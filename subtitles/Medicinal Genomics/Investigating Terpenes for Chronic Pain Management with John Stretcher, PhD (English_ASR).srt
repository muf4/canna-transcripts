00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,560
satisfaction that comes with Crossing

something off of your to-do

33
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,439
list my guest today is Dr John Striker

34
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,159
John is a professor in the department of

35
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:48,919
pharmacology in the College of Medicine

36
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,399
at the University of

37
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,560
Arizona he has built a long-term

38
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:56,439
research program focused on finding

39
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:58,478
improved treatments for pain this has

40
00:01:56,438 --> 00:02:01,199
encompassed multiple approaches over the

41
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:04,718
years including testing cannabinoid and

42
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,000
non-cannabinoid constituents of cannabis

43
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,318
identifying new ways to Target the

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,520
opioid receptor signaling and

45
00:02:09,318 --> 00:02:14,799
identifying new receptor Targets in the

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,920
body for pain relief his lab works on

47
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,519
both the basic science knowledge of how

48
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:22,079
these systems work and also works to

49
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,439
create new drugs for human

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,239
therapy during our conversation we

51
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,079
discussed the basics of tpin what they

52
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:32,560
are and their rolling cannabis the

53
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,200
canomatic effects of tpin and their

54
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,680
synergistic effects with

55
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:40,199
cannabinoids what levels of tpin are

56
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,159
needed to get a therapeutic

57
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,639
effect a recent study showing tpes can

58
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:49,318
relieve chronic neuropathic

59
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:52,279
pain combining tpes with other drugs

60
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:55,919
such as opioids to get better pain

61
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,280
relief at lower Doses and which tpin

62
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,158
provide the best pain

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,640
relief before we get to my conversation

64
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,239

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,079
good afternoon John thanks so much for

85
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,120
joining us on the

86
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,400
podcast thanks Ben really good to be

87
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,680
here appreciate the invite all right

88
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:27,239
well I'm excited to talk with you today

89
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:30,360
about Turin now we've talked about Turin

90
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,560
in a couple other previous episodes how

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,199
they contribute to cannabis Aroma how

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,478
they influence a user's experience even

93
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,639
how they're analyzed but we've yet to

94
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:44,159
really dive into the therapeutic effects

95
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,478
of tpes at least not as like Standalone

96
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,120
compounds which is what I think what

97
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:51,680
makes your recent study and your

98
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,199
abstract so interesting often tpes are

99
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,600
are seen as contributors to the

100
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,160
Entourage effect with other canabo but

101
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,120
your work suggests that they may have

102
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,479
therapeutic effects on their own own

103
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,918
which is really interesting but before

104
00:05:02,478 --> 00:05:06,639
we get too deep into that for those in

105
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,079
the audience who perhaps haven't seen

106
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,879
those previous episodes on tpin could

107
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:13,680
you give us an overview of what they are

108
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,319
and what their role is in

109
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,360
cannabis yeah Ben absolutely so uh tpin

110
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,038
themselves are not unique to cannabis so

111
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,759
these are small molecules that are found

112
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:24,839
in essentially all plants at least all

113
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,720
plants that I know about what makes them

114
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,279
kind of unique for cannabis is there's a

115
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,440
lot of them in cannabis more of them

116
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:33,599
than there are tend to be in plants like

117
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:36,120
hops or or pine or whatever and so what

118
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,120
is a turpine a turpine is a small simple

119
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,560
uh molecule like it's small um very

120
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,160
aromatic very small very Hydro hydr

121
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,839
phobic SL lipophilic so small molecule

122
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,680
and it we've sort of known about these

123
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,679
molecules for many years because as you

124
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,280
just said they add to The Taste and

125
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Aroma of the plant and so you have

126
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:57,439
something like you know even if you

127
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:59,478
don't know what tpin are you kind of

128
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:01,240
still experienced them so you you smell

129
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,199
that fresh lemony smell from a real

130
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,759
lemon not the not the stuff that comes

131
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,720
in a can and you know that's that's Del

132
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,479
lemoning right that's a that's a turpine

133
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,599
you smell that smell coming off of hops

134
00:06:09,478 --> 00:06:13,719
that's Alpha huming uh you know the pine

135
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:15,639
tree smell that's beta pining and so on

136
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,599
so you've all experienced tping even if

137
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:20,759
you haven't run across that term before

138
00:06:18,598 --> 00:06:22,800
and so in terms of what they do in

139
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,319
cannabis yes of course they add to that

140
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,319
unique Aroma and flavor although um

141
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,520
parenthetically they actually are not

142
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,840
what give cannabis that real skunky

143
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:33,879
smell so we've actually isol or we were

144
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:35,598
not the ones that isolated our

145
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:37,719
collaborators isolated that compound

146
00:06:35,598 --> 00:06:39,000
called penal thol working with it

147
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,479
separately it actually has different

148
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,959
activity than either the Turpin or the

149
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,879
cannabinoids but just kind of a side

150
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,359
note there so it's not exactly that

151
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:47,639
skunky smell but some of the other taste

152
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,720
and Aroma elements of the plant are from

153
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:52,680
these turpins and so of course for many

154
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,280
years now people have been looking we

155
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,319
sort of knew that it did this taste and

156
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,918
Aroma but people have suspected that

157
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,160
these have had therapeutic and

158
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,959
pharmacological effects going back some

159
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:05,639
time and so those have been under active

160
00:07:01,959 --> 00:07:07,878
investigation in the literature and um

161
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,280
and then what as also as you suggested

162
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:10,960
that people have suggested that these

163
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:13,000
turpins contribute to the Entourage

164
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:14,959
effect the idea that the turpins might

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,759
somehow combine with the canabo to give

166
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,439
you an effect unique to the plant that

167
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,639
you wouldn't get from either one

168
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:22,319
purified alone and so there were sort of

169
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,000
all these ideas floating around there

170
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,400
had been some studies particularly in

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,279
pain suggesting that tpin could relieve

172
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,758
pain even clinical studies had shown

173
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:32,638
this uh but there were some real

174
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,919
limitations in the literature and the

175
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,800
there still is no solid evidence whether

176
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:39,918
or not the Entourage effect actually

177
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,478
occurs in like a a cannabis extract that

178
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:43,959
you yourself are taking or smoking or

179
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:45,758
whatever and so we kind of surveyed this

180
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:48,680
landscape in about 2020 is when we

181
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,000
started our work in this I said okay you

182
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,639
know there's a lot of suggestions but

183
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,560
not a lot of hard data so let's drill

184
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,079
down and figure out what these molecules

185
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,079
are actually doing rather than just kind

186
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,158
of throwing around ideas and uh so we

187
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:03,878
started by isolating the Turpin and

188
00:08:02,158 --> 00:08:06,000
studying each one individually rather

189
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:07,599
than as you say combined into this kind

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,759
of this mix of this extract so that we

191
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:11,680
could really figure out which each one

192
00:08:08,759 --> 00:08:13,919
does alone before we start you know at

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,879
looking at them in combination and so we

194
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,439
published that initial work in 2021

195
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:20,560
showing that the Turpin have what we

196
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:22,759
call a canaba mtic effect that they they

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,319
behaviorally they look like a canabo

198
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:26,800
although they are not a canabo and their

199
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,439
mechanism is a little bit different than

200
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
a typical canabo but nonetheless it

201
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:32,360
produce some of these same effects in

202
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,918
animals like uh you know sedation the

203
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:36,839
kind of the couch lock or couch high

204
00:08:33,918 --> 00:08:39,079
that you get um catalepsy decrease in

205
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,440
body temperature uh pain relief and so

206
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,080
on so it had these had these effects and

207
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,839
interestingly in terms of the Entourage

208
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,320
effect when we combined the turpine with

209
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,600
a canono a synthetic canabo we got a

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,720
higher impact than either one alone and

211
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,399
that's kind of what got us the most

212
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,839
attention in 2021 was this idea that

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,958
that you could comb that it was have

214
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,200
that the tripping were having this

215
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:00,078
effect and that the effect could be

216
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,839
greater when you combine them with a

217
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,519
canabo and so that's what really got our

218
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:08,959
journey started in in this

219
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,959
area excellent um so how do tpin

220
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,039
interact with the human body um

221
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,759
particularly in relation to

222
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,159
pain yeah so that is still you know

223
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,720
really a big unknown question right not

224
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,278
completely unknown so there have been as

225
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,839
I mentioned clinical studies other

226
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:26,159
studies showing that the tpes relieve

227
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,959
pain so even like say a study where they

228
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:30,600
would give a linol to um laboring women

229
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,599
like women in labor giving birth and it

230
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,800
show that they had this benefit and

231
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,800
there are other studies looking at

232
00:09:33,799 --> 00:09:38,039
chronic pain patients and so on give the

233
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:39,439
tpine you see this benefit but there's

234
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:41,360
still even when you know that there's

235
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,720
still a lot of unknown questions first

236
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,560
of all like we all know that tpin have a

237
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,278
strong smell and we also know that

238
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:49,559
humans have a strong placebo effect uh

239
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,639
when they're exposed to what they think

240
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,199
is a medication like I haven't seen any

241
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:55,039
well-controlled studies that suggest

242
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,000
that the turpine effect is separate from

243
00:09:55,039 --> 00:10:00,399
the placebo effect and mechanism is also

244
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,200
unknown right we don't know how this if

245
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,159
it is relieving pain how it's relieving

246
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,440
pain and that's something we try to

247
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,319
tackle in our own work by first of all

248
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,200
working with mice who do not kind of

249
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,360
have this this expectation that a human

250
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,560
being does they they don't know and

251
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,079
furthermore we were injecting the

252
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,518
turpine so they couldn't get like that

253
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:20,599
Aroma or that smell to sort of confound

254
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,600
the effect and then looking at the mice

255
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,320
and then also figuring out mechanism and

256
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,278
diving in and figuring out exactly what

257
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,680
these are interacting with and at least

258
00:10:26,278 --> 00:10:31,360
in mice we now have data that suggests

259
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,559
that these are stimulating The cannaboid

260
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,720
receptors in your brain so sort of the

261
00:10:33,559 --> 00:10:37,559
the known canabo that are going to be or

262
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,040
Sor known canabo receptors that are

263
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:41,838
going to be stimulated by drugs like THC

264
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,240
and also your endogenous cannaboids that

265
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,200
your own body produces uh and we also

266
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,200
know that they can bind to an activate a

267
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,040
receptor called the adenosine a2a

268
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,720
receptor and again this is one of those

269
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:53,559
targets all of you know about even if

270
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:55,759
you've never heard that word before

271
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:57,439
because that's the same drug or sorry

272
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,319
the same receptor that's targeted by

273
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,200
caffeine so we've all stimulated or

274
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,440
inhibited our Denine a2a receptors

275
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,278
whether you know it or not because we we

276
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,880
do it through caffeine and we found that

277
00:11:06,278 --> 00:11:10,480
the turpine stimulate at least in the

278
00:11:07,879 --> 00:11:13,200
mice this receptor to produce a strong

279
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:15,320
pain relief in a chronic and neuropathic

280
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,839
pain interesting all right a couple

281
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,320
things that you you touched on there

282
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,240
that I thought was interesting um so the

283
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,200
placebo effect I got to think especially

284
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,240
like like you mentioned I mean these are

285
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:31,278
these are aromatic compounds um it would

286
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:33,399
be hard to sort of have a sibo of that

287
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,639
compound without it actually being the

288
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:37,839
real thing right yeah so there's ways to

289
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:39,919
potentially get around that that I've

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,680
been thinking about right so um there's

291
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,838
a lot of different ways to take Tarpin

292
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,439
and indeed cannabis and other extracts

293
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,560
and so if we wanted to take away that

294
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,240
part we might say encapsulated into a

295
00:11:47,559 --> 00:11:51,119
capsule and so I'm working with a

296
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,480
company right now called uh uh black

297
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,519
rock neutraceutical that are developing

298
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,759
an encapsulated as well as a tinctured

299
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,959
form of a beta carry offing that we're

300
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:01,720
going to be testing in in animals and

301
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:03,359
then eventually human beings and that

302
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:05,160
might be one way to get around it does

303
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,200
that change the bioavailability whether

304
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:10,480
or not you're inhaling it versus

305
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,079
ingesting it yeah it very well might but

306
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,399
that touches on another problem in the

307
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,399
turpine field is that there are very few

308
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,759
if really any studies that I can find

309
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:20,480
that actually look at the

310
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,360
bioavailability and the pharmacokinetics

311
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,959
and part of the reason perhaps for that

312
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,320
is that we found it's pretty challenging

313
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:27,159
to do so we started to do these

314
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,680
pharmacokinetic studies we're having

315
00:12:27,159 --> 00:12:31,360
trouble detecting the molecules you

316
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:32,719
mentioned had previously uh discussed

317
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
how to how to sort of measure these

318
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,759
molecules and we use gas chromatography

319
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,799
Mass spectrometry uh but we have a lot

320
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:39,519
of trouble getting it to work

321
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:41,919
consistently maybe we're just idiots and

322
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,600
not doing it right but um that suggests

323
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:46,000
there could be a reason perhaps why

324
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,159
there are so few PK studies on tpin in

325
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,958
the

326
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,319
literature okay and then another thing

327
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,599
you mentioned is that you know that

328
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,519
these tpin they're stimulating some of

329
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:57,600
the same receptors that cannaboids are

330
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,879
now is that at similar levels or are the

331
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,079
cannaboids stimulating more how how does

332
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:04,278
that sort of compare yeah so

333
00:13:02,078 --> 00:13:07,399
pound-for-pound at equivalent levels of

334
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:09,078
potency the turpins are stimulating less

335
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:11,198
so they are what we would call a partial

336
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:13,198
Agonist so whereas something actually

337
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:14,519
THD is technically a partial Agonist too

338
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:18,240
but whereas something like

339
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:21,198
anandamide diog glycerol or sorry not

340
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:23,360
not diog glycerol 2ag um those are going

341
00:13:21,198 --> 00:13:24,479
to be full agonists uh and then I'm

342
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,039
trying to think if there's a synthetic

343
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,000
cannabinoid that that everyone would be

344
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:29,000
familiar with that might be a full

345
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,320
Agonist well THC is the closest to it

346
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,120
right right so those are going to

347
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:35,160
stimulate let's say 100% And what we're

348
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:38,639
getting with the tpin is more like 50 to

349
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:40,159
60% got it so you would need higher

350
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
concentrations of the chines to get a

351
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:44,278
similar effect yeah and that's what we

352
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,720
found so we actually have to use fairly

353
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:49,360
high concentrations both in animal

354
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,879
models when we inject as well as in uh

355
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,639
cell culture models when we're actually

356
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,278
looking at how the receptor itself is

357
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,120
stimulated by these drugs and and so

358
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:58,799
that leads into another issue right when

359
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,639
you're evaluating the Entourage effect

360
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:02,319
and we gotten this criticism in our work

361
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:04,919
they like okay you had to give a high

362
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,480
amount of tpin to the animals or to the

363
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:10,559
cells in order to see these effects in

364
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,800
an actual extract from real cannabis the

365
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:14,119
levels of tpine are fairly low right so

366
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:15,439
they're not at this this high level

367
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,799
where you're going to get get you get a

368
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,160
high dose and and then like so how can

369
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:22,240
we have this Entourage effect well that

370
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:25,559
even if that's true to me it's actually

371
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,959
not that important because we can design

372
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:29,758
these drugs or extracts whatever we can

373
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:32,599
design them however we want we can put

374
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,159
in higher levels T of Turpin to sort of

375
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,759
harness this Entourage like effect or

376
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:38,719
whatever you want to call it in order to

377
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,079
help people treat their pain better or

378
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,759
or whatever they need it

379
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:44,919
for now is the criticism more that you

380
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,879
know evidence for the Entourage effect

381
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:49,439
in cannabis itself that the turpins are

382
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:52,159
at such a low level we can't really um

383
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,560
attribute an effect to them in kind of a

384
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,639
natural product yeah that's the

385
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:58,119
criticism of my work specifically that

386
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,240
I've run into and again we kind of

387
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,078
answer by saying well it doesn't really

388
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,079
matter we're looking at what these

389
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:03,198
molecules do on their own

390
00:15:01,078 --> 00:15:06,078
therapeutically we can design whatever

391
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:07,679
we want in order to help someone um but

392
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:09,239
uh so that's the criticism of my work

393
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:11,638
but then more broadly there's just a

394
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,278
lack of no not a total lack but a

395
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:17,680
general lack of Investigation into this

396
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:19,958
uh you know phenomena in the scientific

397
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:21,239
literature so you know you can go online

398
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:23,319
and find lots of people who will tell

399
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,919
you the entage effect is real you know

400
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,278
you um you get the I don't want to name

401
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:27,838
it in games but like you get you know

402
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,039
you put this tpine in your extract

403
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,440
you're going to get these effects

404
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,278
there's really not a lot or perhaps any

405
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,920
evidence for that and so that's Again

406
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:36,480
part of our motivation for doing this

407
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,120
work is to sort of fill in those gaps

408
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,519
put some scientific backing behind the

409
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,600
claims that are being made in the public

410
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:45,560
excellent okay so you mentioned that you

411
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,240
were doing some um some studies in mice

412
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:50,078
or rats or so mice talk a little bit

413
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,278
more about that and kind of what's the

414
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:54,919
next stage beyond what you've done so

415
00:15:52,278 --> 00:15:56,159
far yeah absolutely so I I briefly

416
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:58,240
described our sort of our initial

417
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,799
research published in 2021 showing that

418
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,519
the Turin sort of cannaboid like and so

419
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,559
we were indeed we were giving those to

420
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:05,919
mice we have this battery of Behavioral

421
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:07,479
tests we give mice because you can't

422
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:10,799
just ask a mouse hey how high are you

423
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:12,278
right now like you feeling it bro um so

424
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:14,278
we have these behavioral tests that we

425
00:16:12,278 --> 00:16:16,519
run in the mice that that cannabinoids

426
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:18,159
produce sort of these typical behaviors

427
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,278
and so we found that they're cannaboid

428
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:23,480
like Etc um however sort of more perhaps

429
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:26,240
more impactfully recently just a a month

430
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,959
or two ago we continued this work

431
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,879
publishing another paper showing the

432
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:33,559
impact of the tping on chronic pain and

433
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:35,240
so not not canono like not a sort of a

434
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,958
tail flick pain which is the the

435
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,879
analgesic assay that we run that's more

436
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,359
like hand on a hot stove pain so this is

437
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,318
trying to get it real patients who are

438
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:44,360
suffering and in particular we used a

439
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,879
model called chemotherapy induced

440
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,120
peripheral neuropathy so people that

441
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,240
have cancer they go on these

442
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,679
chemotherapy drugs like pxel um those

443
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,360
help the cancer right that's great but

444
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,799
many of those patients even a majority

445
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,519
of those patients get some kind of

446
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:59,599
chronic neuropathic pain sort of this

447
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,679
burn

448
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,959
numb electric shooting style pain

449
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,959
usually in the hands and the feet and

450
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,759
for some of those patients it never goes

451
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,798
away even after they sto taking their

452
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:12,439
their uh pet Axel or whatever their

453
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:14,439
chemotherapy drug is even after the ca

454
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:16,240
the Cancer's gone and that pain is

455
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:19,038
really difficult to treat it's not well

456
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,000
treated by opioids or other drugs and so

457
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,759
we wanted to again test a model that's

458
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,199
going to be relevant to to real people

459
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:26,838
and their concerns tested the Turpin in

460
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:29,000
that model and we found that they were

461
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,440
highly effective in relieving this typ

462
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,640
of neuropathic chronic pain we got

463
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,038
strong pain relief and since then this

464
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,640
work hasn't been published yet but we

465
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,079
also looked in other pain models too

466
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:43,120
like a postsurgical pain Model A

467
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:45,558
fibromyalgia like pain model and then uh

468
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,639
oh inflammatory pain so like you know

469
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:49,200
strong inflammation that was the one I'm

470
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,679
wasn't thinking of and so you know four

471
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,240
different chronic pain models all of

472
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,519
them relevant turpins produce strong

473
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:56,000
pain relief in all of them and and then

474
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:58,079
we have further dug into mechanism

475
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,640
that's published anyone can read this if

476
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:03,079
they want um but you know that's in mice

477
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,679
as you mentioned right so this is

478
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:06,918
exciting but this is in mice so where do

479
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:10,159
we take it next scientifically we want

480
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,360
to further explore turning these into

481
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:14,360
actual drugs and that's going to go

482
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:15,959
through several paths One path is going

483
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,479
to be scientific figuring out what is

484
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:19,279
their mechanism like exactly what

485
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,640
they're doing I mentioned the adenine

486
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:22,079
a2a receptor like how are they

487
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,799
stimulating that what does that look

488
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,759
like in your spinal cord what are the

489
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:29,720
the the neuronal circuits that are being

490
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,000
activated to relieve pain all of that um

491
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:33,839
and then we're also going to do more

492
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,759
therapeutic based um investigation

493
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:38,599
because it's not enough that a drug

494
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:40,558
relieves pain to be a good drug it also

495
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,798
has to have tolerable or preferably

496
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:44,119
lower no side effects right so if you

497
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,400
have a drug that relieves your pain but

498
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:47,479
makes you absolutely miserable that

499
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,919
doesn't do anyone any good and so we've

500
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,759
did some of this side effect testing

501
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,240
looking at tolerance and addiction

502
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,599
liability and they have no addiction

503
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,079
liability in our hands in fact we have

504
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:57,759
some unpublished research suggesting

505
00:18:56,079 --> 00:18:59,359
that tpin can block the addiction

506
00:18:57,759 --> 00:19:00,640
liability of opioid

507
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,240
and so that's an exciting future

508
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
direction that we're pursuing but we

509
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,519
need to look at other side effects you

510
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,960
know make sure this isn't making the

511
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:09,519
animals and thus you feel miserable um

512
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:11,120
you know making sure it's not toxic and

513
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,359
so on there's no reason to think it is

514
00:19:11,119 --> 00:19:15,599
but all of that has to be tested and

515
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,399
then on the third sort of pathway is to

516
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,119
bring this to the clinic to to real

517
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:21,120
patients and so here at the University

518
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:24,439
of Arizona we have very active clinical

519
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,599
research programs uh and I can work with

520
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:29,480
Physicians here that do that type of

521
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:31,599
research to get these tpin into patient

522
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,839
and as far as tpin go we have a big

523
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,119
advantage in doing that because it's a

524
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,918
natural product so this isn't some new

525
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:39,918
drug that we whipped up in the lab that

526
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,799
we invented that has to go through all

527
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,240
this extensive safety toxicity testing

528
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:46,720
before it can be approved by the Food

529
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,200
and Drug Administration the tpin are

530
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,558
already on the FDA list of what's called

531
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,600
generally regarded as safe Gras and thus

532
00:19:53,558 --> 00:19:57,240
we can take these right into the clinic

533
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:58,839
and give them to people without I mean

534
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,640
it still has to be approved by the

535
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,319
institution and so on but we can take

536
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,840
them right into people without having to

537
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,480
have that approval from the FDA and

538
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,158
that's going to shorten that timeline by

539
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,640
a lot and as I mentioned there have

540
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:10,720
already been some clinical studies with

541
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,480
tpin and so we'll be looking at their

542
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,679
impact in chronic pain and as part of

543
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:17,200
that we also want to make sure that they

544
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,759
can be delivered well so we've already

545
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,080
brought up the issue of pharmacokinetics

546
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,640
and bioavailability we're working to

547
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,158
also tweak the formulation to make sure

548
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,360
that it's going to be stable that it's

549
00:20:25,159 --> 00:20:28,240
going to get into the brain and the

550
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:31,158
spinal cord and do what it needs to do

551
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,440
without being broken down mhm and so now

552
00:20:31,159 --> 00:20:36,000
what what are you thinking is would be

553
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:39,558
the um the method of ingestion would it

554
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,480
be oral or inhaled or yeah so we're

555
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:43,240
exploring all options right now really

556
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,400
so as I mentioned we did this injected

557
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:48,480
but we also have tested oral Gage or

558
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:51,080
just oral oral delivery as well as

559
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,240
inhaled um version as well with all with

560
00:20:51,079 --> 00:20:55,079
the mice and interestingly we found that

561
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,120
the oral in the inhaled had less

562
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:59,158
bioavailability like even at a high dose

563
00:20:57,119 --> 00:21:01,359
it wasn't producing very much of an

564
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:02,880
effect just a small effect and so part

565
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:05,079
of our work needs to be to figure out if

566
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,039
this is also a limitation in humans and

567
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,759
if it is a limitation in humans ways to

568
00:21:07,038 --> 00:21:10,319
get around that so I mentioned we're

569
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:12,839
working with companies one of them black

570
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:15,798
being black rock there's others to come

571
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:18,000
up with well formulated tpine drugs that

572
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:19,960
and you know therapies that will

573
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,079
hopefully avoid any of these issues and

574
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:25,798
and help people get the relief they need

575
00:21:23,079 --> 00:21:26,918
excellent and now I I jot it down the

576
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:28,079
question but I feel like you kind of

577
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:31,159
answered it when you were kind of

578
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,599
explaining how um one of the benefits

579
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:34,559
with using tpin is that they're

580
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:36,000
generally regarded as safe and you don't

581
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,879
have to kind of go through that new drug

582
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,960
development so is the goal really to

583
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,919
kind of come up with a therapeutic that

584
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:45,798
is just tpin and not sort of in

585
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:48,080
combination with

586
00:21:45,798 --> 00:21:49,918
cannabinoids so I think again there's

587
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:51,678
there's room to have a lot of different

588
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,880
things so I think there is definitely a

589
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,480
space for a pure turpine um our our work

590
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,159
suggests that should be beneficial

591
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,599
particularly geranial and little are the

592
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:03,000
ones in our hands that have the lowest

593
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:04,918
side effects and the highest pain relief

594
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,798
you know capacity and thus you could

595
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,159
make like an extract or a formulated

596
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:11,720
capsule or you know a tincture that you

597
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:13,640
could do under your tongue or perhaps a

598
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,839
vaporization cartridge like all these

599
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,320
options are out there right um but our

600
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,439
work suggests that these drugs can be

601
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,558
more effective when combined with others

602
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:25,159
so part of that that paper we recently

603
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:27,519
published we did a low dose of tarpine

604
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:29,799
with a low dose of opioid and we got

605
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:31,599
higher pain relief than either one alone

606
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,079
so the turpine was making the opioid or

607
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:35,079
perhaps the opioid making the turpine

608
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:37,240
who knows more effective in relieving

609
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:39,038
that pain but when you can give a lower

610
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,159
dose of each you're decreasing the side

611
00:22:39,038 --> 00:22:43,200
effects and so you know decreased

612
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,320
potential of that opioid giving you

613
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,000
constipation tolerance um somnolence

614
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:50,240
where you can't you know get to sleep

615
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,440
nausea and of course addiction right

616
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,200
that's the one that everyone's most

617
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,038
concerned about and indeed as I

618
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,600
mentioned we have data now unpublished

619
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:58,519
but still data we're actively working on

620
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:01,199
the lab suggesting that shpping at least

621
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:03,278
beta caropine will block that rewarding

622
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,759
property of opioid so I'm envisioning

623
00:23:03,278 --> 00:23:07,558
like a combination therapy where you

624
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:09,119
take say beta caropine with an opioid of

625
00:23:07,558 --> 00:23:11,119
some kind you're going to get better

626
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,879
pain relief make it hopefully make it

627
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,000
non-addictive and perhaps decrease some

628
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,559
of the other side effects too um and

629
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,278
cannabinoid so that 2021 paper we

630
00:23:18,558 --> 00:23:23,000
combined the opioid or sorry the tpine

631
00:23:21,278 --> 00:23:24,759
with a cannabinoid Turpin with the

632
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,400
canabo and saw that increased pain

633
00:23:24,759 --> 00:23:29,640
relief so I think there's a place for

634
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,919
that too um we are our combination

635
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,120
studies are sort of still in their

636
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:35,038
infancy we're mostly focused on the pure

637
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,119
tpping but that's an area of big

638
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,440
development that we're going to be

639
00:23:36,119 --> 00:23:40,558
pursuing in the in the years to come

640
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,000
well that's exciting now and and you

641
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:44,158
mentioned that you know tpin they've

642
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,519
been around for a long time um I know

643
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:48,840
that you know the essential oils that

644
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:51,200
you purchase I mean those yeah those are

645
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:53,798
tpin um so why do you think that you

646
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,360
know they haven't been studied as a

647
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:59,278
therapeutic uh really to this

648
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,558
point well they have somewhat and there

649
00:23:59,278 --> 00:24:02,679
are a lot of papers out there I don't

650
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,759
want to short anyone right or kind of be

651
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,798
insulting there are a lot of papers out

652
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:09,319
there um but they were still limited

653
00:24:07,798 --> 00:24:11,278
right so it's like we're going to take a

654
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,639
A turpine or turpine extract we're going

655
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,519
to give a certain amount to patients and

656
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,159
then we see the pain relief but it for

657
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:18,319
whatever reason I don't fully understand

658
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,200
why those next steps weren't taken like

659
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:22,000
what are the side effects what's the

660
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,400
what's the pharmacokinetics you know

661
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
what's the minimal dose that we need to

662
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,399
be effective um you know and really like

663
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,720
formalize and systematize this

664
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:32,199
investigation so you could really turn

665
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,399
it into something um I'm just

666
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,840
spitballing here I don't have any

667
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:36,558
evidence for that but like one of the

668
00:24:34,839 --> 00:24:38,879
reasons could be because it's generally

669
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:40,440
regarded as safe maybe you can't get a

670
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,520
drug company interested in making a

671
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,720
product because you know you can't they

672
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:45,918
can't patent it um and that's where I've

673
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,240
been work all the companies that I've

674
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,919
been working with in this space are all

675
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:51,519
smaller companies right that that care

676
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:53,520
about cannabis that care about tpin

677
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:54,480
they're not looking to be fiser maybe

678
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,158
that's why they're the ones that are

679
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,759
willing to tackle it and maybe that's

680
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,520
why they haven't been tackled in the

681
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,839
past with some of larger the larger you

682
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:04,440
know groups and it could also be the

683
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:06,599
possibility that funding has been harder

684
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,200
to come by I don't really know so we

685
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:09,719
were able to get funding from this work

686
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:12,080
from a portion of the National

687
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,159
Institutes of Health the nah uh called

688
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:15,798
the national Center for complimentary

689
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,559
and Integrative Health the

690
00:25:15,798 --> 00:25:20,879
ncci so kind of a sub subpart of the

691
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:22,119
Niah and they had this program where

692
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,440
they were specifically interested in

693
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:26,678
looking at Turpin and minor cannaboids

694
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,759
and so I will say just in general the

695
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:31,960
Cannabis field cannabinoid field has

696
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:34,119
grown a lot recently you know the last

697
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,558
10 10 or so years all of that has grown

698
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:37,199
funding's become more available people

699
00:25:35,558 --> 00:25:38,960
are becoming more interested and then

700
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,480
some of these minor components or or

701
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,798
understudied components of the cannabis

702
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,319
plant like tur beans and the minor

703
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:45,000
cannabinoids those have also been

704
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:47,879
growing very strongly as well with that

705
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:51,319
interest so maybe the time is just here

706
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:53,080
yeah well that's exciting and now so as

707
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,000
we mentioned too Turpin they're not

708
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:56,319
exclusive to cannabis they are in other

709
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,599
plants and you know there are other

710
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:01,798
sources for it I know they can be

711
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:03,319
synthetically derived too so um in the

712
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:05,240
the tpin that you're working with or

713
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:07,200
even in the vision of you know what you

714
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,679
think the Therapeutics will eventually

715
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,038
be will they be derived from Cannabis or

716
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,840
some other

717
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:17,359
way yeah um I mean we have some reason

718
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:19,038
to believe that the the the chemical

719
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,479
diversity of turpins that you get from

720
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,038
Cannabis seems to be better than from

721
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,240
other plants right so other plants will

722
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,798
have like a couple of tpping that are

723
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,159
sort of dominant cannabis tends to have

724
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:32,079
a lot like we've uh you know at least 10

725
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:33,640
or 15 um me measurable turpins in the

726
00:26:32,079 --> 00:26:36,158
extracts that we're looking at and

727
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,759
working with um but I think a lot of

728
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,840
that might come down to the economics

729
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:41,798
and the legal landscape which I'm

730
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:44,278
interested in but not you know fully an

731
00:26:41,798 --> 00:26:45,759
expert in and so obviously there are

732
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:47,359
companies out there that are you know

733
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,599
can work with hemp say you know that

734
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,678
falls under the 3% level for the farm

735
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,278
bill and can get these components um but

736
00:26:52,679 --> 00:26:56,360
economically maybe it would be make more

737
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:59,000
sense to take it from hops or synthetics

738
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:00,918
I don't actually know um but I will add

739
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,839
to that that we mostly work with

740
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:05,320
purified turpins but we have done some

741
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:07,599
tpine blend work where we take these

742
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,960
extracts that are purified from Cannabis

743
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:12,558
different cultivars of of cannabis and

744
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,038
those mixes are also highly effective in

745
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,759
relieving pain uh that work is not yet

746
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,038
published but we're working on that and

747
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:20,359
so you know maybe there's a specific

748
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:23,480
justification to to take the tpine as a

749
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:25,439
blend as an extract from Cannabis um and

750
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,240
then lastly just economically speaking I

751
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,960
think it's generally easier to to grow

752
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,599
bunch of plants and extract from Plants

753
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:32,880
then to say synthesize all of this in

754
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,199
the

755
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,399
lab even at the concentrations that

756
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,000
you're looking to

757
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:41,959
use well it's easy to to process like

758
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,880
you know 100 kilograms 200 kilograms ton

759
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,120
two tons of plant material versus uh you

760
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,919
know that's relative I don't want to

761
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:49,479
underplay it like that's relatively easy

762
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:51,320
to process large amounts of plant

763
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,240
material versus having to you know get

764
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:54,759
in the lab and synthesize it and figure

765
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,759
out the synthetic process and you have

766
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,398
these giant you know bioreactors and

767
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:03,440
everything else and extraction is is

768
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,038
simpler generally great um so now

769
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,640
thinking maybe a little bit more

770
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:08,359
practically or maybe for folks who are

771
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,360
out there who are trying to M use

772
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:13,599
cannabis or trines to manage their pain

773
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:17,000
um are there

774
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:18,558
certain uh tpin or combinations thereof

775
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,480
that they could potentially be looking

776
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:22,440
for in products that might be more

777
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,839
beneficial based on the work that uh

778
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,558
that you've done yeah I mean I don't

779
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,398
want to over overstate things um all of

780
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:31,798
the workers in mice you know we're still

781
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,038
still got a long ways to go and I'm not

782
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:35,599
a physician so I want everyone to keep

783
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:36,839
that in mind when you're kind of

784
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,798
evaluating this and potentially

785
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:40,558
considering trying it for yourself but

786
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:42,720
on the other hand as I mentioned these

787
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:44,519
all of these tpin are out there like you

788
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,960
can get them um they're generally

789
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,159
regarded as safe so it's it's very

790
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,600
unlikely to hurt you to play around with

791
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,640
some of these products or available and

792
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:54,240
see if it helps for you and you know in

793
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,640
particular some of the patients that

794
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,919
that we've worked with through my

795
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,399
collaborators my commercial

796
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:59,840
collaborators say they get great pain

797
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,479
relief that that nothing else has worked

798
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:03,839
for so I don't think there's anything

799
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:05,919
wrong with trying it out and so things

800
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:08,079
to look for so first of all there's a

801
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,278
lot of companies that say a lot of stuff

802
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:11,000
because this is sort of in the natural

803
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:13,079
product supplement space really is how

804
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,599
most of this gets produced and marketed

805
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:18,278
and so that uh that means that there's

806
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:21,319
not a lot of um you know like U

807
00:29:18,278 --> 00:29:22,839
regulation and you know work that the

808
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:24,558
company has to do to prove that their

809
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:25,678
products have what they say they have in

810
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,519
them a lot of times they don't really

811
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,919
have to do that and but there are

812
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,399
companies that interested in being

813
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:33,200
reliable and and doing that work so try

814
00:29:31,398 --> 00:29:34,719
to find those companies right if you ask

815
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,319
them how do you evaluate your turpine

816
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,600
levels in your comp in your products

817
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,720
like well we send it to this lab and

818
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,599
they do Mass Spec that's a good answer

819
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,240
right and so if you find someone that

820
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,879
that validates their work to produce a

821
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:46,558
high high quality product that's the

822
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,320
first thing I'd look for and then in

823
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,879
terms of individual uh tpin uh beta

824
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:53,439
caropine seems to be very common in our

825
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:56,039
hands it's certainly good at relieving

826
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,440
pain um that's the tping we found that

827
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:59,558
blocks the opioid reward now I don't

828
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,200
recommend any one start taking opioids

829
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:03,599
on my say so um but you know that's the

830
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,399
one that we suggest could block the

831
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:08,240
opioid reward and then Jan alino in our

832
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:09,678
hands are also some of the best single

833
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,000
single product tpin in terms of

834
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,440
relieving pain with low side effects um

835
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,038
but there's a ton of them there's

836
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,919
there's literally hundreds of Turpin and

837
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:19,200
there are other you know at least dozens

838
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:21,080
that are sort of available um

839
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,080
commercially you might see like names

840
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:26,319
like eugenol or bizal all all these

841
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:28,199
products I I don't I can't evaluate them

842
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:29,879
all so ultimately at the end of the day

843
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,278
try to find a good product try it see if

844
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:35,039
it works for you and if it does you know

845
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:36,679
nothing wrong with that yeah no and as

846
00:30:35,038 --> 00:30:39,038
you mentioned there are a lot of tpin a

847
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:41,440
lot of Turin in cannabis and a lot to be

848
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:43,599
investigated so uh a lot of work yet to

849
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,798
be done I'm sure

850
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,918
absolutely all right um John Before I

851
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,519
Let You Go I want to give you the

852
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:52,880
opportunity if there's other resources

853
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,679
um that you think the audience might uh

854
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,679
find useful um if they want to learn

855
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:58,840
more about this topic or even you know

856
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:00,880
if there's links or papers that you've

857
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,319
published um definitely you can mention

858
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,639
them here send me a link I'll put them

859
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,319
in the show description as well so

860
00:31:03,638 --> 00:31:08,240
people can learn more yeah absolutely so

861
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:09,879
we do have some published work on this

862
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,000
um I I metion I've kind of been

863
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,240
describing some of it as I go along uh

864
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,278
we also have some published work on the

865
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,679
minor canabo which is kind of another

866
00:31:15,278 --> 00:31:20,000
interesting area so you like canaban and

867
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,880
canaberal and some of these other other

868
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,398
chemicals so we can publish links to all

869
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,600
that people can read at their Leisure um

870
00:31:24,398 --> 00:31:28,839
as far as larger resources there are not

871
00:31:26,599 --> 00:31:32,319
yet a lot of those resources available

872
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:35,079
but we're trying to build them and so uh

873
00:31:32,319 --> 00:31:37,839
a big uh announcement went out at the

874
00:31:35,079 --> 00:31:39,839
NIH looking for people to establish a

875
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,240
national cannabis Center that would sort

876
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:44,278
of provide information to the public and

877
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,200
be sort of a central Clearing House for

878
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:48,278
data and knowledge about cannabis how to

879
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,558
research it how to you know give it to

880
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,558
prescribe it to patients and so on that

881
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:54,240
Center is not yet in existence but we

882
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:55,879
got a very good score in our application

883
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,000
to do that and there's a very good

884
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:00,320
chance that you're going to be hearing

885
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
about this Center in the next year or so

886
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:04,398
so keep your ear open for that and then

887
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,759
in the meantime we have a a

888
00:32:04,398 --> 00:32:07,879
comprehensive Center for pain and

889
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,119
addiction at the University of Arizona

890
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:12,880
that also provides a lot of resources

891
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:15,278
and links to scientists and clinicians

892
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,080
and Physicians and public health

893
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,960
professionals and so on all that work in

894
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:22,000
pain addiction opioids and canono and we

895
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:24,639
can have all of that available to um for

896
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,798
