2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,199
them of like what is genetic engineering

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:19,160
what is gene editing and sort of um you

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,840
know clarify th those sure sure yeah so

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:25,759
so genetic engineering um is is I guess

6
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:28,518
is kind of defined as moving a gene from

7
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,599
one species to another so for instance

8
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:34,000
if I maybe if I give an example

9
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:39,280
so back in the mid to late '

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,679
80s uh the papaya plant was basically

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,960
being decimated by a virus called

12
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:48,079
ringspot right so the all the Hawaiian

13
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:52,000
plantations were were being devastated

14
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,079
at the time and they couldn't breed in a

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,399
a good resistant or bring in a good

16
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,198
resistant line so the University of

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,879
Hawaii and uh Cornell I believe

18
00:00:59,198 --> 00:01:06,280
identified a Gene um not from papaya but

19
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:09,920
a a gene that would be resistant to the

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,359
papaya ringspot virus so they put that

21
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,280
Gene and this was actually with a gene

22
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:19,438
gun um they put that Gene into Pap into

23
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:21,680
a papaya plant um and and found out that

24
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:25,319
yes indeed that plant was resistant

25
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,479
fully resistant to uh the ringspot virus

26
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:31,039
so that since that Gene didn't come from

27
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:34,039
papaya that's an example of a GM or a a

28
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,360
genetically modified organism right so

29
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,159
now you know I don't know if you you

30
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:40,159
knew or people most people don't know

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,359
that you know most of the papaya plants

32
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:46,040
that we've been eating since uh the late

33
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:47,640
80s are GMOs um but it's it's it's you

34
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,000
know that one particular Gene that gives

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,718
it resistance to that papaya disease

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,478
excellent another example maybe you know

37
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,879
is is a purple tomato that came out

38
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:59,519
recently last year uh they came out with

39
00:01:56,879 --> 00:02:02,478
a purple tomato that was another uh

40
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:04,078
genetic Ally modified tomato that was

41
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,519
made through agrobacterium

42
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,478
transformation but it just put basically

43
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:13,159
in genes that uh were anth thein genes

44
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,959
and so they're making purple

45
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:19,199
tomatoes excellent and and on the on the

46
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,598
flip side Gene editing is is a little

47
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:24,000
different because now you're basically

48
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:26,238
just removing a little bit of sequence

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,759
or or adding sequence that's already

50
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,319
there into the existing cannabis plant

51
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,000
from its own genome so you're not

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,199
bringing in an external Gene you're just

53
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,800
either you know cutting it and deleting

54
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,679
a few bases or bringing in a gene that's

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:43,800
uh that's in cannabis already to give it

56
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,080
a different different trait okay so

57
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,560
that's the main distinction then

58
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:52,400
engineering introducing genes from a

59
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:54,759
different plant editing is um just

60
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,120
editing the existing genome in that

61
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,318
plant yeah and I guess a way to look at

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:03,120
it is the way that that um I guess the

63
00:02:59,318 --> 00:03:06,839
FDA USDA look at it is is um if if the

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,840
plant can be made by normal breeding um

65
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,640
because through normal breeding you know

66
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,840
when you take two plants two cannabis

67
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:14,878
plants together and breed them there's

68
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:17,120
going to be a lot of shuffling of

69
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:19,759
different genes and amongst you know

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,200
amongst their genomes so if it's if it's

71
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:24,280
something you can make through normal

72
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,399
breeding which editing is because you're

73
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:29,280
just um you know taking out or adding a

74
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,080
few bases of its own genome then they

75
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:35,080
consider that editing

76
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,080
and yeah

77
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:48,949
