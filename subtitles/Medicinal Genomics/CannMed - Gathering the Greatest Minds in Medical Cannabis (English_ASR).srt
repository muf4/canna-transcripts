1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,440
this is a drug that was in common use

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,930
hundreds of years ago it was one of the

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,210
most prescribed drugs in 1900 it was in

4
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,039
the pharmacopoeia for for physicians so

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,929
it's already been approved who studied

6
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:15,750
the fact that we now have to reprove it

7
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,800
through the FDA which if you put aspirin

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,559
to the FDA today we wouldn't get through

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,560
is as is circular thinking

10
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:27,049
I'm Kevin mckernon I'm the CSO of

11
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,640
Corrigan life sciences and medicinal

12
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,560
genomics these are two companies that

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,359
are joined at the hip we look at

14
00:00:30,559 --> 00:00:34,789
personalized medicine and patients so we

15
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:36,829
sequence patients their genomes to sort

16
00:00:34,789 --> 00:00:38,539
out what types of defects they may have

17
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,698
or mutations in their genome that can be

18
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:43,219
properly treated and the same time we're

19
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,329
also focusing on medical cannabis safety

20
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:46,219
and so we look at the genetics of the

21
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:50,439
plants to try and help help bring some

22
00:00:46,219 --> 00:00:50,439
more trust and security in that field

23
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:11,060
we are honored and extremely grateful to

24
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:13,340
have as our keynote speaker and our

25
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:22,640
scientific anchor and visionary for this

26
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:24,590
conference dr. rafael Mutulu I was

27
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,900
surprised very surprised to find out

28
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:29,500
that while we knew quite a lot about

29
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:33,109
morphine which had been isolated from

30
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:35,329
Optima many many decades previously in

31
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:39,829
the same is true for cocaine

32
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:42,920
the chemistry of cannabis was not well

33
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:45,219
known there was absolutely no interest

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,469
whatsoever nowadays it seems that

35
00:01:45,219 --> 00:01:51,769
actually interest is going on more and

36
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:54,469
cannabidiol because of its therapeutic

37
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:56,359
activities and not being a top Singh and

38
00:01:54,469 --> 00:02:00,349
not being psychoactive it can be

39
00:01:56,359 --> 00:02:02,359
administered to patients at huge amounts

40
00:02:00,349 --> 00:02:05,509
without any side effects the

41
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:07,939
endocannabinoid system is an extremely

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,980
important one and as a matter of fact

43
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:12,259
people from nih mentioned that it's

44
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:15,079
involved in essentially all human

45
00:02:12,259 --> 00:02:17,659
diseases very very strong statement our

46
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:20,420
group showed to AG works against brain

47
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:23,419
damage so we have seen three or four of

48
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:26,569
these compounds working against brain

49
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:31,669
damage others have found that CBD does

50
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:34,299
that in mice but we have seen no work in

51
00:02:31,669 --> 00:02:34,299
humans

52
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,810
with science gets politicized rational

53
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:47,090
discourse disappears and a feeling that

54
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:48,439
really has happened in this field we're

55
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:52,370
not addressing this in a rational

56
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:53,689
thoughtful way and but we can hundreds

57
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:55,670
of thousands of patients are already

58
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:58,459
using cannabis to treat symptoms but

59
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:01,309
it's really important to study it in a

60
00:02:58,459 --> 00:03:02,959
controlled setting because we need to

61
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,909
understand what the potential risks are

62
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,920
of cannabis use in specific patient

63
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:08,299
populations and we need to understand

64
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:10,548
how the drug interacts with other drugs

65
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:11,810
the patient might we have tilray is one

66
00:03:10,549 --> 00:03:14,689
of the only companies in the world

67
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:17,390
capable of producing GMP grade cannabis

68
00:03:14,689 --> 00:03:19,609
and cannabis derived medications this is

69
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:21,708
possible because tiller is located in

70
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:23,870
Canada where federal regulations allow

71
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:26,120
the production of cannabis and also

72
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:27,609
cannabis extracts that can be used in

73
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,829
clinical research around the world

74
00:03:27,609 --> 00:03:32,180
that's what we want to do is produce

75
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,719
scientifically sound methodologically

76
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:37,700
sound research that will hopefully

77
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,318
change policy and also provide

78
00:03:37,699 --> 00:03:41,629
mainstream physicians with the tools

79
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,548
they need in order to treat patients

80
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,549
with cannabis derived extracts

81
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:59,159
my daily living was my hands shaking so

82
00:03:57,449 --> 00:04:02,429
severe I couldn't stop it

83
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,030
I had suicidal thoughts constantly rage

84
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:08,340
to no end the only reason I'm here today

85
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,300
being able to do this is because of

86
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:13,860
canvas there is thank you

87
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:16,710
year ago today I stopped taking all

88
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:21,150
those pills and strictly using cannabis

89
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:24,239
I have not had a moment of thought to

90
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:27,269
suicide or the depression that I was

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,350
constantly under if an individual

92
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,819
decides to do what you're doing he's

93
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,920
being helped that's fine

94
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:38,670
but the physician or the physicians will

95
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:41,310
not do that I'm personally trying to vie

96
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,560
for clinical trials in football players

97
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,990
and that we have this brain disease that

98
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,360
leads to Alzheimer's and dementia and

99
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,810
all these horrific things we wanted to

100
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:56,730
find out whether the cannabinoid system

101
00:04:50,810 --> 00:05:01,290
effect the damage then by concussion we

102
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:04,370
found that we could reduce by 50% the

103
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:08,310
damage that was done so here we have

104
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:11,459
strong data showing that a cannabis type

105
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,829
compound helps at the moment these

106
00:05:11,459 --> 00:05:16,199
compounds have never never been given to

107
00:05:13,829 --> 00:05:19,379
a human right not only for concussion

108
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:21,529
for anything this rage thing that comes

109
00:05:19,379 --> 00:05:24,540
along with this brain disease is very

110
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:25,769
scary and when I found certain strains

111
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:27,720
of cannabis and have those feelings

112
00:05:25,769 --> 00:05:31,680
anymore and being in Tennessee where I

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,570
was that it was difficult to get strains

114
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,189
it's like hey what do you got this week

115
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,079
we've been trying to put an end to that

116
00:05:35,189 --> 00:05:38,850
by sequencing all the strains and making

117
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:40,709
a huge catalogue of every strain so you

118
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:42,060
can actually gently fingerprinted no all

119
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:43,649
right did it change on me if I'm just

120
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:46,620
curious your experience on that see when

121
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:48,750
I got to California I knew okay go get

122
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,889
my card let me go down and start trying

123
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,779
these strengths because I knew there was

124
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:53,800
something with it we're still really

125
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:55,989
early days tying genotypes

126
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,939
to patients but we're slowly building

127
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,189
this database of variants that we know

128
00:05:57,939 --> 00:06:01,870
predict some level responsible CVD

129
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,759
eventually it's gonna go there do you

130
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:05,860
think you've been on using THC or CBD

131
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,069
long enough to get a sense of long-term

132
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:11,379
effects on for cannabis oh yeah and I

133
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:13,180
don't take Wow leave aspirin or vicodin

134
00:06:11,379 --> 00:06:15,099
or anything anymore and people say

135
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:18,870
marijuana is a gateway drug I said you

136
00:06:15,098 --> 00:06:21,610
know what a gateway drug is football

137
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:23,788
yeah the most exciting research we've

138
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:26,860
seen in addiction medicine is in CBD

139
00:06:23,788 --> 00:06:28,089
reducing those dopes emerging addictive

140
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:29,680
desires and it's one of the most

141
00:06:28,089 --> 00:06:31,448
promising drugs for ending addiction

142
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,098
that we've seen yet hemp is probably the

143
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,020
first agricultural plant that we ever

144
00:06:33,098 --> 00:06:37,149
domesticated right around

145
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:39,158
thank you 37 we've ripped that from her

146
00:06:37,149 --> 00:06:41,318
diet and added antibiotics we have

147
00:06:39,158 --> 00:06:42,819
caffeine given to kids in orange soda in

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,229
school and your died as parents and

149
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,780
never been told about it many of these

150
00:06:44,228 --> 00:06:49,579
kids are on ritalin methylphenidate okay

151
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,929
what does that do to brain

152
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:53,000
there's a host of things that we've

153
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:54,709
somehow said we're not gonna worry about

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,480
what that doesn't develop your mind but

155
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:59,689
we're gonna apply that that scrutiny to

156
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,920
THC there's there's no logic stuff and

157
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:03,230
when you see children with epilepsy

158
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,540
getting it and they're coming alive like

159
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:10,790
what's this third rail about Pediatrics

160
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,360
all about so I have a son with severe

161
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,150
epilepsy

162
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,639
it was untreated and it's a really

163
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,339
severe disease he was really suffering

164
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,110
and I met a dad at an epilepsy

165
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:22,729
conference who told me that marijuana

166
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:23,330
was helping his son who had severe

167
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,330
epilepsy

168
00:07:23,329 --> 00:07:28,370
I looked up whether marijuana had any

169
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:32,990
compounds that might be anti convulsive

170
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:36,290
and I found some literature from the 70s

171
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:39,290
and 80s showing that in fact CBD is

172
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:44,230
pretty consistently anti convulsive 35

173
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:47,360
years ago we administered cannabidiol to

174
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:51,140
epileptic patients and we found those

175
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,870
eight patients that got the material

176
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:56,060
four of them didn't have epileptic

177
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:59,420
attacks during the period and we gave

178
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:01,280
them cannabidiol three had much less and

179
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:04,220
one was not affected so what we want to

180
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:07,549
do is make sure that everyone has access

181
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,200
right now in whatever way they can but

182
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:11,960
at the same time do the rigorous

183
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,360
research that's required and so what I'm

184
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:17,060
going to figure out is how we can move

185
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:19,480
the needle very quickly on policy will

186
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:22,579
also collect input of the data we need

187
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:25,700
clinical trials and unfortunately until

188
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:29,659
recently there were very few clinical

189
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:31,240
trials policy I think has really

190
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,360
interfered with the progress of science

191
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,570
the legal table has to do something we

192
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,009
need

193
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:43,339
the stigma has something to do with it

194
00:08:39,009 --> 00:08:44,778
it shouldn't be that way kids that we

195
00:08:43,339 --> 00:08:46,640
have here that their severe epilepsy

196
00:08:44,778 --> 00:08:47,929
they look and on ones are the

197
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,278
pharmaceutical drugs they look as if

198
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,870
they're complete zombies if you put them

199
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:52,460
on CBD and something like they're now

200
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,810
awake and conscious and they're having

201
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,430
conversations with their parents really

202
00:08:53,809 --> 00:08:56,689
high I don't think they're high I think

203
00:08:55,429 --> 00:08:58,429
you're just restoring the a

204
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:01,790
neurotransmitter imbalances going on

205
00:08:58,429 --> 00:09:05,569
there is enough data already published

206
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:08,329
which shows that yes it lowers the

207
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:11,330
number of epileptic attacks we did that

208
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:14,028
35 years ago in adult patients very

209
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,800
little has been done since my son has

210
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:18,080
been living with this disease for seven

211
00:09:15,799 --> 00:09:19,699
years and I still talk to senators who

212
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,470
say we have to be careful we have to go

213
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,390
slowly and I don't think we can expect

214
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:25,339
patients to wait for years for

215
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:26,870
medication is already available to them

216
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,730
there's this thing called sudden

217
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,159
unexplained death with a velocity that

218
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,240
they just died Bank they're gone if you

219
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:34,120
don't have these things under control

220
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,860
and so it's one of those scenarios where

221
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,750
music I do the right thing so my goal

222
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:40,839
now chill ray is to make sure that we

223
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:44,000
develop these cannabis derived

224
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:45,709
treatments as quickly as possible it's

225
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,360
been black market for so long that we

226
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:49,699
don't have a good way to track this and

227
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,350
so that's what we're trying to do here

228
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,330
is to change that is to genetically

229
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:55,220
sequence all of these strains and then

230
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,720
tie those down to the cannabinoids

231
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,339
intervenes that they make and track that

232
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,680
throughout time if you don't have that

233
00:09:58,339 --> 00:10:02,240
information and you start going down the

234
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,919
Epilepsy route without it you're gonna

235
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,600
go through all types of surgery and

236
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,429
invasive procedures or go through 20

237
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,170
different drugs before they figure this

238
00:10:07,429 --> 00:10:10,969
out having the information advanced

239
00:10:09,169 --> 00:10:13,338
sidesteps all of that it gets you on the

240
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,959
right drug instantly you should no

241
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:16,760
longer be about whether to providing

242
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:17,549
access right the debate should now be

243
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:19,860
about

244
00:10:17,549 --> 00:10:21,449
to provide them access and I think I we

245
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:23,759
can do that collectively by

246
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:25,320
mainstreaming this medicine we were the

247
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:27,299
really lucky one there are two hundred

248
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,700
thousand kids out there who still don't

249
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:33,120
have access to pure cannabidiol you can

250
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,209
no longer allow a medicine that has been

251
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,669
proven to protect our brains to be kept

252
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:42,629
from us any longer especially thank you

253
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:44,669
to our sponsors clear a three pack here

254
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:46,409
if we can tie more science around the

255
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:48,659
plants so people don't just write it off

256
00:10:46,409 --> 00:10:49,679
as you know a hippy stream it's

257
00:10:48,659 --> 00:10:51,629
something that's actually been studied

258
00:10:49,679 --> 00:10:53,399
we understand the planet better than any

259
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:55,320
plant in the world and then we'll start

260
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,820
to consider maybe those how do we

261
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,140
synthesize those on the planet get them

262
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,140
into compounds we trust in people

263
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,928
you

264
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:14,929
