1
00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:09,919
I'm really happy to be here we have a

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,368
lot of clinical information going on in

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:16,009
California as you know cannabis has been

4
00:00:13,368 --> 00:00:18,289
legal as a medical substance for 20

5
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:22,400
years I've been seeing patients for the

6
00:00:18,289 --> 00:00:24,320
past 12 years and over the past five

7
00:00:22,399 --> 00:00:27,669
years I would say the incidence of

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,670
cannabis use in the elderly has totally

9
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:33,948
skyrocketed when I started it was maybe

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:37,670
10% of my population and now it's more

11
00:00:33,948 --> 00:00:39,500
like 50% in the age of 60 and above all

12
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:44,480
the way to my oldest patient is a

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:47,149
hundred and four years old so okay I

14
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:49,369
want to start by I don't have a video

15
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,299
but I do have a little story this is

16
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:55,308
patient Stuart who is 86 years old and

17
00:00:52,299 --> 00:00:58,218
he wrote a little op-ed for our local

18
00:00:55,308 --> 00:01:00,799
newspaper in Santa Cruz California where

19
00:00:58,219 --> 00:01:02,600
he said for some years I've been dealing

20
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:04,968
with progressive numbness and fierce

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,829
pain and my feet a consequence of

22
00:01:04,968 --> 00:01:09,618
peripheral neuropathy that began when I

23
00:01:06,828 --> 00:01:12,199
had diabetes I had trouble sleeping more

24
00:01:09,618 --> 00:01:13,998
than a few hours at night an old friend

25
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,618
suggested that I try some medical

26
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:17,468
marijuana that he and his wife were

27
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:20,868
using for sleep with excellent results

28
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:23,629
he gave me a small bottle of the drops

29
00:01:20,868 --> 00:01:25,849
you will hear about the drops and the

30
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:28,728
result result was also dramatic and

31
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:30,678
immediate since the first night I tried

32
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:32,328
the drops the swelling in my ankles and

33
00:01:30,679 --> 00:01:34,909
the peripheral neuropathy pain and my

34
00:01:32,328 --> 00:01:36,919
feet disappeared and for the first time

35
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:40,039
in many years I sleep well every night

36
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,528
and for as long as I wish this

37
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:44,420
development truly stunned me to

38
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:46,158
neurologist and my competent caring

39
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:48,799
regular doctor had told me that the

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,399
neuropathy was progressive incurable and

41
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,959
untreatable I have no pain anywhere I'm

42
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,849
sleeping better and longer than I have

43
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:57,649
in years and feel a marvelous general

44
00:01:55,849 --> 00:02:00,829
sense of well-being and energy without

45
00:01:57,649 --> 00:02:04,849
the lingering consciousness of stress

46
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:07,278
all without having to make anything to

47
00:02:04,849 --> 00:02:09,759
smoke anything or waste a lot of time

48
00:02:07,278 --> 00:02:12,680
giggling

49
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,589
so I'm still seeing Stuart this is about

50
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,740
four years later and his peripheral

51
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:20,990
neuropathy has progressed and he has

52
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,540
started to use a different product for

53
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:25,939
sleep which is has a lot more THC in it

54
00:02:23,539 --> 00:02:30,318
and he is still sleeping well in through

55
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:33,169
the night and the limitation on how his

56
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,780
peripheral neuropathy has progressed has

57
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:39,318
to do with building a tolerance to the

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:42,140
CBD and being unable to financially

59
00:02:39,318 --> 00:02:44,689
afford the kind of dosing that he needs

60
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:47,839
to get to so he hasn't been able to

61
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:51,609
really follow my instructions as far as

62
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,800
how much he needs to take for example a

63
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:57,500
15 milligram dose of CBD three times a

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,080
day would probably keep his neuropathy

65
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:03,889
in check and he's only able to afford 10

66
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,110
milligrams once a day in this in case I

67
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:08,479
forget to say it later is the most

68
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,340
limiting and the most frustrating factor

69
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,459
of working with the elderly because many

70
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,890
are on fixed incomes and they simply

71
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,439
don't feel that they can afford the

72
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:20,809
medicine some of them truly can't afford

73
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:22,909
it and some of them are like you're

74
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:26,030
asking me to spend $200 a month on

75
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:29,810
medicine that's just too big a piece of

76
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:31,699
my pocket and I can't do it okay I'm not

77
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,469
gonna read this one you'll have copies

78
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:35,149
of all this this is a half hour talk

79
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:37,819
that I'm putting in 20 minutes but we

80
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,409
see here some very infamous drops which

81
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:42,620
are gonna be in a study that I'm gonna

82
00:03:39,409 --> 00:03:44,900
be talking about this is Bobbi she's 82

83
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,519
she can dance again and you see her

84
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:51,289
arthritic hands they're holding the

85
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:54,739
drops okay so to begin with we do have

86
00:03:51,289 --> 00:03:57,259
an informed consent sheet on my patient

87
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,150
intake questionnaire and one of the

88
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:02,899
things that I had on there where there

89
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:06,079
was the risks of THC cannabis which for

90
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:08,569
years like for 10 years that was what

91
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:10,219
was on the risk list and I'd have all

92
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,799
these older folks come in and they'd

93
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:14,870
start to receive it read about this

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,009
informed consent and risk listing and

95
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:18,620
they said well I don't want to come in

96
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:19,238
and do this this is like I'm scared I

97
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,978
don't want to

98
00:04:19,238 --> 00:04:23,589
get dizzy I don't want to have memory

99
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:27,728
loss so I had to create an additional

100
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:29,589
section on the risks for CBD use which

101
00:04:27,728 --> 00:04:32,560
most of them were going to be using and

102
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:35,469
as you can see I never saw a risk for

103
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,939
CBD use anywhere I made this up and I

104
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:41,789
can only come up with four items and you

105
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:46,478
know the change in mood or sensation is

106
00:04:41,788 --> 00:04:48,610
usually a positive thing and here's a

107
00:04:46,478 --> 00:04:50,348
good one though many patients do not

108
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,860
sleep well on CBD that's for another

109
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:57,668
talk so that's something to consider and

110
00:04:52,860 --> 00:05:00,009
dry mouth and loose stools so that's

111
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:03,698
what they learn about before they come

112
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:07,509
in I don't have time to go through all

113
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:10,470
of these but we see that both THC and in

114
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:13,060
the next slide CBD have many available

115
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,370
therapeutic uses and the important ones

116
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:19,810
I want to point out here with the THC is

117
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:22,180
that it's analgesic and antiseptic we

118
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,610
don't necessarily see that as a primary

119
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,668
component of CBD use people may disagree

120
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,879
with me I get people that call me all

121
00:05:27,668 --> 00:05:33,819
the time saying I want the pain medicine

122
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,968
that doesn't get you high I want the CBD

123
00:05:33,819 --> 00:05:39,550
and if it's inflammatory pain then

124
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:41,500
indeed CBD helps but if you're working

125
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:43,389
with the central nervous system for

126
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,519
example you want to get off opiates I

127
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:48,550
have found that the CBD does not help

128
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:50,889
nearly as much as THC so there are uses

129
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:53,348
for THC that are important even in the

130
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:56,288
elderly and I'll show you how we bring

131
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:59,649
it in without causing psychoactive

132
00:05:56,288 --> 00:06:01,360
effects and then of course the main

133
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:03,819
things with CBD are that they're

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,468
anti-anxiety antipsychotic is the most

135
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,899
important effect that I think is

136
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:11,079
important because you can use it in

137
00:06:07,899 --> 00:06:12,879
combination with THC to actually get

138
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,288
some benefits of having THC in your

139
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,668
system while not getting you know

140
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:24,158
disoriented really important effect of

141
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:26,948
CBD among many others okay so what we do

142
00:06:24,158 --> 00:06:30,098
when we consider using medicine in the

143
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:32,169
elderly at least is to start with the

144
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:33,039
concept of you can use a CBD rich

145
00:06:32,168 --> 00:06:34,870
medicine

146
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,870
you won't have to worry about losing

147
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,480
your balance about being altered in your

148
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:44,680
sensation and a lot of the elderly

149
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:47,410
really like that they will eventually go

150
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,600
to a more THC rich medicine for sleep

151
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,110
but they like coming in with this idea

152
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:56,260
that they're not going to be stoned and

153
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,420
just some information about CBD it does

154
00:06:56,259 --> 00:07:01,329
have this wide range of effects which I

155
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:03,040
showed in the last slide but it's

156
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,779
important to remember that as in all

157
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:07,840
cannabinoids it does have a dose

158
00:07:04,779 --> 00:07:10,179
response curve that's biphasic so dosing

159
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:13,029
is very important in both CBD and THC

160
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:15,579
and you have to work with your patients

161
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:18,219
on follow-up visits for dosing or it

162
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:23,289
falls apart this is true of all aged

163
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:25,450
people and so in California the model is

164
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,160
is that you see patients once a year you

165
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,750
give them an approval they go away you

166
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,910
don't see them for a year but if you

167
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:33,879
really want to work with dosing you have

168
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,460
to see them like at least again after 1

169
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,279
to 3 months to help adjust to that naive

170
00:07:36,459 --> 00:07:41,109
user to the to the user that has

171
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:43,239
developed a tolerance and you have to

172
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,490
adjust the dosing and you have to deal

173
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:51,610
with tolerance okay there are some risks

174
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:54,189
of using cannabis in the elderly this is

175
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,139
from the one article that I could find

176
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:59,139
in the Journal of American Geriatrics

177
00:07:56,139 --> 00:08:01,930
that spoke about use of cannabis in the

178
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:05,680
elderly there are no articles there's

179
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,990
nothing written really that I can find

180
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,050
that has to do with any studies done of

181
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,769
people using cannabis in the elderly as

182
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:18,250
far as you know a published study

183
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:20,649
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence so

184
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,870
what they say in this article is that

185
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,139
older adults are vulnerable because of

186
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,899
age-related physiologic changes

187
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:31,240
comorbidity polypharmacy which increase

188
00:08:28,899 --> 00:08:33,490
the likelihood of adverse drug effects

189
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,139
now this is what's interesting because

190
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,820
we're going to see that when we use

191
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,750
cannabis we can decrease the

192
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:40,490
polypharmacy

193
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,820
and we're going to decrease the

194
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,529
likely advent of drug effects so this is

195
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,270
an important reason why you do want to

196
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:50,500
use cannabis in the elderly is to

197
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:53,059
decrease their pharmaceutical usage and

198
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,919
of course lack of information about

199
00:08:53,059 --> 00:08:57,739
safety and efficacy and this is really

200
00:08:54,919 --> 00:09:01,549
true but you have to keep in mind that

201
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:03,649
most of the opinions that come out about

202
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:07,339
cannabis and its use in any patient

203
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:09,850
population is based on age-old ideas

204
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:12,800
that have to do with THC rich cannabis

205
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:15,110
which does have its value but that's not

206
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:19,250
what we're primarily using in the

207
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,860
elderly population okay there was this

208
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:24,620
having said there was no studies sorry

209
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:28,940
there was one study done in Israel about

210
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:33,159
the use of cannabis in a nursing home

211
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:35,810
and most of the residents there did

212
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,490
document dramatic physical results

213
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:40,250
weight gain reduction of pain and

214
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,220
tremors and help in mood and

215
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:45,080
communication skills this was done at

216
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:47,600
the hot area nursing home many of our

217
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:50,300
Israeli members here will remember this

218
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,290
and what I want to point out about this

219
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:57,349
study is that it was done with the raw

220
00:09:54,289 --> 00:09:59,839
bud marijuana so it was either smoked or

221
00:09:57,350 --> 00:10:02,690
vaporized and that's all that was

222
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,060
available at the time of this study we

223
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,370
are very fortunate in the United States

224
00:10:05,059 --> 00:10:10,819
I don't know about every single state

225
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,159
but in California we have almost all the

226
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,190
different forms of cannabis available

227
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:18,649
the one that I find most useful for the

228
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,590
elderly are tinctures of those and I'll

229
00:10:18,649 --> 00:10:24,379
come to that but generally alcohol

230
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:26,269
extracted full plant extract in a

231
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:29,000
dropper bottle because we can regulate

232
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:30,919
the dose by the drop and it gives us a

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,700
concentration range that's useful for

234
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:37,610
the elderly anywhere from maybe 2 or 5

235
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,200
milligrams of cannabinoids to 10 to 20

236
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:44,450
milligrams of cannabinoids that's

237
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,180
appropriate for an alcohol tincture okay

238
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:49,550
so because there wasn't any information

239
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:52,649
out and I have so many elderly patients

240
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:55,708
and fortunately many of them resided in

241
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:57,328
assisted living community it was easy to

242
00:10:55,708 --> 00:11:00,299
gather just some day to get a

243
00:10:57,328 --> 00:11:02,789
questionnaire and this is by no means a

244
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:04,618
study it's a survey but we did take a

245
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:09,149
survey of some other patients in a

246
00:11:04,619 --> 00:11:11,480
senior community in my area to reiterate

247
00:11:09,149 --> 00:11:14,519
what was said by the last speaker

248
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:16,829
there's a problem in skilled nursing

249
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:20,188
facilities anywhere where nurses have to

250
00:11:16,828 --> 00:11:22,219
write an order we can't write orders for

251
00:11:20,188 --> 00:11:25,349
cannabis this affects not only pediatric

252
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:29,069
patients impatience but elderly patients

253
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:32,129
in a skilled nursing facility so there

254
00:11:29,068 --> 00:11:34,708
is a problem in getting the elderly to

255
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:37,678
be using some of these cannabis products

256
00:11:34,708 --> 00:11:39,359
this particular community had assisted

257
00:11:37,678 --> 00:11:41,909
living where they could choose to use

258
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:46,139
what they want and administer to

259
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:50,219
themselves but when and if ever they had

260
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:52,318
a condition that required a progress to

261
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,540
the skilled nursing facility component

262
00:11:52,318 --> 00:11:56,338
this is not even hospitalization just

263
00:11:54,539 --> 00:11:58,649
skilled nursing they had to come off of

264
00:11:56,339 --> 00:12:00,629
their cannabis and all of the

265
00:11:58,649 --> 00:12:02,129
polypharmacy reduction that we had

266
00:12:00,629 --> 00:12:03,629
gained went out the window they were

267
00:12:02,129 --> 00:12:07,889
back up on their three or four more

268
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:10,860
drugs and at the time that I did this

269
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:14,159
study about three years ago there was

270
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:15,870
not any way around it I wasn't the

271
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,458
primary physician at this skilled

272
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,230
nursing facility I would have been

273
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:21,138
willing to write an order but I couldn't

274
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,730
because I didn't have privileges there

275
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:26,789
the primary physician wasn't willing to

276
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:29,399
write an order risk his DEA license so

277
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:31,588
I'm happy to say that there are now one

278
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:34,889
or two physicians in the area that I

279
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:36,870
work that do come on staff at some of

280
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,839
these facilities that are willing to

281
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:42,990
write orders and they say patient may

282
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,629
continue cannabis therapy that's what

283
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:48,629
they say patient may continue cannabis

284
00:12:45,629 --> 00:12:51,928
therapy and that's enough it's not

285
00:12:48,629 --> 00:12:55,649
hospital but it's enough that the nurses

286
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:58,588
will allow the patient to come in with

287
00:12:55,649 --> 00:13:01,289
their note for me which I say this is

288
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:05,380
what I recommend the patient use so

289
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:07,839
between those two pieces of paper

290
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,879
and they're getting their medicine so

291
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,240
that that's how we've done it and I

292
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:15,460
really think that nobody's trying to

293
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:17,830
shut any place down for a few older

294
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,920
patients continuing to use their herbal

295
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,560
medicine and so the the nursing home was

296
00:13:20,919 --> 00:13:25,000
happy with it and the patient's happy

297
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,399
with it that's how we've gotten around

298
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:41,860
it

299
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:47,470
yeah yeah I'm gonna talk about that

300
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:51,460
thanks okay so moving on is going into

301
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:53,529
the study the survey I should say so the

302
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:56,860
participants in this survey all live in

303
00:13:53,529 --> 00:13:58,720
a retirement community in California I

304
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:01,169
already talked about that this is

305
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,810
important all had out access to advice

306
00:14:01,169 --> 00:14:07,629
from a team of professional so the the

307
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:10,209
primary physician on call at this

308
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:12,639
assisted living center was on board he

309
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,650
actually referred patients to me the

310
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:16,449
resident nurse manager became very

311
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,699
interested in cannabis and was a

312
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,560
facilitator so that these old folks

313
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,370
actually had someone to speak to on a

314
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:25,929
daily basis if they needed to help them

315
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:27,610
kind of navigate their way through using

316
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:29,199
cannabis for the first time and then

317
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:33,430
they have access to a cannabis

318
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:37,390
specialist myself and there is Karen the

319
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:39,639
nurse manager dispensing the drops will

320
00:14:37,389 --> 00:14:41,830
come to them so the medicine was

321
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,169
administered by the patient's themselves

322
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,580
she might have taught them how to do it

323
00:14:44,169 --> 00:14:47,949
at the beginning but they took it

324
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:49,810
themselves this was a survey the people

325
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,250
in the survey one to seven months at the

326
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:53,769
time of the report they'd been using

327
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:57,070
cannabis almost all the patients were

328
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:58,929
naive before they started at this time

329
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:00,879
in this part of California there was no

330
00:14:58,929 --> 00:15:02,949
dispensary allowed there was no

331
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,919
dispensary do you know that the patients

332
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:07,900
could go to so we have delivery services

333
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,459
and there were two or three delivery

334
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:11,259
services involved in bringing the

335
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,790
patients their medicine so you'll see a

336
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:17,350
couple of different medicines here Oh

337
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,079
back well all the patients chose to use

338
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:21,480
it in a non inhaled matter

339
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,490
was the last sentence there so this is

340
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,440
the questionnaire you can read about

341
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,889
that later I want to get the results in

342
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,770
here so the kind of medicinal cannabis

343
00:15:28,889 --> 00:15:34,289
that the patient's chose to use because

344
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:38,129
we did this as a retrospective survey so

345
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:40,740
we didn't tell them what to use topical

346
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:44,460
tinctures and edibles no one chose to

347
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:45,750
inhale at this time we had some problem

348
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,030
with finding out what was in the

349
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:50,309
medicine they used because not all the

350
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:52,949
materials were required to be lab tested

351
00:15:50,309 --> 00:15:57,029
therefore not all were but many of them

352
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:59,400
were you'll see and not all the products

353
00:15:57,029 --> 00:16:02,339
delivered to the elderly come from a

354
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,829
reputable delivery service nor do they

355
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:07,920
come from a reputable dispensary that

356
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:11,250
will even honor if you're lucky enough

357
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:13,199
to have a consultant tell you what they

358
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:15,149
want you to take they'll go to a

359
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,530
dispensary they'll be out of the product

360
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:18,720
that you want them to take and they'll

361
00:16:16,529 --> 00:16:22,620
give them something else this happens

362
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:25,200
all the time it's a big risk I can't

363
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:28,320
tell you how many times I've had

364
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,270
patients call me and say I couldn't make

365
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,550
it home they gave me the wrong medicine

366
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:36,419
I took it before I left had to pull off

367
00:16:32,549 --> 00:16:40,229
the road and call 9-1-1 at least three

368
00:16:36,419 --> 00:16:42,179
times so we don't have any control of

369
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,190
that it's a really big problem we don't

370
00:16:42,179 --> 00:16:47,579
have any control of what the patients

371
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:49,860
take all we can do is advise them okay

372
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:52,710
so this is just a review of the cannabis

373
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:54,899
used there were two different tincture

374
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:56,670
is one that's important is the glycerin

375
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,639
tincture as you can see it had a

376
00:16:56,669 --> 00:17:02,250
concentration of about 3 to 4 milligrams

377
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:04,588
of cannabinoids per milliliter the

378
00:17:02,250 --> 00:17:06,329
alcohol tincture more commonly has

379
00:17:04,588 --> 00:17:08,879
anywhere in the range of 10 to 13

380
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:11,399
milligrams per milliliter the patients

381
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,290
ended up self titrating how much they

382
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,360
used which will be in the next slide

383
00:17:13,289 --> 00:17:17,909
they used more of the glycerin tincture

384
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,129
less of the alcohol so the idea about

385
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:23,490
self titration and dosage really turns

386
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:25,860
out to be true other products that they

387
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,529
used were the cookies or the chocolates

388
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:30,869
these were taken before bed at the

389
00:17:28,529 --> 00:17:31,379
suggestion of the delivery driver who

390
00:17:30,869 --> 00:17:33,059
said well

391
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,490
if you want something for sleep use this

392
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,399
this mostly had THC it came as a shock

393
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:42,870
many of them were not prepared but since

394
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:45,660
it worked they continued to use it we

395
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:48,509
also had topicals and we had a couple of

396
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,880
folks using flowers boiled in tea and it

397
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:52,619
really helped their pain so presumably

398
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:57,420
they're getting th CA out of their

399
00:17:52,619 --> 00:18:00,359
flowers boiled in tea okay then this is

400
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:04,080
just a review of the patient's ages here

401
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:06,389
on the left-hand column 78 to 97 what

402
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:09,269
their dose range ended up to be from

403
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:11,220
their various medicines and we can see

404
00:18:09,269 --> 00:18:13,529
that we have something from about a half

405
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,049
a milligram up to forty two milligrams

406
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:19,529
that's the range that the patient's self

407
00:18:16,049 --> 00:18:24,089
titrated into mostly focusing around ten

408
00:18:19,529 --> 00:18:26,789
to fifteen milligrams and we can

409
00:18:24,089 --> 00:18:30,720
conclude is that the patients do self

410
00:18:26,789 --> 00:18:33,029
titrate to Anna prompt approximately you

411
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:38,100
know around the 10 to 20 milligram dose

412
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:42,660
range some more some less and the

413
00:18:38,099 --> 00:18:45,019
problem with topicals is that they're

414
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:48,810
used to a medicine that this was not

415
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:50,490
given with direction like yet lasts 4 to

416
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,359
5 hours you have to use it three times a

417
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:55,769
day so they only used it once a day so

418
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:59,879
they really need direction on every

419
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:02,339
single thing ok the last of this study

420
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:05,820
is the different diagnoses that the

421
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:08,159
patients were seen for mostly centering

422
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:13,079
on peripheral neuropathy arthritis and

423
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:16,050
insomnia and you'll see on the right

424
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:17,699
hand slide is the change in medications

425
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,250
you can look at that later in almost

426
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,759
every case patients reduce their

427
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:25,470
medications or went off this was done by

428
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:28,079
themselves there was no doctor

429
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:32,279
supervising this this is just a report

430
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:34,079
at the survey of what they did and so

431
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,869
just some feedback about what the

432
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:38,970
patient said is that they wanted to

433
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:41,309
reduce their pharmaceuticals experience

434
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,990
less pain have better sleep in this

435
00:19:41,309 --> 00:19:44,279
small group of patients presented here

436
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:47,849
these goals have been met with

437
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,379
levels of success most of all some

438
00:19:47,849 --> 00:19:53,809
patients receive considerable reduction

439
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:56,700
in their other medication use and

440
00:19:53,809 --> 00:19:58,589
overall what we learned is two years

441
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:02,160
later ten of the twelve patients were

442
00:19:58,589 --> 00:20:04,439
still taking cannabis medicine one who

443
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,029
had discontinued resumed after she came

444
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:10,470
for a follow-up visit because she was

445
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:13,410
confused now 14 of the 24 residents used

446
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,240
this medicine and in the cases of

447
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:18,210
discontinuous it's due to lack of

448
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:20,160
education and inadequate follow-up

449
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,890
that's most important with elderly they

450
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:25,080
need follow-up they get confused they

451
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:27,030
forget they're not sure if they're

452
00:20:25,079 --> 00:20:29,399
supposed to keep spending this money or

453
00:20:27,029 --> 00:20:32,700
are they cured now that's really

454
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:34,560
important so I think I'm pretty much out

455
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:38,370
of time oh yeah here's the last slide

456
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:41,039
the biggest biggest response that we got

457
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:44,309
in this survey was we were afraid to use

458
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,440
it during the day so we had a lot of

459
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,539
people that had pain throughout the day

460
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,880
and only achieved remission of their

461
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:52,859
pain at night because they were afraid

462
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,530
but if they came back and they spoke to

463
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:57,089
me or they spoke to the nurse manager

464
00:20:54,529 --> 00:21:00,059
she encouraged them to use it during the

465
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:03,119
day another patient came in complaining

466
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:04,679
of insomnia and back pain but he was so

467
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,809
afraid to use the medicine he stuck with

468
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:08,070
the topical only which of course is not

469
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,740
going to help him sleep

470
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:14,490
so that's some of the patient feedback

471
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:19,440
and Wow I spoke so fast I have one

472
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:20,970
minute left this is amazing so I can

473
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,000
tell you a little bit more about the

474
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:26,940
elderly that I treat now we have

475
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:29,130
patients that come in on their own their

476
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:31,070
families bring them in I have four or

477
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:33,840
five different communities you know

478
00:21:31,069 --> 00:21:36,659
assisted living communities where the

479
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,669
patients are coming in a lot of patients

480
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:40,769
come in because their son or grandson or

481
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:42,600
some younger person is bringing them but

482
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:45,779
almost all of them are coming in because

483
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,059
of this held out miraculous hope that

484
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:50,279
they can use CBD or they can use them

485
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:53,579
the medical marijuana the one that

486
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:55,349
doesn't get you stoned and they have to

487
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:57,369
be educated that there are combinations

488
00:21:55,349 --> 00:21:59,919
of CBD and th

489
00:21:57,369 --> 00:22:02,558
seed that can be had that can help them

490
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:05,350
sleep for example this tincture that we

491
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:07,779
used was early days of teachers and it

492
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:12,789
was a two to one mix of cannabidiol to

493
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:15,730
THC so that 35% of THC actually this

494
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:17,440
strain canna tonic is pretty sedating it

495
