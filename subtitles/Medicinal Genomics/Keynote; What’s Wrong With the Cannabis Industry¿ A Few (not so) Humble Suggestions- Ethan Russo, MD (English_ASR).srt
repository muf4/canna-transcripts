1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:07,440
well it's an honor to be here

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:10,800
um I'm humbled by holding the position

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,320
that's previously uh been taken by

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,019
Rafael mashulum I hope that you're all

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,240
there last night to appreciate the

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:19,980
testimonial

7
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:22,259
so

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,920
um I have an interesting task I hope you

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:28,380
bear with me for the next 30 minutes

10
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:33,320
as I critique the Cannabis industry and

11
00:00:28,379 --> 00:00:33,320
offer some not so humble remedies

12
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:41,218
so here we have Miss America 1980

13
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:44,820
um

14
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,719
benefiting from virtual plastic surgery

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:51,719
but faded pulchritude does not equate to

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,679
competence in a new industry which is

17
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,679
very complex

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,160
would you buy a cannabidiol from this

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,160
man

20
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:11,299
this guy stole my suit you can tell me

21
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:11,299
you can tell me later who wore it better

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,760
foreign

23
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:22,438
we're in the unfortunate situation of uh

24
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,859
not having our pronouncements taken with

25
00:01:22,438 --> 00:01:27,658
any uh credulity by the people who make

26
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:31,259
the decisions and this is always going

27
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,340
to be the problem when politicians are

28
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,579
tasked with trying to make sense of

29
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,799
complex scientific principles and so

30
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:41,819
we're always going to be behind the

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,799
curve

32
00:01:41,819 --> 00:01:45,798
as decisions are being made

33
00:01:46,438 --> 00:01:51,739
we have a situation now of an industry

34
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:55,219
that's trying to make do

35
00:01:51,739 --> 00:01:57,478
despite these obstacles of politicians

36
00:01:55,219 --> 00:01:59,340
continued opposition from law

37
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:02,359
enforcement

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,040
um the legal industry can be Pro or con

39
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,659
you need to seek out the ones that are

40
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,880
going to be a help rather than any

41
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:11,280
hindrance

42
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,799
the states who have legalized are

43
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,199
grabbing more than their share and that

44
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,660
for example has strangled the industry

45
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,299
in California as we'll see

46
00:02:18,659 --> 00:02:23,759
and we have a situation now where the

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,760
FDA had the opportunity to say something

48
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:31,399
useful about cannabidil and others and

49
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:34,378
it totally passed the proverbial buck

50
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,659
meanwhile the people who have spent

51
00:02:34,378 --> 00:02:39,179
decades learning how to grow this plant

52
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:41,519
medicinally have suffered and we have

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,280
the situation now in Mendocino County

54
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,780
where nine out of 10 farmers are

55
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,419
unlicensed

56
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,000
um and many of the ones who are licensed

57
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:54,780
have gone out of business so this has

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,639
led to an exodus from the industry uh I

59
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,860
can tell you that personally it took us

60
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:01,159
seven tries to get a bank that would

61
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,500
take our business account

62
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:07,219
we have a cash only economy that puts

63
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:11,060
Bud tenders and other people at risk of

64
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:14,280
of robbery or murder

65
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:16,140
we also have a lot of unscrupulous

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,060
people in the industry that don't pay

67
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,039
their bills

68
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,598
um and this just leads to endless

69
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:28,079
rip-offs and inability to get insurance

70
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:30,359
again prohibitive tax structure and a

71
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,300
situation where there are no margins in

72
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,659
this industry so that very few people

73
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,760
are actually making money

74
00:03:35,658 --> 00:03:39,959
and then they're the promises that

75
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:44,459
people make

76
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:48,598
in general timelines are rarely met

77
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:50,819
um and uh people need cash on the

78
00:03:48,598 --> 00:03:53,339
barrelhead rather than stock options

79
00:03:50,818 --> 00:03:55,979
which rarely come to pass

80
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:59,878
also there's a problem with diversity in

81
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:02,098
the industry so here we have the rare

82
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,500
black farmer

83
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:07,018
and there's still this

84
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,318
the commodity of which we speak is still

85
00:04:07,019 --> 00:04:12,860
federally illegal irrespective of state

86
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:17,159
laws

87
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:21,060
so that's as much railing as I'm going

88
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:23,939
to do how about Solutions well this is a

89
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,759
scene we'd like to see more of acres and

90
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:31,139
Acres as far as the I can see of a

91
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,379
beautiful crop and an aromatic one

92
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:38,460
but a lot of the acreage has been taken

93
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:40,620
up with cannabidiol now nobody will say

94
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:44,219
more than me that this is a remarkable

95
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:48,240
and versatile compound but it has severe

96
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,360
limitations as an isolate very high

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,139
dosages are needed

98
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:58,080
it does not work as well on its own and

99
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:01,860
um with the high cost access becomes a

100
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:05,819
very difficult problem for patients

101
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:09,120
and we have a situation now that uh CBD

102
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:11,879
has been commoditized no one can come

103
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,759
into the market and be preeminent or

104
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:17,639
even successful it doesn't matter how

105
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:20,160
talented you were in another industry

106
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,918
also we've had the situation where the

107
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,740
farm bill has been co-opted so that a

108
00:05:22,918 --> 00:05:28,680
lot of the CBD which has been a glut on

109
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,819
the market has been turned into Delta

110
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,579
eight

111
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:35,759
um and other synthetic cannabinoids that

112
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:38,639
have no place in in human health

113
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,400
application and can be outright

114
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,620
dangerous and again I follow the

115
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:46,739
politicians for not having the foresight

116
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:49,259
to understand this and do something

117
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:52,379
about it proactively

118
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:54,919
I think that the future really lies in

119
00:05:52,379 --> 00:05:58,079
diversity diversification

120
00:05:54,918 --> 00:05:59,879
uh to different cannabinoids and these

121
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,219
can all be attained with conventional

122
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:05,759
breeding I'm going to take the position

123
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,340
that we don't need biosynthetics

124
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,660
um there are

125
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:13,379
chemovars of cannabis that are available

126
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,680
through standard breeding that provide

127
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:19,139
very cheap sources for these uh

128
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:21,478
different phytochemicals that can be

129
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:23,699
commoditized as well

130
00:06:21,478 --> 00:06:25,318
so really people need to do something

131
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:29,038
different and that's what I like to say

132
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:32,639
sometimes you need to zag instead of Zig

133
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:35,639
so here uh from a paper from a few years

134
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,300
ago I did with jaehan Marco

135
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,600
these are 12 of the phytocannabinoids

136
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:44,280
about which we know some degree of their

137
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,639
pharmacology

138
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:49,978
but that ignores at least

139
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:52,379
138 other ones

140
00:06:49,978 --> 00:06:54,719
um but every phytocannabinoid that's

141
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:58,279
been discovered so far has some unique

142
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,960
therapeutic properties so we really

143
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:04,198
have not yet

144
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:06,180
fully assess the potential of this plant

145
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,080
so we're going to talk about a couple of

146
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,160
possibilities the first is

147
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:13,159
tetrahydrocannabiferin or thcv

148
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:21,000
this was discovered by my friend Roger

149
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:22,918
pertwy in 1970. now how Charmed the

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,579
position was this this was his first

151
00:07:22,918 --> 00:07:29,038
publication and it was in nature

152
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:32,639
as old as I am I've never had a

153
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,060
publication in nature at that time they

154
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,620
were they thought there were six

155
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,478
pharmacologically Active Components of

156
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,240
cannabis

157
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:44,699
um they discovered this one thcv which

158
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,038
has a three carbon propyl side chain

159
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:48,598
instead of the Pentel five carbon side

160
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,800
chain

161
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:55,860
um this was from uh tincture of cannabis

162
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,800
that had been grown in Pakistan

163
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:02,098
um they showed that it was active in

164
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,160
mice but less potent than THC but that

165
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:07,259
was more than 50 years ago we've learned

166
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,720
something since but basically this was

167
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,759
on the Shelf with no attention for more

168
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,080
than 30 years

169
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:19,020
so this is the normal pathway a journal

170
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:22,139
pyrophosphate combining with olivitalic

171
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:24,859
acid to produce the the five carbon side

172
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:28,500
chain uh cannabinoids

173
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:31,620
alternatively thcv is made by this

174
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,740
pathway so General pyrophosphate was

175
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,060
which is the parent compound to the

176
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:39,479
cannabinoids as well as the terpenoids

177
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:43,259
in cannabis combines with divernic acid

178
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:47,300
to produce can cannabidiarolic acid and

179
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:47,299
onward to the others

180
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:52,259
um just to summarize the activity

181
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:54,200
um again this was discovered in

182
00:08:52,259 --> 00:08:57,059
Pakistani cannabis

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:09:00,720
in the first paper

184
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:03,179
um they noted that CB1 was an antagonist

185
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,959
at I'm sorry

186
00:09:03,179 --> 00:09:09,838
um that thcv is an antagonist at the CB1

187
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:12,179
receptor at low doses but a couple of

188
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,540
years later they figured out that it was

189
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:18,239
an Agonist at high doses so this is a

190
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:19,919
nice demonstration of the biphasic dose

191
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,959
response curves of many of the

192
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:24,120
cannabinoids different effects at

193
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:26,819
different Doses and that can be

194
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,360
leveraged in in various ways or it can

195
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:33,060
be a problem with side effects

196
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,039
um in various animal work uh it was

197
00:09:33,059 --> 00:09:38,639
shown that this produces weight loss

198
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:40,919
decreased body fat and serum leptin

199
00:09:38,639 --> 00:09:44,399
concentrations with increased energy

200
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:47,399
expenditure in mice that are genetically

201
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:49,440
prone to obesity it was also shown to

202
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:52,740
have anticonvulsive properties as do

203
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,200
many components of cannabis it also

204
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,620
treated neuropathic pain decreasing

205
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,879
swelling and and over uh overly

206
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:06,659
sensitive responses to pain

207
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,899
um our friend uh John mcpartland in 2015

208
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:12,480
showed that this lacks the side effect

209
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:14,399
profile of the prior drugs that were

210
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,980
used in this fashion the inverse

211
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,440
agonists Ramona band which was briefly

212
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,539
on the European market never made it to

213
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,899
the U.S market because of disastrous

214
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:26,759
side effects it actually lowers

215
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:28,620
endocannabinoid tone so yeah people lost

216
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,600
weight but they were depressed they were

217
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,179
anxious they had the lower seizure

218
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:35,278
threshold and a couple developed Ms who

219
00:10:33,179 --> 00:10:38,519
hadn't had it before

220
00:10:35,278 --> 00:10:42,778
now despite this not being freely

221
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:47,519
available there are thcv cultivars

222
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:50,100
um as long ago as 15 years ago

223
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:52,919
thcv predominant plants have been

224
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:55,740
developed again this hasn't had the

225
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:59,120
attention by breeders that it deserves

226
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:03,600
let's compare this to cannabidiol so

227
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:06,539
these both can attenuate THC sequelae

228
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,600
reducing side effect prototype profile

229
00:11:06,539 --> 00:11:12,299
but again tcv is what's known as a

230
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,659
neutral antagonist at the CB1 receptor

231
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:18,299
whereas CBD is a negative allosteric

232
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:20,399
modulator it it lodges on a different

233
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:22,919
component of the receptor and makes it a

234
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:24,958
little harder for THC to bind

235
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:28,519
they both affect trip channels

236
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:32,399
particularly uh trip V1

237
00:11:28,519 --> 00:11:35,240
but thcv is much more potent which

238
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,159
medically only means that you need fewer

239
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,839
milligrams as compared to CBD for it to

240
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,719
be active

241
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,800
both of these

242
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,278
phytocannabinoids can be used to treat

243
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:49,740
pain inflammation and epilepsy and both

244
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:53,820
have shown been shown in the animal work

245
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:56,278
and anecdotally in humans to help treat

246
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:59,399
addiction to other substances

247
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:03,439
uh it Remains the case that it's very

248
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:07,200
hard to remove THC entirely from

249
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,500
cannabidiol Plants because the cbda

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:14,040
synthase makes THC in a small amount

251
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,019
with thcv it may be possible to get it

252
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:19,199
to the point that it's considered hemp

253
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:22,200
under the farm bill rules

254
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
tcv

255
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:29,639
should be a useful and adjunct to THC

256
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:33,059
chemovars because it can complement the

257
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,980
therapeutic properties and reduce side

258
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:38,159
effects thereby increasing the

259
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,200
therapeutic index of THC in other words

260
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,480
the difference between the dose that's

261
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,240
effective in treating symptoms and that

262
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,060
which produces side effects

263
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:52,079
what do I see as the future here well

264
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:54,719
thcv has a variety of properties that

265
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,019
make it potentially very useful in

266
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,540
treating type 2 diabetes obesity the

267
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:03,060
metabolic syndrome things that are an

268
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:06,899
Affliction of the affluence of Western

269
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:09,059
culture also treating addiction and

270
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:11,639
there is one report indicating the

271
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:12,539
likelihood of benefit Parkinson's

272
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:15,180
disease

273
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:16,919
so all of these areas require better

274
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:21,659
safer products

275
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:24,719
because it is such a safe compound and

276
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:26,939
so versatile I think it's something that

277
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,160
we should be adding to cannabis-based

278
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:31,800
preparations

279
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:34,439
um this doohickey if you want to put

280
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:37,319
your camera on it will give you access

281
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,600
um to this page in more detail and less

282
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,399
blurry

283
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,278
this is a cultivar called pink boost

284
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:47,778
goddess available through Breeder's best

285
00:13:44,278 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm the medical director of that company

286
00:13:47,778 --> 00:13:53,299
as a disclaimer on if you can see

287
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:58,980
carefully this is about a one-to-one

288
00:13:53,299 --> 00:14:02,519
with good titers of both THC and thcv

289
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:05,940
um people have used this this cultivar

290
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:09,060
um like it very much and find it very

291
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,760
easy to handle and and beneficial for a

292
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:13,619
variety of conditions

293
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,860
the next one we're going to talk about

294
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,519
that I think is the next big thing as

295
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:22,200
canaba gerol or CBG

296
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,940
what I like to call the mother of all

297
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,480
cannabinoids

298
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:31,380
now people are well aware that professor

299
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:34,500
michulum in the middle uh discovered the

300
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:38,278
the true structure and synthesized THC

301
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:41,639
in 1964 but with his

302
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:44,879
um research partner uh yahil gayangi

303
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:47,000
both pictured here in 2010 one of my

304
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:51,838
proudest moments

305
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,820
in 1964 they also discovered CBG and I I

306
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,180
want you to understand how prescient

307
00:14:53,820 --> 00:15:00,720
they were so they extracted this from

308
00:14:57,179 --> 00:15:03,419
Lebanese hashish that had been seized on

309
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:05,360
they put it through this process and

310
00:15:03,419 --> 00:15:08,578
figured out the following quote

311
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:11,220
Canaveral represents the primary product

312
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:13,879
and The Missing Link in the formation of

313
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:16,680
cannabis constituents conversion into

314
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:20,299
cannabidiol tetrah drug cannabinol and

315
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:23,819
cannabinol is biogenetically plausible

316
00:15:20,299 --> 00:15:26,819
exactly right cannabinol of course is an

317
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,579
oxidative breakdown product of THC but

318
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:31,019
to me this is amazing with the

319
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:35,179
technology that was available

320
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,179
essentially 60 years ago

321
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:41,639
um this is from a study that uh we

322
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:44,578
published a couple of years ago and it

323
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:47,698
was actually the first study in humans

324
00:15:44,578 --> 00:15:49,379
of the effects of CBG therapeutic that

325
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:54,899
was published

326
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:57,899
um so we had 127 patients who said we

327
00:15:54,899 --> 00:16:00,059
asked that they only participate if they

328
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:03,320
had used material that was at least 50

329
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:03,319
percent CBG

330
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,138
um and again the biosynthetic pathway of

331
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,519
cannabidural uh basically from

332
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:13,940
cannabidiarolic Acid under heater light

333
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,399
producing decarboxylation you get

334
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:20,579
cannabidural that's a photo of a CBG

335
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:24,539
only chemovar that may surprise you to

336
00:16:20,578 --> 00:16:26,419
know that this was available like 15

337
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:29,039
years ago

338
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:31,500
why are we not seeing it in Commerce

339
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,980
universally

340
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:37,559
in our survey we saw this long list of

341
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,980
some 30 conditions that people had that

342
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,619
they used CBG to treat

343
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:48,420
um over half the people were using it

344
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:50,698
medicinally only 6.3 percent thought uh

345
00:16:48,419 --> 00:16:53,099
we're just using it recreationally but

346
00:16:50,698 --> 00:16:55,198
uh you know the vast majority we're

347
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,480
using it to treat something

348
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,778
as you might expect the most common

349
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,060
conditions for anxiety pain depression

350
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:05,640
and insomnia which is basically the

351
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:09,259
profile of of many

352
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,259
cannabis using patients

353
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,380
now the thing that surprised us with the

354
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:21,319
degree of efficacy and if we look at the

355
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:24,299
big ones you see p-values of .001

356
00:17:21,318 --> 00:17:28,019
for many of these conditions depression

357
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:30,119
anxiety and pain

358
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:31,859
what that means for people who aren't

359
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,659
familiar it means there's only one

360
00:17:31,859 --> 00:17:36,178
chance in a thousand that the results

361
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,240
were due to chance that's pretty

362
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:40,559
convincing and again these are only

363
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,380
self-reports it's not a double-blind

364
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,720
randomized controlled trial however

365
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,780
this is real

366
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:52,740
and for the other conditions we see that

367
00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:56,220
the vast majority were improved were

368
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,599
much improved or very much improved

369
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,000
um although there were only a few

370
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:03,240
patients with each we saw big signals

371
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:06,298
for endometriosis with two-thirds noting

372
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:09,240
very high efficacy also for inflammatory

373
00:18:06,298 --> 00:18:10,519
bowel diseases and irritable bowel

374
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:14,579
syndrome

375
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:17,038
and no one thought that conventional

376
00:18:14,579 --> 00:18:19,798
medicine in these instances was better

377
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:20,700
than the CBG preparation that they were

378
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:23,220
taking

379
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,960
now some people reported side effects

380
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:28,798
but they were ones that were obviously

381
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,620
attributable to THC in people that were

382
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:35,058
using a mixed preparation and you know

383
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:37,979
they were dry mouth red eyes uh sedation

384
00:18:35,058 --> 00:18:41,399
these were not seen among the people who

385
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:43,679
were using CBG only products so our

386
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,679
conclusions were

387
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:48,900
um first of all this is becoming more

388
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:52,460
popular particularly in the Pacific

389
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:52,460
Northwest where I live

390
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:57,840
um again this is the first study in

391
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:59,960
humans anxiety pain depression and

392
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:03,359
insomnia were the most common symptoms

393
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:06,779
and efficacy was very high with very

394
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:09,178
very few reported side effects

395
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,339
um it was interesting the reports of

396
00:19:09,179 --> 00:19:15,080
benefit and inflammatory bowel disease

397
00:19:11,339 --> 00:19:18,659
are supported by animal work

398
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:22,379
and apparently this seems to be mediated

399
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:24,779
through both the CB1 and the pipar gamma

400
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,960
receptor which is a nuclear receptor

401
00:19:24,779 --> 00:19:29,940
that affects Gene transcription

402
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:33,538
um we felt that this provided a good

403
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,179
foundation for the safety of CBG for

404
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:38,579
future randomized controlled trials so

405
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,798
no one at the FDA can say well nobody's

406
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:43,439
ever taken it so

407
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:46,339
um you need 10 years of development to

408
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,340
show that it's safe

409
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:53,519
um comparing CBG to CBD again both may

410
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,559
be used to treat pain anxiety and need

411
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,798
sleep

412
00:19:54,558 --> 00:20:01,319
CBD on its own does not treat sleep

413
00:19:57,798 --> 00:20:04,259
except perhaps at extreme doses at lower

414
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:07,079
doses it's actually stimulating again

415
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:09,419
both affect trip channels both have

416
00:20:07,079 --> 00:20:13,819
antibiotic properties and both are

417
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:16,700
cytotoxic for cancer cells without being

418
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:18,538
destructive of normal cells

419
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:20,058
in both

420
00:20:18,538 --> 00:20:24,480
inhibit

421
00:20:20,058 --> 00:20:26,819
fatty acid Amino hydrolase so the enzyme

422
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,400
that breaks down in neandamides so they

423
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:32,058
may increase

424
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,460
cannabinoid endocannabinoid tone again

425
00:20:32,058 --> 00:20:38,579
cannabigirol is much more potent in CBD

426
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,460
if we're talking about isolates 10

427
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:44,159
milligrams of CBG is an effective dose

428
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:48,480
for anxiety whereas it might take 200

429
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:53,160
milligrams or more of CBD as an isolate

430
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:57,860
and there are CBG only cannabis scheme

431
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,860
of ours that are available as we'll see

432
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,840
um issues of CBG and THC

433
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:07,379
at this point I feel the cannabigirol is

434
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:10,980
a useful adjunct to almost all THC

435
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:16,140
chemovars again because of synergy and

436
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:19,339
providing benefit on pain sleep mood Etc

437
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:22,860
um particularly the anti-anxiety effects

438
00:21:19,339 --> 00:21:26,720
May really notably increase the

439
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:26,719
therapeutic index of THC

440
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:32,640
economic prospects well I like to say

441
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:35,399
that what the world's needs now

442
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,220
particularly in the pandemic year as a

443
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:42,620
safe non-sedating non-addictive agent

444
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:46,380
for anxiety and CBG seems to be it

445
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:50,359
because it's so safe and versatile I

446
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:52,039
think it should be a most uh

447
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:54,658
combinations

448
00:21:52,038 --> 00:21:56,879
formulations and this is the way we're

449
00:21:54,659 --> 00:21:59,520
doing our formulation

450
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:02,100
uh I think that it's an impressive

451
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:06,418
impressive agent for treatment of

452
00:22:02,099 --> 00:22:07,158
primary cancer especially the prostate

453
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:11,220
um

454
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:16,620
because it affects uh trip M8 receptor

455
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:21,179
which is a key marker in prostate cancer

456
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:22,859
also CBG has very prominent antibiotic

457
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:26,159
effects

458
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:28,319
particularly against gram positives but

459
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:31,500
there are ways now to make it affect

460
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:33,359
gram negatives but it really shines in

461
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:37,140
treatment of methicillin resistance

462
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:39,479
staph aureus and Vancomycin resistant I

463
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:43,340
I'm sorry yeah Vancomycin resistant

464
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,960
enterococcus again disclaimer

465
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:48,000
I'm the chief medical officer for

466
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,120
anterior Pharmaceuticals which is

467
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,380
working in both of these areas

468
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:59,819
here is a CBG only chemovar called

469
00:22:55,380 --> 00:23:02,820
anomaly again available if you scan the

470
00:22:59,819 --> 00:23:05,519
doohickey and if you can see the fine

471
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:09,240
print you'll see that basically all the

472
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:12,058
cannabinoid content is is CBG again

473
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:16,140
there was no genetic modification here

474
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:19,139
this is just good mendelian breeding

475
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:19,919
um right

476
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:22,500
um

477
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,880
another problem in the industry is

478
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,679
extraction and there were a lot of

479
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:29,220
questions in the session I was in

480
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,179
yesterday about how do we best extract

481
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:33,259
to

482
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:37,798
save the key ingredients

483
00:23:33,259 --> 00:23:39,740
well with my colleague Jeremy Plum who's

484
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:43,019
in the audience somewhere

485
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:46,980
we did this study a couple of years ago

486
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:50,400
a process that that we call cryo-kef

487
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,298
which was just trademarked

488
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,179
um so the idea behind this was whether

489
00:23:54,298 --> 00:24:01,259
really necessary or not it's become

490
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:04,500
traditional for all cannabis for use has

491
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:07,440
been dried and cured well it's been

492
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,259
known for ages that when you do that you

493
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:13,259
may lose as much as 50 percent of the

494
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:16,859
mono terpenoid content if you believe in

495
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:20,640
the Entourage effect as I do following

496
00:24:16,859 --> 00:24:22,798
the dictates of Professor micholum then

497
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,559
you need that stuff and a chimpy

498
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:30,259
squandered if you're not going to be

499
00:24:25,558 --> 00:24:30,259
smoking or vaporizing the material

500
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:35,460
so

501
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,298
the process that we went through uh that

502
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:41,159
we call cryokief involved

503
00:24:38,298 --> 00:24:44,359
exposing freshly cut cannabis

504
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:48,600
immediately through a whole cold chain

505
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:50,119
and exposing it to dry ice vapor for up

506
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:54,000
to 48 Hours

507
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:56,699
the idea of being of fixing the

508
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,579
trichomes making them brittle so that

509
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:03,860
they'll fall off properly also

510
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:03,859
decreasing some of the water content

511
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:13,140
then we went through a sifting process

512
00:25:09,619 --> 00:25:16,199
using this pollinator machine a very

513
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:17,700
simple device you know I think that this

514
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,159
can be done

515
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,919
um in a much more sophisticated fashion

516
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:26,400
we wanted the biggest trichomes which

517
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:30,240
are 150 microns in size

518
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:33,620
um and these are collected as kief the

519
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Moroccan name for hashish

520
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:38,579
if you wanted to call it something else

521
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:44,000
you could call it an enriched trichrome

522
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:44,000
preparation term coined by David Potter

523
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,419
um I'm just going to provide one example

524
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:51,480
we did six different chemovars and

525
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,059
chemovars will vary in how tightly they

526
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,298
hold on to their trichomes so this may

527
00:25:54,058 --> 00:26:00,359
be a process that's better for uh

528
00:25:57,298 --> 00:26:04,740
material that say might have had Afghan

529
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:07,139
genetics where uh in that culture uh

530
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:10,980
it's a traditional to

531
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:14,159
um sift cannabis to produce hashish

532
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,500
now if you look carefully at the uh bars

533
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,260
and the table you'll see that we started

534
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,859
off with a cannabinoid total of 11.5

535
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:26,579
percent which is almost all thca

536
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:30,678
and that was vastly increased by this

537
00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:34,379
process to 58.5

538
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:38,038
of the total weight

539
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:40,440
um now the we in other team of ours we

540
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:46,099
were able to show again concentration of

541
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:50,278
of CBD or even CBG through this process

542
00:26:46,099 --> 00:26:51,678
we did comparisons with material that

543
00:26:50,278 --> 00:26:54,720
was dried

544
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,400
previously and subjected to the same

545
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,759
process

546
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,820
um and the yields were not as great at

547
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:05,519
all

548
00:27:01,819 --> 00:27:09,839
with the terpenoids we went from a terp

549
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:13,139
total of 1.38 a little bit low but that

550
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,139
doubled to 2.87 and you'll see with each

551
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:17,700
of the component the components that the

552
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,900
the

553
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,220
um the gray the cryo Keith uh was was

554
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:26,220
higher

555
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:28,200
um than for all the other processes and

556
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:31,440
this

557
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,419
article is available free online if you

558
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,940
go to

559
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:38,340
ethanrusso.org at the library tab you

560
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:40,500
can see the full details of this

561
00:27:38,339 --> 00:27:43,019
now more importantly a graphic

562
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,298
presentation on the left we have the

563
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:47,579
cryo Keith on the right the more

564
00:27:45,298 --> 00:27:49,079
traditional approach to dried Kief and I

565
00:27:47,579 --> 00:27:50,819
think you'll agree that these look

566
00:27:49,079 --> 00:27:54,379
considerably different

567
00:27:50,819 --> 00:27:57,480
in the dried Keith there's a lot of

568
00:27:54,380 --> 00:28:00,000
particulate matter from the plant that

569
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:02,819
is not something you necessarily want in

570
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,460
your lungs and certainly isn't necessary

571
00:28:02,819 --> 00:28:08,339
to the medicinal effects

572
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,620
ultimately we got a yield that would be

573
00:28:08,339 --> 00:28:14,939
comparable to what's done with water

574
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:18,479
hash uh but without all the water

575
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:20,820
um and again we were using relatively

576
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,519
crude techniques as a proof of concept

577
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:26,240
and I think that this can be uh yet

578
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,240
refined

579
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:32,759
so what we were able to show

580
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:35,460
um was that quietkeep isolated the

581
00:28:32,759 --> 00:28:37,740
trichomes and highly concentrated both

582
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:41,220
the cannabinoids and terpenoid

583
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:44,278
components we think that this would be a

584
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:47,120
very uh good product on two levels one

585
00:28:44,278 --> 00:28:49,619
would be for the Cannabis connoisseur

586
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:51,599
that instead of

587
00:28:49,619 --> 00:28:56,058
um uh

588
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:56,058
and isolate with uh

589
00:28:56,460 --> 00:29:00,440
butane or some other solvent would be

590
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:04,079
clean

591
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:09,440
it would also offer the ability to have

592
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,439
very good quality acid cannabinoids

593
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:16,079
um which if wanted could be secondarily

594
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,619
decarboxylated but particularly with

595
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,298
preservation of the full complement of

596
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:25,319
monoterpenoids and this could be subject

597
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:27,720
to secondary processing of various types

598
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:30,720
um interestingly the material that's

599
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,839
left after the cryo Creek keep process

600
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,960
still had plenty of of activity itself

601
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:41,038
and that could be solvent extracted or

602
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:44,399
CO2 extracted so really this is

603
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:46,140
producing a value-added product

604
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:47,058
um and yet

605
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:50,460
um

606
00:29:47,058 --> 00:29:53,460
not leaving waste that it just needs to

607
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,480
be composted for example

608
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,899
um

609
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,679
again this offers the ability to combine

610
00:29:57,898 --> 00:30:06,019
acid and neutral cannabinoids for

611
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,019
whatever kind of therapeutic purposes

612
00:30:07,159 --> 00:30:14,640
now I want to talk a little bit again

613
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:17,600
disclaimer this material comes from a

614
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:21,000
breeders best headed by Dale Hunt

615
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,558
I am the medical director of that

616
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,079
company

617
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:28,619
um this is what he's called the new

618
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:32,579
cannabinoid Discovery program the idea

619
00:30:28,619 --> 00:30:35,398
being to gain the ability to isolate

620
00:30:32,579 --> 00:30:39,418
novel cannabinoids for future

621
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:43,439
generations to carry on After I'm Gone

622
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:48,840
uh this is a technique that uses

623
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:51,298
receptors to identify the compounds and

624
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:53,579
without exaggeration this is a million

625
00:30:51,298 --> 00:30:55,639
times more sensitive than standard

626
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:59,579
techniques

627
00:30:55,640 --> 00:31:01,100
and instrumentation so whereas the

628
00:30:59,579 --> 00:31:04,558
latter

629
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:07,319
gets things down to the Nano molar level

630
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:09,240
this is the femtomolar level or 10 to

631
00:31:07,319 --> 00:31:13,200
the minus 15th

632
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,159
the idea being to gain the ability to

633
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,159
identify rare cannabinoids

634
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:23,000
that may refine to cannabinoid and other

635
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,080
receptors because not all

636
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:27,359
phytocannabinoids work through that

637
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:30,119
mechanism

638
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:34,819
um and the idea would be to screen

639
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:34,819
reader submissions for this

640
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:41,939
um this is an animation I'm just going

641
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:43,220
to go through quickly if you look at the

642
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,659
economics

643
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:51,500
THC uh is expected to earn 7 73.6

644
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:57,480
billion dollars by 2027

645
00:31:51,500 --> 00:32:00,419
with CBD uh 9.7 billion by 2025 there

646
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:04,140
are about 10 others that have increasing

647
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:06,600
demand as we've discussed and then over

648
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:08,000
a hundred of others that we have yet to

649
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:10,980
explore

650
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,839
a lot of these are near or below

651
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,200
detection limits with standard

652
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:18,199
instrumentation uh they may come from

653
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,720
rare genetics

654
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:25,380
the mindset has been really occupied

655
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:28,500
with just CBD and 2E THC to the

656
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:34,500
exclusion of others with breeders best

657
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:36,839
the ideas to uh to license and provide

658
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,319
intellectual property protection for

659
00:32:36,839 --> 00:32:42,720
Unique team of ours on help them get

660
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,980
developed

661
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,940
um

662
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:51,778
and this is a way to again to screen for

663
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:54,659
the future of Commerce so it all starts

664
00:32:51,778 --> 00:32:58,558
with the cannabis plant

665
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:01,620
um after a research license uh various

666
00:32:58,558 --> 00:33:03,898
tissues from the plant Not Just Flowers

667
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:06,479
um there's potential for the roots and

668
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:10,678
other parts of the plant so this can be

669
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:13,319
sampled and acid maybe we find a novel

670
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:15,240
cannabinoid and then it's possible to

671
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:16,579
selectively breed to increase its

672
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,380
concentration

673
00:33:16,579 --> 00:33:21,538
producing progeny which can be

674
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:24,059
subsequently studied and go through the

675
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:27,778
process again until you get it to the

676
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:30,079
point where it's economically viable

677
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:33,000
so purification

678
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,759
studying its effects and eventually

679
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:39,960
getting it to humans for new products

680
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:41,759
and medicine and even producing new

681
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:44,579
Industries

682
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:48,200
and hopefully producing a better quality

683
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:53,579
of life for patients and their families

684
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:55,220
and with commercial opportunities

685
00:33:53,579 --> 00:33:58,139
foreign

686
00:33:55,220 --> 00:34:01,019
and I wanted to close with some

687
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,240
discussion of formulation

688
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:04,798
it is very important to know for anybody

689
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,259
who's interested in pharmaceutical

690
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,960
development of cannabinoids that there

691
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:13,440
are certain roles and that is to produce

692
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,119
a Botanical it all has to be from one

693
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,639
species

694
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,838
so it is not a place where you could

695
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:23,240
could combine phytocannab or

696
00:34:20,838 --> 00:34:25,559
cannabinoids from two different

697
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:28,739
biosynthetic sources and put them

698
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:32,219
together without going through programs

699
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:36,838
identifying the toxicity and therapeutic

700
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:39,898
effects of each and that that's not uh a

701
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:44,338
good path towards approval

702
00:34:39,898 --> 00:34:46,739
so it's also true in New York state that

703
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:49,799
any the Cannabis products need to be

704
00:34:46,739 --> 00:34:52,199
cannabis derived so that would mean that

705
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,139
you wouldn't be combining uh

706
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:56,579
cannabinoids with linole from lavender

707
00:34:55,139 --> 00:35:01,680
for example

708
00:34:56,579 --> 00:35:06,059
so the path ahead for True Botanicals is

709
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:09,179
by using all these components from

710
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:11,519
cannabis itself but it doesn't need to

711
00:35:09,179 --> 00:35:15,179
be from the same plant I would point out

712
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:17,639
that satavex is actually a combination

713
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:21,659
of two different chemovars one Ranch in

714
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:25,139
THC one rich in cannabidiol and these

715
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:28,440
are combined and that's been accepted as

716
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:31,078
a unitary formulation by Regulators in

717
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:31,980
30 different countries

718
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,400
um

719
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:39,139
so really I think one of the best paths

720
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:41,519
ahead is creative combinations of

721
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:43,319
phytocannabinoids and terpenoids and

722
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,980
flavonoids as we'll hear more about

723
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,859
later that can be optimized for any

724
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:52,800
particular clinical indication and this

725
00:35:49,858 --> 00:35:56,460
is exactly the approach that we're using

726
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,820
a credoscience in our formulation now

727
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,940
so selective mendelian breeding without

728
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:04,559
genetic modification

729
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:08,220
and the new cannabinoid Discovery

730
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:11,759
program would be the suppliers of the

731
00:36:08,219 --> 00:36:12,358
components or approaches like these

732
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,599
um

733
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:18,539
it is essential as we've heard yesterday

734
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,119
in some of the sessions uh the industry

735
00:36:18,539 --> 00:36:25,500
requires good manufacturing practice

736
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:28,260
standards and the availability of active

737
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:31,619
pharmaceutical ingredients

738
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:35,640
um so the company that is first able to

739
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:38,460
supply API quality phytocannabinoids and

740
00:36:35,639 --> 00:36:40,379
terpenoids derived from Cannabis is

741
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:46,099
going to be in the proverbial driver's

742
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,099
seat for uh future Commerce in this area

743
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,939
so

744
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:54,619
um I hope that a few oxes were oxen were

745
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:58,619
gourd in this but hopefully not fatally

746
00:36:54,619 --> 00:37:00,000
and with that I'm surprised but it looks

747
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:03,920
like we may have a few minutes for

748
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,920
questions so thank you

749
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,660
Bonnie

750
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:34,740
sure so tcv again is a neutral

751
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:36,838
antagonist that's a way at low doses

752
00:37:34,739 --> 00:37:39,118
that's a way of saying it takes up space

753
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:42,059
on the receptor but it'd be different

754
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:44,160
than CBD which isn't actually just

755
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,500
making it a little harder to bind by

756
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,019
changing the confirmation so it's a

757
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:50,880
technical difference

758
00:37:49,019 --> 00:37:53,759
um in this instance I guess you'd say

759
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:57,539
the thcv is taking up space that THC

760
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,820
would normally want now you might think

761
00:37:57,539 --> 00:38:02,639
from that that it's going to really

762
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,460
reduce the clinical efficacy of the THC

763
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:07,319
but that's not what we see clinically

764
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:11,280
because there are a lot of people using

765
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,859
these mixed chemovars that have both and

766
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,980
boy they're usually very happy with how

767
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:20,179
it makes them feel or treating whatever

768
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,179
their condition is

769
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,359
please

770
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:45,779
thank you thank you sorry that what

771
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:49,019
delivery system for thcv has the most

772
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:51,359
efficacy whether it's sublingual edible

773
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:54,358
you know that type of thing

774
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,858
boyet that's hard to say I mean there

775
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,539
really are not a lot of commercial

776
00:38:55,858 --> 00:39:01,139
products

777
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:03,119
um yet available with thcv you know

778
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:05,759
they're always going to be issues of

779
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,119
bioavailability if someone's taking it

780
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,680
orally or advice would be that

781
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:15,480
cannabinoids are better absorbed with

782
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:19,078
food certainly with concomitant fats but

783
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:22,079
again these materials can often have a

784
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,839
certain degree of absorption or a

785
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,339
mucosally sublingually

786
00:39:24,838 --> 00:39:30,838
um

787
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:33,420
yeah topically I don't know about thcv

788
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:36,119
topically but in general the

789
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,280
cannabinoids are great on the skin

790
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:41,519
they're not absorbs the stem

791
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,560
systemically at this point very

792
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:47,159
effectively at all

793
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:49,619
um so there we need more work if you are

794
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:51,960
experimenting in this area it would

795
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:55,039
really encourage you to let people know

796
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:55,039
what you think works

797
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,000
brick and mortar basis two milligrams of

798
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,920
thcv isolate in a dark chocolate is

799
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,719
amazing for Focus I have nursing

800
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,220
students that take it instead of their

801
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:18,179
Adderall

802
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:21,239
I'm sorry 20 milligrams thcv

803
00:40:18,179 --> 00:40:23,460
for Focus two milligrams to five

804
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:26,639
milligrams of isolate for not weight

805
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,059
loss but appetite suppression and it

806
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:32,159
totally works no no that's nice

807
00:40:30,059 --> 00:40:34,320
very good next

808
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:36,000
High Ethan over here

809
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:38,400
thank you for the talk that was

810
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,559
wonderful I'm curious to hear what you

811
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,079
think the priorities are for human

812
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:44,940
clinical research both observational and

813
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:48,599
experimental

814
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:51,480
well big topic that'd be the next hour

815
00:40:48,599 --> 00:40:53,220
well you know I've always said um I

816
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:55,260
think the priority areas that haven't

817
00:40:53,219 --> 00:40:57,959
had the attention they deserve or

818
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:00,960
Obstetrics and Gynecology which has been

819
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:04,079
a forbidden area

820
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,440
um for far too long on the other area of

821
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:10,200
Psychiatry broadly and you know again I

822
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,139
think that just based on the numbers at

823
00:41:10,199 --> 00:41:15,559
the top of the list anxiety treatment we

824
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:19,078
can do so much better than the current

825
00:41:15,559 --> 00:41:21,239
uh dangerous and addictive anti-anxiety

826
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,440
agents so those those are the ones I'd

827
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:25,319
highlight

828
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:28,559
thank you you bet

829
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:33,599
nice presentation and do you think that

830
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:37,559
CBG may be useful to a Gad

831
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:41,059
to to trade which a g a g

832
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:43,858
and E productivity and

833
00:41:41,059 --> 00:41:47,159
ADHD sure thank you

834
00:41:43,858 --> 00:41:49,559
um yeah I mean I think it may be that

835
00:41:47,159 --> 00:41:53,639
wasn't one of the listed ones among the

836
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:57,239
127 patients that we had but certainly

837
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:59,819
anxiety is a big component of ADHD for

838
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:01,858
many children and adults with residual

839
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,720
adhds so I think that there's a good

840
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:06,719
likelihood

841
00:42:03,719 --> 00:42:10,858
um you know we know that THC and low

842
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:13,939
doses Works while CBD can have a role so

843
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:16,500
I I couldn't tell you what the the ideal

844
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,320
combination would be but I think it's a

845
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:21,920
good bet that CBG would be a useful

846
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:21,920
component

847
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,338
oh

848
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:33,420
hi there I was just wondering if you've

849
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:35,880
done any work or your thoughts on the

850
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,700
cannabinoid Quinones and their

851
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,320
therapeutic values for targeted ailments

852
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:43,618
I'm sorry I missed a word the

853
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,619
cannabinoid Queen owns Quinones

854
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:49,500
uh

855
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:52,260
it's a difficult topic for me there I

856
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,699
have a history with this in general the

857
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:56,579
Quinones

858
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:59,159
um is a chemical group

859
00:42:56,579 --> 00:43:01,920
um have certain toxicities I I'd be

860
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:04,858
really hesitant go there

861
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,800
um Again part of this is my bias I think

862
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:11,400
that the the cannabinoids as the plant

863
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:14,220
produces them are plenty adequate and

864
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:16,019
I'm not a fan of semi-synthetics at this

865
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:19,858
point which invariably are going to be

866
00:43:16,019 --> 00:43:22,679
isolets and could not possibly have the

867
00:43:19,858 --> 00:43:25,980
broad range of therapeutic effects that

868
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:29,759
uh properly constituted uh cannabis

869
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:32,480
extract would have so that's my bias

870
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,480
thank you

871
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,940
foreign

872
00:43:38,099 --> 00:43:42,900
thank you so much Dr Russo it's great

873
00:43:40,318 --> 00:43:45,719
presentation and I learned a lot

874
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,358
um in a general question how do you

875
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:51,959
recommend as an expert to speak to other

876
00:43:48,358 --> 00:43:53,519
physician practitioners and providers on

877
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:56,940
the use of medical cannabis when they're

878
00:43:53,519 --> 00:43:59,039
resistant to want to hear about it who

879
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,559
walk out of the room you know obviously

880
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:03,838
those who how do you get caught across

881
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:05,460
to them that this is not a recreational

882
00:44:03,838 --> 00:44:07,078
drug that everybody our patients are

883
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:09,838
just getting high which is a lot of

884
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,240
doctors are and practitioners think is

885
00:44:09,838 --> 00:44:14,578
happening yeah well it's difficult I've

886
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,799
been doing this for 27 years and we've

887
00:44:14,579 --> 00:44:21,380
only made incremental improvements

888
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:25,800
unfortunately on with politicians

889
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:28,920
the sad fact is until they or a family

890
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:31,260
member is has got cancer and needs

891
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,019
cannabis they're rarely going to become

892
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,319
convinced and this is just the story you

893
00:44:34,019 --> 00:44:39,599
see repeatedly or if you have very

894
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,838
sympathetic patients that are able to

895
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,599
connect with a politician one-on-one and

896
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:49,500
bring them on board so it takes

897
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,359
tremendous lobbying effort so anyway it

898
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:54,780
sounds like you're involved in that and

899
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,578
I just encourage you to persist

900
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,319
I'll try and steal the last question

901
00:44:56,579 --> 00:44:59,880
over here I'm very curious about these

902
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:01,980
Femme to molar sensitivity scanning

903
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:04,500
tools you have Ethan can they also find

904
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:05,579
uh or or explore the tryptamine space we

905
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,599
have in the leaves there was some

906
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:08,818
wonderful paper last year about

907
00:45:06,599 --> 00:45:12,359
cyanurenic acid in the leaves yeah I

908
00:45:08,818 --> 00:45:15,739
mean the this technology was borrowed uh

909
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,900
from other areas so this receptor

910
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:23,159
approach to analysis

911
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:27,059
um as could be applied to cannabinoids

912
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:30,899
or anything else on and maybe it's the

913
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:33,420
future of uh exploration for Trace

914
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,838
components in a variety of medicinal

915
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:38,880
plants

916
00:45:35,838 --> 00:45:41,719
I want to have a question about your

917
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:44,460
opinion about covid-19 and cannabis

918
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:47,279
because I have some discussion with

919
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:50,699
mushroom and they take me some idea and

920
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,160
in my practice I see Morocco yeah you

921
00:45:50,699 --> 00:45:55,618
have no covid wouldn't have okay I

922
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:58,500
haven't fixed it out

923
00:45:55,619 --> 00:46:00,960
um I think both Bonnie and Dustin can

924
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,099
give much better answers on this but you

925
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,358
know

926
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:05,460
um

927
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,338
you may hear

928
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:12,720
um of certain cannabis components that

929
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:14,099
will help prevent uh binding of the

930
00:46:12,719 --> 00:46:17,399
virus

931
00:46:14,099 --> 00:46:18,660
um to the receptor so that's one aspect

932
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:21,300
and then

933
00:46:18,659 --> 00:46:24,299
um in terms of long covid there again

934
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:27,300
may be a role but I think we should

935
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:29,519
um I'll confine my answer to that

936
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,680
um there are people that that are in the

937
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:34,079
trenches and and have much more

938
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,779
experience with this I think there's a

939
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:38,760
role but I could not Define it for you

940
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:40,980
at this point

941
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:44,060
so I think that's our time thank you

942
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:44,059
again for your attention
