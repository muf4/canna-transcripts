[Music]

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,839
and one of them being that there's a

3
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:19,600
number of different fluids that can be

4
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,559
tested and I know that your your paper

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,679
kind of looked at this kind of saliva

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:29,358
versus urine versus uh blood so what is

7
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:33,960
sort of the the best one to use so right

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:36,160
now at the side uh what is happens I

9
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,600
know in Canada for sure I I think it's

10
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:41,878
similar in the US is if a a officer is

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,039
suspect somebody of being impaired they

12
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,119
they pull them over and they do a a

13
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,520
standardized field sobriety test which

14
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:51,038
is the you know touching your nose and

15
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:54,039
looking at uh the stigmas and and your

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,800
ability to walk in the one leg stand uh

17
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:57,840
you know your balance and things like

18
00:00:55,799 --> 00:01:00,038
that which we've all seen on TV I'm sure

19
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,519
we're a little bit familiar with what

20
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:04,599
that looks like uh and then they're also

21
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:07,478
able to do at the roadside and I know in

22
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:09,640
Canada we use this it's a saliva test

23
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:11,640
that measures it gives you a reading

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,159
that says positive or negative if you're

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,799
above a certain level or not and then

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,080
there's the blood which they can take

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,400
you back to the lab and they can look at

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:25,560
the blood levels of THC as well then

29
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,478
there's urine of course um which is a

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,320
bit of a different Beast because with

31
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:31,719
urine you're measuring the breakdown

32
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:33,839
products of cannabis you're measuring

33
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,438
what it comes off the Cannabis whereas

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,680
with saliva and blood you're measuring

35
00:01:36,438 --> 00:01:43,039
uh THC uh directly so for that reason

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,360
urine probably isn't a great indicator

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,799
of recent use also as we know the these

38
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:53,078
breakdown products of cannabis of THC

39
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,520
can last in the urine for days weeks

40
00:01:53,078 --> 00:01:58,199
very a very long time so it's not a

41
00:01:55,519 --> 00:02:00,239
great indicator of very recent use it

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,759
just says that somebody has used in the

43
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,438
past few days or potentially longer

44
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,239
whereas Salva tells you more of a short

45
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,318
time window in the past 12 hours and

46
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,400
blood can give you a more definitive

47
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,399
timeline um you know if somebody has

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,080
very high levels of blood THC then you

49
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,239
know they've used fairly recently or

50
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:23,959
smoked fairly recently um and and if

51
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:26,080
they're lower than they would have used

52
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,000
at some point in the past day or so so

53
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:30,519
that's more of an accurate time window

54
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,959
for blood and saliva

55
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,680
right and now is it fairly easy to kind

56
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,598
of look at the concentrations in the

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,080
blood or saliva and sort of Trace

58
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:42,560
backwards how much cannabis the person

59
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,040
could have ingested again I'm I'm sorry

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,959
I'm GNA keep doing this I'm Gonna Keep

61
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:50,039
kind of doing the comparison to alcohol

62
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:53,280
but you know if you're at like a 08 um

63
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:54,560
alcohol level you can kind of kind of go

64
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,479
back and be like okay they've probably

65
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,318
had a few a few drinks at least in the

66
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:01,799
past hour or two can you do a similar

67
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:04,238
thing with cannabis it's really uh to to

68
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:06,200
estimate the last time of use and the

69
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,799
exact amount of use is quite challenging

70
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:12,039
with cannabis because the amount of THC

71
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:15,879
in blood and urine is really dependent

72
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:18,199
on a lot of factors including age sex

73
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,719
how often you use cannabis what form of

74
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,959
cannabis you've used so we know that

75
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:26,199
smoked and Vaped cannabis produce very

76
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:29,039
much higher levels very quickly in Blood

77
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:32,000
and saliva than with uh Edibles for

78
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:34,239
example but Edibles last very a lot

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,598
longer than smoked with smoked or Vaped

80
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:39,438
it's gone in five hours with Edibles

81
00:03:36,598 --> 00:03:41,598
that's much can last much longer so if

82
00:03:39,438 --> 00:03:42,680
somebody comes up with 10 nanograms per

83
00:03:41,598 --> 00:03:45,878
Mill of

84
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:48,080
THC uh it's really hard to know what

85
00:03:45,878 --> 00:03:51,399
kind of cannabis they used and when they

86
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,040
last used it also um people who use

87
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:58,480
frequently the Cannabis might stick

88
00:03:54,039 --> 00:04:00,318
around longer in the blood urine than

89
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,598
people who use infrequent

90
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:04,878
so it's it's it's very it's very

91
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:06,878
challenging but we we can tell you've

92
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:10,239
used recently but we don't know exactly

93
00:04:06,878 --> 00:04:10,239
how much or when that

94
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:25,759
