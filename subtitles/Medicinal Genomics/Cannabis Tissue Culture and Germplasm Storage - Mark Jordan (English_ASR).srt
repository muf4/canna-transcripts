1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,688
how's it going so I'm just gonna kind of

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,459
get straight into this I'm here to talk

3
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,129
to you guys about tissue culture and

4
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,990
what it is how you go about it and just

5
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,880
kind of explain how I got into this

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,359
whole industry it's kind of interesting

7
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:19,320
so to begin tissue culture started about

8
00:00:15,359 --> 00:00:21,989
a hundred years ago and it has

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,670
revolutionized industries the bamboo

10
00:00:21,989 --> 00:00:25,979
industry the banana industry the

11
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,230
pineapple industry back in the day you

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,230
could only take a cutting and get it to

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,670
root and propagate by that method in

14
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,140
this in vitro culture or growing in

15
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,570
non-biological conditions are not normal

16
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,609
biological conditions you can actually

17
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,909
create an environment where the plant

18
00:00:41,609 --> 00:00:47,939
wants to replicate without the need to

19
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:51,299
take all that time of creating a new

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,609
meristem from each clan so what are the

21
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:55,709
uses of tissue culture and cannabis this

22
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:58,378
is where this is a question everybody

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,750
asks me and apart from the things on

24
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,420
this list I just want to kind of touch

25
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,269
on what it actually does on you can

26
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,549
actually get about 20% faster growth or

27
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:11,579
reset the genetics to almost seed rates

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:14,280
by putting plant through tissue culture

29
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,679
that's not every cultivar and a lot of

30
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,978
it is protocol dependent so I can't talk

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,950
for every industry or every on cultivar

32
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:26,099
of cannabis but specific ones I have

33
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:28,320
seen the growth rates exponentially

34
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:30,509
increase by just basically resetting

35
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:33,469
those cuts that are cuts and cuts that

36
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:37,829
have been going on for about 19 20 years

37
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:40,469
which is huge for this industry so why

38
00:01:37,828 --> 00:01:42,269
do we use tissue culture over cuttings

39
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:44,789
or traditional cloning methods those

40
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:46,739
sort of things I guess the biggest one

41
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:48,960
is tissue culture doesn't require

42
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:51,599
maintenance once it's in the to you let

43
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:53,158
it sit there and it grows that means you

44
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,199
don't have to water it you don't have to

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:59,368
look at it every day it just sits there

46
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,170
I've had these cultures stay alive for

47
00:01:59,368 --> 00:02:03,629
up to nine months at a time without

48
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:05,820
having to touch them whatsoever under

49
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:08,340
just normal room temperature conditions

50
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:10,560
and a lot of them will die off by that

51
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,450
point but at the same time it's good to

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,860
know that you can keep them in tubes

53
00:02:12,449 --> 00:02:16,500
it's what the US

54
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,320
a actually uses to hold on to endangered

55
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,969
species or other plantlets that they're

56
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,129
having a hard time propagating I

57
00:02:20,969 --> 00:02:25,109
actually started doing quite a bit of

58
00:02:23,129 --> 00:02:27,389
this at the Denver Botanic Gardens where

59
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,040
I ran their protocol creation lab and I

60
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:32,369
realized while I was doing that my

61
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:34,949
passion lie with cannabis and nobody in

62
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,620
the industry really knew what it was or

63
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:39,719
was talking about it so that's when I

64
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:41,009
started my company min abyss and I've

65
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:43,590
just been going around doing tissue

66
00:02:41,009 --> 00:02:45,179
culture consulting and small-scale lab

67
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:48,330
setup and I can't stress enough

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,040
small-scale lab setup one of the

69
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,140
questions I commonly get asked doing

70
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:53,969
consulting is what's this media made out

71
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:56,099
of and really it's just all the

72
00:02:53,969 --> 00:02:58,439
nutrients vitamins and hormones the

73
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,209
plant needs in order to grow sometimes

74
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,159
you can incorporate antibiotics to

75
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:03,840
prevent pathogens from either

76
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,409
establishing or coming out into the

77
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,500
media or you can add dyes to try and

78
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:13,739
color coat some of your stuff it's all

79
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,719
about growing with an input of sugar

80
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,759
instead of letting the plant

81
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:20,310
photosynthesize the plant grows off the

82
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,959
sugar that's located in the media along

83
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,409
with all the nutrients vitamins and

84
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,180
hormones it would normally need to grow

85
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,889
so how do you know what chemical

86
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:31,019
concentrations of all these things to

87
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,208
add well apart from lots of different

88
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,969
nutrient companies that have developed

89
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:38,039
this stuff there is a media called MS

90
00:03:35,969 --> 00:03:40,530
media it is the standard for every

91
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:42,298
tissue culture protocol pretty much that

92
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,489
I've seen there's a couple modifications

93
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:47,870
for bananas or orchids or things like

94
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:50,909
that but in general this MS media was

95
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,580
developed for tobacco culture and that

96
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:55,739
is key to talk about here because

97
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:58,860
cannabis is not tobacco so when you put

98
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,390
it in this media sometimes these plants

99
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,430
are lacking nitrogen or you're lacking

100
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:05,039
other hormones that you'd expect and

101
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,439
they're just not there and that requires

102
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,989
each individual cultivar to have a

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:11,669
specific protocol made for it

104
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:14,009
I can't stress that enough because in

105
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,978
every other aspect of the horticulture

106
00:04:14,009 --> 00:04:19,500
industry you'll see scutellaria by

107
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:22,019
cleanses and scutellaria orientalis or

108
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,029
different species such as that require

109
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:27,120
different hormone and nutrient blends

110
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:28,918
but most people when we talk about

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,800
mr. tissue culture they want to do a one

112
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:33,899
shoe fits all to it and hope that it

113
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,430
works out with just one protocol and

114
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:36,689
I've seen that too many times where

115
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,639
that's not the case

116
00:04:36,689 --> 00:04:43,620
you'll develop a protocol it works with

117
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:45,360
one species not another so you need to

118
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,430
understand the morphology of your plant

119
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,379
I guess is where the main concept of all

120
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:53,040
this comes in a lot of people define it

121
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:54,719
as sativa indica and I realized quite

122
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
awhile ago those terms were invented in

123
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,970
the 1700s the late 1700s but all the

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,949
same so I've grown plants that have a

125
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,110
more indica leaning leaf structure and a

126
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:06,978
more sativa leaning leaf structure that

127
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:09,060
have the same basic effect and require

128
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:11,509
completely different nutrients and when

129
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,009
I say effect I'm talking about the hobby

130
00:05:11,509 --> 00:05:15,478
the other thing that I did was I tried a

131
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,250
couple different hormone blends that

132
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:19,079
were unconventional and as you can see

133
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:21,899
in some of these pictures here it'll

134
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,198
produce elongated leaves or just weird

135
00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:27,359
genetic issues that are all on

136
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,288
environmental base so it's epigenetic

137
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:33,389
stress changes rather than actual gene

138
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:35,399
changes themselves once you culture that

139
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:37,470
plant again and again it will revert

140
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:40,978
back to the state that it normally was

141
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:42,030
at there are four common stages to

142
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:45,209
tissue culture and I'm just gonna

143
00:05:42,029 --> 00:05:47,009
summarize these because they're in all

144
00:05:45,209 --> 00:05:49,348
the literature essentially on you have

145
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,839
your stage one initiation it takes about

146
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:54,029
two to four we are two weeks for almost

147
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,469
every one of these stages your stage two

148
00:05:54,029 --> 00:05:57,388
which is your multiplication you're

149
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,160
trying to mass your cells stage three

150
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,900
you get the plant to root once the stems

151
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,539
have grown and your cells have masked

152
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:04,859
and then stage for your acclamation

153
00:06:03,538 --> 00:06:07,348
stage where you go and you harden and

154
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,569
off that rooting stage I need to talk

155
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:12,300
about really quickly and I'll get into

156
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:15,000
this as well it's very hard to establish

157
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,879
a set routing protocol for every single

158
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,610
cultivar of cannabis I've read some

159
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,550
literature talking about hops and people

160
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,288
trying to do indirect cell organogenesis

161
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:28,470
where it only works some of the time on

162
00:06:25,288 --> 00:06:30,360
some cultivars but not all and so you

163
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:32,820
run into a lot of problems going down

164
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,620
that path I have found that if you

165
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,810
germinate seeds or quote unquote a

166
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,788
well-designed protocol so straight ms

167
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,110
media takes about eight days to route

168
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,599
and shoot at the same time that can exce

169
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,310
cut down on your propagation time but if

170
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,230
you do it for cuttings you have to

171
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:48,939
develop that individual protocol for

172
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:51,610
that individual species of plant and

173
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:56,589
that is something most people just don't

174
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,840
have so right now I want to get into

175
00:06:56,589 --> 00:07:01,029
stage one that initiation stage because

176
00:06:58,839 --> 00:07:02,799
this is where the magic song basically

177
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:05,109
happens why everybody wants to advertise

178
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,689
tissue culture to you and it's all about

179
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,889
just cleaning the exterior tissue of

180
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:11,259
your plant I'm not talking about

181
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:12,849
endophyte removing or anything else all

182
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:14,589
I'm talking about is taking something

183
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:17,560
like tween 20 which is a non ionic

184
00:07:14,589 --> 00:07:20,409
detergent and adding it with some bleach

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:22,569
to some reverse osmosis water so there's

186
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,140
no minerals in there mixing it up for

187
00:07:22,569 --> 00:07:27,939
about 10 minutes and then transferring

188
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:30,009
everything under your laminar flow hood

189
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:32,350
in order to maintain a sterile

190
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,110
environment that's about it but the key

191
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:38,770
there is maintaining clean tissue from

192
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,660
the start so you got to talk about two

193
00:07:38,769 --> 00:07:42,639
different forms of stage one tissue

194
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:44,140
culture at least in cannabis there's

195
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,360
actually a third that's called callus

196
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:49,419
culture I'm not even gonna go into that

197
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:51,460
because as far as I'm aware very few if

198
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:53,170
anybody has developed a protocol where

199
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:55,719
you can get shoots or indirect

200
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,610
organogenesis so shoots deform from

201
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,770
callus culture we're gonna go on to

202
00:07:57,610 --> 00:08:02,199
meristem culture which is taking a

203
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:07,240
meristem you can see let's see here

204
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:09,339
highlighted in that red bubble here you

205
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:12,160
can see a meristem there's lateral

206
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:14,409
meristems and apical meristems if you

207
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,630
take an apical meristem that tissue can

208
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:19,180
be so new you can actually culture out

209
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:21,430
of viruses yes you can culture out of

210
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,199
viruses that does not guarantee the

211
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,000
virus is going to be eliminated because

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,920
there's a good chance you had human

213
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,579
error and you did not culture out of

214
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,279
that virus so that being said you need

215
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:35,620
to really look at does your plant have

216
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,689
virus in the first place if it doesn't I

217
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,700
would recommend auxilary node culture

218
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,500
it's a hell of a lot easier to do so

219
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:43,390
with auxilary node culture all you do is

220
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,940
you take a cutting where those red lines

221
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:47,230
are and you can just stick it straight

222
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,140
in your media after cleaning the

223
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:51,909
exterior your tissue generally this

224
00:08:50,139 --> 00:08:53,409
works out so that second picture in

225
00:08:51,909 --> 00:08:54,459
there you can actually see shoots

226
00:08:53,409 --> 00:08:56,679
starting to form

227
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:59,200
of the plant and that's actually two

228
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,599
plants out of one that took about a week

229
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,770
to get to that stage another week of

230
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,050
growth and it would have been good

231
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:07,620
enough to cut off of making it so you

232
00:09:05,049 --> 00:09:10,958
can exponentially multiply your cuttings

233
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:13,839
at this point in time you can see the

234
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:15,849
infected path or the plant that was

235
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,180
infected by a pathogen in there and

236
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:20,980
those pathogens can create huge issues

237
00:09:19,179 --> 00:09:23,049
I've heard quite a few presenters here

238
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:25,089
talk about endophytes and that's exactly

239
00:09:23,049 --> 00:09:25,990
what the majority of them are you have

240
00:09:25,089 --> 00:09:28,660
endophytes

241
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,879
or bacteria living inside your cell wall

242
00:09:28,659 --> 00:09:32,528
that pop out into your media about two

243
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,679
weeks after you've cultured

244
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:36,759
that's a huge problem you don't know

245
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:38,859
they're there and I've heard too many

246
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:40,659
growers tell me well my plants are

247
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,610
completely clean and I know exactly

248
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,549
what's in them you go to culture they're

249
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,720
their crop and it's just you'd be amazed

250
00:09:45,549 --> 00:09:48,219
what you see out of there I actually

251
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,379
have some pictures coming up of some of

252
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,509
those things so the stage two is the

253
00:09:50,379 --> 00:09:55,570
multiplication stage I was typically

254
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:58,240
getting a 1 2 3 2 1 to 8 division ratio

255
00:09:55,570 --> 00:10:00,580
per culture every single time I did this

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,100
and that culture media only cost a

257
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:06,250
couple cents apiece so it's virtually

258
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,519
free to do once you set up the lab now

259
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:11,679
you only want to keep a plant in stage 2

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,259
or I guess in culture for no more than

261
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:15,909
five generations at a time if you do

262
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:17,889
more than that you start to get genetic

263
00:10:15,909 --> 00:10:19,990
digression the same way that holding on

264
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:21,689
to a 20 year old cutting would have so

265
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:24,549
just not a good idea

266
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:26,950
stage 2 the multiplication stage has

267
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:29,620
quite a few advantages over just typical

268
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:31,930
cuttings as well you can create bushy

269
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,120
clumpy plants that picture in the center

270
00:10:31,929 --> 00:10:37,088
I actually managed to get 22 cuttings

271
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:40,000
off of that single 25 millimeter culture

272
00:10:37,089 --> 00:10:43,690
that was huge because all of a sudden I

273
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,909
could exponentially manipulate that

274
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:50,410
plant and get a ton of cuttings out of

275
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:53,528
the single plant mass this also poses

276
00:10:50,409 --> 00:10:55,719
another question what else does it do it

277
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:58,149
cuts down on your actual vegetative

278
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,620
growth time so when you already have the

279
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:01,328
structure you're looking for where you

280
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,278
don't have to do that initial peach tree

281
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:05,679
pruning where you get that nice bushy

282
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,360
top canopy that's all evenly consistent

283
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:07,899
and you start off with the plant that

284
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,639
already

285
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:11,439
that structure you can grow your plants

286
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,389
a little bit shorter but they're still

287
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,279
gonna yield the same amount as if you

288
00:11:13,389 --> 00:11:16,600
pop them and top them and top them to

289
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,610
try and get that yield that you were

290
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,850
looking for by growing them out an extra

291
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:24,070
month the third stage here is the

292
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,629
routing stage and this is one of the big

293
00:11:24,070 --> 00:11:27,580
stages that I'm going to touch on here

294
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:29,649
in a little bit as well but it just

295
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,600
depends on your hormone blend on the

296
00:11:29,649 --> 00:11:34,179
temperature fluctuations of your culture

297
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,700
and some of the contamination that might

298
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:39,399
happen with some of these cultures

299
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,170
sometimes you'll have weird contaminants

300
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,179
or endophytes that don't want to come

301
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:45,189
out in the media and once you start

302
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:46,870
rooting you'll actually see some of the

303
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:48,730
roots degrade because they have

304
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:51,159
endophytes that only like living in the

305
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,810
root system I mean it makes sense plants

306
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,480
are like icebergs they have more mass on

307
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:57,549
the bottom a good majority of the time

308
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,850
so one of the keys I want to stress here

309
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:04,449
is stage 3 has the potential to ship

310
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:06,310
plants in the dark I did a small-scale

311
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,190
trial on this where I did no more than

312
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:11,049
24 plants and I rooted them in the dark

313
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:13,480
that first picture is how I got the idea

314
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:16,149
I had cut a plant down this is cannabis

315
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,800
and I had stuck it in a 55-gallon trash

316
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:20,980
bag and forgotten about it for a little

317
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:22,990
over a week week later I just wanted to

318
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,720
check see if it had started molding or

319
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,060
whatnot open it up and there were roots

320
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:29,769
all over the lower part of the plant

321
00:12:28,059 --> 00:12:31,449
right where the callus or the

322
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:33,159
undifferentiated cells really would have

323
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:35,379
appeared you can start to see those

324
00:12:33,159 --> 00:12:38,199
white little dots those are all root

325
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:40,059
starts and so I gave it a shot in tissue

326
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,509
culture why not try it and beat you if

327
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:47,469
it works ex vitro and the results I got

328
00:12:43,509 --> 00:12:49,480
were varied every plant rooted yes but

329
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:51,250
if you look at that picture the top of

330
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,440
the plant didn't always look completely

331
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:55,089
healthy and that could be due to a lot

332
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,950
of different things chances are it

333
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:59,709
wasn't developing some sort of hormone

334
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,450
and you need to develop a protocol for

335
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,879
that particular cultivar that would fix

336
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,580
that issue in my case I was just seeing

337
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:09,700
binary a or B do they root or not and

338
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,860
turns out they do which was huge for a

339
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:15,360
lot of the future potential in this

340
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:17,950
industry now I also want to advertise

341
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,079
the roots are not going all straight

342
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:20,649
down some go completely straight out and

343
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:22,118
I

344
00:13:20,649 --> 00:13:24,399
know what causes that I didn't look

345
00:13:22,119 --> 00:13:25,240
enough into it just thrown that out as

346
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,869
food for thought

347
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:31,360
not necessarily perfect root systems

348
00:13:27,869 --> 00:13:32,740
stage for the acclamation stage this is

349
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,389
one that a lot of people are struggling

350
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,980
with so I'll touch base on it really

351
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:38,079
quick and get back into it later

352
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:40,420
Stage four you're just getting plants

353
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:42,789
into the greenhouse that's about it so

354
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:44,409
once they're there they develop a nice

355
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,349
healthy root system and as long as you

356
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:49,240
don't add more inoculants and create

357
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:53,350
issues within the plant itself they tend

358
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,459
to remain fairly healthy now at times if

359
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,889
you look at the bottom right picture

360
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:59,438
here you'll actually see some of the

361
00:13:56,889 --> 00:14:01,419
plant tissue is deformed or the

362
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:03,490
morphology of it was not correct

363
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:05,919
that means my initial hormone blend when

364
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:07,899
I was culturing that plant was not what

365
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:09,818
it should have actually been you'll see

366
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,100
different serration issues and things

367
00:14:09,818 --> 00:14:13,479
like that and within about two weeks of

368
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,009
pulling it out of the tube it'll revert

369
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,839
back to its normal state you won't even

370
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:18,428
know it was there but it is good to

371
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,170
mention that those type of things can

372
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:25,808
happen coming out of in vitro culture

373
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:27,519
the hardening stage is fairly simple but

374
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:28,838
I've seen a lot of people struggle with

375
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,549
it and it's just a matter of removing

376
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,889
the humidity over the course of a week

377
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:34,328
so what you see here is just a soup food

378
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,730
container nothing insane

379
00:14:34,328 --> 00:14:38,888
where I just shoved a Grodin Rockwell

380
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:41,470
cube with a plant inside of it and

381
00:14:38,889 --> 00:14:43,198
slowly over the course of about a week I

382
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:46,569
let it harden off and it worked great

383
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:49,299
now I should mention as I was pulling

384
00:14:46,568 --> 00:14:51,068
some of these plants out of culture the

385
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:52,599
roots would snap off if I accidentally

386
00:14:51,068 --> 00:14:55,299
touched them or i brushed them against

387
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:57,399
something so they are extremely fragile

388
00:14:55,299 --> 00:14:59,438
at this state they've been growing in

389
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,659
basically a jello substance the entire

390
00:14:59,438 --> 00:15:02,860
time at that point you know you can pull

391
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:04,509
it out you can wiggle it around they

392
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,220
might not break off but you go flicking

393
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:07,928
those or tapping them there's a good

394
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:10,019
chance the plants are not accustomed to

395
00:15:07,928 --> 00:15:13,028
that they haven't developed the

396
00:15:10,019 --> 00:15:15,490
the resistance in the structure to

397
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:17,019
really be able to move around that much

398
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,730
they were never agitated in the

399
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,948
beginning there was no wind in the tube

400
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:24,039
don't expect there to be win the second

401
00:15:20,948 --> 00:15:25,808
you take them out so the four main

402
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:29,668
problems with tissue culture and this is

403
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:33,308
the biggest stress I have here is

404
00:15:29,668 --> 00:15:35,948
improper hormone creations endophytes

405
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:38,798
the routing stage in the acclamation

406
00:15:35,948 --> 00:15:41,889
stage so the endophyte there I'm sorry

407
00:15:38,798 --> 00:15:43,598
the improper hormones every time I have

408
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:45,908
looked and read a research article

409
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:49,599
online about cannabis tissue culture

410
00:15:45,908 --> 00:15:52,119
I see pdz as the main ingredient so we

411
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:54,220
got to talk about tdz here it's actually

412
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:57,220
an herbicide that is a plant growth

413
00:15:54,220 --> 00:16:00,729
regulator and it causes the leaves to

414
00:15:57,220 --> 00:16:02,109
lose weight but not fall off so as you

415
00:16:00,729 --> 00:16:04,028
can see in some of these pictures this

416
00:16:02,109 --> 00:16:05,528
was the sum of the first tissue culture

417
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:07,778
I had done just trialing some of these

418
00:16:05,528 --> 00:16:10,058
protocols the leaves are on there

419
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:12,129
they're a lot smaller they're yellowing

420
00:16:10,058 --> 00:16:14,499
and they don't look healthy I do not

421
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:16,569
recommend using tdz as a starting point

422
00:16:14,499 --> 00:16:19,119
or any other point for cannabis tissue

423
00:16:16,568 --> 00:16:21,068
culture that's just a huge no-no in my

424
00:16:19,119 --> 00:16:23,048
book and I've never found one plant

425
00:16:21,068 --> 00:16:27,478
species that works with that cannabis

426
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:31,178
wise so using better auxins cytokinins

427
00:16:27,479 --> 00:16:32,799
combinations is a much better idea Mehta

428
00:16:31,178 --> 00:16:35,678
toplin is the one I would recommend

429
00:16:32,798 --> 00:16:39,519
people start with if you use meta toplin

430
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:42,158
you get a pretty good growth but it

431
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:44,078
doesn't always a root or it can have

432
00:16:42,158 --> 00:16:45,639
other issues it's just a good starting

433
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:47,948
point I also included a lot of other

434
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,808
cytokinins in this slide so if anybody

435
00:16:47,948 --> 00:16:52,599
wants to experiment try some of those

436
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:54,969
out your chances of success will go up

437
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:57,609
you also need to know that auxins in

438
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:01,778
coordination or in ratio with those

439
00:16:57,609 --> 00:17:02,979
cytokinins make a huge difference in doe

440
00:17:01,778 --> 00:17:05,259
fights are the second point here

441
00:17:02,979 --> 00:17:07,899
endophytes I drew a nice little pretty

442
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:09,578
picture live inside the cell walls as

443
00:17:07,898 --> 00:17:11,138
indicated by the blue lines and you'll

444
00:17:09,578 --> 00:17:13,000
actually see them pop out in the media

445
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:17,349
about two weeks after you culture the

446
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:20,378
plan this is so problematic I can't even

447
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:22,298
explain how many times I've heard people

448
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:24,458
fail at tissue culture and stop their

449
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:27,638
lab because they literally don't know

450
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:30,519
what happened so here's the problem

451
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:32,829
endophytes can be toxic or novel so

452
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:34,538
beneficial those inoculants that we've

453
00:17:32,829 --> 00:17:36,638
all talked about adding to our plants

454
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:39,099
that are very beneficial might not

455
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:40,808
culture all so well that's just a

456
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,859
consideration it doesn't mean don't use

457
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:42,529
them or anything like that

458
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:44,329
just

459
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,369
be aware of what you're actually adding

460
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:48,589
to your plant and if it's likely to pop

461
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:50,209
out in media if you're trying to get

462
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:54,019
somebody to tissue culture your plant or

463
00:17:50,210 --> 00:17:55,670
your tissue culturing yourself so here's

464
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:58,309
a couple more pathogen pictures because

465
00:17:55,670 --> 00:18:00,230
I just couldn't believe I had over 20

466
00:17:58,309 --> 00:18:02,179
and I tried to fit as many as I could in

467
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,430
just a single slide to show you they're

468
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:05,990
all over the spectrum and rather than

469
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,900
going through and trying to identify all

470
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:10,880
these I decided it would be a wiser use

471
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,720
of my time to figure out how to get rid

472
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,610
of them so what I did was I noticed we

473
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:19,460
were using inoculants that had endo

474
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:21,289
FIDIC properties such as the bacillus

475
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:23,329
what I ended up doing was to get rid of

476
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:24,470
them I watered with hydrogen peroxide at

477
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,839
about a three to five percent

478
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:29,029
concentration every day while adding in

479
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:31,970
my nutrients to my water over the course

480
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:33,649
of about three weeks I actually was able

481
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,539
to recover some of these plants to the

482
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:38,150
point where the pathogen slowed down or

483
00:18:35,539 --> 00:18:40,309
the endophyte slowed down inside the

484
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:42,950
plant tissue itself and you were able to

485
00:18:40,309 --> 00:18:43,879
get a couple clean in vitro cultures and

486
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,470
that was huge

487
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:49,730
maybe not all of them but some of them

488
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:52,250
would take so if you look at common

489
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,900
stage 3 routing problems one of the

490
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,769
biggest ones I ran into at first was I

491
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:59,720
was using t5 lights those small little

492
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:02,029
bulbs essentially and my temperature

493
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,589
fluctuations would change more than 10

494
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:06,039
degrees sometimes up to 20 degrees

495
00:19:03,589 --> 00:19:08,689
between day and nighttime temperatures I

496
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:10,399
realized very quickly that was one of

497
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:13,340
the biggest limiting factors and

498
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,580
switched to complete LED lights for my

499
00:19:13,339 --> 00:19:19,039
tissue culture it almost overnight fixed

500
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:20,869
my problem all of them which I couldn't

501
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,230
believe just the temperature fluctuation

502
00:19:20,869 --> 00:19:26,329
alone potentially some of the light

503
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:28,160
created some of that and so what I try

504
00:19:26,329 --> 00:19:30,109
to tell people when they're trying to

505
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:33,050
create some of these hormone blends or

506
00:19:30,109 --> 00:19:35,389
whatnot is look at the compounds or the

507
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,819
bottles that you've used as brooding

508
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,259
hormones for the rest of your cannabis

509
00:19:37,819 --> 00:19:41,509
grow I mean people have been doing this

510
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:43,940
for years why not pay attention to the

511
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:46,519
iba concentrations on the back of clone

512
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:47,840
X or Hortis or hor max if you start

513
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,450
looking at those and you actually

514
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,250
utilize those ratios and some of the

515
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,930
additives they're putting in you're

516
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,119
gonna be a lot more successful at

517
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:58,490
rooting your culture in vitro

518
00:19:56,119 --> 00:20:01,309
I do also need to mention the previous

519
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:04,250
media plays a big impact or has a big

520
00:20:01,309 --> 00:20:06,409
role in your actual next successive

521
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:08,690
stage if you have too much cytokine and

522
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:10,940
build up from stage 2 or multiplication

523
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:12,500
media your stage 3 media will have

524
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:15,920
residual and you're gonna form more

525
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:18,789
callous than you will roots ask me why

526
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,920
don't really know but that was just a

527
00:20:18,789 --> 00:20:24,399
something that I saw along with nonpolar

528
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:27,440
auxins so I've seen a lot of people that

529
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,000
decided I'm gonna try and make callus

530
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,330
culture and do indirect organogenesis

531
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,940
for my first generation they make their

532
00:20:32,329 --> 00:20:36,439
plant they put it through callus and

533
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:39,799
they might get a little more too much

534
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:41,870
callus on there at that point they used

535
00:20:39,799 --> 00:20:43,519
a non polar oxen if you look at that top

536
00:20:41,869 --> 00:20:45,589
right picture you're gonna see the plant

537
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,089
is growing upside down the roots are at

538
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:49,459
the top and the shoots are at the bottom

539
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,619
that's one of those things that most

540
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,269
people are not aware of and so they

541
00:20:51,619 --> 00:20:54,709
don't really think about well I need to

542
00:20:53,269 --> 00:20:58,190
use polar auxins when I'm trying to

543
00:20:54,710 --> 00:21:00,380
route things the last one that I really

544
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,570
have noticed is stage 4 problems or

545
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,850
acclimation problems where the grower

546
00:21:02,569 --> 00:21:06,500
will actually pull their plant out of

547
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:08,000
the test tube and just expect well it

548
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,950
has shoots and it has roots why can't I

549
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,269
treat it like a cutting well these

550
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:13,309
things have been under a hundred percent

551
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:14,690
humidity there's no reason that you

552
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:16,789
should expect to treat that like a

553
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:18,350
cutting you have to harden it off like a

554
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:20,480
cutting treat it like a non rooted

555
00:21:18,349 --> 00:21:22,159
cutting maybe but not one that you can

556
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,200
just plop out of a tube and stick it

557
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:26,210
straight in a greenhouse I get the

558
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:28,490
question a lot how long does this take

559
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,769
generally the acclamation stage is that

560
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:33,109
two-week period sometimes it can go as

561
00:21:30,769 --> 00:21:34,879
high as three but once you start to kind

562
00:21:33,109 --> 00:21:36,679
of see the roots grow you know the

563
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,680
plants are a lot more hardened off and

564
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:41,690
generally you can plant it at that point

565
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:43,519
germplasm conservation is one of those

566
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:45,289
things that a lot of people have a lot

567
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:47,690
of interest in in this industry and

568
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,299
there's a lot of factors that go along

569
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:52,070
with this you can put a plant in test

570
00:21:50,299 --> 00:21:53,750
tubes to get in a refrigerator and it

571
00:21:52,069 --> 00:21:55,639
slows down the digression of your media

572
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,779
in which case your plant can live a

573
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,190
little bit longer so when you start

574
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:03,019
refrigerating your plants there are a

575
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:04,519
couple basic rules I've kind of learned

576
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:07,369
from literature and other things that

577
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:09,470
you need to pay attention to do not go

578
00:22:07,369 --> 00:22:11,599
lower than 40 degrees on your plant

579
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,759
you're essentially starting to freeze it

580
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:17,058
and you'll get a lot more cell death and

581
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:19,429
I should also mention that your

582
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:21,619
contamination although slowed down can

583
00:22:19,429 --> 00:22:24,830
still be there in a refrigerator I've

584
00:22:21,619 --> 00:22:28,369
stored test tubes for a long period of

585
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:30,558
time in a refrigerated condition and oh

586
00:22:28,369 --> 00:22:31,939
when I pop them out three or four months

587
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:34,099
later I can have a world of

588
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:36,019
contamination if I didn't keep that

589
00:22:34,099 --> 00:22:37,759
refrigerator sterile in some way or

590
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,490
another I didn't keep the room it was in

591
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:42,769
sterile so it's very good to note you

592
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,259
need to do this in a pretty clean

593
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:47,960
I'd recommend ISO five standard lab or

594
00:22:45,259 --> 00:22:49,369
better the other one that a lot of

595
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:51,288
people ask is can you freeze these

596
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,689
cultures cryopreserve on that sort of

597
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:56,329
stuff I have actually never personally

598
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:58,669
tried cryo preserving cannabis tissue

599
00:22:56,329 --> 00:23:00,678
culture but what I have found in all the

600
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:02,450
literature is there's all sorts of

601
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,580
issues with either freezing or thawing

602
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:06,710
that causes the vacuoles to burst and

603
00:23:04,579 --> 00:23:09,470
that causes a lot more problems in the

604
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,329
long term for even trying this out so

605
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:13,839
whenever I'm starting somebody out in a

606
00:23:11,329 --> 00:23:16,069
lab or whatnot I just recommend they go

607
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:17,990
room temperature no more than

608
00:23:16,069 --> 00:23:20,119
refrigerator and just work with that

609
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,339
develop their protocols before they try

610
00:23:20,119 --> 00:23:23,709
and do long-term storage or commercial

611
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:26,000
propagation or anything like that

612
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:27,890
because in the end you're just gonna be

613
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,319
dumping like ton of money into these

614
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:32,570
labs without actually knowing how to

615
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:35,509
keep the plant alive in them and why

616
00:23:32,569 --> 00:23:38,480
waste your money plant breeding was

617
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:39,859
another aspect of cannabis tissue

618
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:41,960
culture that a lot of people have had

619
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:44,209
interest in so kind of touch briefly on

620
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:47,179
it and that's you can germinate plants

621
00:23:44,210 --> 00:23:49,130
in vitro so inside the test tube takes

622
00:23:47,179 --> 00:23:50,269
about eight days for them to get to

623
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,659
about the point of the middle picture

624
00:23:50,269 --> 00:23:56,569
and you can screen them for pathogens so

625
00:23:53,659 --> 00:23:59,570
medicinal genomics I know has a female

626
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,740
male indicator for sex testing and what

627
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:02,899
I found was if I grow them in a

628
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,730
test-tube I could pop open the lid take

629
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,429
a little bit of tissue sample run it

630
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:10,579
through PCR and extract the DNA and be

631
00:24:07,429 --> 00:24:12,110
able to see is it male or female since

632
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:13,879
it does not detect him Aphrodite's it

633
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:16,548
was a you know somewhat biased test but

634
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:18,890
at the same time male or female for

635
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:20,869
those for the sexes of that seedling

636
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,670
that allowed you to separate the

637
00:24:20,869 --> 00:24:25,250
seedlings out in your room

638
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:27,019
and you could then grow all female or

639
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:29,839
produce a much higher quality breeding

640
00:24:27,019 --> 00:24:33,139
program the other one is green pod

641
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:35,629
sowing where you can actually pollinate

642
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:37,820
a female plant and wait a week until the

643
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,530
seed starts to develop the embryo

644
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:41,750
develops first and in the seed coat

645
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:43,609
develops around the embryo when you pull

646
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:45,349
the seed early and the embryo is

647
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:48,199
developed you can actually put that in

648
00:24:45,349 --> 00:24:49,879
culture and grow it out and you can cut

649
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:51,860
months off your breeding cycles every

650
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,900
generation because you're not waiting

651
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:55,579
for a seed coat to develop with all the

652
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,200
nutrients hormones and vitamins the

653
00:24:55,579 --> 00:25:01,879
plant needs in order to grow and keep it

654
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,259
alive within the seed coat itself so the

655
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,570
big one that I'm going to talk about is

656
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:08,480
a cost-benefit analysis of tissue

657
00:25:05,569 --> 00:25:11,029
culture and I have a couple different

658
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,000
labs that I've set up and I try and do

659
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:15,920
you know all the way from small scale to

660
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,960
medium scale I try to avoid the large

661
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:20,300
scale propagation currently because I

662
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,640
don't know anybody that has a completed

663
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:24,859
protocol that can get any strain you

664
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,540
want or any cultivar you want through

665
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:28,699
the entire process from start to finish

666
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,680
without a hitch and when people are

667
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:32,779
asking about times how long can I get a

668
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,060
return on my investment those sort of

669
00:25:32,779 --> 00:25:37,039
deals when you start to get these

670
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:39,200
numbers and throw them out there you

671
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:42,019
don't want to give a false impression of

672
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:44,120
what you're actually providing so what I

673
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:47,389
would recommend is go with the

674
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:50,029
essentially 35 to $40,000 lab if you

675
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:52,970
really want to start and figure out what

676
00:25:50,029 --> 00:25:54,980
protocols you need to make or how to go

677
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:56,420
about making them you can always go a

678
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,789
little bit cheaper if you need to but

679
00:25:56,420 --> 00:26:01,240
that $40,000 range allows you to get a

680
00:25:58,789 --> 00:26:03,460
good hood a good autoclave and really

681
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,829
put your plants through culture

682
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:08,930
efficiently and successfully well having

683
00:26:06,829 --> 00:26:11,299
the ability to trial some other media's

684
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:13,220
and some other hormones just to make

685
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:16,399
sure you're not basically shooting

686
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,009
yourself in the foot that being said if

687
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,570
you go more expensive labs you are still

688
00:26:19,009 --> 00:26:22,640
able to do in-house breeding techniques

689
00:26:20,569 --> 00:26:24,439
you're still able to do production and

690
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,870
all that and if you start at the low

691
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,720
scale your equipment does not become

692
00:26:26,869 --> 00:26:31,429
senile or obsolete over time you can

693
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,170
still use the old hood and the old

694
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:35,180
autoclave as you're expanding to a

695
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:35,690
bigger lab to get the results that you

696
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,810
really look

697
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:40,490
for so with that being said I have a

698
00:26:38,809 --> 00:26:42,769
couple more minutes here and I'm just

699
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,490
curious on if anybody has questions I'd

700
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:45,490
love to take some

701
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:53,220
[Applause]

702
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:04,349
you mentioned the endo pathogens you're

703
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:07,200
seeing in the system that contaminate

704
00:27:04,349 --> 00:27:10,168
the tissue culture are those plant

705
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:13,590
pathogens that will eventually be

706
00:27:10,169 --> 00:27:16,350
reflected in the plant or are those just

707
00:27:13,589 --> 00:27:18,359
a problem in this issue culture so those

708
00:27:16,349 --> 00:27:20,269
are a pathogen that you will see

709
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:22,409
eventually reflected in the plant and

710
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:25,980
sometimes they are beneficial and

711
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,990
sometimes they are toxic so if they're

712
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:30,298
present it makes your tissue culture

713
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,910
process much more complicated and much

714
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:35,190
harder initially there in the plant when

715
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:38,070
you took the culture when you took the

716
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,350
explant so when it was before in vitro

717
00:27:38,069 --> 00:27:44,659
before stage one you have the plant to

718
00:27:40,349 --> 00:27:47,099
grow and that pathogen is present by

719
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:49,140
cutting it out and putting it in a tube

720
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:51,959
you're just showing that it's there

721
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,660
rather than eliminating it altogether

722
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,910
there are methods of eliminating using

723
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,710
antibiotics or other things but those

724
00:27:56,910 --> 00:28:01,230
are all protocols that still have to be

725
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:04,470
developed for cannabis specifically okay

726
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:06,569
one quick follow-up to that I'm sure not

727
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:08,850
in your tissue culture our operations

728
00:28:06,569 --> 00:28:11,418
but in general in the industry are there

729
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:15,000
certain pathogens that are appearing in

730
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:18,570
in product put out by the current

731
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,640
nursery practices I don't I can't speak

732
00:28:18,569 --> 00:28:22,859
for tissue culture being put out per se

733
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,679
but I do know there are quite a few

734
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:27,359
present Fusarium is one among them I've

735
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,940
actually cultured that out myself and

736
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,219
looked for that I've also heard

737
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:34,500
confirmation of other growers finding

738
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:38,610
Fusarium in their plants different

739
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,619
species of bacillus I think by Kafra is

740
00:28:38,609 --> 00:28:42,389
a pretty big one as well and those are

741
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:43,678
all the know all that I know off the top

742
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:49,169
of my head but I'm sure there's a

743
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:51,630
plethora of them thank you well can you

744
00:28:49,169 --> 00:28:54,419
comment on the addition of beneficial

745
00:28:51,630 --> 00:29:01,160
symbionts at any of the stage Michael

746
00:28:54,419 --> 00:29:01,160
Rizzi funghi that kind of those kind of

747
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:08,369
microbial additions yeah sure so every

748
00:29:05,849 --> 00:29:09,899
time that I have gone to I I should

749
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:12,349
mention I've worked in a bacterial

750
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:14,680
culture lab and when I did

751
00:29:12,349 --> 00:29:17,149
we had to make specific media and

752
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,860
antibiotics to make it so other bacteria

753
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:20,780
didn't grow in there when you're making

754
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,759
tissue culture media there's no

755
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:25,039
antibiotics you're basically creating a

756
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:28,009
cocktail that everything loves to grow

757
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:30,109
in including fungus and bacteria so

758
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:32,299
you're perpetuating the problem if you

759
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:36,319
add those inoculants right before you

760
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:38,899
take the culture itself so is there an

761
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:40,849
optimal stage like at your routing stage

762
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,620
or whatever that you can add it before

763
00:29:40,849 --> 00:29:45,109
you you actually go ahead and route in

764
00:29:42,619 --> 00:29:47,959
matrix and soil you cannot you have to

765
00:29:45,109 --> 00:29:50,299
add them in your soil itself because

766
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:52,039
under in vitro conditions that media

767
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:54,710
will grow whatever you're trying to add

768
00:29:52,039 --> 00:29:56,720
and take over the plan so it is not

769
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,779
really a tissue culture solution it's a

770
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,180
matrix it's a post plant a post

771
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:04,990
routing in the matrix solution as you're

772
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,990
saying yeah exactly

773
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:14,240
hey fantastic fantastic talk how are you

774
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:16,699
determining whether the viruses are are

775
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:20,150
there or not is this just a visual

776
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:23,410
detection and then with respect to the

777
00:30:20,150 --> 00:30:26,570
slide that you had with which I love the

778
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:30,560
yeah your your cost-benefit analysis

779
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:34,579
there is the automated step

780
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:38,149
I assume that liquid handling or sample

781
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:40,759
prep is a big part of that protocol

782
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:43,820
can you speak to any software that

783
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:46,789
you've seen or systems that are being

784
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:48,589
used in a high-throughput way to do some

785
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:52,909
of that method development and protocol

786
00:30:48,589 --> 00:30:54,500
work actually yes I have so I found it

787
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:56,330
on a YouTube video actually that's

788
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,940
pretty readily available if anybody

789
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:01,269
wants to look for it of a couple very

790
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,890
large scale production labs that have

791
00:31:01,269 --> 00:31:06,619
automated media pouring techniques that

792
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:10,000
they do and so it'll pre make the media

793
00:31:06,619 --> 00:31:13,939
in the autoclave and then pipe it as a

794
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,549
flat moves along basically a line and

795
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:18,710
that flat fills every single tube and

796
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:20,329
all of a sudden you don't have anybody

797
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,980
filling tubes you have people picking

798
00:31:20,329 --> 00:31:24,490
them up setting them on the rack and

799
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,559
pulling them off the rack prefilled

800
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:28,630
and then would you repeat your other

801
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:34,509
question please yeah so you mentioned

802
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:37,300
that your you found disease I'm sorry

803
00:31:34,509 --> 00:31:39,190
the viruses when you've Ivan identified

804
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:41,500
these viruses I'm wondering is this

805
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:47,950
visual detection or are you actually

806
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:49,420
doing some kind of validated so there's

807
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,710
a couple different techniques you can

808
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,440
actually use the first one would be

809
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:55,299
visual identification but there are

810
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:57,820
strips that you can actually use to tell

811
00:31:55,299 --> 00:31:59,440
are there viruses in those plants and

812
00:31:57,819 --> 00:32:00,609
they have a ninety-nine point eight

813
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,920
percent accuracy

814
00:32:00,609 --> 00:32:04,689
I've trialed some of those and confirmed

815
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:07,029
there was no virus in the first place

816
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:08,830
so it could just be you thought that it

817
00:32:07,029 --> 00:32:11,259
looked like that sometimes because those

818
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:13,329
strips are so specific you actually need

819
00:32:11,259 --> 00:32:16,599
to take it to a commercial virus testing

820
00:32:13,329 --> 00:32:18,490
laboratory and have them run an analysis

821
00:32:16,599 --> 00:32:21,159
to see is there a virus in there and

822
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:23,559
they can only test for things that there

823
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:25,120
that they think might be in there a lot

824
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,829
of those virus testing laboratories

825
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,879
again I used to work for something like

826
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:32,949
that are not able to figure out random

827
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,010
viruses or things that they don't know

828
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:39,850
what to look for so I guess the short

829
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:41,410
answer to that is yes you can visually

830
00:32:39,849 --> 00:32:42,639
try and detect and identify and

831
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:44,920
sometimes that'll work

832
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,870
but I always recommend getting a third

833
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:50,140
party lab to really make sure that your

834
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:51,759
culture is in fact virus free and if

835
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:53,590
you're gonna try and do it in-house at

836
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:55,509
least use a strip test they cost a

837
00:32:53,589 --> 00:32:57,069
couple bucks apiece make sure you don't

838
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:59,619
have a virus in your plant tissue before

839
00:32:57,069 --> 00:33:01,929
you go selling it well I there's

840
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,750
obviously controversy is over whether

841
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,759
some viruses are systemic and whether

842
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:09,849
you can get rid of them so you know I

843
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:12,490
think it can be a touchy issue as when

844
00:33:09,849 --> 00:33:15,929
you're saying that tissue culture can

845
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,930
completely remediates

846
00:33:16,289 --> 00:33:22,690
similar to the problem of the

847
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,569
variability within you know these chemo

848
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:28,390
bars that your your your culturing

849
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:30,899
you're going to see probably some some

850
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:33,400
phenotypical differences there as well

851
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,350
yeah I would completely agree with that

852
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,210
actually and even when you go to take

853
00:33:35,349 --> 00:33:39,158
your meristem culture

854
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,630
times if you take too much tissue you

855
00:33:39,159 --> 00:33:43,480
still haven't cultured out of the virus

856
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:46,028
so it's very important to know using

857
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:47,890
either strip test or third-party labs

858
00:33:46,028 --> 00:33:50,558
that you did in fact culture out of that

859
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:54,899
and not just relying on your eyes to you

860
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:54,898
know tell you yeah thanks so much

861
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:02,680
