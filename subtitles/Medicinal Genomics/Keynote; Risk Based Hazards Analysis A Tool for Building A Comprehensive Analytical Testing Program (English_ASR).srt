1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:08,400
good morning everyone and thank you for

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,759
coming at 8 30 in the morning to listen

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
to

4
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,599
some

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,440
really um well we'll dive into some

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,359
hazards analysis

7
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:20,559
later on today and

8
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:23,359
first of all thank you to the organizers

9
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:24,879
of canmed for inviting me and giving me

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,560
this chance to

11
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,879
talk about

12
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:31,118
some contaminants and

13
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:32,238
how we approach contaminants in in

14
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:33,200
cannabis

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,759
so

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,960
my talk today is going to be about um a

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:41,519
hazardous based analysis um for building

18
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,039
an and comprehensive analytical testing

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:47,120
program

20
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:48,878
so i've been i've spent most of my life

21
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,558
in the analytical world

22
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:52,878
in the food industry

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,039
and i've

24
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:57,280
for close to 30 years now

25
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,439
working with pesticides and other

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,640
contaminants or things that you don't

27
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,878
want in

28
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,719
in in your food or any product that you

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,759
consume or you use

30
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:09,118
for

31
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,320
on yourself but um and so i've

32
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,840
i've often been called the past lady

33
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:16,399
because that's what i

34
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,719
i focus a lot on pesticides i can

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,960
remember the names of pesticides and

36
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:23,359
at times when i forget the names of my

37
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,359
children

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,239
that's how much i work on pesticides

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,880
but um so and currently i am with um i

40
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,239
work with for europeans

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:40,399
and um i know if many of you familiar

42
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:42,000
with your fins we're a

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,920
global

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,879
network of laboratories we have about

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
800 laboratories across the globe and i

46
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,118
promise that's the only pitch i have for

47
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:55,680
for your offense and

48
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:57,680
so let's move on so today like

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
we said we're going to be talking about

50
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,719
hazards analysis

51
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,640
and

52
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:04,078
the background for this i kind of

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,118
borrowed it from my background in the

54
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,478
food industry and in 2011 the food

55
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,360
safety modernization act was signed

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,470
and

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,640
usually when we talk about

58
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:17,439
[Music]

59
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,359
health and safety we focus on

60
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,318
the microbial risks

61
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,360
because the effects are immediate and

62
00:02:22,318 --> 00:02:27,199
contaminants and chemical hazards are

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,599
are usually forgotten

64
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:32,799
but they are important for the product

65
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:35,839
for safety and quality of of products

66
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,239
and in 2011

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,560
food safety modernization act fesma

68
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
included contaminants specifically

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,959
chemical hazards and added that

70
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,479
requirement for the food industry in

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,519
general

72
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:49,518
and

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,719
they required a risk-based hazard

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,800
analysis

75
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:54,318
so and in addition to that the

76
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,160
verification of ingredients and

77
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,479
suppliers and the development of

78
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,400
specifications which is usually a

79
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,639
challenge when you are when you have a

80
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,439
product and you have various ingredients

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,799
in the product you um

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:11,199
you want to know what you want in it

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
but the challenge is sometimes

84
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:15,759
what we don't want in it that could

85
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:18,000
affect the safety and not only sometimes

86
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:19,280
and more importantly the safety but also

87
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
your

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,759
the value of your business the marketing

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,759
value of your business

90
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:31,120
if you guys remember a while back dr oz

91
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,840
and heavy metals in apple juice so they

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,599
wanted us to label our apple juice us

93
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,519
with a sign that

94
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,359
this could be carcinogenic

95
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,200
so um which is

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,040
who would want to drink apple juice that

97
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,399
says this could potentially expose you

98
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:47,679
to cancer

99
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:51,120
and so borrowing that um the background

100
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,840
for this is um the process is that they

101
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,280
required is you identify your hazards

102
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,158
you figure out how to control the

103
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,158
hazards you manage it and you verify

104
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:03,120
that you're managing of your hazards is

105
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:05,280
working and then usually if you have

106
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,120
various ingredients in your products

107
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,080
that your supply chain

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,319
is

109
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,599
following all the controls that you're

110
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:14,560
wanting to do

111
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,279
and i've been working with

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,439
people setting up analytical quality

113
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,358
monitoring programs like i said for

114
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:24,079
close to 30 years and these are the

115
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,758
three well there's really four

116
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,240
the three questions that i get asked

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,800
more often what do i test how do i test

118
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,280
how often do i test oh and by the way i

119
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,040
only have this amount of money to spend

120
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,599
for for this program so what this also

121
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,800
the risk-based hazard analysis also

122
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,280
helps you get the most value for

123
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,439
whatever budget you have

124
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:49,039
for your testing because you can't you

125
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,120
know if we

126
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,759
had unlimited budget we could test every

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,360
lot every ingredient every time we open

128
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:00,000
a packet of um supply that we have we

129
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,439
could just test them but it could get

130
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,240
very costly

131
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,240
and so this um

132
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,038
based on using the hazardous analysis

133
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,840
you could

134
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,240
rank

135
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,519
enables you to rank your ingredients or

136
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,079
your products

137
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,639
and categorize them as low risk medium

138
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:18,879
risk and high risk so when you have a

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,360
limited budget you focus on your high

140
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,079
risk then a little bit on the medium and

141
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,720
maybe alternate some of the low risk and

142
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:29,359
this year we do testing next year

143
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,540
we don't and all that good stuff or use

144
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,080
our data and figure out where we can

145
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,080
[Music]

146
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,879
mitigate risk without having to do

147
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:41,758
actual testing and spending money

148
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:44,800
and so this is the chemical i'm sorry

149
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,120
that my slides are kind of like off they

150
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,240
look fine when i

151
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,160
send them

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,918
but the chemical risk assessment this is

153
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,280
the chemical risk assessment process

154
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,240
that we follow

155
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,359
and

156
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,680
the

157
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:59,759
phase one is the hazard characterization

158
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,959
and id and then determination of

159
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,759
exposure and that step involves a lot of

160
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:09,439
data review document review and in the

161
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:11,439
food world one of my favorite reading

162
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:14,079
puts me to sleep at night

163
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:16,240
is the fda import alerts

164
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:18,399
because that tells you what's being held

165
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,199
and detained at the ports

166
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,959
for illegal substances or for violative

167
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,960
substances and then they're not getting

168
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:27,279
allowed to enter the country and there's

169
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:30,000
a whole long list of them and it's quite

170
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:32,000
interesting reading and and then

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,079
at this phase you identify your risk

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,038
factors and

173
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:38,318
phase two you classify them as you rank

174
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,399
your ingredients

175
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,560
whether they're high medium or low and

176
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:44,318
then your follow-up activities anything

177
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:46,478
that involves all these ingredients to

178
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,800
your suppliers and then your

179
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:51,598
verification or testing program and then

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
the

181
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:58,319
your suppliers are very are very key

182
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:02,560
to for you being able to have a

183
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,680
high quality and safe product

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,959
and

185
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,639
so

186
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:10,478
going back to cannabis

187
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,560
slash hemp we can do the um

188
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:14,839
we can apply this borrow what we've done

189
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,519
in the food industry to

190
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:19,598
cannabis and so we start off with

191
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,519
assessing sources of contamination from

192
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:22,879
ground to shelf

193
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:25,120
basically

194
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,759
we start from soil all the way to when

195
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,560
we put the product in the shelf and look

196
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:33,759
at every phase of that and see what are

197
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
potential exposure to hazards and one of

198
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,280
the

199
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,079
risk factors that is always part of

200
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:41,679
hazard analysis is the inherent risk

201
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,439
related to that

202
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,400
product or ingredient

203
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:46,560
and

204
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,519
how we use that thinking

205
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
is

206
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:53,680
we asked this three questions

207
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,918
how likely is it to occur

208
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
how likely am i going to remove it from

209
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,839
processing

210
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:03,280
and are there multiple hazards occurring

211
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,079
at one time these three questions i cop

212
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,000
we

213
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,959
copied as we were creating this tool

214
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
from the codex approach but usually it's

215
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,839
about

216
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,639
how likely is it to cause death how

217
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,159
likely are and so but we've applied it

218
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,840
here for

219
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
so the likelihood of occurrence of that

220
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,000
chemical or that contaminant or that

221
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,119
hazard in that particular product or

222
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,800
ingredient

223
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,879
and if i process it would i remove it or

224
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,720
would i concentrate it

225
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,038
for example when you're making apple

226
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,080
juice concentrate and you have heavy

227
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,240
metals let's say lead in your product in

228
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,158
the apples themselves and that you

229
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
extract them and you make your

230
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,720
concentrate

231
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,680
and and they go with your

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,000
extraction process they carry over you

233
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:52,479
will in fact concentrate the presence of

234
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,958
lead in the concentrate because if it's

235
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,600
soluble in the you know final juice that

236
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:01,919
you have and sometimes lead does carry

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:05,680
over or a pesticide that's water soluble

238
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:09,039
that for example metamodifies which is

239
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:10,879
for a while a problem pesticide in the

240
00:09:09,039 --> 00:09:12,399
food industry because it is water

241
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,080
soluble and when you do use your

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,759
concentrates it does concentrate in the

243
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,320
product and then multiple hazards

244
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:20,720
occurring at one time for example

245
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,920
vegetables or

246
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,200
cannabis could be exposed both to heavy

247
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:29,120
metals and to pesticides and to other

248
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,080
stuff that it will pick up from the

249
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,639
ground

250
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:35,040
and so when you have this series of

251
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,879
answers so if it's likely to occur you

252
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:39,278
can't remove it from processing and

253
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,720
multiple hazards occur at one time

254
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:45,039
it is a very high risk so the inherent

255
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,519
risk becomes three uh this we just

256
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:50,559
categorize it from one low medium high

257
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,278
so one two and three and so if it's

258
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:55,278
unlikely to occur and even though you

259
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,679
can't remove it but it's not likely to

260
00:09:55,278 --> 00:09:59,200
be there anyway and then there's no

261
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,120
possibility of multiple hazards

262
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,879
occurring then there's

263
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
very minimal

264
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:08,879
little or no risk to that ingredient

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,879
so let's apply and borrow this for our

266
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,399
cannabis um luckily when we look at

267
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,600
cannabis we're only looking at one

268
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,839
material

269
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,920
let's start with the plan discipline

270
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,160
um uh

271
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:22,000
we like to call it the you know it's

272
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:24,078
considered a rack rock or cultural

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,200
commodity i'd like to consider it that

274
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,879
way

275
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,200
so we go and we look at the face

276
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,278
you know that previous graph i told i

277
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,000
took you from soil to shelf let's start

278
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:38,879
with soil and then the plant grows we

279
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,360
all know cannabis is a phytoremediator

280
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,320
so we will absorb things that are on the

281
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,278
ground

282
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,000
and

283
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,120
so in the soil usually the biggest risk

284
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,839
that you have

285
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,000
are usually heavy metals and pesticides

286
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
in 2019

287
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,720
i partnered with the company and we did

288
00:10:54,958 --> 00:11:00,399
testing of about 300 soil samples

289
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,160
and um

290
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,000
tested it for pesticides and for heavy

291
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:05,919
metals and then

292
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,200
on the other end we

293
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:12,719
tested the by the product that came out

294
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:16,160
from the soil we tested about 700

295
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,079
biomass samples and what we found this

296
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:20,879
is actually a poster we presented at

297
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,958
aoac and if you're interested

298
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:25,278
to look at those numbers i could

299
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,879
uh let me know send me here and i'll

300
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,759
send you the information and it did

301
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,439
translate for example one um pesticide

302
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:36,078
chloranth neoliberal

303
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,600
was in the soil already because it was

304
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:40,239
there not that it was applied during

305
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,800
planting but it was there um because of

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,480
the previous crops that were used

307
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,559
it came through

308
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,000
to the final mass

309
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,359
the final

310
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,799
plant material

311
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,079
about 35 percent

312
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:55,759
and then

313
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,559
also um

314
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:01,039
we found some ddt in the soil luckily

315
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,239
ddt did not translate to the product so

316
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,399
it's a good thing

317
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,720
so and um and and so those are some of

318
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,278
the things and um it's the same trend

319
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:11,440
with heavy metals although the heavy

320
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,039
metals it's very difficult

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
to predict the

322
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,958
there's no

323
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,360
linear correlation from soil to the

324
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:21,838
actual plant material itself

325
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:26,639
and then of course because during the

326
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,639
plant growth although we know that

327
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,320
you don't usually apply pesticides as

328
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,159
you're growing your crop but

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,839
depending on the neighboring

330
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:38,240
crops that you have

331
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,680
they may be applying pesticides they're

332
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,720
allowed to apply pesticides and

333
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,799
there's an advertent drift that we call

334
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,600
so when they're spraying up in the air

335
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,000
and the wind is just the right direction

336
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,920
the right strength and the right speed

337
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,759
it could land in your crop

338
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:57,278
and it could stay there and luckily some

339
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:58,799
of those if they're

340
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,439
they're just surface they could be

341
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:03,439
removed by washing or maybe processing

342
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,120
but if you're doing extraction they will

343
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,560
probably go through all the way to the

344
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,600
extract

345
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:12,239
and that's the challenge

346
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,680
and so so the risks that we've

347
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,200
determined

348
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:17,039
asking all those questions about

349
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:19,120
inherent risk is

350
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:22,159
at this phase heavy heavy on heavy

351
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:25,120
metals and pesticides and

352
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:27,278
fertilizers some of them also fall into

353
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,799
the categories of the pesticides when

354
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:32,000
you do pesticide screen there are some

355
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:36,799
fertilizers included in there

356
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:39,198
or fertilizer type structure pesticides

357
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:41,759
and now we move on to the after you

358
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:44,240
harvest it and you store it and some of

359
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,198
the issues that we

360
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,399
look into and um this is how we

361
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:52,078
after we did the inherent risk um

362
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,198
questions asking them

363
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:55,359
mold

364
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:57,039
bacteria and once again pesticides

365
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,800
because

366
00:13:57,039 --> 00:14:01,838
the reason for pesticides in during

367
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:03,919
harvest and storage is sometimes

368
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,120
we've i've encountered some of this

369
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,519
where

370
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,480
we had a problem

371
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,078
on

372
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,120
some cranberries

373
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,958
and the supplier swore no pesticide was

374
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
used in that crop it didn't come in

375
00:14:14,958 --> 00:14:18,799
contact

376
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,838
nothing was used as it was growing

377
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,479
well

378
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,760
the crate that they used

379
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
for storing

380
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:27,838
their

381
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:30,320
and transporting their product

382
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,160
was sprayed with a wax that had some

383
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,920
pesticides in it

384
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:37,439
and those little cranberries absorb the

385
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:39,039
little pesticides and we we saw them you

386
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,279
know they wanted to blame it in the labs

387
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,360
like no your results are wrong you're

388
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:44,879
not correct you're not doing your job

389
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,560
correctly

390
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,639
but you know so those are things to

391
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:53,039
think about and even sometimes

392
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:54,240
another example is coffee which is um

393
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,559
you're

394
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,879
ex we're pouring coffee and they're on

395
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:00,958
the barges and all the stuff sometimes

396
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,240
they do clean those barges and they

397
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,638
don't spray

398
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,799
cleaners on them and coffee likes to

399
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,799
absorb you know when there's the oily

400
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:11,359
outside it's like so it adds to the

401
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,198
flavor of the coffee i'm just kidding

402
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,919
but anyway you could pick it up from

403
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,439
there and then the mycotoxins of course

404
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:19,519
are directly related to the molds and

405
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,399
the bacteria that um

406
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:26,320
it could be produced and um

407
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:29,839
and um so and the mycotoxins stay and

408
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,680
they are hazard a health hazard

409
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
then we move on to processing and then

410
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:36,239
manufacture and then ultimately shelf

411
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:38,000
and then when you take your plant

412
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,799
material

413
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,278
and you extract it so you expose it to

414
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,719
solvents and the mycotoxins are still

415
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:46,480
there because sometimes they're being

416
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
stored and if the microtoxins have

417
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,000
already formed and they're there there's

418
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,599
a big chance that it will carry over to

419
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,320
your extract

420
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,800
so try to store them properly which is i

421
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,800
think everybody's goal as well so

422
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:03,198
and then the pesticides and heavy metals

423
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:04,479
where they come in is when you add

424
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:06,479
ingredients

425
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,159
and when you start to make your complex

426
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,360
products or you add flavors or you have

427
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,198
some olive oil as a carrier or

428
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,480
i may be using

429
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,879
off-the-cuff examples here but um

430
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,039
the idea is that the more you have and

431
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,120
this is where another level of

432
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,240
risk-based analysis

433
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,078
is is a good to do because when you have

434
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,399
ingredients and you have exposure to

435
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,879
pesticides and heavy metals especially

436
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,639
if you're importing

437
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,039
ingredients

438
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,560
from outside of the united states to add

439
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:44,799
into your products

440
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:48,479
the risk goes up because the regulations

441
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:50,958
for pesticides or for contaminants is

442
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,199
different there's usually a difference

443
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:56,319
in the different countries so the

444
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,958
geography is a source of risk

445
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:02,320
so one example i always like to give is

446
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:04,720
um i i worked a lot in apples and in

447
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,318
south america i used to go to south

448
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
america every year to look at apple

449
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:12,318
crops and um

450
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,038
for pesticide diphenoconazole

451
00:17:12,318 --> 00:17:16,399
is allowed for use in brazil

452
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,038
and um

453
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,280
and so and it carries over when they

454
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,279
make the concentrate it's usually there

455
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:25,038
and also they methylate the nomenclature

456
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:26,959
which has been all

457
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:28,720
their methods been revoked here in the

458
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,200
u.s and

459
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,200
but it carries over to the concentrate

460
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:37,360
totally allowed perfectly good in brazil

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,720
now they go on the tanker they come to

462
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,678
the u.s

463
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,558
the fda gets a hold of them and tests

464
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:46,160
them well diphenylconozole and like i

465
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:47,519
said that method of method has been

466
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,240
revoked

467
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,759
those pesticides are perfectly

468
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,759
legal in brazil

469
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:56,000
are now violative in the u.s

470
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,879
which makes the product unusable here in

471
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,720
the u.s so that's a that's

472
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,080
something to think about is there

473
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:06,319
differences in regulations heavy metals

474
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:08,720
is not as simple because the u.s does

475
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,678
not have regulations for heavy metals we

476
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,319
have suggestions we have um levels that

477
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,640
we want and fda has a trend to zero for

478
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:19,038
heavy metals especially um with the

479
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,038
recent baby food concern for heavy

480
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:25,440
metals and and so those two are um

481
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:27,599
are a concern and at in ads for your

482
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,480
contaminant risk

483
00:18:27,599 --> 00:18:31,119
so

484
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,960
based on all of this we've come up with

485
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,119
the contaminant pro

486
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,880
using the risk-based hazards analysis

487
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:38,798
and i think this is familiar

488
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:41,600
to all of you this is a contaminant

489
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:44,319
profile that's really good

490
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,119
to apply to cannabis

491
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:47,279
and

492
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,079
you don't have to test

493
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,119
for all of them in all phases

494
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:52,879
some

495
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:55,359
like for example you don't need to test

496
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,400
residual you don't need to test your

497
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:01,519
raw plant material for residual solvents

498
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,080
because there would be no um exposure or

499
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,200
risk of exposure for it if you use those

500
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,879
questions

501
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:11,200
that um you know that then my

502
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,600
four or five slides before um you'll be

503
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,519
able to determine what phase you want to

504
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:19,599
uh test them and um i usually uh though

505
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:20,400
microbiology is there in the profile i

506
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,000
don't

507
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,080
i won't speak to microbiology because

508
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,079
i may be giving you

509
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:30,159
incorrect information

510
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:32,639
so i will focus on my contaminants and

511
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,519
my pesticides as we do this so now that

512
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,559
we've we've gone through this complete

513
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:41,440
the risk hazard thought process and then

514
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,000
we have our contaminant profile

515
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,279
we go this allows you to take you to

516
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,240
testing

517
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,480
and

518
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:51,599
i will take some of my time to talk

519
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,679
about testing because

520
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:57,038
not all testing's the same

521
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:58,720
and um pro methods and procedures and

522
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,720
all this is important to be aware of

523
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,600
those things so i'll take you through

524
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,038
some

525
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,240
testing and

526
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,240
advances in testing for the contaminant

527
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,200
profile for cannabis

528
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:13,200
and i will start with

529
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,840
the residual solvents

530
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,120
so um you know like the exposure of your

531
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,279
product is when you do your extraction

532
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,119
this residual solvents are usually from

533
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,879
the extraction process

534
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,839
and

535
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,120
the most

536
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,918
that we see

537
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:30,959
usually is ethanol butane

538
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,240
propane

539
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,640
and

540
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,120
methanol in the pharma industry

541
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,080
sometimes we get asked to do methanol as

542
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:42,239
well and then supercritical

543
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:43,359
co2 which usually will not leave a

544
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
residue

545
00:20:43,359 --> 00:20:46,639
and then

546
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:49,279
the reason for the concern for residual

547
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,759
solvents is that you

548
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,599
after you've extracted it and you think

549
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:55,200
you're trying you're removing all those

550
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,719
solvents that you've used for extraction

551
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,600
sometimes they don't all quite go away

552
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:04,079
and so this is a list i the list that i

553
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,678
have there is

554
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:09,359
the bcc

555
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:13,519
bcc list of solvents some other

556
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:18,558
regulations um ask for the full usb 467

557
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:20,639
usb 467 list of solvents which is about

558
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:21,759
five times more

559
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,840
um

560
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:26,400
components than that but that's a

561
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,798
compendial method for usb usually used

562
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
in the in the pharma industry for a full

563
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:34,480
um length for um four six seven and so

564
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,799
this is the kind of testing that you do

565
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,038
and residual solvents is usually tested

566
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:41,279
by headspace which makes sense you know

567
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:44,000
because you want a solvent so you take

568
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:47,119
your product and um you add your

569
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,038
solvents to it and um seal it

570
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,479
make sure you seal it properly

571
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,400
in the lab we make sure it's sealed

572
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,919
because when you heat it a little bit so

573
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:56,480
that you release some of those residual

574
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,720
solvents as they're there and then you

575
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,159
all this are done closed and then you

576
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,159
have the that big

577
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:07,359
thing t thing on top is your auto

578
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:09,599
sampler pretty fancy auto sampler it

579
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:11,038
runs about it's more expensive than the

580
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,519
gc system

581
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,759
the auto sampler because the your

582
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,519
analysis is very dependent on that on

583
00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:20,400
that auto sampler that it does what it

584
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:23,359
does and delivers the whatever residual

585
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,440
solvent to the instrument that measures

586
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:28,719
it i i

587
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,600
was looking at a quote last week

588
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:33,120
um

589
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:36,158
the gc was i think i don't know 40k they

590
00:22:33,119 --> 00:22:37,918
told me but the auto sampler was 80k

591
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,840
and i'm like

592
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
i may be able to build the gc but the

593
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:45,359
auto sampler we'll see but anyway you do

594
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:48,480
need that setup though to to give you

595
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,439
your um precision and your rsds that are

596
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
proper

597
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,640
a good auto sampler is very important in

598
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,679
the residual solvent testing

599
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,038
then the next one we go to is mycotoxins

600
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,440
and the mic

601
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:02,720
though there are as you can see there

602
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,000
there's about

603
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,798
12 16 mycotoxins that are commonly

604
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:11,200
tested for in the cannabis world most of

605
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:12,480
the regulations only focus on

606
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:17,200
the five

607
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,200
the atlas and okra and um

608
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,558
we

609
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,840
where i work we also work with infant

610
00:23:20,558 --> 00:23:25,279
formula so i love the limits of the

611
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:27,839
cannabis world because they're

612
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,960
significantly higher than infant formula

613
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:30,639
and so

614
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,079
i wouldn't say easy

615
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,880
but a little bit simpler to get to than

616
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:38,720
what we try to do for infant formula but

617
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,799
mycotoxins are

618
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,120
highly toxic natural compounds and

619
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:45,038
especially if you're allergic to it

620
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:47,678
it's not very good you know if you have

621
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,359
like a i don't know peanut a nut that

622
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,159
sometimes a little mold in there some

623
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:55,599
micro toxin and you eat it and your body

624
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:58,320
doesn't like it you could have

625
00:23:55,599 --> 00:24:00,959
issues in your in your mouth after taste

626
00:23:58,319 --> 00:24:03,119
or you could actually get sick it's

627
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,880
every now and then you could see it in

628
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,000
in the food

629
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,520
come out and they are they are not easy

630
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,278
to destroy

631
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:13,278
you can't heat them out

632
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:16,400
they'll stay

633
00:24:13,278 --> 00:24:19,200
the molecule is very persistent and

634
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:23,200
to test them we do use a very simple

635
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,480
extraction and do lcms analysis for it

636
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:29,120
and that allows us

637
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,558
the lcms allows us to

638
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,599
get to the

639
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:34,720
limit

640
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,719
the action limits that most of the

641
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,120
regulations from the different state

642
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,519
regulations offer

643
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:44,719
and then we go to heavy metals and

644
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,558
generally

645
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,880
the heavy metals is

646
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,000
the testing is involves the digestion

647
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,600
with some acid nitric acid usually and

648
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,679
then

649
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,519
you transfer it and send it off to your

650
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,880
icp ms

651
00:24:57,519 --> 00:25:02,960
well we do it icp ms or other detection

652
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,799
systems that you can do although they

653
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:09,120
are less sensitive

654
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,079
actually we also do msms we do tandem ms

655
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,599
because

656
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:16,240
like i said in my lab we also work with

657
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,599
infant formula and in front formula they

658
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,919
want zero

659
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,480
well which is not real

660
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,278
so we go to one ppv

661
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,240
we want pbb whereas in in cannabis i

662
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,519
think

663
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:32,319
these are limits of um quants for the

664
00:25:29,519 --> 00:25:34,639
samples that we do and 510

665
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:37,200
lead five arsenic 10 that's total

666
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,759
arsenic by the way um

667
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:42,798
although for those of you in cannabis

668
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,879
that are concerned with prop 65 prop 65

669
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:46,400
looks for inorganic arsenic

670
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,960
which if your

671
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,080
total arsenic is

672
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,079
below

673
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:55,119
what that threshold is for inorganic

674
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:56,879
arsenic for prop 65 then you can

675
00:25:55,119 --> 00:26:00,158
have a good

676
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,480
safety you know feel good that you are

677
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,278
under that inorganic arsenic threshold

678
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,759
and then cadmium and this lev limit of

679
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:10,400
plants are actually

680
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:13,359
well below many of the state regulations

681
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,720
if not all so there's no problem

682
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,798
heavy metals

683
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,400
analysis is not an issue

684
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:20,720
there's good quality and there's many

685
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,400
labs that can do it there and it's very

686
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
established system

687
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,038
but um

688
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,679
but you still need to have um

689
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:32,319
a good quality control in your digestion

690
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,559
and your blanks and controls um to

691
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:37,759
follow that but it's generally tested

692
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:39,839
using um icpms acid digestion and icp

693
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:40,879
mass spec

694
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,199
and then

695
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,720
we go to my favorite part

696
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,600
because this is nowadays is a very big

697
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,200
question um in in the cannabis world in

698
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,599
the canvas world in the hemp world

699
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,400
because of many regulations

700
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:59,038
many each state has different sets of

701
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,278
pesticides what pesticides do you test

702
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:03,599
and which list are you going to go

703
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,798
through what limit of quant do you want

704
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:06,639
to use

705
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,879
and if you're in colorado

706
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,720
that is the biggest challenge you have

707
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,480
because the limit of quants that the

708
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,120
that colorado requires for the

709
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,759
certification is very very difficult to

710
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:20,639
achieve it's very very low many some of

711
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:22,960
the compounds are are low but

712
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:25,120
you know you can get to it if you work

713
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,798
hard enough

714
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,879
so pesticides

715
00:27:26,798 --> 00:27:31,278
now this is a general background you can

716
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,278
just um see it and it's transferred to

717
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,038
hemp based products

718
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,038
you know we talked about the risk how it

719
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,640
could get into there at the soil and

720
00:27:37,038 --> 00:27:40,640
during your

721
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,520
planning and exposure

722
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,520
but um

723
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,240
currently

724
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,120
there are 1600 parent compounds well

725
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,120
there's really six thou over six

726
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:54,479
thousand registered pesticides in the

727
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,759
united states

728
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:58,159
and

729
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,240
i don't think there's

730
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,320
a synthetic pesticide that's registered

731
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,278
for cannabis there are some biological

732
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:07,200
pesticides that are registered but i the

733
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,880
last time i checked there was not a

734
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,640
synthetic pesticide that's allowed for

735
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:15,360
use in him which means any pesticides

736
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,520
you detect could be considered violative

737
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,959
but luckily states from state to state

738
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:20,558
to state to state they have what they

739
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,798
call action limits

740
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:24,480
so that's what you use and you try to

741
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:26,960
fall under

742
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,360
well under the action limits

743
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,360
like i said colorado is the challenge

744
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:34,079
because their action limits or their

745
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,398
limits of quant requirement is quite low

746
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,558
and and then their list is also very

747
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:43,199
extensive and the same with florida

748
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,200
there's also an extensive list so

749
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:48,240
people always ask me do we really need

750
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:50,799
to test breast size there's really not a

751
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,278
law that tells you you have to test for

752
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:55,440
pesticides you know unlike

753
00:28:53,278 --> 00:28:57,839
um micro you're required to test for

754
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:00,880
micro and some of that stuff aflatoxin

755
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,879
there is a regulation that tells you but

756
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
the reason that you test for pesticides

757
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,679
is it's actually codified

758
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,158
and it falls under the definition of

759
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,559
adulterated food if you're if you're if

760
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:16,240
you want to take your final product your

761
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:18,000
cannabis put it into food and

762
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,240
a raw

763
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,720
is deemed adulterated and subject to

764
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,159
enforcement if it contains either a

765
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,038
pesticide

766
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,760
that's

767
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,759
a level greater than the tolerance well

768
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,759
there's no tolerance so any pesticides

769
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:32,558
greater than level tolerance

770
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,319
or

771
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,398
that that's what it is a pesticide for

772
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:38,558
which there is no tolerance exemption or

773
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:40,798
food additive regulation

774
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:44,398
it is considered adulterated

775
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:46,639
and it is not legal

776
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,119
to distribute adulterated food

777
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,840
at least in the us well eu i guess

778
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:54,158
everywhere i think and then the shea if

779
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:56,720
you're in the dietary supplement world

780
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,480
the shay tells you the same thing

781
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,720
if it's a dollar rated it's considered

782
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,038
misbranded and you do not want

783
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,360
misbranded products out there

784
00:30:03,038 --> 00:30:07,200
and so there really is

785
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,719
a reason

786
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,000
it's codified

787
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,278
you need to be concerned about

788
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,558
pesticides

789
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:16,240
and

790
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:19,359
at least be aware of what your pesticide

791
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,319
profile is of your product just so no

792
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,319
surprises for you

793
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,720
and

794
00:30:24,798 --> 00:30:29,599
then

795
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,798
as i mentioned already there are

796
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,558
many different sets of analyzed list

797
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:37,759
and then action limits specific to

798
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:41,038
individual states and colorado has

799
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:42,720
the most and i think florida is a close

800
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,480
second and

801
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,798
washington state washington's not there

802
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,278
but it also has a long list

803
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,639
of pesticides they're they're

804
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:51,519
similar

805
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,679
but

806
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:56,879
sometimes two or three compounds

807
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:58,960
different enough but luckily

808
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,360
you can screen for pesticides

809
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
and so

810
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,918
for here the pesticide residue analysis

811
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,558
is the most complex of all the

812
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,759
contaminants that we did because

813
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:11,678
unlike

814
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,000
for example mycotoxins there were only

815
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,840
five components we were interested in in

816
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,759
heavy metals there were only four

817
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:20,079
components we were interested in in

818
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:23,038
residual solvents maybe eight to

819
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:24,879
12 to 15 at the most maybe

820
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:27,119
20.

821
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,360
pesticide residues usually screen for

822
00:31:27,119 --> 00:31:31,278
about 500 compounds

823
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,519
to be comprehensive because there are so

824
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,079
many to pick so so many pesticides out

825
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,558
there to pick from and there are

826
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:40,158
two approaches that we

827
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,918
we kind of define the approaches to

828
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,799
pesticide residue testing as the

829
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:46,640
classical approach which was

830
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:49,038
my time i started with a classical

831
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,038
approach 30 years ago where you actually

832
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,519
do um

833
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:56,480
liquid liquid chemical separation you

834
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,079
use a ton of methylene chloride acetone

835
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:00,880
put it in a chef panel it's those

836
00:31:58,079 --> 00:32:04,879
pictures of of scientists that you see

837
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,840
and then we actually do a chemistry um

838
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
this

839
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,558
solvent chemistry to separate um

840
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,240
that but then now we have they have the

841
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:18,240
modern approach the the advent of the of

842
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:19,759
technology of lcms and gcms and in the

843
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,399
classical approach the reason for all

844
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,879
those mixing with lots of amounts of

845
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,518
acetone and methylene chloride is to

846
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:28,799
clean up you know you take your ham your

847
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,839
hands like

848
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,119
green

849
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:34,720
or and and and you know those colors

850
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:36,479
come from compounds

851
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,440
and those compounds

852
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,759
um sometimes interfere with analysis and

853
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,080
you wanna that's why you do a lot of the

854
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,398
extraction methanol or

855
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:48,480
acetone huge amounts so you can shake

856
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:50,719
them off and you can separate the

857
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,278
organics from the pesticides that you

858
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:55,519
want and you end up with

859
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:57,200
if you did it your job right a colorless

860
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,880
liquid at the end because our

861
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,558
instruments don't like those highly

862
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,760
colored stuff because they mess your

863
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:03,359
instruments up

864
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:04,398
and then

865
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,839
um

866
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,278
you know because of concerns for the

867
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:09,199
environment and we want to be

868
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:13,519
responsible

869
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,200
in the last 15 20 years they they

870
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,798
did away with a lot of those solvents

871
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,519
used only a little bit they went to

872
00:33:16,798 --> 00:33:23,359
about from 100 mils to about 5 to 10

873
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:25,038
mils and that's for those if

874
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:27,678
any of you guys here in the best side

875
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,038
world um the advent of lcms and then

876
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,919
captures

877
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:30,960
um

878
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:32,080
because

879
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,840
the

880
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:39,519
in our lab what we we like is

881
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:41,439
when you dilute dilution it's the best

882
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,200
manner of cleanup

883
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,880
because you don't use chemicals and all

884
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,278
this stuff and the only way you are able

885
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:49,919
to do that is if you have a gcms

886
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:51,599
if you have the ms and or 10 mms and

887
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,440
that's what they call the modern

888
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:55,278
approach because it is very very

889
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,399
dependent on the instrument that you use

890
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:58,720
at the end

891
00:33:56,398 --> 00:34:00,798
whereas the classical approach is

892
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:03,038
dependent your ability to screen for

893
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,720
pesticides dependent on the first part

894
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:07,119
on the extraction and how good you do

895
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:10,000
that and how good you separate it out

896
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:12,480
and there's a multi-residue method like

897
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,960
i said there's 500 plus compounds

898
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,639
there's labs in the eu that can do 700

899
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,199
compounds at one time

900
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,440
and it's mind-boggling to look at that

901
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,918
the data the chromatography that comes

902
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:27,039
out for a bit and it's also optimized

903
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:30,078
for analysis of complex samples and when

904
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:32,878
you're doing pesticides um it is really

905
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:35,679
best if you want to cover a wide range

906
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:40,639
of um of components

907
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,039
to do um two platforms gcms and lcms

908
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,119
often in the cannabis world we

909
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:48,559
we see where we

910
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:49,919
tend to only use lc the lcm sms platform

911
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,199
and that

912
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:54,078
if you

913
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,519
only use one platform it give it puts

914
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,920
you a little bit of a disadvantage

915
00:34:55,519 --> 00:35:00,639
because there are compounds pesticides

916
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,000
that are not amenable to

917
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:06,799
lc you need the gc to get them out and

918
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,800
have a recovery and

919
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,760
some of them i see some headshaking in

920
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,079
the audience but

921
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:18,000
many of them really the recoveries they

922
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,000
don't make it quite through and

923
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,200
and then

924
00:35:21,039 --> 00:35:24,880
what when you have both of them when

925
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:27,519
you're using both of them you can

926
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,039
immediately do a confirmation

927
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:32,079
you know you have when you see a

928
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:33,199
positive and if it also comes out in the

929
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,119
gc

930
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:36,639
you can look at what the g c transitions

931
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,800
are and if they match then you have an

932
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:42,400
immediate confirmation if you have a gc

933
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,720
and it also works in lc as we have about

934
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,920
235 analytes

935
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,319
and

936
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,358
i think 90 percent

937
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,800
of the lists that are in the state

938
00:35:51,358 --> 00:35:56,799
the list for the states for the

939
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,760
pesticides that they have 90 of those do

940
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,680
fall into the uh word they can be done

941
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,640
by both uh either gc or lc but there is

942
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:09,519
there's just a few of them enough

943
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:13,519
that you have to use one or the other

944
00:36:09,519 --> 00:36:15,759
and you want to use up gc one of them

945
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:17,280
and i'm pretty sure

946
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,359
i'll have people disagree with me is

947
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,000
bifentrine as an example

948
00:36:19,358 --> 00:36:24,480
it's rare and which and bifentrine is

949
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,679
one of those compounds that show up in

950
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,920
cannabis

951
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:31,679
and and it is a g

952
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,400
it's best on the gcm sms you can

953
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:39,399
survive with lcm sms but your recoveries

954
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,400
are could be low and um

955
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,358
yes so it the accuracy is not

956
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,960
quite there

957
00:36:45,358 --> 00:36:48,960
and

958
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,559
because cannabis is such a complex

959
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,400
matrix you do have to validate a full

960
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:57,119
validate so you can

961
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,039
determine the analyte

962
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,838
the analyte you want in the presence of

963
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:04,400
other components and the limit of font

964
00:37:01,838 --> 00:37:05,759
that you want and you can assess

965
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,079
the difference

966
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,680
and those are the that's those are the

967
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,480
terms that we

968
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,319
need to define when we validate how

969
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,639
selective the method is what our limit

970
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,039
of quant what the accuracy what the

971
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:22,239
precision and the robustness is the

972
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,199
robustness that we do we have a very uh

973
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,279
because we

974
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:28,319
also have to meet sante requirements for

975
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,240
the eu when we do our validation um it's

976
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,079
over three days

977
00:37:30,239 --> 00:37:34,959
and two to three analysts that we have

978
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,760
to repeat the whole process and and and

979
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
look at the rsds between

980
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,240
our

981
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:41,199
analysts

982
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:43,439
and

983
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:44,319
method validation takes quite a lot of

984
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:47,920
effort

985
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,039
um to do that but it does at the end

986
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,519
give you

987
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,759
a confidence in your method that your

988
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,800
your method is is doing what it's meant

989
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:56,960
to do

990
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,640
and and that what you're seeing as your

991
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,559
pesticides if you're not seeing any

992
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:02,719
pesticides you're confident that there

993
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,480
really is no pesticide in there because

994
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,879
you validated the method and you have

995
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,960
criteria based on the validation you

996
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,599
define criteria for acceptance of your

997
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,559
analytical test

998
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,000
and

999
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:18,480
for pesticides residue we we have to do

1000
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,480
this is just an example of what could go

1001
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,519
on in the lab because like i said

1002
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,039
cannabis hemp is a difficult matrix and

1003
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:27,679
we

1004
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:29,440
use the the base is the catcher's sample

1005
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,199
preparation which is very simple you

1006
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:33,200
take your matrix you add a little

1007
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:34,159
nitrile you add salt

1008
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:36,239
and

1009
00:38:34,159 --> 00:38:38,000
you shake them for a little bit and then

1010
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,399
you take them through a solid face

1011
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,800
extraction then you have a clean extra

1012
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,800
and then that layer on the top you take

1013
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
it you shoot it to your machine

1014
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,560
and there are different combinations

1015
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:53,598
that you could use for um for cleanup um

1016
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:56,078
you know you just vary the salts and

1017
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:57,920
that you have depending on the

1018
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:59,119
structure of the pesticides you want to

1019
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,079
capture

1020
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,320
and what you want to focus and sometimes

1021
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,079
for the

1022
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
to meet the colorado requirements we've

1023
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,320
had to use

1024
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,960
at least three of those combinations so

1025
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:16,720
you often have to go back twice to to

1026
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,039
meet them but you can't can be done

1027
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,959
and then

1028
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:23,279
we keep putting difficult sample because

1029
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:25,440
it is a difficult matrix and this is one

1030
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,839
of the things how we get away with false

1031
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,920
positives

1032
00:39:26,838 --> 00:39:31,519
um oh actually this is the gc part which

1033
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,680
is

1034
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,039
this is for matrix interference that we

1035
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:38,078
do that so you you do split purge this

1036
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:40,239
is kind of

1037
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,400
really deep into the chemistry but

1038
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:46,078
there's a technique that we use

1039
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,639
into separating them we we use pressure

1040
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:50,560
and we split we do the purge and all the

1041
00:39:48,639 --> 00:39:52,319
bad stuff that we don't want goes to the

1042
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,239
other side and the good stuff that we

1043
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,000
want goes to the to the guard um often

1044
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:59,279
you need a guard column

1045
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,239
before your column when you do

1046
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,880
chromatography so you don't ruin your

1047
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:06,879
actual analytical column because the

1048
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,680
guard column is usually i don't know

1049
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:11,280
maybe just as an example

1050
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:13,118
fifty dollars

1051
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,440
and your analytical column could be

1052
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,599
upwards of five hundred dollars so

1053
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,559
there's a tennis so but the guard column

1054
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:20,880
kind of

1055
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:23,279
absorbs a lot of the gunk

1056
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,960
and um this just in case you want to set

1057
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,839
up your own pesticide test

1058
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,838
but

1059
00:40:27,838 --> 00:40:32,880
you know and it's this is a very simple

1060
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,960
simplified diagram of it and there is a

1061
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,000
lot of experience that's in the back of

1062
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,519
that when you're interpreting

1063
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,400
chromatograms

1064
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:40,318
and

1065
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,358
this one is the one

1066
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,318
you do

1067
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:46,239
besides your ms which is

1068
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:48,000
the

1069
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,439
you have transitions

1070
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,679
how i

1071
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,679
try to describe ms for those of you that

1072
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,759
are not really familiar with it is you

1073
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:58,078
have this little

1074
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,240
compound for example and then you

1075
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,519
send it through it's like

1076
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:05,199
having chill daughters so you're

1077
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:08,000
and then you do something and then you

1078
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:11,679
have that and then if you take it

1079
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,039
further you have um on down the road so

1080
00:41:11,679 --> 00:41:18,078
their their fingerprints are very uh

1081
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:21,679
specific to that so what we do is when

1082
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,000
we do our lc or gc you have a compound

1083
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,879
in there it has what you expect the

1084
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,280
transitions to be and if the ratio or

1085
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:31,358
something is not off is not right based

1086
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,480
on the criteria that we've set it

1087
00:41:31,358 --> 00:41:34,880
triggers

1088
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,079
another um

1089
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,519
transition

1090
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,760
and then you end up

1091
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:42,559
at the end with more transitions to

1092
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:44,240
confirm your compound and this is a

1093
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,960
simplified um

1094
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:49,759
here so when you do we have the standard

1095
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,000
below and then the sample the kind first

1096
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,079
second and third squares they all kind

1097
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,760
of look the same until you go to that

1098
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,839
final step

1099
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,440
where the fingerprint i call them

1100
00:41:57,838 --> 00:42:00,838
fingerprint

1101
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:05,679
don't match

1102
00:42:00,838 --> 00:42:07,838
anymore so you take them further and um

1103
00:42:05,679 --> 00:42:09,598
i am not an expert in this i have quite

1104
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,000
a few experts in my lab

1105
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:13,760
i just understand the surface of it so

1106
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,039
if you have any questions about it send

1107
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,560
it to me and i will send it to the

1108
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:19,599
proper people

1109
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:22,639
to answer your questions

1110
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,200
and then on top of all of that to give

1111
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,279
confidence to your testing or if you

1112
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,598
have a lab or in-house lab where you're

1113
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:31,920
looking at other labs there's always the

1114
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,640
accreditation that helps and the

1115
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:37,519
accredited accreditation if you can read

1116
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:39,440
that is just demonstrates the competence

1117
00:42:37,519 --> 00:42:41,679
of labs you know it basically

1118
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,720
standardizes labs

1119
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:47,519
for the requirements and it's just a

1120
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:50,399
systematic approach to documentation and

1121
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,759
that um and then the only thing that's

1122
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,160
important to remember is that

1123
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,200
accreditation the iso accreditation

1124
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:57,358
is

1125
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,439
there's a general accreditation that you

1126
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:02,559
can have for a site

1127
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,679
but more importantly the methods

1128
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:05,679
they are

1129
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:09,118
method specific

1130
00:43:05,679 --> 00:43:11,598
the iso accreditation and often can go

1131
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:13,760
down to the matrix

1132
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,318
that you have for your accreditation

1133
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,480
it's just another another an added layer

1134
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:21,358
of confidence that you have that there's

1135
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:23,199
a consistency in the practices of the

1136
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:25,119
lab in the testing and if you have an

1137
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:27,759
in-house lab if you want to

1138
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,200
have your own it's it's a good thing to

1139
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:31,200
help you be consistent

1140
00:43:31,519 --> 00:43:36,800
and at the end

1141
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:38,879
so we went through the risk base and

1142
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,560
that's the that's important to

1143
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:43,280
understand what your potential hazards

1144
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:45,039
are and that the

1145
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:47,119
it is important that you test your raw

1146
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:49,920
materials or at least know based the

1147
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,640
baseline of your products if you

1148
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:54,559
if the budget doesn't allow for every

1149
00:43:52,639 --> 00:43:57,039
lot or everything at least get the

1150
00:43:54,559 --> 00:43:58,639
baseline and understand

1151
00:43:57,039 --> 00:44:00,239
when it's related to your suppliers

1152
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:01,679
where you're sourcing it you don't have

1153
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:03,519
to test them

1154
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:07,279
every day or all the time just have an

1155
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,880
understanding of your baseline and then

1156
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,200
because of the complexity of the hemp

1157
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,039
matrix and the hemp extracts and the

1158
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:14,639
isolates that we

1159
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,279
get from them

1160
00:44:14,639 --> 00:44:20,000
we need to sometimes go look for

1161
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,680
technology to help us into figuring out

1162
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,119
those contaminants

1163
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:24,078
knowing what the contaminants are in our

1164
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,440
products

1165
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,519
and

1166
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:30,639
it's really important to use validated

1167
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:31,838
methods or the term fit for purpose so

1168
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,358
you know that

1169
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:38,000
what you have is important and then the

1170
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:40,000
iso accreditation adds another level of

1171
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,960
confidence for staff

1172
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,559
and

1173
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,559
that's it and thank you for listening

1174
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,399
so i think we have a little bit of time

1175
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,400
for questions

1176
00:44:57,679 --> 00:45:02,639
hi good morning good morning enjoyed

1177
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:04,159
your presentation by the way um

1178
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:05,358
love to get a copy of that study that

1179
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,799
you mentioned at the beginning of your

1180
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:09,519
talk

1181
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,920
sure we'll i'll send it to it was a

1182
00:45:09,519 --> 00:45:15,119
poster aoc poster and i can send you a

1183
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,519
copy of it okay um

1184
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,400
yeah i do have a question um i publish a

1185
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,159
lot

1186
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,280
in the field of heavy metals in cannabis

1187
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:21,960
and hemp

1188
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,359
and

1189
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:24,960
[Music]

1190
00:45:23,358 --> 00:45:26,719
i think there's compelling evidence out

1191
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,159
there that we need to be expanding the

1192
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,439
elemental panel beyond the big four

1193
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:32,799
there's a lot of information in the

1194
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,240
public domain

1195
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:36,240
how the pharmaceutical industry

1196
00:45:34,239 --> 00:45:38,559
approached that using a risk assessment

1197
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:41,118
strategy which to me

1198
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,400
is is guidance to the industry but it's

1199
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,680
convincing

1200
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,318
the industry that they should think

1201
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:47,199
about expanding the elemental panel and

1202
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:49,039
um

1203
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:49,838
yeah i can publish and i can talk about

1204
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:51,920
it

1205
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,759
in your conferences and i have a talk

1206
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:55,760
this afternoon at three o'clock but i

1207
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:57,280
just like to get your thoughts and input

1208
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,400
how we can convince the cannabis

1209
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,839
industry

1210
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,440
that they need to be expanding that

1211
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:04,559
elemental panel

1212
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,200
yes up to to date actually if we if we

1213
00:46:04,559 --> 00:46:10,078
go through to follow the

1214
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:13,039
pharma industry um we are currently

1215
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:14,960
doing a validation study and it has 17

1216
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,960
elements in it

1217
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,679
included for just for the release of

1218
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,720
their product which is um

1219
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:23,919
which is

1220
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:26,480
the trend so um

1221
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,800
going from four i i do agree with you

1222
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,318
that we there are some elements that we

1223
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,960
need to add

1224
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:35,119
to the four and

1225
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,960
but currently though the regulations

1226
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,358
only ask for the four and that may be

1227
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,599
once when state to state regulations

1228
00:46:41,358 --> 00:46:45,838
move to adding more elements then we

1229
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:49,119
would definitely have to to take a look

1230
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:51,039
at it luckily the methods

1231
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,200
the ic the heavy metal methods are

1232
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,639
easily extended

1233
00:46:53,199 --> 00:46:58,480
to include more elements in the testing

1234
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:00,879
so it's not a big jump

1235
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,358
um to go from four to a few more

1236
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:06,400
compounds except for you know maybe

1237
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,400
selenium and molybdenum and some of that

1238
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:11,400
which you may need a different mode of

1239
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,400
testing

1240
00:47:11,679 --> 00:47:15,519
so i believe your talk is at 3 pm this

1241
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:18,239
afternoon

1242
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:20,639
yes so if you're interested to hear

1243
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:22,000
learn more about heavy metals 3 pm this

1244
00:47:20,639 --> 00:47:25,480
afternoon

1245
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:25,480
any other questions

1246
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:31,440
well i think the next part is coffee

1247
00:47:29,358 --> 00:47:33,279
break

1248
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,599
so i think we should

1249
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,720
go and get our coffee break early thank

1250
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:40,800
you

1251
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,799
[Applause]
