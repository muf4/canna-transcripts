1
00:00:03,279 --> 00:00:09,439
well good morning everyone welcome back

2
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:12,080
thank you Ethan for a great opening

3
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,718
talk wait a moment for the slides to

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:18,480
come up

5
00:00:13,718 --> 00:00:21,399
so this talk um which I alluded to uh

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,800
yesterday in some ways kind of came out

7
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:26,759
of this experience that I had and that

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,118
Bonnie also shared that she had and some

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,199
of the other clinicians that have been

10
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,759
doing this for a while where we started

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,200
our career mostly working career in

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,280
cannabis I should say mostly just

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:39,760
working with THC with our patients and

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,879
then after a few years Along Came

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,920
another option to work with CBD and we

16
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,920
could combine that with THC and then

17
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,600
another option came along you know we

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,440
discovered the acidic cannabinoids had

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,719
value we kind of added those in and then

20
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:56,759
CBG came along and now there's some thcv

21
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:58,320
and cbdv and I can imagine that for a

22
00:00:56,759 --> 00:01:01,358
lot of people just coming into this

23
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,439
field it's a little over in because

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,519
there's a lot of options and many of

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:09,319
them have over overlapping therapeutic

26
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,158
effects therapeutic potential and you

27
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:12,679
see a certain patient with some symptoms

28
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,200
and you wonder well where the heck do I

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,118
start and so what I wanted to do with

30
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,879
this talk was just bring in some Basics

31
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:22,799
from the preclinical and clinical

32
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,920
literature to show you what happens when

33
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,118
we combine these cannabinoids I think we

34
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,519
all in this room are aware that their

35
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,519
combinations are often Superior to their

36
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,959
isolated usage but how do we how do we

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:38,438
do that how do we approach it and make

38
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:40,239
sense of it so and um and just for the

39
00:01:38,438 --> 00:01:42,559
folks in the back yesterday I had like a

40
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,640
full screen down here it's not essential

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,640
but it's a little easier to see so in

42
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,920
the next 28 minutes what we'll go

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,359
through is just a little reminder like

44
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,439
yesterday about how complex this is

45
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,000
we'll talk about the major chemotypes

46
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,919
acidic versus

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,920
decarbox the the role of choar I'll just

48
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,359
mention that and then the types of

49
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,000
interactions and then on the right

50
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:06,399
column here we're going to go through

51
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,478
all of these combinations some very

52
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,719
quickly what I'm really going to

53
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,680
emphasize is the THC plus CBD one

54
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:15,080
because I think a lot of us bring a

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:17,040
limited understanding of what happens

56
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,080
when we combine these and so I want to

57
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:23,199
go into some of those nuances and give a

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:25,160
more complete picture of that so uh

59
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:27,639
yesterday I talked about this is a

60
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:29,479
multi-compound multi-targeted medicine

61
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,479
that interfaces with the ECS there's

62
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,840
incred ible complexity here and if you

63
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,039
have this tendency to want to be

64
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,560
reductionistic and to really understand

65
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:40,519
what's happening at what receptors you

66
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,239
know that might help in some cases but I

67
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,680
think what's more helpful is to kind of

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,400
zoom out and look at uh pattern

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,280
recognition and Trends and and what

70
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,400
we're seeing with our patients and also

71
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:52,199
in the

72
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:55,280
literature there are four main

73
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:57,959
chemotypes of cannabis this is just the

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,598
the nomenclature chemotype 1 is THC

75
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,280
dominant chemotype 2 has a relative

76
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:08,280
balance of THC and CBD three is CBD

77
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,280
dominant four CBG dominant there are

78
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,919
some thcv rich varieties of cannabis I

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,878
don't know that we have any that are

80
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:18,199
truly thcv dominant without you know the

81
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,919
very Trace levels of the others yet but

82
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,878
I'm sure that's coming and so this is

83
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:25,079
what I want to use as a framework for

84
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:28,120
thinking about when a patient comes in

85
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,280
to see me where am I going to start I'm

86
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,719
going to start with typ Al one of these

87
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,400
major chemotypes you know and then

88
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:37,759
within each one there's this question

89
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,519
about is it in the acidic or raw state

90
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,959
or is it decarbox which can be very

91
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,920
different in some

92
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,640
cases and um and then Within These

93
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:49,000
chemotypes of course there's different

94
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,119
chemo vars the different varieties that

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,400
can have very different properties you

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,840
know very distinct properties but the

97
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,000
way I see that in in a lot of cases most

98
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,840
most of the time is like the

99
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,878
old-fashioned radio where you have the

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,120
big tuning knob to kind of find the

101
00:04:01,878 --> 00:04:06,280
station and then the little tuning knob

102
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,560
to do the fine tuning I consider the

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:11,598
chemotypes like the big tuning and the

104
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,598
the chemo vars uh the the finer tuning

105
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:16,560
to really dial it in to maximize the

106
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,358
benefits or minimize the adverse effects

107
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,519
and um I'm not going to talk a lot about

108
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,599
the chemo virus here even though some of

109
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,280
them are very special and there can be

110
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:27,680
highly selective responses um that's

111
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:29,959
also a hard thing to accomplish because

112
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,000
the naming is all over the place and the

113
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:34,159
consistency from one batch or one store

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,279
to the next is problematic so I I

115
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,039
encourage you to focus on the chemotypes

116
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:39,879
especially if you're getting started

117
00:04:38,038 --> 00:04:41,719
here and even if you're not and then the

118
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:43,560
two main types of interactions that we

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,240
might be thinking about here are the

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,879
pharmacokinetic interactions which are

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,240
interactions having to do with

122
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:53,719
absorption metabolism excretion

123
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,160
distribution and the pharmacodynamics

124
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,639
having to do with their actual

125
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,280
physiologic

126
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,478
effects and so uh well I'll apologize in

127
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,559
advance it looks like the formatting got

128
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:07,359
a little messed up I did correct it this

129
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,800
morning but some of the slide some of

130
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,960
the images here are going to have a

131
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,400
clear background instead of a white one

132
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:15,799
and I apologize for that so here's an

133
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,879
example of a PK interaction this was a

134
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,600
really interesting uh rodent study where

135
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,079
they compared blood levels of canabo

136
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,639
administered in a full spectrum extract

137
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,439
with the same quantities of those canabo

138
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,639
but administered alone and they were

139
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:33,839
given orally to mice in a single

140
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,800
dose and so this is what it looks like

141
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:37,399
this full spectrum extract as you can

142
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,879
see here it had a little bit of just

143
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,159
about everything it was around half

144
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:47,279
decarbox or or somewhere in that range

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:52,759
there was CBD cbda THC thca and and um

146
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:54,959
cbdv a cbga and so they tested those six

147
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,439
isolated canids in the same quantity

148
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,359
against the full extract and what they

149
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:00,800
found here here's an example with CBD

150
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:05,360
and this this is kind of what you would

151
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:08,800
expect in the uh light uh colored uh

152
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,639
line here we have the purified CBD and

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,918
in the dark we have the same quantity of

154
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:15,120
CBD in the context of the extract and

155
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:18,000
you see there's much better absorption

156
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,639
with the purified CBD and and the

157
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,199
typical reason for that is that fat

158
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,199
soluble compounds when they're taken

159
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,478
orally at the same time they compete

160
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,639
with each other for some absorption you

161
00:06:25,478 --> 00:06:29,680
see this with fat soluble vitamins and

162
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,560
and other compounds

163
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,280
but what they didn't expect was this so

164
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,879
here we have

165
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,918
cbda getting absorbed much better in the

166
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:44,719
context of the full extract than it did

167
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:47,439
in the isolated form it was 14 times

168
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,599
higher area under the curve so what the

169
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,639
heck was going on there why did cbda get

170
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,918
absorbed so much

171
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:57,120
better and uh the diligent researchers

172
00:06:54,918 --> 00:06:59,719
this was uh Jonathan Arnold's group out

173
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:01,560
of Australia they ended up figuring out

174
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,560
that this happened to do this had to do

175
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,399
with an elux pump in the intestinal

176
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:09,000
border and so just to orient you I I'll

177
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:11,918
show it on on this slide here we have

178
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,079
the the uh Lum the Lumen of the

179
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,918
intestine would be here and here's the

180
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:20,198
blood supply and so when the canabo get

181
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,680
absorbed some of them are kicked back

182
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,520
into the Lumen through this efux pump

183
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:29,038
and what the researchers discovered was

184
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:32,598
that low amounts of CBG or THC would

185
00:07:29,038 --> 00:07:35,159
inhibit that brcp elux pump prevent the

186
00:07:32,598 --> 00:07:37,759
cbda from getting kicked back out and

187
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:40,160
therefore increase the absorption of

188
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,000
cbda now this was in rodents we don't

189
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
know if this is exactly the case in

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,279
humans but we do see very high levels of

191
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,680
cbda bioavailability when taken orally

192
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:52,519
in humans so there's a high likelihood

193
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,598
so this what would be the take-home from

194
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:57,359
this it might be that if you're using

195
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,120
cbda it would probably be helpful to

196
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:03,680
have a little THC or a little CB G with

197
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,439
it to maximize the potential for

198
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,478
absorption all right so that's an

199
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:09,959
example of a PK interaction now let's

200
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:13,758
move on to the the main topic here which

201
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:16,158
is THC and CBD and we'll start with kind

202
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,720
of where we're all coming from here's a

203
00:08:16,158 --> 00:08:22,079
study of 177 patients with cancer pain

204
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:24,639
who are on opioids they were treated

205
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:28,000
either with nmols the THC CBD

206
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,960
combination or the same dose of THC or

207
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
or the same um

208
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:36,559
basically spray method of THC alone and

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,158
they were allowed to titrate up to

210
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:40,278
however many sprays was effective

211
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:42,038
without adverse effects and then looked

212
00:08:40,278 --> 00:08:44,679
at the levels of pain it turned out that

213
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:47,199
the people who were receiving the THC

214
00:08:44,679 --> 00:08:48,958
CBD combo they ended up using somewhat

215
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,399
more sprays not a lot but a little bit

216
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:53,039
more sprays per day on average and

217
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,759
that's likely because it was somewhat

218
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:58,759
better tolerated but then if you look at

219
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:01,519
the at the results here so this first

220
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:03,439
one is a a 10% or greater reduction in

221
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,000
pain and there's really no difference in

222
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,959
the proportion of people that achieve

223
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,679
that between THC or combination THC CBD

224
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:13,799
but this is more clinically relevant 30%

225
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,120
reduction in pain or greater and you can

226
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,919
see quite a big difference here much you

227
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:22,679
know about 40% more of the people in the

228
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,919
THC CBD group achiev that compared to

229
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:27,359
THC alone and the adverse effects in

230
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,559
both groups were similar because they

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,200
were allowed to titrate in the way that

232
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:37,679
wanted to and so the the idea here is

233
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,879
that uh THC was um causing some side

234
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,159
effects that limited the dose and CBD

235
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,879
was probably mitigating that while

236
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,600
adding some of its own benefits and that

237
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,679
that's kind of what we what we tend to

238
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:50,759
think about with t CBD you know add it

239
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:52,359
to THC you're going to mitigate the

240
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,078
adverse effects you're going to enhance

241
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,000
the benefits it makes perfect sense

242
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:58,199
let's put them together and I think that

243
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,278
a lot of times that's the case and it's

244
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,839
certainly the case with the severe

245
00:10:00,278 --> 00:10:04,679
adverse effects this is showing toxic

246
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,480
psychosis threshold in terms of

247
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:12,919
milligrams of THC taken orally and um

248
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,720
this is from a paper from Ethan in 2018

249
00:10:12,919 --> 00:10:17,679
and when you look at you know just pure

250
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,040
THC around 18 milligram that could cause

251
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:22,639
toxic psychosis in some people of course

252
00:10:20,039 --> 00:10:24,559
it's a temporary experience but when

253
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:27,319
it's combined with CBD you need a much

254
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:30,359
higher dose to achieve that severe

255
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,720
adverse side effect so this is a summary

256
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,680
slide I'm going to keep coming back to

257
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:38,278
pharmacodynamic interaction is that CBD

258
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,278
is a negative alisic modulator at CB1

259
00:10:38,278 --> 00:10:42,320
and it can dampen the adverse effects

260
00:10:40,278 --> 00:10:45,120
especially the more severe ones now

261
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,560
here's a study in fibromyalgia patients

262
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,679
who were vaporizing cannabis either type

263
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:55,239
1 type two or type three or Placebo and

264
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:58,278
they were looking at their uh subjective

265
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:00,959
pain results after vaporization but also

266
00:10:58,278 --> 00:11:02,759
at their blood levels of cannabinoids

267
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:07,119
and what they found was that CBD

268
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:09,159
inhalation increased the THC plasma

269
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,120
concentrations but diminished the

270
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:12,879
analgesic effects these authors

271
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,519
suggested this was a synergistic

272
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:18,078
pharmacokinetic interaction meaning the

273
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,120
presence of the CBD slowed down the

274
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:23,000
metabolism of THC allowing for there to

275
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,000
be higher levels but an antagonistic

276
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,120
pharmacodynamic interaction those higher

277
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,039
levels did not result in better pain

278
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,639
relief it actually resulted in less pain

279
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:36,759
Rel belief and so um there were also uh

280
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,039
reductions in spontaneous pain in the

281
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:40,559
study that correlated with the

282
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:43,278
subjective rating of drug high so what

283
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:46,439
does that mean that means that to help

284
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,519
the pain in these fibromyalgia patients

285
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,560
it seemed like approaching this

286
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:54,320
psychoactive this THC effect is what was

287
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:56,719
really helping them the most and CBD

288
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,240
diminishes that so the question is

289
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,480
beyond dampening and adverse effects can

290
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,720
adding CBD to THC dampen the therapeutic

291
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,839
effects and I think in some cases the

292
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,278
answer is yes and then we have this

293
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:12,680
pharmac pharmacokinetic interaction

294
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:15,399
where CBD could be increasing THC levels

295
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:17,719
by slowing its metabolism now here's

296
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:21,679
another study and I apologize again for

297
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:25,680
the slides THC versus a ratio of 1 to3

298
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:27,479
THC CBD vaporized in adults and in

299
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,239
adolescents uh looking at their

300
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,759
subjective experiences after doing this

301
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,720
and this would correspond to about a

302
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:37,439
quarter of a typical joint the dose of

303
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,680
THC that they were getting 8 mg and what

304
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,480
they found was that the combination of

305
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:44,239
THC and CBD at this 1:3 ratio was no

306
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,399
less psychoactive than the equivalent

307
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,680
dose of THC CBD augmented THC levels

308
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,320
again so it's that pharmacokinetic

309
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:56,239
interaction slowing the breakdown of THC

310
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,720
but despite higher plasma levels of THC

311
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,919
and that combination treatment uh the

312
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,199
stronger effects were not absor not

313
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:06,639
observed uh likely again due to that

314
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:08,359
phod dnamic antagonism so the group that

315
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,000
received the combination had higher

316
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:13,039
levels of THC but did not have more

317
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,958
psychoactive

318
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:18,759
effects and then here's a study that was

319
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:21,679
a double blind randomized control trial

320
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:24,720
with 26 healthy cannabis users that were

321
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:28,799
vaporizing either THC combination THC

322
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,759
CBD or CBD or Placebo again uh and

323
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,439
looking at their driving performance and

324
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:36,519
a simulation and what they found was

325
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:39,519
that the group that had THC dominant

326
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:41,879
only no CBD they were this is their

327
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:43,600
standard deviation of lane lane position

328
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:46,679
basically how much are they swerving

329
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,040
back and forth and that uh deviation was

330
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:52,799
2.33 CM on average the combination of

331
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,958
THC and CBD actually had a stronger

332
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:59,319
deviation and the CBD dominant uh Vapor

333
00:13:55,958 --> 00:14:02,119
didn't change it at all but what's

334
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:06,759
interesting is the cut off here 2.4

335
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,839
cm is considered typical of a 05% blood

336
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,600
alcohol concentration and is thought to

337
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:14,320
indicate clinically relevant driving

338
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,839
impairment so in this case the same dose

339
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,680
of THC administered with

340
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:23,639
CBD was more impairing slightly more

341
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:25,799
impairing than THC alone now what what's

342
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:28,278
going on there well first of all that

343
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,359
and that was just at um that was at the

344
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:34,399
40 to1 100 minutes test there was no

345
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,320
change later on at 240 to 300 in any

346
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,000
group the drivers who consumed THC were

347
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,839
generally more aware that their driving

348
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,839
was impaired but the group that received

349
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,920
both had less anxiety they also rated

350
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:50,639
the drug effect as lower and they had

351
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,719
higher ratings of confidence to drive

352
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,278
than THC alone so these findings

353
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,720
challenge the myth that CBD can amarate

354
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:01,720
the psychoactive effects of THC what

355
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,639
what seems to be happening here is that

356
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:08,040
CBD mitigated the THC induced anxiety

357
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:10,278
which it tends to do but maybe a little

358
00:15:08,039 --> 00:15:13,360
THC induced anxiety is a good thing if

359
00:15:10,278 --> 00:15:18,958
you're about to get behind the

360
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:21,199
wheel and so um beyond beyond decreasing

361
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:23,198
the adverse effects and decreasing the

362
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:26,439
therapeutic effects could the

363
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:29,278
combination of THC and CBD decrease the

364
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,000
awareness of the impairment or increase

365
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,639
the anxiety related to impairment and

366
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,399
therefore increase the risk I think this

367
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,440
study suggests that that's

368
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:40,879
possible and it's probably not in

369
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,519
everyone but there might be some

370
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:47,000
settings and some patients where that's

371
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:50,318
going to happen now um this is a uh

372
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,198
strange study uh because it it was uh it

373
00:15:50,318 --> 00:15:56,000
involved a very high doable THC and CBD

374
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,278
taken orally in a brownie along with a

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,078
whole cocktail of other cyp drugs I'm

376
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:02,399
not going to spend lot of time on it but

377
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:08,559
the brownie either had 20 milligram of

378
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:12,120
THC or 20 Mig of THC and 640 Mig of CBD

379
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:15,679
so this was a 1 to 32 ratio of THC to

380
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,839
CBD pretty strong brownies but the um

381
00:16:15,679 --> 00:16:19,799
the people who received the combination

382
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:22,160
with this high dose of THC were more

383
00:16:19,799 --> 00:16:24,559
impaired and they rated the experience

384
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,600
as Less Pleasant than the people who

385
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,119
received the the 20 migs of THC alone

386
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,920
now a lot of you are probably surprised

387
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,959
by this you're thinking well if I if I

388
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:35,318
overdose on THC but I'm taking it with

389
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:37,119
this massive dose of CBD isn't that

390
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,000
going to dampen down the activity at the

391
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,240
CB1 receptor and protect me from feeling

392
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,559
too stoned well in this case which was

393
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,000
an unusual study it didn't and um what's

394
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:51,159
hard to see on these uh line graphs here

395
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,559
is that the plasma levels of THC and of

396
00:16:51,159 --> 00:16:57,559
11 hydroxy THC were much higher in the

397
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:00,119
group that had the brownie with the CBD

398
00:16:57,559 --> 00:17:02,518
in it compared to the THC brownie alone

399
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:05,000
so there is significant

400
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:07,558
pharmacokinetic uh synergism Happening

401
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:10,679
Here increasing the levels of THC and 11

402
00:17:07,558 --> 00:17:10,678
hydroxy which are both

403
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:18,038
psychoactive so the question is um is

404
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:20,279
there a pharmacokinetic potential to

405
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:22,519
increase impairment at high doses when

406
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:24,558
CBD and THC are taken together and I

407
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,679
think the answer is

408
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:30,119
yes now here's an interesting study on

409
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,759
some uh Young people with epilepsy

410
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,239
treated in the UK and they had a variety

411
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:38,839
of treatments that they could start with

412
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:43,000
there was the CBD broad spectrum the CBD

413
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:44,399
isolate the um and the CBD we could call

414
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,519
it full spectrum in the study they

415
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,160
called it broadspectrum plus

416
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:51,359
THC um but those those were the options

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:55,038
for treatment and I think if you can see

418
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:58,479
this and follow it along uh only four of

419
00:17:55,038 --> 00:18:01,038
the 35 patients ended up starting off

420
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,440
with this broadspectrum plus THC pretty

421
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:05,640
much everyone started with either CBD

422
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,919
isolate or CBD broadspectrum but when it

423
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:09,799
didn't work they would move on to a

424
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,759
different treatment and this is where

425
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:16,079
they ended up down here and so just to

426
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:19,240
summarize these results on the next

427
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:21,359
slide in in total of the 17 who tried

428
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:24,200
THC 16

429
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:28,079
responded and 13 of them tried CBD

430
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,679
dominant no THC first and then of

431
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,119
everyone that re responded to the THC

432
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,038
treatment all of them were also taking

433
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:38,599
very high doses of CBD at the same time

434
00:18:36,038 --> 00:18:40,879
was this necessary was this needed maybe

435
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:42,918
in some it was and some it wasn't but

436
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:46,360
kind of a waste of time for many of them

437
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:49,320
starting with this CBD isolate and CBD

438
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:52,759
broadspectrum with zero THC and so I

439
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:54,720
bring that up because in this situation

440
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:58,079
what I'm suggesting is that lowd dose

441
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:01,120
THC in many cases can add benefit to

442
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,960
high dose CBD and if you get a partial

443
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:08,279
response with high does CBD switching

444
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,279
over to a full spectrum extract might be

445
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:13,319
helpful so um so that's all I've got for

446
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,440
this and we'll we'll summarize it again

447
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:16,759
later but this is you know I'm I hope

448
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
that I've brought in your mind a little

449
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:21,440
bit about some of the potentials for THC

450
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,080
and CBD to interact with each other

451
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,960
pharmacodynamically and

452
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:27,519
pharmacokinetically when taken via

453
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:30,720
inhalation and when taken

454
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:33,519
orally let's let's move on to thca this

455
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,079
is pharmacologically distinct from THC

456
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:37,839
it is not psychoactive it has a lot of

457
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:40,158
beneficial properties

458
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:43,399
anti-inflammatory neuroprotective

459
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:45,159
hepatoprotective antiemetic uh very very

460
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,720
strong anti-emetic a lot of people don't

461
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,799
think about that with

462
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:53,319
thca many other

463
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,079
targets and thca is is different than

464
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:59,079
THC especially because it doesn't act

465
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:02,839
upon the CB1 receptor at least not as a

466
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:04,519
partial Agonist like THC does and so how

467
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:08,038
do these two go together well they have

468
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,639
similar metabolism and so you there even

469
00:20:08,038 --> 00:20:11,400
though this hasn't been shown that I'm

470
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:14,360
aware of in humans there's likely going

471
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:17,759
to be pharmacokinetic agonism there if

472
00:20:14,359 --> 00:20:20,079
you take thca with THC it's likely to

473
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:22,440
slow the breakdown and could potentiate

474
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,279
the THC pharmacokinetically there was

475
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:29,120
also one study in rodents that showed

476
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,918
that thca was acting as a CB1 positive

477
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:35,319
allosteric modulator now this is

478
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:37,000
exciting because uh this would be you

479
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,399
know if this is the case a positive

480
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,119
alisic modulator at CB1 has great

481
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:45,440
therapeutic potential when we take THC

482
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:47,479
as a CB1 Agonist we are globally

483
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,558
affecting our endoc canabo system which

484
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,558
can be a good thing but I think

485
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:53,519
affecting our endoc canabo system with

486
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:57,279
with greater Precision the Precision

487
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:59,279
involved with our endoc canabo synthesis

488
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:01,240
would be in many cases Cas is even

489
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:03,639
better so imagine if we could use

490
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:06,720
something like thca to selectively

491
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,200
enhance CB1 signaling where it's

492
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,640
happening when and where it's happening

493
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,798
in the body based on the wisdom and

494
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,278
precision of our own endoc canabo system

495
00:21:12,798 --> 00:21:17,599
so and there's been a lot of pH

496
00:21:15,278 --> 00:21:20,278
pharmaceutical uh exploration looking

497
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:22,959
for a good positive alisic modulator for

498
00:21:20,278 --> 00:21:26,278
this reason now cannabis te is a great

499
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,720
delivery method for thca especially

500
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:30,440
because the solubility of thca is much

501
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,000
greater in water if especially if you're

502
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:36,400
not adding anything like cream to the

503
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,519
water you're going to have at most a 1

504
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:42,759
to5 ratio of THC to thca so you get a

505
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:45,839
lot more thca when you make cannabis

506
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:48,599
T now let's switch gears to CBD plus

507
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:51,798
cbda while THC and thca are quite

508
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:54,158
different CBD and cbda are very similar

509
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:56,278
they have many similar Targets in the

510
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:59,080
body but one of the main differences is

511
00:21:56,278 --> 00:22:01,759
at the CB1 receptor so all that I showed

512
00:21:59,079 --> 00:22:04,639
you about CBD interacting with THC

513
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:06,359
pharmacode dynamically dampening those

514
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,640
effects through negative alisic

515
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:12,759
modulation this is not likely to happen

516
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:15,919
with cbda cbda is also more bioavailable

517
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:19,158
but CBD has greater ability to cross the

518
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:21,320
bloodb brain barrier and so what are the

519
00:22:19,159 --> 00:22:23,880
take-homes from this CBD is also much

520
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:26,759
more excuse me cbda is also much more

521
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:29,600
potent than CBD at least in many animal

522
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:31,759
models like 10x the the potency of CBD

523
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:33,158
in a rodent model of D syndrome even

524
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,798
though it barely crosses the bloodb

525
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:38,200
brain barrier 100x the potency of CBD in

526
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,918
a model of

527
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:44,278
hyperalgesia and 10,000 times the

528
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,440
potency of CBD in a rodent model of

529
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,558
nausea vomiting so cbda can be more

530
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,880
bioavailable and more potent these

531
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:56,000
rodent studies don't rely on oral

532
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,799
absorption their their int peraonal

533
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:02,038
injection and then it really makes some

534
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:04,000
sense to combine cbda with THC

535
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,440
especially in people that do well with

536
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,480
THC and that don't want the potential of

537
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:14,000
dampening the pH pharmaco um of

538
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,360
dampening the therapeutic effects of the

539
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,159
THC right we're we're avoiding that

540
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:21,959
negative aleric modulation so cbda and

541
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,919
THC go really well together as

542
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,400
demonstrated in this model of

543
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,799
inflammatory pain where the tiniest

544
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,519
doses I'm not going to get into it that

545
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:32,879
was my lecture last year but if you see

546
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:35,400
this study you wouldn't believe how low

547
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,360
the doses were that were effective when

548
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:42,519
combining cbda and THC for inflammatory

549
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,119
pain now U moving on to

550
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:47,480
CBG CBG has many mechanisms of action

551
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:49,599
but one of them that I think is worth

552
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:52,240
bringing up in this lecture is its

553
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:54,798
activity at the 5 ht1a serotonin

554
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,839
receptor the serotonin this serotonin

555
00:23:54,798 --> 00:24:00,918
receptor is thought to be the target of

556
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:04,399
CBD and cbda a in its anti-anxiety and

557
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:07,600
anti-nausea effects CBG has been shown

558
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:11,519
to be a neutral antagonist at this

559
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:13,599
receptor and um could potentially oppose

560
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:16,839
some of the effects of CBD at least in

561
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:19,719
one animal study um it was shown to

562
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,399
oppose the anti-emetic effects of CBD

563
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:24,200
and it could be unpredictable when

564
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:25,960
combined with other serotonergic agents

565
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,120
I haven't seen a lot of this but it's a

566
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,840
caution maybe I've seen a couple cases

567
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:33,398
now where CBG seems to have altered the

568
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:35,519
effects of CBD but it's something just

569
00:24:33,398 --> 00:24:37,119
to watch for if you're using them

570
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:38,918
together I think in most cases they go

571
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:42,519
really well together and remember this

572
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:46,840
is just one of their targets one of

573
00:24:42,519 --> 00:24:49,079
many for example CBG is also a par gamma

574
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:53,918
uh Agonist with stronger Affinity than

575
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:57,359
THC or CBD and um in Vivo this was shown

576
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:59,038
in animals where CBG could enhance or

577
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,038
the the effects of CB BG on this

578
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:03,960
receptor were enhanced by CBD so I think

579
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:05,640
combining these two there's some

580
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,200
potential for antagonism there's some

581
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:11,159
potential for

582
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:14,600
synergism and then U moving on to

583
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:18,080
thcv this is a CB1 antagonist at low

584
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:19,959
doses a CB1 Agonist at higher doses it's

585
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:23,079
probably most well known for producing

586
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,240
weight loss and decreasing uh body fat

587
00:25:23,079 --> 00:25:28,599
uh it also has anti-convulsant

588
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:31,240
properties and um it lacks the adverse

589
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:34,480
effects of inverse agon agonists like

590
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:37,159
Rano so rabant is a CB1 blocker the

591
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,480
anti- munchy drug that was marketed in

592
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:42,080
Europe and almost here in the US but it

593
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,000
makes people really upset and suicidal

594
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:48,480
not a good idea to block cv1 in humans

595
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:50,759
thcv can gently block CB1 uh and get

596
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,159
some of those same metabolic benefits

597
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:55,119
without causing those types of adverse

598
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,720
effects actually it can be experienced

599
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:59,398
as quite

600
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,880
uplifting but that's us usually in well

601
00:25:59,398 --> 00:26:03,439
even even when administered is an

602
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:05,640
isolate and so this was a a study that

603
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,640
looked at a very low dose of thcv in

604
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,679
humans 5 milligrams taken orally twice

605
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,919
daily for 13 weeks it decreased uh

606
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,159
fasting glucose it increased at a ptin

607
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,520
it improved beta cell function um there

608
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,799
were mild to moderate adverse effects

609
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,000
but when the thcv was combined with CBD

610
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:28,639
those metabolic benefits vanished even

611
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,880
when it was combined with a low dose of

612
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:36,799
CBD they they tested it both against 5

613
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:39,480
milligram of CBD and 100 Mig of CBD and

614
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,960
those metabolic benefits vanished so

615
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,519
very interesting that CBD May attenuate

616
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,960
or remove some of the benefits of thcv

617
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:50,440
so let's review all of this and then

618
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:53,919
we'll do a quick case THC and CBG May

619
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:58,759
enhance the absorption of cbda via the

620
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:02,000
intestinal e-lux pump CBD and THC have

621
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,398
pharmacokinetic agonism and

622
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,200
pharmacodynamic antagonism sometimes

623
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:07,678
that antagonism is good because it's

624
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,720
blocking the side effects sometimes it

625
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,960
might not be good because it's blocking

626
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,200
the therapeutic effects and there are

627
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:16,120
complex cognitive and subjective effects

628
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,038
including more confidence driving in

629
00:27:16,119 --> 00:27:23,038
that one study cbda and CBD are similar

630
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:26,038
and likely have pharmacokinetic agonism

631
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:29,960
and different potency and brain

632
00:27:26,038 --> 00:27:32,679
penetration thca and THC are distinct in

633
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:35,200
their activity they likely synergize

634
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,159
pharmacokinetically thca may be a

635
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,840
positive ostero alisic modulator at CB1

636
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:43,559
which could enhance endoc canabo

637
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:47,158
function and enhance the activity of

638
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:48,918
THC cbda and THC may have some

639
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,679
synergistic effects together in

640
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:54,080
inflammatory pain with ultra low oral

641
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:58,200
Doses and in general seems to be a good

642
00:27:54,079 --> 00:28:01,359
combination for my patients CBG can be

643
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,278
synergistically with CBD via parar gamma

644
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:06,599
May block some of the serotonergic

645
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:10,759
effects and CBG cannot replace THC or

646
00:28:06,599 --> 00:28:12,398
CBD but it adds distinct effects so I I

647
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:15,000
I know that when you're thinking what

648
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,719
should I do switch or add I think that

649
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,038
sometimes the combination of all of them

650
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,798
can be useful but we wouldn't start

651
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:25,319
there CBD can block the metabolic

652
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:27,038
benefits of thcv so my recommendations

653
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,960
when you're approaching a patient and

654
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:30,839
you're thinking where do I start start

655
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,278
work with full spectrum chemotype

656
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:35,319
categories think to yourself am I going

657
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,919
to start with one 2 3 or four what

658
00:28:35,319 --> 00:28:40,079
what's what am I coming out of the gates

659
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:43,278
with try one at a time explore dose

660
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:44,839
response effects and then add or switch

661
00:28:43,278 --> 00:28:46,240
so you have kind of a starting dose you

662
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:47,839
have a dose that you're going to titrate

663
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,159
up to if there's no adverse effects

664
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,158
you're going to see how they do within

665
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:52,960
that range as Bonnie says you're kind of

666
00:28:51,159 --> 00:28:55,799
ruling it in or ruling it out is this

667
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,319
chemotype going to be effective and then

668
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,639
depending on how far you get you can

669
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,200
switch to something else or you can

670
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,120
layer something else on top I still

671
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,558
think that the combination of THC and

672
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:08,839
CBD this type two is a great place to

673
00:29:05,558 --> 00:29:11,278
start it's very effective but if you're

674
00:29:08,839 --> 00:29:14,158
relying on it to produce decreased

675
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,798
psycho activity that that may not be the

676
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,200
outcome that you see in everyone it's

677
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:21,079
certainly going to be that way in some

678
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:23,200
people include at least a little thca

679
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:25,278
with your THC trust me don't fully

680
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,399
decarb your THC it's going to work

681
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,278
better if you don't um the possible

682
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,000
exception to that is in people that need

683
00:29:30,278 --> 00:29:35,159
THC but are Ultra sensitive to it and

684
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,880
you want to have a you know a more

685
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:40,760
precise low dose include at least a

686
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,760
little cbda with your CBD they work

687
00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:46,839
similarly and the cbda is much stronger

688
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:50,200
include at least a little THC or CBG

689
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:52,319
with your cbda to enhance its absorption

690
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,120
observe closely when you're adding CBG

691
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:57,720
to CBD you might not get what you expect

692
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:59,558
and avoid CBD with thcv if you're

693
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:02,038
looking for the metabolic benefits these

694
00:29:59,558 --> 00:30:03,519
are some general recommendations things

695
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:06,319
to look for and I'll give a quick case

696
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,798
in the next last minute here so autism

697
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:10,519
spectrum disorder age five came in with

698
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,879
nighttime Awakenings intermittent

699
00:30:10,519 --> 00:30:15,359
aggression and hand biting so I started

700
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:17,200
him on a balanced ratio the the products

701
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:18,798
that we work with that I get the the

702
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:21,480
great pleasure of working with I've

703
00:30:18,798 --> 00:30:24,119
designed and uh healer makes so this is

704
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:26,519
our one: one but it's actually a 1: one

705
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:30,518
to one: one it it's half DEC

706
00:30:26,519 --> 00:30:32,599
carboxilate um one drop is 1 milligram

707
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:34,640
and so he started off with five drops in

708
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:37,678
the morning so a little more than 1

709
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,480
milligram of each of those and um and

710
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,399
then I chose a formula called healer

711
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:45,839
pain at night which was a THC to thca

712
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,398
one:1 formula for for bedtime and the

713
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,079
reason I chose that was really because I

714
00:30:47,398 --> 00:30:53,398
wanted to incrementally adjust in half

715
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:56,879
milligrams instead of full milligrams of

716
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:59,079
THC and so uh came back one month later

717
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:00,278
Global Improvement in all areas he's at

718
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:02,519
peace the medicine has been a

719
00:31:00,278 --> 00:31:03,960
GameChanger I'm in absolute awe of how

720
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:05,960
it has changed his life he's even

721
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,399
willing to try more Foods he had

722
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,960
titrated up to 15 drops of balance in

723
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:14,599
the morning so almost 4 milligram of THC

724
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,480
in that dose 10 drops in the afternoon 2

725
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:20,199
and2 milligrams uh pain was four drops

726
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:22,440
before bed so 2 milligrams before bed

727
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:24,600
but 4 months later he had started public

728
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,480
school and his symptoms worsened they

729
00:31:24,599 --> 00:31:28,119
had had titrated up on the balance

730
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,399
formula so we were still exploring the

731
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:33,079
dose response curve we went up on the

732
00:31:30,398 --> 00:31:35,398
balance and the pain symptoms improved

733
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:37,439
some but he was still pushing his peers

734
00:31:35,398 --> 00:31:39,398
attempting to bite others slapping

735
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,840
himself in the face waking up at 3:00 or

736
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:44,759
4 in the morning and he was still making

737
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:46,480
developmental progress so uh we changed

738
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,398
the nighttime formula to our more

739
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,919
sedating THC dominant healer Knight and

740
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,038
then we started adding our CBG formula

741
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,000
during the day he started sleeping

742
00:31:54,038 --> 00:31:57,440
through the night squeezing or giving a

743
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,440
little pinch instead of being more

744
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,159
aggressive

745
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,360
was stable at 25 and 20 drops of balance

746
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,600
in the morning and the night again

747
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:07,479
that's so that's around almost 6

748
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,638
milligrams of THC in the morning and

749
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:12,919
five in the not in the night but in the

750
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:15,959
afternoon CBG 10 milligrams twice daily

751
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:17,480
night 6 milligrams before bed and the

752
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,038
efficacy was maintained for the

753
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,880
following six months so I think that

754
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,638
shows you a case where here's what I

755
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,720
decided to start with balance during the

756
00:32:22,638 --> 00:32:27,959
day THC dominant at night symptoms

757
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:29,600
returned I titrated up we didn't get the

758
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,038
results we were looking for we layered

759
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,480
in CBG that was my next choice and we

760
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,519
got the symptoms under control and that

761
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,839
is all I have for you today thank you so

762
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,250
much

763
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,250
[Applause]
