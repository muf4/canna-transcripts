1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:10,780
appreciate the opportunity to to talk to

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,689
doctors UN patients are the people who

3
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:15,820
are going to bring us to freedom and

4
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:18,129
better health and I appreciate your

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,079
attendance here I'm going to talk to you

6
00:00:18,129 --> 00:00:22,419
about how to legally recommend cannabis

7
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,919
to your patients which is certainly more

8
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:25,410
about protecting your license than

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,230
protecting your patients

10
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:33,399
marijuana has a cannabis as a quite a

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:35,259
range of safety and the licensing issues

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,390
are more political than about the

13
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:38,858
carrier your clients I'm going to talk

14
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:40,838
about the scope of my talk is going to

15
00:00:38,859 --> 00:00:43,749
be about talking about medical cannabis

16
00:00:40,838 --> 00:00:45,248
practice in two contexts and first in

17
00:00:43,749 --> 00:00:47,499
terms of the federal regulation of the

18
00:00:45,249 --> 00:00:49,420
Controlled Substances licenses that many

19
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:52,109
of you have and secondly in terms of

20
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:55,149
state physician and healthcare provider

21
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:56,798
licensing boards the state level so that

22
00:00:55,149 --> 00:00:58,569
would be in Massachusetts the board of

23
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:00,249
registration and medicine and the board

24
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:03,338
of registration in nursing and just a

25
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:06,609
footnote on that nurse practitioners

26
00:01:03,338 --> 00:01:08,769
have had certifying authority since 2014

27
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:11,379
as a matter of state law and as a matter

28
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:12,969
of the nursing board regulations but the

29
00:01:11,379 --> 00:01:15,759
Department of Public Health which is

30
00:01:12,969 --> 00:01:17,950
tasked with overseeing the medical

31
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:20,469
cannabis law in Massachusetts has failed

32
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:23,140
to accommodate that in their regulations

33
00:01:20,469 --> 00:01:25,480
there are regulations pending to do that

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:27,760
and my latest information is that

35
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,370
perhaps in June they will become final

36
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:32,109
so that that nurse practitioners can be

37
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,170
included as well so let me talk about

38
00:01:32,109 --> 00:01:36,939
the feds hopefully quickly we all know

39
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:39,370
that cannabis is a Schedule one

40
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:40,359
designation with no medical use so

41
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,540
therefore there's no prescription

42
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:45,459
Authority for that and this is in spite

43
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,870
of the fact that the Department of

44
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:49,689
Health and Human Services of the federal

45
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:54,490
government has had a patent since 2003

46
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:57,069
for medical cannabis is antioxidant

47
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,899
effect this is also in spite of several

48
00:01:57,069 --> 00:02:01,059
lawsuits that have documented the

49
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:05,620
medical benefits of cannabis and that

50
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:07,450
the federal courts have allowed to have

51
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,118
refused to get involved in the

52
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:12,968
rescheduling process so state medical

53
00:02:10,118 --> 00:02:15,459
marijuana laws have been the workaround

54
00:02:12,968 --> 00:02:18,310
West Virginia is about to become the

55
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:23,050
29th state but the first state was

56
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:26,770
California in 1996 and but to get back

57
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:29,830
to enable doctors and patients to get

58
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:33,069
access to cannabis state medical

59
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:35,620
cannabis laws authorized physicians and

60
00:02:33,068 --> 00:02:37,750
healthcare providers to certify or

61
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:40,060
recommend patient access and this is

62
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,330
bypassing the prescription prohibition

63
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:45,939
so a certifying doctor unlike a

64
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,000
prescribing doctor simply finds that

65
00:02:45,939 --> 00:02:52,120
cannabis finds that the patient has

66
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,280
ineligible condition finds that cannabis

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,110
can relieve that condition determines

68
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,239
that the benefits outweigh the risks and

69
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:02,620
discloses to the patient the risk

70
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:05,860
benefit analysis and access to but this

71
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:08,080
is a matter of access and not dosing my

72
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,500
colleague Val Romano is going to talk a

73
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,180
little bit more about the Massachusetts

74
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,560
regulations but again getting back to

75
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:19,450
the federal context for your work I

76
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,030
would say that you have a belt and spend

77
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:24,280
a suspender protection from federal

78
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:26,919
interference with what you do the belt

79
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,669
is what I would call the Conant versus

80
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:33,909
Walters decision a 2000 trial court

81
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:35,530
decision that was affirmed in 2002 by an

82
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:37,359
appellate court enforce the US Supreme

83
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:39,609
Court denied certiorari so it remains

84
00:03:37,359 --> 00:03:41,530
the law and under that decision there is

85
00:03:39,609 --> 00:03:42,879
a permanent injunction against federal

86
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,590
law enforcement officers and the

87
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,379
Department of Justice and administrative

88
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:51,099
agencies and they are enjoying them hate

89
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:54,009
to read this from either revoking a

90
00:03:51,099 --> 00:03:55,989
physician's license to prescribe control

91
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:59,739
some PSA's or conducting an

92
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:01,030
investigation of a physician solely for

93
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,400
a physician's professional

94
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:05,318
recommendation for the use of marijuana

95
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,329
that's a permanent injunction that

96
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:09,909
protects your licenses the suspenders

97
00:04:07,329 --> 00:04:12,760
for federal protection from interference

98
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:15,370
with your practice is the 2006

99
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:17,079
right-to-die case the Gonzalez versus

100
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,180
Oregon decision of the US Supreme Court

101
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,189
that was the second Bush

102
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,120
administration's reaction to Oregon's

103
00:04:21,189 --> 00:04:26,310
right-to-die law and again

104
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,600
manure for me to read from the decision

105
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,240
so you can understand the scope of the

106
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,439
protection that the Federalist you have

107
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,269
from federal interference

108
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:35,819
congrat this is from the Gonzalez

109
00:04:33,269 --> 00:04:38,370
decision congressional regulations of

110
00:04:35,819 --> 00:04:40,139
medical congressional regulation of

111
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:41,790
medical practice in so far as it bars

112
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:44,280
doctors from using their prescription

113
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:47,879
writing powers as a means to engage in

114
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:50,369
illicit drug dealing that is the extent

115
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:52,610
of federal regulation beyond that bar

116
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:55,620
however the Controlled Substances Act

117
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:58,199
manifests no intent to regulate the

118
00:04:55,620 --> 00:05:00,120
practice of medicine generally the CSAs

119
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:02,879
for the Controlled Substances acts

120
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,769
prescription requirement does not

121
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,180
authorize the Attorney General to bar

122
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:10,978
physicians from dispensing controlled

123
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,350
substances for assisted suicide in the

124
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:15,240
face of a state medical regime that

125
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:17,220
permits such conduct

126
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,439
so there's your belt-and-suspenders no

127
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,750
matter what anybody else tells you as

128
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:24,240
long as you're practicing within the

129
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:26,399
confines of a state law state law

130
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,460
permitting that type of medical practice

131
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,079
that type of medical treatment you are

132
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:33,239
essentially immune from federal

133
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:38,099
interference so let me talk now about

134
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:39,000
state law in Massachusetts as I

135
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,550
mentioned you've got the board

136
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,459
registration of medicine and nursing

137
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:47,210
you've got for the from the state

138
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:50,279
Medical Licensing Board no specific

139
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:51,989
cannabis medicine practice guidances you

140
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,219
simply have the state medical marijuana

141
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:58,129
law and again val is going to speak to

142
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,570
you more on that and you have the

143
00:05:58,129 --> 00:06:03,930
Department of Public Health regulations

144
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:05,879
implementing that law and and while

145
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,689
those regulation is pretty much parent

146
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,939
the state law there is a continuing

147
00:06:09,689 --> 00:06:13,918
medical education requirement that's in

148
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:17,250
there as well and I will refer you to

149
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:20,430
the access to these online and to vowels

150
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:24,329
presentation at the state level with

151
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:27,329
regard to criminal protections doctors

152
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:28,978
are immune from criminal prosecution as

153
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:31,560
a matter of a state statute for

154
00:06:28,978 --> 00:06:33,750
authorizing controlled substance use for

155
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:35,918
a legitimate medical purpose in the

156
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:39,430
course of professional practice

157
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:42,000
there's no criminal risk there you have

158
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:44,680
protection under Massachusetts tort law

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,468
negligence law that no health care

160
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:50,348
provider will be liable to a third party

161
00:06:47,468 --> 00:06:53,680
for a patient's negligence or abuse of

162
00:06:50,348 --> 00:06:55,718
the medicine if if the risks of

163
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,718
impairment are disclosed by the health

164
00:06:55,718 --> 00:07:01,120
care provider and documented with

165
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:03,639
additional documentation of the

166
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,069
patient's competency to understand that

167
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,528
that warning so if the warnings

168
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:10,240
documented and the patient's competency

169
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:12,189
you know have to have the patient repeat

170
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,288
back to you what you they understand to

171
00:07:12,189 --> 00:07:16,028
be the warnings then that's all

172
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:18,519
documented in the chart that's your

173
00:07:16,028 --> 00:07:20,168
defense to a negligence action and

174
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:22,299
there's really very little malpractice

175
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:24,038
risk because these recommendations and

176
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:26,079
certifications are not dosing

177
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:28,930
instructions they're simply accessed

178
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:32,228
with the patient able to self titrate so

179
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,228
your tort risk is similarly minimal the

180
00:07:32,228 --> 00:07:38,800
best way to protect your license is

181
00:07:34,228 --> 00:07:41,348
documentation I suggest a written

182
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,550
examination assessment and patient

183
00:07:41,348 --> 00:07:48,069
disclosure protocol something that notes

184
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:51,158
that that provides you a outline of a

185
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:53,500
check series of checkboxes to go through

186
00:07:51,158 --> 00:07:57,519
as you do your examinations and your

187
00:07:53,500 --> 00:08:00,129
assessments and this protocol can be

188
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:02,228
used to do the tasks that will protect

189
00:08:00,129 --> 00:08:03,819
you and then document the results of

190
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:07,149
each one of those tasks in your record

191
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:09,278
the first part of safe cannabis practice

192
00:08:07,149 --> 00:08:12,788
cannabis medicine practice is a full

193
00:08:09,278 --> 00:08:15,699
patient medical record review and in

194
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:19,418
that this is a particularly focused on

195
00:08:15,699 --> 00:08:22,000
the condition or symptom that's being to

196
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:25,299
be treated with the cannabis and

197
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,569
particularly important is a condition

198
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:31,270
diagnosis in the medical record by a

199
00:08:28,569 --> 00:08:32,788
specialist for that for that symptom for

200
00:08:31,269 --> 00:08:35,168
that symptom for that condition

201
00:08:32,788 --> 00:08:37,649
particularly so if it's beyond your

202
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:40,088
specialty you can piggyback on another

203
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:42,490
specialist diagnosis but if a patient is

204
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:44,649
coming into you for the first time with

205
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:46,778
the condition that a specialist hasn't

206
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:49,179
identified and you aren't a specialist

207
00:08:46,778 --> 00:08:50,980
in that condition don't certify we

208
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:53,219
for the patient to a specialist and then

209
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,230
you can piggyback on the specialists

210
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,480
diagnosis and in person the next the

211
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,899
next important part of the documentation

212
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,100
is an in-person clinical examination

213
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:07,000
especially regarding the condition of

214
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:10,950
symptom to be treated and you should

215
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,450
also be looking for the patient's

216
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,430
pre-certification use of marijuana as

217
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:17,410
providing evidence for you that there

218
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:20,500
may be some efficacy in cannabis for

219
00:09:17,409 --> 00:09:22,958
that patient the next thing to do in the

220
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,679
chart is to do to perform a literature

221
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:28,479
review of the benefits and risks of

222
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:30,489
medical cannabis for the symptom to be

223
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,769
treated and for the patient's other

224
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:34,720
pre-existing conditions its simply

225
00:09:32,769 --> 00:09:37,539
practicing safe medicine and filling

226
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:41,440
your file with material in case there's

227
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:43,809
a review the next part is doing this

228
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
certification the certification is an

229
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:48,879
assessment of risks and benefits so the

230
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,610
chart should include a discussion a

231
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:53,528
listing of those your analysis as to why

232
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:55,720
you believe that the benefits outweigh

233
00:09:53,528 --> 00:09:59,490
the risks and a disclosure to the

234
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,540
patient of that risk benefit analysis

235
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,700
lastly there should be something in the

236
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:05,919
nature of a treatment plan as you would

237
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,290
with any other patient that comes with

238
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:10,929
you that would include some metrics for

239
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:13,569
assessing the value of the cannabis

240
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:16,208
treatment whether it be symptom relief

241
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:18,459
quality of life improvement or even harm

242
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:20,559
reduction one of the ways to assist you

243
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:24,159
on that and involve the patient in that

244
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:26,379
process is to recommend strongly to a

245
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:29,350
patient that the patient keep a diary of

246
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,269
benefits and side-effects that is part

247
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,370
of keeping your continuing relationship

248
00:10:31,269 --> 00:10:36,039
with the patient and giving you the

249
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:39,129
ability to monitor how things are going

250
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,289
with the patient and that also should

251
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:43,208
include trying to schedule you can't

252
00:10:41,289 --> 00:10:45,129
compel the patients to come back but in

253
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:47,619
terms of the ongoing role in the

254
00:10:45,129 --> 00:10:49,588
patient's treatment which is part of the

255
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:52,480
requirement under Massachusetts law

256
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,339
scheduling a minimum a two-week

257
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,959
follow-up to see how the experience with

258
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:57,670
the cannabis medicine is going and so

259
00:10:55,958 --> 00:11:00,069
you can report that feedback into the

260
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:02,708
chart as well as a follow-up appointment

261
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:03,050
three to six months out you can't compel

262
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:05,119
the page

263
00:11:03,049 --> 00:11:06,620
to come in but you can put those

264
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,100
recommendations in there in your

265
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:13,669
paperwork and have that on hand in case

266
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:16,009
someone comes as one of the licensing

267
00:11:13,669 --> 00:11:18,049
board comes to look at you the most

268
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:19,879
important way to protect yourself

269
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:22,278
besides this documentation is

270
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:24,110
essentially also not to have contact

271
00:11:22,278 --> 00:11:26,990
with the medicine not to touch the

272
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:28,940
cannabis as a doctor when the patient

273
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:31,690
asks you about supply in Massachusetts

274
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:34,570
you can simply refer them to the

275
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:37,459
licensing to the DPH licensed

276
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:40,040
distribution network there are only ten

277
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:42,129
in Massachusetts so far there are many

278
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:46,849
more in the pipeline

279
00:11:42,129 --> 00:11:48,528
lastly the the the the point about why

280
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,899
licensing boards are looking at people

281
00:11:48,528 --> 00:11:52,850
it's simply a matter of politics and a

282
00:11:50,899 --> 00:11:56,179
matter of the suppression of doctor

283
00:11:52,850 --> 00:12:00,470
participation in medical cannabis

284
00:11:56,179 --> 00:12:02,299
practice one of the chief culprits for

285
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,730
this is the mass Medical Society which

286
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,229
has been against cannabis medicine ever

287
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,659
since the campaign for it

288
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:10,370
so that there are only a few doctors who

289
00:12:08,659 --> 00:12:12,500
are participating in it they're

290
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,179
providing I mean 20 percent of the

291
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,039
doctors are providing 80 percent of the

292
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:18,799
recommendations those people get

293
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,629
targeted for those of you who choose in

294
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:23,479
Massachusetts to join this brigade of

295
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:25,578
courageous doctors what I've told you is

296
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,589
hopefully gonna help you if they come

297
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:29,689
after you if you've got the

298
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:32,149
documentation you are immune I can tell

299
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:34,790
you that doctors at least one doctor who

300
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,200
has been challenged by the board has had

301
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,578
the board's recommendation for

302
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:40,610
suspension dismissed by an

303
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,958
administrative law judge the the crime

304
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:44,180
there was not anything to do with

305
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:45,229
patient complaints and everything to do

306
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:47,149
with the doctors use of nurse

307
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,550
practitioners and as I mentioned the

308
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:52,399
nurse practitioner regulation should has

309
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:53,599
been published it's already permitted

310
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,389
under the nursing regs

311
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:59,570
it'll be permitted under the DPH regs

312
00:12:56,389 --> 00:13:02,149
hopefully around June sometime so that's

313
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,278
what I have for the content of my talk

314
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,259
but we're trying to keep our talks short

315
00:13:04,278 --> 00:13:08,179
so that we can give plenty of time for

316
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:10,629
questions thank you very much

317
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:13,459

registration holders throughout the

326
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:36,350
Commonwealth work closely with this

327
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,990
process I'm also an attorney in

328
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:40,820
California although I live here been

329
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,970
doing something to do with medical

330
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:46,490
marijuana for probably 20 years now and

331
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,879
it was it was great when Massachusetts

332
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:52,639
passed our law in 2012 I want to say

333
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:55,700
first of all that you know thank you for

334
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:59,319
participating in this if it wasn't for

335
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,610
courageous doctors in evaluation centers

336
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,590
really stepping up we wouldn't have a

337
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,470
medical marijuana program we wouldn't

338
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:08,360
have any incentive for dispensaries to

339
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,220
try to open up we wouldn't have enough

340
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,649
patient access to actually collect any

341
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:16,519
data we wouldn't be moving things

342
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:19,069
forward at all partners for instance is

343
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:21,019
actually doing a study of medical

344
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,430
marijuana patients over the next few

345
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:24,110
months collecting data that wouldn't

346
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:26,269
work there wouldn't be enough patients

347
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,879
right now you can look on the Department

348
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:31,759
of Public Health website and every month

349
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,289
they actually Pat put up a dashboard to

350
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:34,879
show you what the status of the medical

351
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:39,230
marijuana program in Massachusetts is

352
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:40,820
for that month as of March 31st there

353
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,720
were forty thousand four hundred and

354
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:46,430
eleven patients most of those

355
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:49,070
certifications were written by just a

356
00:14:46,429 --> 00:14:50,659
handful of doctors even though there are

357
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:53,570
in fact a hundred and eighty-nine

358
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:56,149
doctors who have registered to certify

359
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:59,420
patients in the Commonwealth with about

360
00:14:56,149 --> 00:15:01,850
six six more added in March it's very

361
00:14:59,419 --> 00:15:06,709
few of them that are actually doing the

362
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:09,110
work and Mike Cutler touched on dr.

363
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:11,900
Nodame who you know got in a little hot

364
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:13,610
water for working with nurse

365
00:15:11,899 --> 00:15:16,189
practitioners and fortunately has been

366
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:20,000
vindicated and in fact nurse

367
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:21,340
practitioners were authorized under the

368
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,710
law and the Reg

369
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:26,410
from their inception it was merely

370
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,990
because there wasn't a process for

371
00:15:26,409 --> 00:15:31,899
allowing nurses to do this that it

372
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,210
became a problem and so the supervision

373
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,590
that was going on at Kanna care was

374
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,480
called into question although ultimately

375
00:15:35,590 --> 00:15:39,970
turned out to be vindicated and they

376
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:41,680
were doing the right thing so the

377
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,090
sources of information for you to sort

378
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:45,549
of get to kind of the nuts and bolts and

379
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:47,290
I didn't invite anyone to chime in as

380
00:15:45,549 --> 00:15:48,789
well the sources of information you have

381
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:52,649
the rags for the medical use of

382
00:15:48,789 --> 00:15:56,579
marijuana program 105 CMR 725 you have

383
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:59,169
243 CMR one two and three that are

384
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,660
specifically enumerated in the regs you

385
00:15:59,169 --> 00:16:03,189
have Co net V Walters which Mike spoke

386
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:06,009
about which really created a First

387
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,320
Amendment privilege for you to discuss

388
00:16:06,009 --> 00:16:11,110
treatment options with your patient it's

389
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:13,000
the beauty of that case you have the

390
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:14,590
Controlled Substances Act what title 21

391
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,960
in the United States Code you have the

392
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,399
Act for the humanitarian medical use of

393
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,980
marijuana that's essentially the law

394
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,269
that the voters passed in 2012 63

395
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,250
percent of people in the Commonwealth

396
00:16:22,269 --> 00:16:27,250
agreed on something which is pretty cool

397
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:29,259
rarely happens and then you have

398
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,350
extensive board of registration policies

399
00:16:29,259 --> 00:16:33,730
and then the DPH guidance for physicians

400
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,620
and they actually lay it out pretty well

401
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,120
they lay out there's there's some

402
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,529
documents on the DPH website where they

403
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,570
lay out what you can do what you can't

404
00:16:38,529 --> 00:16:42,689
do and they actually lay out the process

405
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:45,160
for becoming a certifying physician

406
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:47,740
essentially certifying physician must be

407
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:49,539
a mass licensed physician they have to

408
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:52,149
hold an active full license with no

409
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:53,169
prescribing restrictions they have to

410
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:55,389
have a Massachusetts controlled

411
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:57,279
substance registration they have it have

412
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:59,439
to have at least one established place

413
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:01,209
of practice in Massachusetts they have

414
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,190
to complete a minimum of two hours of

415
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:06,250
category one continual continuing

416
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:08,709
professional development credits that

417
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:11,200
zme has to explain the proper use of

418
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:13,209
marijuana including side effects dosage

419
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,850
and contraindications including with

420
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:19,509
psych including with psycho psychotropic

421
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:21,789
drugs so and they have to register with

422
00:17:19,509 --> 00:17:24,640
the medical use of marijuana program via

423
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:26,619
their website so that's what you have to

424
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,509
do you also have to have this bona fide

425
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:30,369
doctor-patient relationship and the mass

426
00:17:28,509 --> 00:17:31,990
Medical Society chimed in a lot and so

427
00:17:30,369 --> 00:17:35,168
the voters passed a five-page law in

428
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,460
2012 in 2013 the department of public

429
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:38,080
I went around the Commonwealth and had

430
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,019
listening sessions for how we're gonna

431
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,999
implement this five-page law and a lot

432
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,649
of people chimed in and there was a lot

433
00:17:42,999 --> 00:17:46,690
of insightful information that was put

434
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:48,128
forward and one of the groups that

435
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,600
chimed in was the mass Medical Society

436
00:17:48,128 --> 00:17:51,908
who I'm sure you all know better than I

437
00:17:49,599 --> 00:17:53,709
do 25,000 doctors and med students and

438
00:17:51,909 --> 00:17:55,570
they really wanted to make sure that

439
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:57,940
people had this what a bona fide

440
00:17:55,569 --> 00:17:59,710
doctor-patient relationship would be so

441
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:01,330
unlike California where you can get a

442
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:01,989
certification or a recommendation over

443
00:18:01,329 --> 00:18:03,638
Skype

444
00:18:01,989 --> 00:18:04,989
I got doctors never even reviewed your

445
00:18:03,638 --> 00:18:06,488
medical history he doesn't know you at

446
00:18:04,989 --> 00:18:07,929
all doesn't have an ongoing role you

447
00:18:06,489 --> 00:18:09,340
just give him there a couple hundred

448
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:11,889
bucks and you're getting you're getting

449
00:18:09,339 --> 00:18:13,778
your privilege to use cannabis here the

450
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:15,158
the mass Medical Society wants you to

451
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:17,378
have conducted the clinical visit like

452
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,639
Mike said completed and documented the

453
00:18:17,378 --> 00:18:20,829
full assessment of the patient's medical

454
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:23,349
history explained the benefits and harms

455
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:25,210
and has a role in the ongoing care and

456
00:18:23,349 --> 00:18:27,278
treatment so they're really trying to

457
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:29,139
make it so you have to have that role

458
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:30,849
that that relationship with the doctor

459
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:32,408
and then they're supposed to use the

460
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:34,898
prescription monitoring program or or

461
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:39,429
mass Pat now before issuing that written

462
00:18:34,898 --> 00:18:40,599
certification and so you know it sounds

463
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:42,519
like a lot of overhead and a lot of

464
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:44,168
doctors aren't engaging in it so it's

465
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:46,329
because of these evaluation centers like

466
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,859
I said early on and I'm thankful that

467
00:18:46,329 --> 00:18:50,829
they're actually allowing patients who

468
00:18:47,858 --> 00:18:52,839
otherwise their primary care doctor you

469
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:54,699
know I I'm sort of a cynic and I get

470
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:57,308
sort of you know enthusiastic about

471
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,778
these things but cannabis although we

472
00:18:57,308 --> 00:19:02,200
call cannabis big business right now

473
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:06,388
it's not cannabis business does not have

474
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:08,200
you know a pretty 30 something year old

475
00:19:06,388 --> 00:19:10,089
pharmaceutical rep coming into your

476
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,330
office offering free samples and to take

477
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:17,048
you out to lunch we probably should but

478
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:19,509
we don't and and so you know so that's

479
00:19:17,048 --> 00:19:21,868
why you know cannabis is not actually

480
00:19:19,509 --> 00:19:25,720
probably accepted as well as it could be

481
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:27,488
another reason is Rach V Gonzales which

482
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,499
is a case out of the the Ninth Circuit

483
00:19:27,489 --> 00:19:32,200
or actually the United States Supreme

484
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:35,950
Court ultimately which held that the

485
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:38,859
purely intrastate production and use of

486
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:41,080
cannabis actually violates interstate

487
00:19:38,858 --> 00:19:42,579
commerce right so why is why does

488
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,148
Congress have the authority to regulate

489
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:48,599
cannabis use if it's a purely intrastate

490
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:51,899
activity because of this print

491
00:19:48,599 --> 00:19:53,730
and your doctors not lawyers but this is

492
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,560
Wickard principle which was started

493
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,700
somebody was growing wheat at home and

494
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:58,649
they said it's illegal for you to grow

495
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,110
wheat at home because ultimately you're

496
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,300
hurting the Interstate Commerce for

497
00:20:01,109 --> 00:20:05,609
wheat so if I'm a medical marijuana

498
00:20:03,299 --> 00:20:06,329
patient and big pharma has completely

499
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:09,299
failed me

500
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:12,199
and I'm growing cannabis at home I got a

501
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:15,149
few plants and it's helping me what

502
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,390
interstate commerce am I actually

503
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:21,120
harming well so it's it's again why we

504
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:23,580
need pharmaceutical reps so that we can

505
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,699
see the Interstate Commerce that we're

506
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:29,339
harming is the prescription of other

507
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,740
pills and other drugs and in fact there

508
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:33,289
was a great study there's a great study

509
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,910
last year and it's actually been

510
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:41,789
replicated and further analyzed but what

511
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:45,210
it said in medical marijuana states 1826

512
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:50,940
fewer pain pills prescribed per year per

513
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:55,640
doctor 1826 per doctor I know it's it's

514
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:58,320
awesome 562 fewer doses of anxiety pills

515
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,930
541 fewer doses of nausea nausea

516
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,419
medications it goes on and on and on and

517
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:05,130
so when we look at you know we're in

518
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:07,590
we're in Massachusetts we know we have

519
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:10,560
this horrible problem with opiates when

520
00:21:07,589 --> 00:21:13,139
we look at what's going on in Mass if

521
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,960
the patient is never going down the road

522
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:17,340
of Vikes and perks and oxys and becoming

523
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:19,350
a heroin addict and then having their

524
00:21:17,339 --> 00:21:20,849
insurance run out and I know I'm stating

525
00:21:19,349 --> 00:21:22,619
the obvious to you but it's something

526
00:21:20,849 --> 00:21:26,549
that needs is worth being repeated if

527
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:29,969
you never go down that road then that's

528
00:21:26,549 --> 00:21:31,349
why we have 1800 fewer pain pills

529
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:33,690
prescribed in medical marijuana

530
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:35,250
jurisdictions that's why the Journal of

531
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:38,940
the American Medical Association came

532
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:41,519
out a few years ago and said 24.8% less

533
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:44,070
opiate mortalities in marijuana

534
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:46,170
jurisdictions a full 25 out of a hundred

535
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:48,779
fewer people dying in marijuana

536
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:50,970
jurisdictions and so the data is

537
00:21:48,779 --> 00:21:53,369
overwhelming and don't let anybody tell

538
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:57,890
you otherwise because to find real

539
00:21:53,369 --> 00:22:01,899
impartial data like peer-reviewed

540
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:03,850
studies out of major universities

541
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:07,000
the opponents don't have that kind of

542
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:09,639
data they have purely objective I'm not

543
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,869
not objective you know data with with a

544
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:17,380
particular focus so the data is there so

545
00:22:13,869 --> 00:22:19,899
keep going what what else you need to

546
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,909
know as far as under the law and that's

547
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:26,200
sort of my soapboxing and I apologize

548
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:28,028
and uh so a qualifying patient has to be

549
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,130
a mass resident they have to be 18 years

550
00:22:28,028 --> 00:22:35,769
or older or if they're under 18 you have

551
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:37,179
to have two physicians review see them

552
00:22:35,769 --> 00:22:41,798
and say they have a life limiting

553
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:43,450
illness okay I'll finish up and I'll

554
00:22:41,798 --> 00:22:47,558
pass it on and we can move to move to

555
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:49,269
questions so quickly evaluation centers

556
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,798
I just want to emphasize again the

557
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:53,019
important role that they're playing but

558
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:54,970
also the reason why there's only a few

559
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:57,460
doctors certifying most of the patients

560
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,259
we would love to have all of you get on

561
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,750
board this important treatment option

562
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,640
let's get together let's collect data so

563
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:05,288
that we don't have that argument against

564
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,210
cannabis anymore and let's figure out a

565
00:23:05,288 --> 00:23:09,759
way that we can really make it clear to

566
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,259
the public as a whole even the ones who

567
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:12,819
are listening to the pretty

568
00:23:11,259 --> 00:23:14,589
pharmaceutical rep that this is a good

569
00:23:12,819 --> 00:23:16,980
thing for the populace so thanks for

570
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:16,980
listening

571
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:23,928
so we only a few minutes of Bonnie's

572
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:26,300
gonna give us some experience from from

573
00:23:23,929 --> 00:23:29,570
California as well and her experiences

574
00:23:26,299 --> 00:23:33,500
working with patients so I just a few

575
00:23:29,569 --> 00:23:36,740
do's and don'ts and also some case cases

576
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,170
where doctors in California have been in

577
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:40,880
trouble and they are pretty egregious

578
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,550
and I don't think anybody here is gonna

579
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:45,200
do this but remember in California it

580
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:49,009
was the Wild West for quite some time

581
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:51,860
and a person could just walk in off the

582
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,210
street saying my back hurt you collected

583
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:56,629
their money and you gave them a letter

584
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:58,250
most of the doctors who are still

585
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:59,900
standing that are doing that that are

586
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:01,929
doing that kind of practice are going to

587
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:04,190
be out of business because it's it's

588
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:06,890
going to be legally available as of

589
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:08,720
January 1st and then the rest of us who

590
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,580
actually practice medicine just using

591
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,410
cannabis and our toolbox are going to be

592
00:24:10,579 --> 00:24:16,428
the ones who still see patients I treat

593
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:18,830
every patient and go through the process

594
00:24:16,429 --> 00:24:20,420
the same way history physical review of

595
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:21,710
medical records and I do highly

596
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:23,860
recommend that if you don't know the

597
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:26,210
person and they are coming to you

598
00:24:23,859 --> 00:24:27,649
specifically for cannabis because you're

599
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,910
open to that and you're gonna help a lot

600
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,100
of people if you're open to that ask

601
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:33,529
them to fax or scan their medical

602
00:24:31,099 --> 00:24:35,689
records ahead of time it makes it a lot

603
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:39,710
easier if you know what they have before

604
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:40,519
they come and then document the heck out

605
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:43,519
of your chart

606
00:24:40,519 --> 00:24:45,619
i document medications that the patient

607
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:47,750
has tried that have not worked

608
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:50,419
i document surgical procedures i

609
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:53,539
document how many physicians they've

610
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:55,970
seen sometimes what major academic

611
00:24:53,539 --> 00:24:59,690
centers they've gone to for for care for

612
00:24:55,970 --> 00:25:02,269
for help that is documentation that will

613
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:05,058
help you if something happens be able to

614
00:25:02,269 --> 00:25:07,308
back up your decision-making on every

615
00:25:05,058 --> 00:25:09,349
chart I write patient if I decide that

616
00:25:07,308 --> 00:25:11,420
they qualify patient qualifies for

617
00:25:09,349 --> 00:25:15,139
medical cannabis based on California law

618
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:17,570
I usually write the benefits i assessing

619
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:21,679
it the benefit benefits outweigh the

620
00:25:17,569 --> 00:25:24,678
risk and I also write that I've

621
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:26,780
discussed side-effects in my paperwork

622
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,710
that I give to a patient a new intake

623
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:32,740
form is seven pages it's two pages of

624
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,630
medical information medications a

625
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:36,750
but then it's five pages of informed

626
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:40,929
consent and an arbitration agreement and

627
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:43,750
so in I've been doing this for almost a

628
00:25:40,929 --> 00:25:45,280
decade I have not been in trouble with

629
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,950
the Medical Board and I've not gotten

630
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,389
sued I know dr. Hogan rather is here in

631
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:50,830
the audience I see him he's been doing a

632
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:52,270
lot longer than I have and I know he

633
00:25:50,829 --> 00:25:54,549
does it the right way too and it's not

634
00:25:52,269 --> 00:25:57,369
gotten in trouble and really

635
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:00,490
documentation is your key I at one point

636
00:25:57,369 --> 00:26:03,659
was a medical director of overseeing 15

637
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:06,849
different medical cannibis offices about

638
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,540
like six or seven years ago and we had

639
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:12,399
some doctors who did have problems but

640
00:26:09,539 --> 00:26:14,409
documentation was what saved them and so

641
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,570
that is the key and where did those

642
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:18,759
problems come from so in one case it was

643
00:26:16,569 --> 00:26:21,369
a parent calling saying my son does not

644
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:23,859
have what you said he has I found his

645
00:26:21,369 --> 00:26:26,199
letter and so you may get a call from a

646
00:26:23,859 --> 00:26:27,428
family member we obviously were not

647
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,410
gonna break HIPPA we don't know who that

648
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:30,790
person is on the phone so we say we

649
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:33,279
can't help you we can't disclose

650
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,139
anything but at one point there was a

651
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:38,079
complaint to the Medical Board and that

652
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,700
doctor did have the chart subpoenaed but

653
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:41,470
because that doctors medical records

654
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:44,019
were sound and the patient did bring in

655
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:45,789
medical records his his mother didn't

656
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:47,769
know the whole story and did not know

657
00:26:45,789 --> 00:26:49,990
other medications he was on so that was

658
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:53,349
that was easy and it was dismissed a

659
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:57,220
couple cases that were just egregious

660
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:59,500
and ridiculous is we had a famous case I

661
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,880
don't know the doctor who a patient came

662
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:04,990
in and he said can you just give me a

663
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:08,710
blank caregiver letter and the guy it

664
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:10,359
was an undercover person from the

665
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,769
Medical Board and they got a blank

666
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:14,439
caregiver letter where they could just

667
00:27:11,769 --> 00:27:16,150
put in somebody's name and they made

668
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,650
this ridiculous assumption they said

669
00:27:16,150 --> 00:27:18,400
we're gonna write the dog's name in

670
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:20,500
there or something it was just

671
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,540
ridiculous and and the doctor got dinged

672
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:24,730
for that then he was on probation for

673
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:26,349
that so that was one case and then very

674
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:28,509
recently I was asked to write a letter

675
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:31,599
for a doctor which I declined to do

676
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:34,690
because it was a local physician near me

677
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:36,819
who saw who is an internal medicine

678
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,308
specialist who saw a five-year-old who

679
00:27:36,819 --> 00:27:40,450
had no diagnosis but the family was

680
00:27:39,308 --> 00:27:42,428
saying we're not we don't want a

681
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:44,569
diagnosis of a DD on the chart but the

682
00:27:42,429 --> 00:27:46,850
school saying he has a DD

683
00:27:44,569 --> 00:27:50,179
can you just give us a letter and he did

684
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:51,529
and it ended up that the school asked

685
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:54,769
well what medicine is he on and they

686
00:27:51,529 --> 00:27:56,569
said he's on cookies and then it went to

687
00:27:54,769 --> 00:27:59,029
Child Protective Services and became a

688
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:01,369
big deal the parents are thrilled with

689
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:03,559
the treatment it's just that the doctor

690
00:28:01,369 --> 00:28:05,719
was not qualified to diagnose a

691
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,849
five-year-old with a DD so going back to

692
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:10,370
what Mike said here if you're not

693
00:28:07,849 --> 00:28:12,679
qualified to make the diagnosis don't

694
00:28:10,369 --> 00:28:14,389
make sure they see a specialist

695
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:16,910
make sure they have paperwork and again

696
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:18,320
in my practice anybody under 25 they

697
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:19,910
don't even get an appointment with me

698
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:23,000
unless they send in medical records

699
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:25,130
ahead of time and if that takes them

700
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,750
four months then so be it then that's

701
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:30,080
that's on them there's only so much you

702
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:31,940
can do okay unfortunately I think we're

703
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:34,220
going to take questions after this just

704
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:36,620
due to the incoming next panel that's up

705
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,230
so we're a little short on the time here

706
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:41,209
this is just a lunch collision

707
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:42,829
unfortunately but I do want to thank

708
00:28:41,210 --> 00:28:44,150
everybody that's all the advice you guys

709
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:45,529
have given I think it's incredibly

710
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:47,690
important that we get this correct

711
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:50,180
having the the legal understanding of

712
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:52,519
the realms of what we can do is is

713
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:55,360
paramount to making patients have safer

714
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:55,359
access thank you

715
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:02,849
you
