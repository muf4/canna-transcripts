[Music]

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,679
shifting gears a little bit here to talk

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,560
about um the poster that you're going to

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,239
be presenting um that's about uh using

5
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,759
psilocybin to treat cannabis dependency

6
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:29,640
so um talk talk with me a bit about sort

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,439
of the Genesis of this um how did you

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,359
first get interested in studying this

9
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,359
yeah so the poster we're doing is from a

10
00:00:35,359 --> 00:00:39,960
project that we did in the fall we

11
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,679
wanted to see if micro doing psilocybin

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,878
can help people who struggle with

13
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:46,759
cannabis dependency and I know people in

14
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:49,238
the industry are like say that cannabis

15
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:52,799
does not have any problems you know it's

16
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:54,839
100% safe but on our side in helping our

17
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:56,959
patients we come across a lot of people

18
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,000
who have an unhealthy relationship with

19
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:03,719
the plant and I start Ed we started

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,519
offering micro doing um as part of our

21
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,719
business back in May and in doing that

22
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:10,519
we had patients report that they were

23
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,840
like inadvertently decreasing their

24
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:15,158
cannabis use um alongside alcohol we see

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,040
that oftentimes and that's well

26
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:20,359
researched too um but the decrease in

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:23,960
cannabis is not well researched so we're

28
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:25,159
like could micro doing help people

29
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,759
improve their relationship with the

30
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,479
plant and depend on it less the same way

31
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,519
that we see other you know sub other

32
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:34,200
substance

33
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:36,319
addictions so we kind of put it out

34
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:40,040
there like let's let's get a group of

35
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:42,000
eight people and let's try this out so

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,040
that's what we did we found eight people

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,920
who were willing to try um this group

38
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:53,118
program that we had put together and it

39
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:56,118
was an six week six- week program um

40
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:58,478
where we use micro doing group support

41
00:01:56,118 --> 00:02:00,759
um we met every week we took a group

42
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:04,200
tolerance break together we provided a

43
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:07,478
ton of Education we even did a mini dose

44
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,439
session um where people got to they

45
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:12,680
could consume up to two grams of

46
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,199
psilocybin during that session um and

47
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,120
then we had a group chat as well during

48
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:21,439
that time and the the results were

49
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,319
astounding it was amazing to see so you

50
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:27,318
were already using psilocybon micro

51
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:29,479
doing to treat um different conditions

52
00:02:27,318 --> 00:02:30,518
and sort of just saw the reduction in in

53
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:34,878
cannabis

54
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:36,560
as a a welcome side effect yeah yeah

55
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,280
exactly and that's what we're seeing

56
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,158
like being reported and then alongside

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,479
of that we have people coming to us um

58
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:49,759
saying like I have I'm using all this

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:51,158
cannabis how can I cut down um so we

60
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,759
just wanted to see if this could be an

61
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:55,560
effective tool of course not not a cure

62
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:58,359
or anything like that but a tool for

63
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,199
people to use right and now when you say

64
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,400
an unhealthy relationship with cannabis

65
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:06,359
what does that look like um in the

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,080
people who were in the group it looked

67
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:13,120
like uh they could not get through the

68
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:15,879
day without you know without sucking on

69
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,519
their bait pen multiple times a day it

70
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:21,518
looked like people could not travel

71
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,400
because they could they feared that they

72
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,959
wouldn't have access to their cannabis

73
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,400
um it looked like the slightest

74
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,799
inconvenience would make them turn to

75
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:36,080
their vac pen um and it was people who

76
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,920
were just not they wanted a different

77
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,719
relationship they didn't want to have to

78
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:44,119
depend on it so much to help them feel

79
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:47,719
normal and then so there was one person

80
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:51,360
who was showing early signs of CHS she

81
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:54,438
had like early morning nausea um

82
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:58,079
so no CHS interesting topic we actually

83
00:03:54,438 --> 00:04:01,680
just spoke with um Ethan Russo who did a

84
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:04,519
study on CHS uh all about that so yeah

85
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,760
that that just seems awful yeah and

86
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:08,200
we're seeing a lot of that now I'm

87
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,120
working with some other um Professionals

88
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:11,199
in the space and we're doing our own

89
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,358
survey

90
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:20,519
also oh interesting yeah interesting um

91
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:23,279
so what methods of support are available

92
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,560
were available for cannabis um overc

93
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,119
consumption or cannabis dependency um

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,280
kind of before you explored this and how

95
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,720
does that differ from or how does that

96
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:36,000
compare to you know alcohol or tobacco

97
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,520
sort of um right well understood

98
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,439
dependencies there is there does exist

99
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:44,359
like you know Marijuana anonymous groups

100
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:46,120
I haven't like been to those so I don't

101
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,319
know a whole lot about them I assume

102
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,038
that they follow like the same 12ep

103
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:54,639
program maybe that alcoholics annonymous

104
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:56,519
does um there are there are some

105
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,800
Facebook groups but a lot of times it's

106
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:03,599
like a silent people suffer in silence a

107
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:05,800
lot and they're afraid to admit that

108
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,199
their cannabis use is problematic

109
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,400
because they have all these people

110
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:13,400
saying cannabis is this amazing

111
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:15,918
wonderful medicine and wonderful drug

112
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:18,120
and like shame on you for having a

113
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:19,639
problem with it it's not addictive which

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,038
is all completely wrong so then they're

115
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,038
just kind of like suffering in the

116
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,759
shadows so there's not a whole lot of

117
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,759
support out there

118
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
yeah

119
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:38,519
[Music]

120
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,560
a
