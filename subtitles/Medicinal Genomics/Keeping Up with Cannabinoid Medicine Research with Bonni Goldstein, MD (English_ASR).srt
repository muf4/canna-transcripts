105
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,000
people who kind of understand cannabis

106
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:59,198

there's only so much I C uh bandwidth I

110
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
have to expand into learning everything

111
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:13,120
about the plant but yet I attend the

112
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:15,360
lectures uh from these uh brilliant phds

113
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,160
in plant biology and so on and I learned

114
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,000
so much and it just enhances the whole

115
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,240
my

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,478
whole ability to really understand um

117
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,079
everything about the plant it's just I

118
00:05:25,478 --> 00:05:29,918
it's it's a great conference and I've

119

00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,879
excellent yeah we we agree and um we're

127
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
hoping to have more opportunities for

128
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,600
some of that camaraderie and um

129
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,840
networking that you mentioned so um

130
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,400
we're really excited about this year

131
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,079
it's going to be a great event and of

132
00:05:56,399 --> 00:06:00,839
course one of the pillars of the event

133
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:03,800
is the medical practicum which is going

134
00:06:00,839 --> 00:06:05,519
to be taking place on Monday the 13th

135
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,360
and it's a full day workshop that's

136
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:10,799
really sort of a a crash course in

137
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,520
cannaboid medicine featuring you of

138
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:17,879
course Dr Dustin sulac Eloise th and new

139
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:21,079
this year Dr Ethan Ro Ethan rouso excuse

140
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,519
me which is quite the lineup um I was

141
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:24,478
hoping briefly can you tell the

142
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:25,680
listeners what they can expect from the

143
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:28,959
the medical

144
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,400
practicum sure so we uh at the medical

145
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:33,598
practicum break it down into kind of two

146
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,120
parts so one is the

147
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:37,159
basic um science that you need to

148
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,478
understand kind of like the first two

149
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,439
years of medical school where they teach

150
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:42,598
you all the biochemistry and Physiology

151
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,759
and you don't really get into

152
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,399
the um uh patient care just yet so we

153
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,598
have the morning lectures which are

154
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:50,679
about the physiology of the

155
00:06:48,598 --> 00:06:54,918
endocannabinoid system the pharmacology

156
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:58,598
the plant um and then we and and a few

157
00:06:54,918 --> 00:07:00,918
others and then we move into dosing um

158
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,639
how to approach a patient which

159
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:06,878
cannaboids you might want to choose for

160
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,960
which conditions or which symptoms um

161
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,199
and we share our clinical experience and

162
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,120
listen we know that we're behind in

163
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:18,160
research because of the prohibition the

164
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,680
schedule one status that is ongoing

165
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,360
still not allowed to do studies on THC

166
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,959
unless you jump through a thousand Hoops

167
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,400
with the government so although it's

168
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:31,918
getting a little bit better um what we

169
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:34,799
have in our art Aral is our clinical

170
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,240
experience and cannabis is not the same

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,079
as

172
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,199
Pharmaceuticals uh it's multiple

173
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,598
compounds in it it doesn't fit that you

174
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:46,680
know single molecule and where you can

175
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:49,399
do a randomized control trial it just

176
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,519
doesn't fit into that um and although

177
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:56,079
those trials are helpful I found that

178
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:58,279
clinically because cannabis is so safe

179
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,120
um if you just understand what you're

180
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:03,158
doing and learn from people who have

181
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,199
been doing it you can actually make a

182
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:06,879
difference in somebody's life somebody

183
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,199
who's suffering from a refractory

184
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,479
condition or somebody where the

185
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,080
treatment is almost worse than the

186
00:08:11,478 --> 00:08:16,639
symptoms of the condition and so and

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,198
even then not just those kinds of

188
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:21,439
patients but just General Wellness for

189
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:23,800
your patients to keep them well right

190
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,598
and so I think it's a a really it's a

191
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,800
Powerhouse of a day there's a lot of

192
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:30,279
learning um and we make ourselves

193
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,440
available so Ethan Dustin myself and

194
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:33,679
Eloise all have oh gosh I don't even

195
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,000
know how many years have you put it

196
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:39,239
together experience in cannabis medicine

197
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,320
it's a lot um but you have the ability

198
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,000
to pick our brains and I think that's uh

199
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:45,680
really important absolutely and that's

200
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
something that we we hear about all the

201
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,559
time is the fact that people can walk up

202
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,480
to you or have a meal with you and you

203
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:55,759
know just continue to to pick your brain

204
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,120
and um and learn even Beyond just the

205
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,360
sessions um is such a a great part of

206
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:02,039
the event and uh and I like the point

207
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,320
that you made too about the practicum is

208
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:05,759
that you you start off with the basics

209
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
which you know even if you're if you're

210
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:09,919
new to cannabis if you're dipping your

211
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,320
toe it's a great place to start and

212
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,000
gives you a nice foundation for the

213
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:16,560
following day too where it gets into

214
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,078
sort of more more detailed research that

215
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,039
the oral presenters are giving um if you

216
00:09:19,078 --> 00:09:23,199
attend the practicum it gives you a nice

217
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,919
kind of uh solid

218
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,680
foundation absolutely and you know we're

219
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,759
I hate to say it but we're all kind of

220
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:31,639
like nerds science nerds

221
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:33,159
and we focused on cannabis so if you

222
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,759
come up to me and I'm eating lunch and

223
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:37,919
you say hey can I pick your brain I'm

224
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:40,159
like all in you know let's go for it I

225
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,799
love sharing what I know because you

226
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,480
know I would joke around but it's true I

227
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:45,919
can't take care of everybody so we need

228
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:48,320
other clinicians we need other even if

229
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,039
it's not the first line treatment Like

230
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,480
It Is Well it's not first line in my

231
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:53,000
practice because I'm seeing people after

232
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:55,920
they've already failed first second and

233
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,919
third line but it's something that you

234
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:00,919
should be able to discuss with your

235
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:03,439
patients and and you need to have that

236
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:07,679
basic knowledge to have that

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,160
conversation for sure so maybe there are

238
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:11,078
some listeners out there who have

239
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:13,360
already attended canmed maybe even

240
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:14,199
already attended the practicum um but I

241
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,079
know

242
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,040
that the research is constantly changing

243
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,519
new things are always coming up so are

244
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:22,519
there new things in this year's

245
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:24,240
practicum that um you wanted to

246
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,879
highlight to that people should consider

247
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,519
if they're thinking about coming

248
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,639
back well we are spending a little bit

249
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:33,399
more time

250
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,519
on the clinical side of things so we do

251
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:38,039
have the basic science lectures but we

252
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:43,720
are you know trying to add more clinical

253
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:46,039
so case reports um and um uh Dr Ethan

254
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:49,440
Russo is doing a lecture highlighting

255
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:54,000
neurologic disease uh he's a neurologist

256
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:56,360
by uh training and uh he's so brilliant

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,600
um that he is able to impart that

258
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:02,240
knowledge about um how so many

259
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,399
neurologic disorders like dementia let's

260
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:08,200
say um certain brain cancers like we

261
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,078
really don't have good treatment you

262
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,639
know you your loved one gets diagnosed

263
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:13,239
dementia goes to the neurologist and

264
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:17,360
they kind of hand you some medications

265
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:18,919
that e don't really do great things

266
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,519
right maybe slight Improvement but

267
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:23,479
certainly not in everybody and lots of

268
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:27,200
side effects so um he's going to go

269
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:30,759
through how cannabinoids um can be

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,480
preventive uh and also can be um uh

271
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:34,759
provide a really great treatment for

272
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,399
people struggling with neurologic

273
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:38,319
conditions so I'm really excited to hear

274
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,519
that lecture i' I've heard parts of it

275
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,399
in the past but um I can't wait uh to

276
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,759
hear him talk about that yeah it's

277
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:48,078
always exciting to get to hear Dr Russo

278
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:50,639
talk he's sort of the sort of the Elder

279
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,319
Statesman not to not to date him but um

280
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:56,839
the guru he's my Guru he's my mentor

281
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:58,160
yeah he's he's phenomenal excellent and

282
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,480
so we we were talking about new

283
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,838
literature it's coming coming out all

284
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,959
the time and like I said I was watching

285
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,480
your cim at 23 presentation and you even

286
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:08,799
remarked that that morning you had to

287
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,519
add some new information into your

288
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:12,199
presentation because you were you were

289
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,919
looking at a paper and realized oh I

290
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,480
need to put that in there so literature

291
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:19,719
is changing all the time new research

292
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,240
all the time um are there any new

293
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,720
developments new research recently that

294
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,919
you're excited

295
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,879
about well kind of touching on that

296
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:30,639
dementia part of it a paper came out

297
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:33,078
very recently and it it's in mice but it

298
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,839
gives us some really nice information

299
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:39,638
that we didn't really have before so the

300
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:41,440
raw canabo cbda and thca so

301
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,879
cannabidiolic acid and

302
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,519
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid are

303
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:49,838
compounds that the plant gives us in its

304
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:52,078
unheated State way back when when I

305
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,120
started doing this in 2008 we actually

306
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,078
thought that these compounds were

307
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,879
inactive and I was taught so you have to

308
00:12:57,078 --> 00:13:01,799
heat the plant in order to act activate

309
00:12:59,879 --> 00:13:06,278
the medicinal properties kind of like

310
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:08,120
convert cbda to CBD convert thca to THC

311
00:13:06,278 --> 00:13:10,958
through that heating

312
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,480
process and really um we find out that

313
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:17,719
that's not true cbda and thca have

314
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,720
potent anti-inflammatory antioxidant

315
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:23,040
effects neuroprotective effects and so

316
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,120
there's been a tremendous amount of

317
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:28,198
research looking at these what we call

318
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,600
the acidic cannabinoids that a at the

319
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:33,919
end stands for the acid um and what can

320
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,839
they do so they are woefully underst

321
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:37,799
studied but luckily there's a lot of

322
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,800
interest and they're it's moving forward

323
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:44,879
in terms of uh the research and a recent

324
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:49,599
study came out showing that both cbda

325
00:13:44,879 --> 00:13:53,039
and thca in a mouse model of Alzheimer's

326
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,480
was actually quite protective and so it

327
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:57,159
lowered so when you get Alzheimer's or

328
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,120
dementia you what's happening is your

329
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,159
brain cells are becoming inflam flamed

330
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,039
and they're dying and with Alzheimer's

331
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:05,399
particularly there's these deposits of

332
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,319
these proteins in your brain that kind

333
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:10,480
of basically mess up cell function and

334
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,160
it turns out that cbda and

335
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
thca uh in mice that received those

336
00:14:13,159 --> 00:14:18,719
compared to mice that didn't get those

337
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,320
compounds actually reduced or lowered

338
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:23,000
those protein depositions which is

339
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,720
amazing right because we don't really

340
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,159
have medicine to do

341
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:31,800
that and also um alleviated this um

342
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:33,679
abnormal calcium flow the calcium is

343
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,359
very important to your brain function

344
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:36,879
calcium moves in and out of your cells

345
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,480
it's not because of how much milk you

346
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:41,879
drink or how much Dairy you have or it's

347
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,079
really just how calcium Flows In and Out

348
00:14:41,879 --> 00:14:46,919
of the cells and if that becomes

349
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,719
unregulated or out of balance you can

350
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:51,479
have a lot of problems neurologically

351
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,560
and so thca and CBJ were found to

352
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,320
alleviate that imbalance which is

353
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,719
amazing and also had neuro other

354
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:03,199
neuroprotective effects and in the study

355
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:05,759
they actually measured um memory loss

356
00:15:03,198 --> 00:15:08,000
and resilience to these changes and the

357
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:10,159
mice that got these cannabinoids did

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,799
better and what I'll tell you just in my

359
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,759
own experience I use cbda and thca all

360
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:18,000
the time in my pediatric practice as

361
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,199
well as my adult practice mostly for

362
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,240
alleviation of

363
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,039
inflammation uh like let's say related

364
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,799
to

365
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:28,919
osteoarthritis in the Pediatric patients

366
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:31,399
um also many of my patients have neuron

367
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:33,599
inflammation neuroinflammation they have

368
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:36,159
especially the kids with autism have

369
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:40,040
have major dysfunction in their immune

370
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:42,000
systems and also cbda and THC appear to

371
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:45,039
also help with anxiety so that's another

372
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,679
reason that we use it non impairing

373
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:49,599
compounds but not like plant we don't

374
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:52,638
have to worry about going high dose and

375
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,319
making somebody uncomfortably high or or

376
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
too much psychoactivity and certainly

377
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:58,439
that's never the goal especially with

378
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,000
the Pediatric patient so here we have

379
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:03,920
this new data it's very

380
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
exciting yeah that is exciting and so

381
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:07,639
you mentioned that the the prevailing

382
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,879
wisdom before was that you know you need

383
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,799
to decarbox these compounds in order to

384
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:15,240
make them active now was that sort of

385
00:16:11,799 --> 00:16:18,278
because it is true that and you made the

386
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:21,240
point yourself that thca is not

387
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:23,318
psychoactive until you decarbox it so

388
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,799
was the thought that okay if it's if

389
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:26,399
it's true in that case that it's not

390
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:29,120
going to be psychoactive unless we

391
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,198
decarbox it it's proba true for the

392
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,399
other medicinal effects too well and I

393
00:16:32,198 --> 00:16:34,958
think that's was kind of a

394
00:16:33,399 --> 00:16:37,360
generalization you know when you can't

395
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:39,479
study things you can't learn about them

396
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,079
so people went by how they felt so if

397
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,079
you were to take raw cannabis you didn't

398
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:47,078
feel anything same thing like with CBD

399
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:49,078
if you took some CBD and you say well I

400
00:16:47,078 --> 00:16:50,599
don't feel anything well maybe it's not

401
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,159
it's not doing anything I don't feel

402
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,720
anything and what we know now is that

403
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:56,719
not only do these compounds just need a

404
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,480
little time but dosing matters so you

405
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,199
should know what your dosing is the prep

406
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,839
reparation matters is it actually what's

407
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,438
in the bottle exactly what they're it's

408
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,519
what's on the label right does that dive

409
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:11,519
so there's a lot to it but most of my

410
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:14,599
patients who are using non um impairing

411
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:18,959
canabo so basically everything but THC

412
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:20,519
and possibly CBN um they are they report

413
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,600
well I don't feel anything I said we

414
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,918
have to give it time it needs to this is

415
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:26,759
a plant it's not going to hit you like a

416
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,080
harsh pharmaceutical it's going to get

417
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:32,200
you into homeostasis over time right my

418
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,519
analogy is if I'm out of shape and I go

419
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,519
to the gym tomorrow I am not in shape

420
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:40,079
tomorrow night but if I hang in there I

421
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,879
will see in a month I feel better in two

422
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,960
months I feel even better and by three

423
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,440
months people are saying wow you're you

424
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,880
you've got muscles and you know wow you

425
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,240
look great and so you have to give

426
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:54,640
cannabis a chance it is a plant that it

427
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:57,159
we're asking it to change your either

428
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:59,400
your neurochemistry or your inflammatory

429
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,120
chemistry you got to give it a chance to

430
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,798
work so but I'll share with you in my I

431
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:06,359
have a couple of elderly patients that

432
00:18:03,798 --> 00:18:08,519
have pretty severe pain from gout from

433
00:18:06,359 --> 00:18:11,279
severe osteoarthritis bone on bone in

434
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:14,519
their knees or severe hip pain other

435
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:17,558
joint pain and they report that cbda is

436
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:20,079
amazing for that it's and it's and

437
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:22,918
there's no I just have not seen side

438
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,798
effects now in my autism patients

439
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:26,600
sometimes they we're hitting targets

440
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,918
that we might not want to hit so the

441
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:30,599
children may have worse behaviors that's

442
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,559
very unique to that condition but in

443
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:35,519
general cbda seems to be very well

444
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:38,639
tolerated when just one comment about

445
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,879
thca non impairing but thca likes to

446
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,880
convert to THC so you have to watch your

447
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,280
product make sure you keep it cold don't

448
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:46,960
let it get overheated don't leave it in

449
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:50,038
your car on a hot day but normally kind

450
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,360
of the ratio I like for thca to THC is

451
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:55,400
at least like a 20 to one so 20 parts

452
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:57,399
thca to one part THC that can be

453
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,798
measured of course tested medicine so

454
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,720
you know what's in the B model uh if you

455
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:03,759
don't have access to that there are uh

456
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:06,600
some people on YouTube who have done

457
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:10,558
some kind of they show you how they make

458
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:12,558
thca uh from um the raw cannabis uh

459
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:16,240
plant um

460
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:17,558
but it can uh have a psychoactive effect

461
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,919
if you go really high dose because

462
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:22,079
remember with every thca milligram let's

463
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,720
say some THC is coming along with it and

464
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:25,558
sometimes it will convert it doesn't

465
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:28,038
convert as fast as I think people think

466
00:19:25,558 --> 00:19:30,000
it uh it does or how I used to think it

467
00:19:28,038 --> 00:19:32,400
would convert pretty quickly but it

468
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,798
looks like it's you know as long as you

469
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,400
keep it in the fridge it should be okay

470
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,038
and in my patients who are using thca

471
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,159
for seizures I have one uh a couple kids

472
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:43,079
in my practice thca is the only thing

473
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:46,720
that helped with seizures CBD didn't

474
00:19:43,079 --> 00:19:48,960
help THC didn't help but these kids are

475
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,839
not showing any signs of um of

476
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
impairment in fact what they're showing

477
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,038
is is improved neurocognitive function

478
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,279
because the seizures are

479
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:59,558
down now are you finding that in your

480
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:03,440
practice you're you're using the acid

481
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:05,480
forms more than the decarbox forms no I

482
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,919
would say that it's the kind of all lump

483
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:09,480
together it really depends on the

484
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:11,000
person's response I have a method I

485
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,279
describe in my book rule it in or rule

486
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,000
it out so we start with one compound we

487
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:20,359
dose it up we look for a sweet spot if

488
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,119
there is one if we can find some benefit

489
00:20:20,359 --> 00:20:26,158
without side effects at a certain dose I

490
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:28,239
have ruled it in if it's either no

491
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,679
response at all at low medium high do

492
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,679
does or a negative response as long as

493
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,798
it's not from these nuances of cannabis

494
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,400
like basic properties where low doses do

495
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:38,798
one thing and high doses do another but

496
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,840
we try to sort all that out as we're

497
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,158
going through the process if it's ruled

498
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:45,199
out it's ruled out we get rid of it now

499
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,159
sometimes it could be the the the

500
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,360
particular product as you know because

501
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:51,559
not all CBD is the same they come from

502
00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:53,319
different plant genetics and one might

503
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,720
suit your Chemistry better than another

504
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:57,678
so sometimes we'll try a new cannabinoid

505
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,600
sometimes we'll try a different product

506
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:03,840
in the same category

507
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:06,079
but uh Dr um uh sulac and I have a very

508
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,839
similar saying we treat the patient not

509
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:11,798
the condition because with cannabis it

510
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:13,558
truly is like an individual approach um

511
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:17,558
so it's interesting I have some patients

512
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:21,200
that don't tolerate um THC or CBD or CBG

513
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:23,319
but they do tolerate the acids and vice

514
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,679
versa and then some people just do a

515
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:26,480
they tolerate everything and it's just

516
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:28,278
we figure out what works best at what

517
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,720
what dose I do find that laying

518
00:21:28,278 --> 00:21:34,400
cannabinoids just to add that in um for

519
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,839
some people is really a very good answer

520
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,798
because you can keep them lowd dose

521
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:42,038
because they synergize and you can get

522
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:44,798
sometimes better results from that

523
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:46,960
Synergy of the of those plant compounds

524
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:49,960
rather than one compound at a higher

525
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,519
dose yeah no I think it was ddy Mary who

526
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:53,519
had a graphic in one of his

527
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:56,519
presentations that really sort of showed

528
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:58,240
how the different canabo when used

529
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:59,759
together kind of layer on top of each

530
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:03,960
other and and kind of create the

531
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:05,119
Entourage effect which um we've all come

532
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:07,558
to know and

533
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,519
love yeah and it's important to

534
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:11,319
understand that all of that takes time

535
00:22:09,519 --> 00:22:13,200
nobody can just kind of look at you and

536
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:15,359
go okay you should have take this this

537
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,759
and this I mean if they can then I would

538
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,879
say go to that person but in general it

539
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,000
has to be a little trial and error some

540
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,799
of my research with biomarkers on

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,679
children with autism is trying to help

542
00:22:23,798 --> 00:22:29,119
dial that down a little bit to give us a

543
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:31,679
little more narrow um or a little more

544
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:34,879
uh insight into who might respond to

545
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:37,440
what but we're getting there yeah and so

546
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,679
is that approach one that's kind of

547
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,880
foreign to most Physicians are they are

548
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:44,759
they used to having a more clear sort of

549
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
standard of care that when they start

550
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:48,960
using canabo it's a little bit out of

551
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,960
their comfort zone yeah we're not taught

552
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,519
that way in medical school we're taught

553
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,840
okay here's the condition here's the

554
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:57,679
standard of care the approved

555
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,639
medications and uh I mean you can even

556
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,278
get sued for not following standard of

557
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:05,720
care so you know and for taking a

558
00:23:02,278 --> 00:23:08,240
different pathway um and so that's kind

559
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:11,240
of how allopathic medicine works which

560
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,839
is that kind of you if you have this

561
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:15,679
condition here's the and and mostly

562
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:18,439
everything's evidence-based but you know

563
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,159
a lot of the Pharmaceuticals even as I

564
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,919
mentioned the treatment sometimes can be

565
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,080
worse than the condition yeah and to

566
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,960
treat somebody with a a medication that

567
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:32,119
now creates so you're treating them for

568
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,519
pain and now they have maybe their pain

569
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,479
is cut by 50% but now they have nausea

570
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:40,038
and constipation on top of it have you

571
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,599
really helped that patient right so with

572
00:23:40,038 --> 00:23:45,359
cannabis one of the goals is to not have

573
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:48,000
side effects the goal is to and you can

574
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:50,959
do that if you learn how these compounds

575
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,278
work and you can manipulate them into a

576
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,240
regimen for a patient based on that

577
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,278
individual's response and again that's

578
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,440
treating the patient not necessarily the

579
00:23:57,278 --> 00:24:00,880
condition so

580
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:03,240
I I think most you know I don't

581
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,080
magically come up with something I base

582
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,359
my clinical decision-making on what do

583
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:10,678
we know from the science and then what

584
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:13,759
do I know from other patients and but I

585
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:15,798
also explained to the patients the

586
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:18,558
parents it's going to be a little trial

587
00:24:15,798 --> 00:24:20,319
and error but remember there's really

588
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:22,399
very little harm and that's one of the

589
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:25,158
things that I try to get across at the

590
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:28,559
conference and at in in just in general

591
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,480
anytime I speak cannabis is safe all of

592
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:34,200
this nonsense about it being unsafe is

593
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:37,440
ridiculous if you are a 15-year-old

594
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:40,960
abusing THC yes you're going to have

595
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,000
problems that is not the case for

596
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:47,038
medically uh uh supervised or even

597
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,919
patients using cannabis medically it is

598
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,359
not you cannot lump them into the same

599
00:24:48,919 --> 00:24:54,038
basket it is completely

600
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:56,000
separate well said no and one of the

601
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,158
things you mentioned too this whole idea

602
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,038
of you know treating the patient not

603
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,159
necessarily in the condition and in your

604
00:25:00,038 --> 00:25:05,000
presentations a lot of times you're

605
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,200
you're talking about patients who have a

606
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:10,240
laundry list of of conditions um you

607
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,919
call them unicorns just because they are

608
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:17,720
so unique um so speak a little bit about

609
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:20,960
that and how you know what that's like

610
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,120
sure so I think Dustin Dr sulac um

611
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,519
Eloise and myself who all practice you

612
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,759
know uh clinically um have all found as

613
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,960
well as many other uh cannabis

614
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:32,359
Physicians that you end up seeing

615
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:37,480
patients

616
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:39,759
who have not been uh kind of this the

617
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:42,000
typical patient who responds to other

618
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:44,599
treatments it's usually what we call a

619
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
refractory practice which is unfortunate

620
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,678
because why should somebody suffer for

621
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,159
years before they can find Cannabis it

622
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,038
should never be Last Resort um

623
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,919
especially for conditions for which the

624
00:25:52,038 --> 00:25:56,278
treatment is not great and we know it's

625
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,120
not great look in taking care of

626
00:25:56,278 --> 00:26:01,278
pediatric epilepsy patients I've read

627
00:25:58,119 --> 00:26:03,519
just I try to read every single paper

628
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:05,679
and every paper says these medications

629
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:07,879
are burdensome in their side effects it

630
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,080
acknowledges it right there and then

631
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,640
goes on to recommend that medication and

632
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:14,720
I just find that like even as a parent

633
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,440
if I had a young child having seizures

634
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,000
is that excite me to put them on a

635
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,278
medicine that's going to slow down their

636
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,558
brain and potentially interfere with

637
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:24,679
their ability to learn well we know what

638
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:27,158
seizures do we know what these

639
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:29,038
medications can do and if cannabis can

640
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,640
play a Ro to help I don't know why

641
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:33,319
everybody's so afraid and they say oh

642
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,038
longterm longterm when they introduced

643
00:26:33,319 --> 00:26:38,158
some of these um anti-seizure men they

644
00:26:36,038 --> 00:26:40,519
didn't have long-term studies right and

645
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,278
we knew that they had bad side effects

646
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,599
so there seems to be this double

647
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:47,759
standard you know with cannabis to have

648
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:50,199
to kind of achieve this very high bar

649
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,000
but I'll tell you it achieves it people

650
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,519
who do not get good results they're

651
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,640
paying out of pocket they stop buying it

652
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:59,639
nobody is taking it just to take it yeah

653
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,759
now there are people who again there is

654
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,720
problematic THC use out there but that

655
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:08,119
is not Banning it or prohibiting it that

656
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:09,839
doesn't work we have to educate and we

657
00:27:08,119 --> 00:27:12,278
have to educate kids when they're

658
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,119
between the ages of eight and 12 about

659
00:27:12,278 --> 00:27:15,440
all substances and why they would

660
00:27:14,119 --> 00:27:17,719
probably leave it alone if they're

661
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,960
healthy so that their brain can develop

662
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:23,079
and so on right but that if they're sick

663
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,798
that some of these compounds that are

664
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:27,879
being talked about that are quote bad

665
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,798
for you are not used medically and now

666
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,278
you know we're getting into that

667
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,440
psychedelic world where all the

668
00:27:30,278 --> 00:27:34,119
psychedelics are being looked at yeah

669
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,440
you know coming around and saying there

670
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:38,158
is some benefit here especially when

671
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,360
it's medically supervised and used

672
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,519
appropriately so I think you know this

673
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:44,079
whole idea of it has to be FDA approved

674
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,919
and it has to be randomized control

675
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,439
trial with Placebo and all of that it it

676
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,320
life doesn't work that way for some of

677
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,640
these patients they can't sit around and

678
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:56,639
wait for us to discover a pharmaceutical

679
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,038
that works when cannabis can actually

680
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
give them a better quality of life and

681
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:02,079
I'm not talking even cure I'm talking

682
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,759
about just day-to-day functioning

683
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,918
feeling better being able to manage the

684
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:08,200
condition

685
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,320
well yeah and it's a great point you

686
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,000
make about the the bar being set very

687
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,759
high for cannabis medicine and yeah the

688
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,038
proofs in the pudding it it meets it

689
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:18,519
because like you said there are a lot of

690
00:28:16,038 --> 00:28:21,798
things working against people who are

691
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:23,880
using cannabis as a medicine the cost uh

692
00:28:21,798 --> 00:28:26,480
the the legality all of those things

693
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,080
access yeah right and they still

694
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,759
continue to use it because works that's

695
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:34,000
right that's right and they're using you

696
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:35,879
know there some f families who have kids

697
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,599
with epilepsy are spending upwards over

698
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,200
$1,000 dollar a month that is not easy

699
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:43,038
to do everything costs more these days

700
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,640
but just even over the past few years I

701
00:28:43,038 --> 00:28:46,480
think about how much money people lay

702
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,919
out but why would they do that because

703
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,519
their child is doing better or because

704
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,320
their loved one is doing better and a at

705
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,000
some point you you say okay we won't go

706
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:58,119
out to eat anymore we won't take a

707
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,640
vacation I mean the terrible that you

708
00:28:58,119 --> 00:29:04,079
have to give that up in order to take a

709
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:05,480
medicine that just about every study and

710
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,038
I can't even think of a study that

711
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:11,360
doesn't say this in a CL clinical

712
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:14,359
studies safe and well tolerated I see it

713
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:16,199
all the time if you go to PubMed or

714
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:18,119
Google Scholar and just look for some

715
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:20,440
clinical studies on cannabinoids it will

716
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:22,839
all say safe and well tolerated safe and

717
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,720
well tolerated now whether it worked

718
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:26,359
that sometimes depends on what

719
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,519
population that you've recruited for

720
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:31,759
your practice or for your study and also

721
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,519
what um product you're using is it the

722
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:35,960
right dose is it the right chovar you

723
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:37,839
know those questions come up but safe

724
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:40,440
and well tolerated is something that's

725
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:43,000
kind of standard to see in almost every

726
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,000
clinical uh study of of

727
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,759
cannabis yeah and the other thing you

728
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,599
mentioned too about how a lot of the

729
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:50,679
patients you see are these refractory

730
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:53,000
cases these people who have tried

731
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,360
everything else and it's just not work

732
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:57,079
working it makes me wonder about you

733
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:59,240
know the patients who maybe they are on

734
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:01,079
a medication and yeah it's working it's

735
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,519
reducing their symptoms but maybe it's

736
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,000
giving them some unwanted side effects

737
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,558
but they're like hey it's better than

738
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,558
nothing or it's better than what I had

739
00:30:07,558 --> 00:30:10,839
before makes me wonder like how many of

740
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,519
those people could potentially be

741
00:30:10,839 --> 00:30:15,798
benefiting from Cannabis but it just

742
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:18,720
didn't get bad enough that they sort of

743
00:30:15,798 --> 00:30:21,759
turn to it yeah or there's the leftover

744
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,319
stigma like I don't want my doctor yeah

745
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:25,558
and yeah and I don't want my doctor to

746
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:27,678
think I'm a pothead and you know what

747
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,119
that's an extra $50 a month and I'm on a

748
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:33,919
fixed income because I'm disabled or you

749
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:37,079
know uh it's the the mountain that we

750
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:43,278
have made people have to climb to go for

751
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:45,960
cannabis is is crazy and um it's one of

752
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:48,278
the things that's really is never talked

753
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,640
about is just how much money cannabis is

754
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:54,359
saving the health care uh utilization

755
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:56,519
right so a child that gets hospitalized

756
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,599
every month with what we call status

757
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:00,599
epilepticus a severe seizure dis

758
00:30:58,599 --> 00:31:02,879
disorder or a severe seizure that lasts

759
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,278
longer than 15 minutes and has to be put

760
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,679
on a ventilator and pumped full of drugs

761
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:10,319
and then a you know ICU and then a rehab

762
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:13,639
and the whole thing when you think about

763
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:15,678
the level of um illness and the high

764
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:18,119
cost of that illness in our Health Care

765
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,840
system and then you start a child on

766
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:21,038
cannabis and maybe they're not seizure

767
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:23,720
free but they're not ending up in the

768
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:27,440
hospital do you know how much money we

769
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,278
have saved Health Care at that point why

770
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,200
shouldn't some of that money go to help

771
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:32,278
pay for some of the medicines for these

772
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,798
kids

773
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:37,398
so yeah and adult and adults I don't

774
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,839
want to leave adults out sure of

775
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:42,518
course so kind of circling back to sort

776
00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:45,240
of the the new research that's coming

777
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,200
out and sort of the new canono that

778
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:50,120
you're you're getting to work with again

779
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,440
I I keep coming back to the the camed

780
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,038
presentation I'll definitely put a link

781
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,840
in the show description so people can

782
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:56,638
check it out but um you were talking

783
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:59,359
about a patient case and you said you

784
00:31:56,638 --> 00:32:03,839
know at the time I only had THC CBD and

785
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:06,319
thca to work with um so kind of when was

786
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:08,959
that and how has your toolbox sort of

787
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,480
expanded since then yeah it's really

788
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:15,000
been amazing so I've been doing this for

789
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:18,200
15 years and when I started in 2008 it

790
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:21,359
was THC that's what we had that's what

791
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:23,440
you took okay maybe a little CBD in

792
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,439
there but remember in 2008 nobody was

793
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,960
testing you would could walk into a

794
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:30,120
dispensary in California and you got

795
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,440
something a cookie or some cannabis

796
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:34,759
flower or whatever it was and you know

797
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:37,038
buy or beware then what ended up

798
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,119
happening was around

799
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:42,398
201122 the idea of testing cannabis

800
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:44,359
started to become more popular there was

801
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,319
no requirement by the state to test but

802
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,000
some companies were doing it so I was

803
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,759
pointing people in the direction of well

804
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,839
just go for the tested medicine the ones

805
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:53,200
that have a label the ones that look

806
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,638
like now of course they're labeling

807
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,840
issues and I admit that back then no no

808
00:32:56,638 --> 00:33:02,199
problem but but really nobody was really

809
00:32:58,839 --> 00:33:03,839
talking about CBD in 2012 and 2013 is

810
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:07,038
kind of the evolution of when we started

811
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:09,199
hearing more about CBD being medicinal

812
00:33:07,038 --> 00:33:11,038
for seizures for

813
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,480
inflammation and I would say that I

814
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:16,960
treated my first pediatric epilepsy

815
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:21,038
patient with CBD oil in

816
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,079
2013 so and it was hard to get you know

817
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:24,839
the parents had to make a zillion calls

818
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:26,319
to figure out who had it where could I

819
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:28,918
get it and then of course we were like

820
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:32,278
is it clean do we trust it because we

821
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:36,120
didn't have testing um and luckily there

822
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:39,960
were a couple of uh companies that were

823
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:41,959
um dedicated to and devoted to these

824
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,240
pediatric epilepsy patients and so we

825
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,440
were able there were about two or three

826
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:47,919
oils I mean now there's thousands right

827
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
think about that just in just basically

828
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:52,480
the last decade right and then what

829
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,320
happened was thca became

830
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,000
available because there was some

831
00:33:54,319 --> 00:34:01,200
evidence from people making their own

832
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:04,240
thca uh oil so there was a an article in

833
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:06,960
1979 that showed that thca stops

834
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,159
seizures in a rrap model or Mouse model

835
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,639
and you know when you're a desperate

836
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:10,760
parent and you're up at 3:00 in the

837
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,639
morning and you're searching through the

838
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,159
literature and you come across that and

839
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:17,320
you realize you can just go in

840
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,200
California get raw cannabis and make a

841
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,800
tincture out of it and then give it to

842
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,719
your kid they started hearing these

843
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,879
anecdotal stories of kids with thca uh

844
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:29,039
stopping their seizures or reducing them

845
00:34:25,878 --> 00:34:29,960
so that was available then CBG came out

846
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,599
then

847
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:36,159
cbda um and now we have and then cbdv

848
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,240
and thcv and so like you know the

849
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,398
alphabet soup continues right and now

850
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:44,918
you know like CBN is available and we

851
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:50,000
have a lot CBC is available from a few

852
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:52,598
companies cbga raw um flower that is

853
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,440
before it you know starts to have thca

854
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:57,838
and cbda in it um and all of these

855
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,760
compounds have some evidence in the

856
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,799
scientific literature of all of them

857
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,480
anti-inflammatory um some of them Target

858
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:08,039
cannabinoid receptors some don't many of

859
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,599
them Target trip receptors and or trip

860
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,920
channels the trip channels are highly

861
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,920
involved in pain and inflammation they

862
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,519
kind of overlap in the areas of the body

863
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,240
where cannaboid receptors are and

864
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:19,320
they're targets of these cannaboids are

865
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:22,639
endoc canabo Target trip channels so

866
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:25,039
that makes sense um so it's now become

867
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:27,239
this what I call the wall of vitamins at

868
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,719
the at the store where I go in I look

869
00:35:27,239 --> 00:35:31,159
and I go oh no I don't know which one to

870
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,759
get that's why it's so helpful to have

871
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:34,358
like a medical practicum so you can

872
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,240
really understand what maybe some of

873
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:42,719
these compounds do um I'm in general a

874
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:46,358
pretty neurotic uh physician but with

875
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:48,159
cannaboids I feel little less Neurosis

876
00:35:46,358 --> 00:35:50,519
because of all this experience I have

877
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,358
but knowing that they're safe and always

878
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:55,079
start low titr trate up understand the

879
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:57,318
compound read everything you can about

880
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:59,200
it so you have an understanding but the

881
00:35:57,318 --> 00:36:01,838
reality is sometimes you get an off

882
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:05,000
Target and the patient will tell you

883
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:07,440
they know and if they have anxiety or

884
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,599
they have say you know um it actually

885
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,119
made my pain worse or I feel nauseous

886
00:36:10,599 --> 00:36:15,920
you're on the wrong path you got to

887
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:18,358
change something yeah no and I have to

888
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,400
imagine that you know with each new

889
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:22,679
cannaboid that comes online you know it

890
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,440
just gets that much more complicated you

891
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:27,759
have almost too much variety to choose

892
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,240
from that's why we need to come learn

893
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:33,160
about cannabis medicine so the patients

894
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,239
can have a guide remember they're going

895
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:37,199
to pretty much discover if you give them

896
00:36:35,239 --> 00:36:39,000
the tools they can discover what works

897
00:36:37,199 --> 00:36:41,719
for their own body you are s you're

898
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:43,159
empowering patients to be advocates for

899
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:45,480
their own health you're not just saying

900
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:48,358
here's a drug see in three months you

901
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:50,880
are helping them kind of explore this

902
00:36:48,358 --> 00:36:52,598
and find their personalized or

903
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,480
customized regimen we've been you know

904
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:57,440
cancer treatment is now becoming very

905
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,639
personalized right it's should not be

906
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:01,480
cookie cutter when you have and and one

907
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:02,719
of the reasons I say I see refractory

908
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,519
patients is because they've been treated

909
00:37:02,719 --> 00:37:08,078
with a cookie cutter type treatment and

910
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:10,119
but they don't fit okay they're not a

911
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,920
cookie right they're a piece of cake and

912
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:14,318
so we wanna we want to be able to help

913
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,039
those people as well and we don't want

914
00:37:14,318 --> 00:37:17,559
to abandon them and I've had patients

915
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:19,759
come to me and say the medical

916
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,159
communities abandon us because either

917
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,440
our child or I don't respond to what

918
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:26,679
they gave us and now I've become like a

919
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:28,679
problem patient but for many of these

920
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:33,239
patients cannabis can turn things

921
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:35,358
around and having this huge arsenal of

922
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:37,719
different cannabinoids is so important

923
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,480
it's not just all about THC and CBD

924
00:37:37,719 --> 00:37:42,719
anymore yeah no and I have to imagine

925
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,400
that you must constantly be reading up

926
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,118
on the latest research and that's why

927
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,079
you like going to conferences and things

928
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:50,800
like that is to make sure that you are

929
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,160
always expanding that

930
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,079
Arsenal it is very hard to keep up the

931
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,159
information is coming out at the speed

932
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,400
of light there are more clinical trials

933
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:04,039
coming out on uh cannabinoids and humans

934
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,240
um we have these studies like the one I

935
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:09,400
mentioned about dementia with cbda and

936
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:11,519
thca look my father's 93 and a half and

937
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,318
he's I last night I FaceTime with him

938
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:18,039
and he's doing great I have him on CBD

939
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:21,920
cbda

940
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:23,519
CBG and very Ultra lowd do THC at night

941
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,720
because there's some evidence that ultr

942
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:28,358
lowd do

943
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:30,399
THC can be benefit official for

944
00:38:28,358 --> 00:38:33,000
neurocognition okay now he's not perfect

945
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,440
at 93 and a half but he's at home he

946
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:38,838
cooks dinner uh he Giggles along with us

947
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,599
I last time I visited we did a trivia

948
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:44,239
game so he grew up he's Lower East Side

949
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,838
of New York City he knows the city in

950
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,838
and out like he was a street kid you

951
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:50,119
know I mean he had a home but you know

952
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:51,920
he ran around on the streets let's say

953
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:54,519
you know back in the day and we're

954
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:57,119
talking a long time ago was born in 1930

955
00:38:54,519 --> 00:38:58,960
um he could tell me straight he could

956
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,760
tell me the names of all the bridges he

957
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,119
could tell me the names of when they or

958
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,760
the year that they built the subway and

959
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,480
the year that they built this and that

960
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:08,640
and this building and that building I

961
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,280
mean pretty sharp yeah and some of that

962
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,679
I'm sure is genetics and some of that

963
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,680
I'm sure is living a pretty healthy

964
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:16,279
lifestyle is you know throughout his

965
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,480
years not being a heavy uh substance

966
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,040
abuser and not smoking cigarettes and so

967
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,719
on but it's amazing to me that he still

968
00:39:22,039 --> 00:39:28,440
has it all together and this is on

969
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:31,039
cannabis so don't tell me that it's bad

970
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:33,318
for you it is not bad for you it is bad

971
00:39:31,039 --> 00:39:36,838
for you if you have problematic use but

972
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:40,000
again medic medical use is is just can

973
00:39:36,838 --> 00:39:41,559
be astounding for some people excellent

974
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:46,318
all right Bon I do want to be mindful of

975
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:48,440
your time um but winding down here um of

976
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:50,679
course in addition to come to the

977
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,200
practicum and make sure that you you you

978
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,838
meet with Bonnie and the other doctors

979
00:39:52,199 --> 00:39:57,719
here but are there other resources or um

980
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:59,960
ways people people can maybe get in

981
00:39:57,719 --> 00:40:02,480
touch with you or learn from you uh that

982
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,519
you want to share with the audience oh

983
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,000
that's great thank you so well first

984
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:10,880
thing is that the met the um some of the

985
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,800
lectures from canmed 2023 are available

986
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,519
and I recommend people looking at them I

987
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,680
go back to them all the time I went back

988
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:21,519
and looked at the Hop uh what is that

989
00:40:17,679 --> 00:40:23,838
hop latent virus that plants have and I

990
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:25,559
was trying to educate some other people

991
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,799
and I said I'm just going to watch uh

992
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:29,480
the doctor's video uh presentation one

993
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,480
more time so I got all the details and

994
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:33,280
then I'm able to really talk about it in

995
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:35,440
a way that I understand and I supplement

996
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,000
that with reading but so I definitely

997
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,039
recommend the CED 2023 lectures that are

998
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,880
online whichever ones are online um I

999
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,159
actually not to cut you off but we have

1000
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:47,760
all of the canmed lectures previous

1001
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:50,440
years up on our website so great great

1002
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,319
resource I yep I have a YouTube channel

1003
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,000
under my name Bonnie Goldstein MD and

1004
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:58,400
Bonnie's B and N without the e I also

1005
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,199
have my Instagram account where I try to

1006
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:05,519
post as much like new

1007
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:07,399
studies um and just kind of give people

1008
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,679
um okay this is what's coming out this

1009
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,440
is what we can what what what

1010
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:14,480
researchers are working on so I try to

1011
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,079
put out um anything new out there that I

1012
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,800
think might be helpful for people and

1013
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:20,519
then of course my book which is in your

1014
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
background and of I'm embarrassed I

1015
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:25,719
don't have a copy sitting here at my

1016
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:29,399
desk um but uh my book cannabis's

1017
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:32,679
medicine um gives you a very nice uh

1018
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:34,960
walk through the endocannabinoid system

1019
00:41:32,679 --> 00:41:37,159
the plant there's a chapter called how

1020
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,960
to use cannabis as medicine it explains

1021
00:41:37,159 --> 00:41:41,879
what ratios are like what does it mean

1022
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,400
to have a CBD to THC ratio what is a

1023
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:47,079
concentration how many milligrams in in

1024
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:51,079
an ML and gives people like just kind of

1025
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:53,880
a stepbystep approach to how to start a

1026
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:56,440
cannabis regimen and then there's about

1027
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:58,760
31 ailments I think that I cover with

1028
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,920
some of the research it's very hard to

1029
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:03,560
have a book out there in that there's

1030
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,159
new research coming out all the time and

1031
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:08,159
you know you have to you know like stop

1032
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:10,159
adding things so hopefully a rewrite is

1033
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:11,679

1034
