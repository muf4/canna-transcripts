00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:20,359
thinking the events in June I have

25
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,239
plenty of time yes you do but it's never

26

too early to purchase your ticket

27
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:28,000
package for cmed not only will you take

28

advantage of early bird pricing which

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
gets you another $500 off the full

30
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:35,039
Summit package but you'll also get the

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,438
satisfaction that comes with Crossing

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,680
something off of your to-do

33
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:44,279
list Our Guest today is Justin ESL

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,280
Justin is CEO and geneticist at Green

35
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,478
luster fenos and he's been an influencer

36
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,560
and leader in the Cannabis industry for

37
00:01:49,478 --> 00:01:53,359
15

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,680
years Justin was the head grower and

39
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:59,239
geneticist of an indoor commercial scale

40
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,479
cultivation operation back in 2012 and

41
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,399
since then he's helped more than 100

42
00:02:01,478 --> 00:02:06,118
cannabis facilities

43
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,959
worldwide his one-of-a-kind approach to

44
00:02:06,118 --> 00:02:11,520
plasticity breeding has yielded pest in

45
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,878
bacteria resistant genetics in his

46
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,159
application of cannabis tissue culture

47
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:18,799
and selective homogeneous breeding

48
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:21,639
enable his company to bring exotic

49
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,040
tailored Offspring to Growers

50
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:26,000
globally during our conversation we

51
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:28,239
discuss Justin's background in

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,959
traditional a and how that applies to

53
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,080
cannabis how he used uses tissue culture

54
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,598
to store genetics and eliminate

55
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,400
pathogens the process for creating

56
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:40,399
stable cannabis

57
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,599
varieties how purposely introducing

58
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,599
pests and pathogens into the breeding

59
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:49,560
room helps select for resistance traits

60
00:02:46,598 --> 00:02:54,000
and the application of analytical tools

61
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,920
such as PCR hlc and marker assisted

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,120
breeding before we get to my

63
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:01,399

80
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,439
esel good morning Justin thank you so

81
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:01,318
much for joining us on the podcast

82
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:03,199
thanks man happy to be here all right so

83
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:05,359
I'm excited to talk with you about

84
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:08,479
cannabis breeding techniques uh the

85
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,239
audience just heard me read your bio but

86
00:04:08,479 --> 00:04:13,158
maybe to start out I'm gonna ask you to

87
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,400
elaborate a bit more on your background

88
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:16,639
how you got into cannabis breeding and

89
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,439
how you're approach is different from

90
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,959
other

91
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:23,399
breeders yeah sure so um you know my

92
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,879
background starts off in traditional a

93
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,039
so I've been breeding blueberries I've

94
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:31,680
been breeding strawberries grafting

95
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:34,560
Japanese maples propagating ni Blu

96
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,400
hydranges um and so I have an extensive

97
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,000
uh background with breeding in general

98
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:41,279
for all a in general um but with

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,759
cannabis I would say around 2012 is

100
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:46,439
where I really started getting my feet

101
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:49,000
in the dirt um and breeding cannabis um

102
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:51,560
you know stabilizing genetics plant

103
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,120
genetics uh very similar right with

104
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,759
cannabis genetics um but what has missed

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:00,199
kind of missed the curve is you just got

106
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,840
a lot of genetics that are cross

107
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,560
pollinated um sometimes poor breeding

108
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,839
techniques are used um but you end up

109
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:10,720
with lots of different genetics and in

110
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,478
seed form they're very unstable um

111
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,720
sometimes you've got strains that show

112
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:17,319
very high her hermaphrodite Tendencies

113
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,840
uh and then you've got some that you

114
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,279
know you might have regular seeds where

115
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:24,758
you have 70% of them are male and only

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:28,399
30% are female um so you run into many

117
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:32,000
scenarios Growers do buying seeds uh

118
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:34,758
buying clones um and so it really really

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,879
got me into wanting to stabilize

120
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:41,479
cannabis genetics so that we have a very

121
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:46,159
very homozygous stock of seed for

122
00:05:41,478 --> 00:05:49,599
Growers to use um and so with that um

123
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,160
Madrid we started in Madrid in 2012 uh

124
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,160
we were pretty predominant in a lot of

125
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,840
the coffee shops in the Netherlands area

126
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,800
um and we started to work with CBD germ

127
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:01,439
plasm uh just to name one off hand

128
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,160
Lion's Tabernacle it won the 2012 CBD

129
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:06,038
Cannabis Cup in Spain um and so we

130
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,439
started getting involved with breeding

131
00:06:06,038 --> 00:06:11,800
but not just breeding but like I said

132
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:14,079
creating homity as well as plasticity

133
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:18,560
breeding which we can get into later as

134
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:23,439
well right so so what's your approach to

135
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,199
creating a homozygous um strain sure so

136
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,160
we are also a tissue culture laboratory

137
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,160
so something unique that we do

138
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,800
everything's in vitro

139
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,680
so everything grows in cryo it's never

140
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,680
watered it's never fed it's never

141
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,959
touched it's never looked at for up to a

142
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,639
year at a time and because of this uh

143
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:44,478
we've been able to really really

144
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,918
maintain a large Vault of different

145
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:49,560
genetics we have about 2,000 strains

146
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,359
that we've hunted um from about 20

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:56,680
countries now the USA being one um and

148
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,960
so we get these um into their vessels

149
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,598
where they go through either

150
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:04,159
multiplication phase or a ro phase but

151
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:06,918
more importantly 100% sterile so we're

152
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,800
able to sterilize these genetics uh

153
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:10,639
implementing aicle maristone tissue

154
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,319
culture we can get them back to their

155
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,439
generation zero uh which is going to

156
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:19,120
return that actual tissue that plant

157
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:21,680
that genotype to its original Vigor um

158
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:24,399
so we take a sterile approach and then

159
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,120
when we go to create a new line we can

160
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:29,000
pull from that Vault we get that out of

161
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,399
tissue uh we start What's called the

162
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,959
acclamation phase getting it used to

163
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:35,918
being out of that 100% relative humidity

164
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:38,839
vessel and then getting it into our

165
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:41,839
inbreeding Chambers uh we then will take

166
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:44,359
that specific strain and we will inbreed

167
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:47,119
it and we get it to about an S4 when we

168
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:51,680
get to an S4 we then get it back into

169
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,879
vitro and we hold it in that S4 um stage

170
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,079
so that when we come across another line

171
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:59,840
that really really checks all the boxes

172
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:03,439
for us we then do the cross there um so

173
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:06,560
we're creating stabilized Offspring um

174
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:08,800
in seed form um and yeah I mean that's

175
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,519
kind of our approach but we also take

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,639
that plasticity approach um something

177
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,758
very very unique that we're doing and

178
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,158
I've done an also traditional AG is we

179
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,158
are taking I'll give you an instance an

180
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:24,439
example of how we do this plasticity

181
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:28,598
breeding in 35 gallon tubs we are

182
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:31,478
propagating and growing um fungus larvae

183
00:08:28,598 --> 00:08:34,000
we Harvest fungus Nat larae with wire

184
00:08:31,478 --> 00:08:36,319
mesh and then we practice what we call

185
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,038
targeted releases so we might go into

186
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:42,039
one breeding chamber and we'll disperse

187
00:08:39,038 --> 00:08:44,080
this larvae and from start to finish

188
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:47,080
we're able to find that specific

189
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,959
genotype that shows the most resistance

190
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:52,440
towards that specific plant pressure uh

191
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:54,719
in this case being a fungus snap uh you

192
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,880
know they start in that lar stage but

193
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,480
then they evolve into that adult mobile

194
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,000
stage where they're landing on your

195
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,519
plants they eating the foliage they're

196
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,480
causing damage to your canopy and so

197
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,759
we're able to take that genotype isolate

198
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,159
it and then bring that over to the next

199
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:13,838
generation and breed again and again and

200
00:09:11,159 --> 00:09:16,399
again and we're constantly hunting for

201
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,360
that genotype that has the most

202
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:22,278
resistance towards that plant pressure

203
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:26,600
wow so you are purposely

204
00:09:22,278 --> 00:09:28,360
introducing uh a pest in this case right

205
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
to try to identify the plants that have

206
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,560
the trait that you're looking for

207
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,440
that's right and we're we're a

208
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:38,278
completely sealed facility so I hope so

209
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,560
yeah UVC filter hea filtered so we don't

210
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:43,120
really have too many past pressures that

211
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:45,958
come into our facilities but we're able

212
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,959
to control what does come in and then

213
00:09:45,958 --> 00:09:51,278
create such such a high density of that

214
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,838
specific plant pressure that's allowing

215
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:57,000
us to do these inbs and we do this with

216
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,760
spider mites aphids uh we buy spores a

217
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,919
PM uh and we do this with every Garden

218
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,319
pressure um that a grower is going to

219
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:05,278
experience so that they have the

220
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,720
greatest tailored Offspring when it

221
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:09,320
comes to growing and so you do it with

222
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:12,480
all those different pathogens for every

223
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,240
line no so we have a Target right so

224
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,039
every strain there's a Target we might

225
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,560
do a PM Target and then we're also you

226
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:22,719
know hunting for yields or we're hunting

227
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:25,239
for Turpin or canabo so there's always a

228
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,959
different Target um you know you go and

229
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:31,159
try to Target everything in one strain

230
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,039
it it would take so much to achieve that

231
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,799
um and then in many cases you're kind of

232
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:38,439
fighting one with the

233
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,719
other yeah so in terms of of pathogens

234
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,519
and pests are there ones that are uh

235
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,079
particularly um interesting or ones that

236
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,240
you prioritize I should say uh we

237
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:51,239
definitely prioritize powdery mildew on

238
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,360
the bacteria side on the pest side it's

239
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,159
going to probably be thrips aphids or

240
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,079
fungus snats indoor Growers experience a

241
00:10:56,159 --> 00:11:00,000
lot of the fungus snats they experience

242
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:02,519
a lot of the powdery mil do and then

243
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,078
when you get Outdoors you're seeing man

244
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,519
you're seeing all kinds of pest

245
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,919
obviously aphids spider mites um rusted

246
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,560
mites uh and things of that sort so we

247
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,439
have a different Target for each train

248
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:15,599
and now do you do environmental

249
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,519
pressures

250
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,839
too uh mainly just either pest or

251
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,600
bacteria um our rooms are each dialed in

252
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,320
so we've got breeding chambers that we

253
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,480
dial in for more of like uh say Texas

254
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,720
environment we've got strains that

255
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,278
Island for like main environment

256
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:36,519
compared to Florida environment um we

257
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:39,278
are East Coast breeders uh we're we're

258
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:41,720
located in North Carolina and New York

259
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,078
um and so a lot of what we're doing this

260
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,000
year last year and years to come is

261
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,719
going to be more so directed towards the

262
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,919
east coast cool now this plasticity

263
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,000
breeding is that something that's unique

264
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,919
in the

265
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,919
industry um it's Unique for cannabis

266
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:59,759
breeders yeah I mean most cannabis

267
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:01,439
breeders they're finding a plant that

268
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,078
they're growing they love it they find

269
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,720
another strain that they really like

270
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:08,879
they're crossing the two and they're

271
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,600
selling the seed um so for us it's

272
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,000
because we're indoors we're able to

273
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:15,320
achieve about four years of outdoor

274
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:18,839
breeding we're able to achieve that in

275
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:22,399
about two years in our indoor facility

276
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,040
wow but I think I think uh yeah a lot of

277
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:28,278
breeders aren't taking the time to do

278
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:31,480
Implement plasticity breeding and

279
00:12:28,278 --> 00:12:32,519
creating more of a homozygous genome um

280
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,639
with their

281
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,159
genetics yeah no and I was going to kind

282
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,680
of circle back too because when you were

283
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:40,198
sort of talking about the process before

284
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:44,159
you mentioned

285
00:12:40,198 --> 00:12:46,278
S4 um which to some folks who who are

286
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,799
listening and maybe some some hosts who

287
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:50,078
are who are talking to you um in terms

288
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:54,159
of like the

289
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:56,078
S4 um F1 all these different sort of uh

290
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,600
letter number combinations can you sort

291
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,198
of like walk through the process and you

292
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:03,959
know when each of those kind of comes

293
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:06,559
into play yeah so s is just selfing so

294
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:09,000
that's when you're taking um a specific

295
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:10,879
genotype that's a female um you're

296
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,360
reversing it and then when you reverse

297
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:17,039
it you're having it pollinate itself um

298
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,278
creating that first S1 and so we're

299
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:23,519
doing this over and over again until we

300
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:25,120
get to S4 uh and then when we get to S4

301
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,720
we're then pairing it with something

302
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,198
from our vault it could be something

303
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,839
from our vault that was bred uh with

304
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:34,479
male pollen maybe it's an F2 maybe it's

305
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:38,680
an F3 uh but at the end of the day we're

306
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,519
matching up two very very stable strains

307
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:43,799
and we're matching them with each other

308
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:45,399
to create um you know a new line and

309
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,799
then hunting from

310
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:52,799
there excellent yeah yeah yeah um so the

311
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,719
process of of selfing a plant um what

312
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:56,758
does that look like uh because I know

313
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,560
when I was looking through um your

314
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,919
LinkedIn posts there was some ation

315
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:03,638
about different techniques for creating

316
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:07,240
these femin seeds and how you know

317
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,480
they're not all equal oh yeah yeah so a

318
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,639
lot of people don't know this but the

319
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,560
first feminized seed ever in the world

320
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:15,399
ever created was created through a

321
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:17,919
process called rodelization rodelization

322
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,360
is a defense mechanism built into the

323
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:23,639
cannabis plant it's so that a female

324
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,278
plant will always produce Offspring okay

325
00:14:23,639 --> 00:14:27,399
and it's like I said it's a defense

326
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,078
mechanism now obviously being in the

327
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,240
Cannabis industry we don't want our Fe

328
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:33,399
female plants to be pollinated but

329
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,320
that's why they have tricomes and that's

330
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,320
why the pistols are there so that

331
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:39,639
neighbor and pollen Blowing by sticks to

332
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,160
the pistol retracts down and forms a

333
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:44,278
seed that's why the tricomes are sticky

334
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,719
that female plant wants pollen that

335
00:14:44,278 --> 00:14:49,720
blows by to stick to them retract and

336
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,000
form seed um and so what happens in this

337
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:54,360
rodelization phase is if you take a

338
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,958
plant that's supposed to reach full

339
00:14:54,360 --> 00:15:00,039
maturity in say eight weeks and you push

340
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:02,439
it to 14 weeks it will it will actually

341
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:04,958
produce anthers those anthers will

342
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:07,560
mature and it will pollinate itself and

343
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:10,119
this goes for female clones feminized

344
00:15:07,559 --> 00:15:12,758
seed this goes for all female cannabis

345
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:15,519
plants so that was the first way that a

346
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:17,720
female a feminized seed was ever created

347
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:21,360
now breeders we've learned over time

348
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:23,000
that this creates more um uh more of a

349
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,680
chance to get more of a like a

350
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,639
hermaphodite so it increases your

351
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,838
hermaphodite Tendencies substantially um

352
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:32,278
and so then you had breeders to use clal

353
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,920
silver clal Sil silver is probably like

354
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:37,879
the number one um product that you see

355
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:40,159
sprayed on feminized plants at home to

356
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,198
produce feminized seed someone like

357
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,958
myself on a commercial scale we use

358
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:47,479
silver thy sufate spray and something we

359
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:50,119
do differently um than any other breeder

360
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,959
I know of is we use an adant it's a

361
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,959
sticker so choal silver you're spraying

362
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:58,559
on a female plant every single day

363
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:59,599
repetitively for a long extent period of

364
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:01,638
time

365
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:04,360
with silver thy sufate spray you're

366
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:07,839
spraying about every 3 to five days

367
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:10,360
doing it our way we spray one time we've

368
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,519
made an Adent with the silver thy sufate

369
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:16,360
spray so that that stays active and on

370
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,679
the plant for longer without evaporating

371
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,800
and so we do this so that when we find a

372
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:23,799
genotype we want to reverse we're

373
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:25,479
soaking it once with the heavy atomizer

374
00:16:23,799 --> 00:16:27,278
and then from there we leave it alone

375
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:30,240
and within a few weeks we're starting to

376
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,838
see that reversal take place

377
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,560
so what's the benefit of doing it once

378
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,519
versus multiple times other than you

379
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:38,599
know ease of use for for you yeah I mean

380
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:40,078
it's it's really an ease of use thing uh

381
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,959
another thing that we're seeing is we're

382
00:16:40,078 --> 00:16:44,879
seeing more robust anther production as

383
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:47,359
opposed to spraying silver thy sulfate

384
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:49,480
spray every 3 to five days uh getting

385
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
this one spray with a very highly

386
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,440
concentration of the silver thigh sufate

387
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:57,439
spray uh we're just seeing more robust

388
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,920
uh reversals I mean I've I've had um

389
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,040
reversals that look like a and and it's

390
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:04,639
not sometimes with these reversals you

391
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:06,399
don't get as many pollen sacks as you

392
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,319
would like to and is like what you would

393
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:14,120
see on a male um but with this adant we

394
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:17,078
we see robust anther production um and

395
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:19,838
yeah I mean the the numbers don't lie

396
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:23,279
excellent so now this process of sort of

397
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:26,599
of reversing a plant is that just for

398
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:30,000
selfing or do you also use that um to

399
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:32,279
breed with another plant so uh two two

400
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,679
things so it's only for reversing uh

401
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,200
we're obviously trying to get pollen

402
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:37,960
from that plant uh in most cases it's

403
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,160
going to be live pollen so we'll have

404
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:43,519
that reverse plant in a sealed chamber

405
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,480
with other female plants um but in some

406
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,119
cases what we'll do is we'll Harvest

407
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,160
that uh that pollen and either cut it

408
00:17:48,119 --> 00:17:51,959
with flour and get it in the freezer or

409
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,960
we'll nitrogen freeze it just depending

410
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,798
on what we're doing but we do that so

411
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,880
then we can still have that same pollen

412
00:17:55,798 --> 00:18:01,960
to use down the line in a future project

413
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,240
excellent excellent um so I know one of

414
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:06,079
the concerns with with doing this and

415
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,839
know feminized seeds in general is

416
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:11,000
hermaphrodites like like you mentioned

417
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:13,359
before um is there something about your

418
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,839
process or are there best practices for

419
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:19,240
this to kind of make sure that doesn't

420
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,798
happen yeah I mean so it we we Implement

421
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:23,558
a lot of advanced tools not everyone in

422
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:25,839
the industry especially more of your

423
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:28,079
craft at home breeders not everybody can

424
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:30,720
implement this uh but we Implement

425
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:34,558
marker assist selection as uh as well as

426
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,038
par uh we're also an hlc lab as well so

427
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:40,200
we're able to do our hlc testing in

428
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:42,919
house um so we're able to really shave

429
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,759
off a lot of time that most breeders

430
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:47,919
have to go into breeding to find out

431
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,359
which genotype they're going to carry on

432
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:52,759
which ones have recessive traits which

433
00:18:50,359 --> 00:18:55,639
ones don't um and so we're able to

434
00:18:52,759 --> 00:18:59,119
collect a lot of data uh from these

435
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:01,520
third-party analytics to give us the

436
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:03,798
information we need to make sure that

437
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:06,679
we're bringing in the right genotypes in

438
00:19:03,798 --> 00:19:08,240
when it's time to breed excellent so

439
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:11,360
marker assisted selection I'm glad you

440
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,880
brought that up so Are there specific

441
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:15,639
traits that you've already identified

442
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:17,360
that you're kind of screening for or are

443
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,200
you doing actually like sequencing to

444
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,399
find new and interesting markers and

445
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,798
then going from there yeah we're doing

446
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,679
sequencing to find new markers um and

447
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:28,440
right this is a this is new to the

448
00:19:26,679 --> 00:19:30,440
industry somewhat new to the industry

449
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:32,480
and so so you know we're learning as we

450
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,679
go we wish I mean most of what we do is

451
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,200
in house but for the marker assisted

452
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,798
selection in par that's third party um

453
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,798
so we're leaning on them for a lot of

454
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,119
advice uh with the advanced tools that

455
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,279
they're they're learning and they've

456
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,279
mastered um but yeah we're constantly

457
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:49,279
learning constantly evolving looking for

458
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:51,720
new sequencies new markers uh to keep an

459
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:54,319
eye out for excellent so then are you

460
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:57,159
using like PCR assays to to screen the

461
00:19:54,319 --> 00:20:01,038
plants based on those markers in some

462
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:02,440
cases yes awesome that's really cool um

463
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:04,000
all right so I was wondering if you

464
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:08,798
could kind of just like take me through

465
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:11,279
the process of creating a new strain um

466
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:13,480
like are you selecting the plants with a

467
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,480
specific trait in mind or are you just

468
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,839
taking two plants Crossing them and kind

469
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,319
of seeing what comes out and then

470
00:20:16,839 --> 00:20:22,839
following the trail from there how does

471
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:25,399
that work yeah so I mean each strain is

472
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:28,759
different um I'll give you an example um

473
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:31,679
I brought back a a cut from AK-47 of AK4

474
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:34,038
7 from a family farm in Durango Mexico

475
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,440
um we got it back um and got it

476
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:39,158
initiated we then crossed it with a very

477
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,798
popular Michigan strain you've probably

478
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:46,280
heard of it Oreos um but to create our

479
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:50,519
new strain uh which we called cream 47

480
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:53,079
we had to take the Oreos get it to an F3

481
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:55,519
and then we took our AK-47 which we knew

482
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:58,279
as a land race strain and we did that

483
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,200
initial upfront cross when we do that

484
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:01,960
cross

485
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,000
when creating cream 47 we had a list of

486
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:06,120
markers we wanted to hit we wanted to

487
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,480
hit high triome density we wanted the

488
00:21:06,119 --> 00:21:11,558
bag peel to be there we wanted some of

489
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,720
that creamy kind of Oreo um flavor to

490
00:21:11,558 --> 00:21:17,879
come over from the Oreos uh in that

491
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,360
cross so in some cases it's doing a stem

492
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,679
rub on the mail in some cases we're

493
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,918
looking at internodal spacing you know

494
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:27,038
do we want a indicia dominant plant do

495
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,520
we want a sativa dominant plant do we

496
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:31,720
want a true hybrid um and then we're

497
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:33,720
also implementing like I said before

498
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,640
which genotypes and which plants are

499
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:39,600
most resistant towards certain uh plant

500
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,240
pressures um so I mean it's hard to give

501
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:45,759
a breeder a a rundown of an exact

502
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,519
formula for what our targets are um but

503
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:50,839
it's it's always changing I mean for

504
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:52,960
each strain we have a different goal um

505
00:21:50,839 --> 00:21:54,918
we just developed a strain push OG which

506
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,679
our goal for that was to be very drought

507
00:21:54,919 --> 00:22:00,720
resistant uh very very drought resistant

508
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,759
and to be a light feeder so yeah I mean

509
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:05,120
it it's hard to nail down exactly what

510
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:07,240
we're looking for for each strain but

511
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,678
bag appeal because of the way the market

512
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,640
is right now and the things that are

513
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:12,759
trending in the industry bag appeal is

514
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,840
always a box that we have to check

515
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:16,480
because at then at the end of the day

516
00:22:14,839 --> 00:22:18,399
the grower needs to like what they see

517
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,720
in the canopy and the consumer needs to

518
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,038
like what they see in the bag yeah for

519
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,200
sure so now when you you were talking

520
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:26,839
about doing the initial cross with uh I

521
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,919
think it was the F3 and then the land

522
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:32,158
race and then so so how many different

523
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,720
seeds are you popping how many plants

524
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:37,640
are you sort of evaluating and sort of

525
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
how does it scale from there yeah so I

526
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,720
mean if we're doing if we're hunting

527
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:43,839
through seed we're doing about 200 um as

528
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,278
I told you before we're a small indoor

529
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:48,558
craft sealed facility uh we're not

530
00:22:46,278 --> 00:22:50,880
Outdoors we're not in a greenhouse we're

531
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,759
in an indoor sealed environment that way

532
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,400
we don't have any worries of any

533
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:58,519
cross-contamination or uh foreign pollen

534
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,159
coming in that we're unaware of um but

535
00:22:58,519 --> 00:23:02,759
for what we were just speaking about the

536
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,600
F3 and then you're taking the land race

537
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:08,839
AK-47 once we make that cross we will

538
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,639
hunt out about from maybe 200 seed um

539
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:12,480
we'll do that because of the stability

540
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,960
with both lines we're working with all

541
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:18,679
we need is about 200 seed to find that

542
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,240
genotype that we want to then sterilize

543
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:23,240
um again we we use um axillary node

544
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:25,919
culture so we're actually doing a micro

545
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:28,558
splice taking that node sterilizing it

546
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,480
and then getting it into vitro um and

547
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:32,839
then depending on how quick we need to

548
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,960
make seed for our new line it might stay

549
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:37,038
there for a year it might stay there for

550
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,840
two years um and then we're we're

551
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:42,240
pulling it out when we need it excellent

552
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:44,839
so that upfront stabilization before you

553
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,000
were putting it into uh tissue culture

554
00:23:44,839 --> 00:23:51,399
makes it so you don't have to hunt as

555
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:55,200
many that's right that's right

556
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,559
awesome um so I know that you're working

557
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
with um a lot of different cannabis

558
00:23:57,558 --> 00:24:01,599
cultivators commercial home growth

559
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:03,959
everything um now are a lot of your

560
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,558
clients are they growing from seed or

561
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:08,200
are they more sort of popping seeds

562
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,038
pheno hunting and then cloning from

563
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,679
there sure so I mean because we produce

564
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:14,839
type one type two and type three

565
00:24:12,679 --> 00:24:17,080
genetics we've got hemp Farmers that are

566
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:20,199
doing 10,000 seeds at a time so they're

567
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:22,158
growing from seed um and then with our

568
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,600
guys that are more wck medical side of

569
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,360
the industry which is going to be more

570
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,639
along the lines of your type one or type

571
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,119
two they're going to buy like a 100 seed

572
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,480
pack they're going to hunt they're going

573
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:33,639
to pop 100 seeds they're going to find

574
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,319
the the phenotypes that work best for

575
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:36,759
them in their grow and then they're

576
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,759
going to get a mom and they're going to

577
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:41,278
turn it into a mom and cut clones from

578
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:43,720
there most Growers are running either

579
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,038
clones uh anyone I know running seed is

580
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:47,600
going to be mainly our hemp Farmers uh

581
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:49,839
but because of our stability with our

582
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:51,639
type one seeds we do have some Farms

583
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,918
that decide they're just going to run

584
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,799
seed um so again it really just depends

585
00:24:54,919 --> 00:24:59,600
on the farm we're working with now do

586
00:24:57,798 --> 00:25:02,558
you see that change in at any time where

587
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:03,879
you know more Farms will grow

588
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,440
exclusively from

589
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,559
seed well a lot of farms are hunting

590
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,320
pheno hunting constantly the advantage

591
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,359
from growing from seed is you have that

592
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,158
initial radical that little white Tap

593
00:25:12,359 --> 00:25:15,479
Root that comes out of the seed and

594
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,039
there's certain hormones that are

595
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,720
produced that allow you to achieve the

596
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,240
full genetic potential of that plant so

597
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,360
you don't get that with the Clone you

598
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:25,278
don't get the radical and you're never

599
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:27,079
with a clone going to achieve the full

600
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,880
genetic potential and that's why a lot

601
00:25:27,079 --> 00:25:31,639
of Growers favor seed seeds um I think

602
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,440
it's always going to be split I mean

603
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,360
you've got guys that love growing from

604
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,679
seed and you've got guys that love

605
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,439
growing from clone um I think we're

606
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,679
going to continue to kind of see that

607
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,759
Trend parallel um like I said it's it's

608
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:48,440
really a preference thing yeah no I kind

609
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,359
of I guess circling back to the pathogen

610
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,278
side and I know it's been an issue

611
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:56,240
primarily with folks who grow from clone

612
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:59,720
is hop L and vroid um any have you

613
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:04,038
worked with that pathogen at all oh yeah

614
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:06,600
so pop and vroid is is huge I mean it's

615
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:09,158
we've we've personally tested seed from

616
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,678
all over the place uh and I tell people

617
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:14,278
the data that we've tracked has shown

618
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:16,559
about 82% of what we test is positive

619
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:18,398
for the hotblade and vroid the best

620
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:20,200
place to test is in your roots you can

621
00:26:18,398 --> 00:26:22,398
test the bud you can test the leaf you

622
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:24,558
can test the stem and it comes back

623
00:26:22,398 --> 00:26:26,719
negative and there's hop and vroid it's

624
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:29,398
in the roots so the roots are the best

625
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:32,880
place to test for that um and the way it

626
00:26:29,398 --> 00:26:34,759
shows itself is later in its progression

627
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,200
you start to see things that look like

628
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:39,158
maybe nutrient uh nutrient deficiencies

629
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,278
the limbs start to be a little bit more

630
00:26:39,159 --> 00:26:44,278
brittle easy to fall off um and it's

631
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,960
very mature State you're losing

632
00:26:44,278 --> 00:26:49,679
cannabinoids you're losing Turpin yields

633
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,319
I mean it's detrimental um it's a big

634
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,038
reason why we got into the tissue

635
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:55,079
culture Arena we just want to ensure

636
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:59,000
that everything we're working with is

637
00:26:55,079 --> 00:27:02,119
sterile um and and it's that's huge um

638
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,038
back in 2009 I cultured out the Rosetta

639
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:06,639
virus out of knockout roses uh your

640
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:09,960
traditional knockout rose like you would

641
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,200
see in a neighborhood um and the Rosetta

642
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:15,840
virus uh transferred very similarly to

643
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,080
what we see with the hopl and viroid um

644
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,079
and so our approach with that to get rid

645
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:23,240
of it is through aicle maristone tissue

646
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:25,558
culture with a very high intensity of UV

647
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,359
exposure and we're actually able to rid

648
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:30,678
that germ plasm of the hopin and vroid

649
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:34,000
and get it back to its original Vigor

650
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:36,720
now the hopl en vroid you know it really

651
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,079
depends on how strong it is in the plant

652
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,159
you can test it and the efficacy is not

653
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:44,359
always going to be there so it's really

654
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:47,159
really really tricky uh to nail down you

655
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:49,959
know how how um potent is it in that

656
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:51,080
strain that you're working with yeah and

657
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,480
that I know that's one of the things

658
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:56,319
about hopl virid is it can affect

659
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:59,399
different varieties differently so I

660
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:01,439
mean h have you identified any varieties

661
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:04,839
that are more resistant to hop L and

662
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,640
vroid than others no I mean we're just

663
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:11,000
it's still so new um hopl Android's been

664
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,278
around for a while but on the analytical

665
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,759
side the testing side the R&amp;D side

666
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:18,200
there's so much there's so many more

667
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,798
unknowns uh there's so much more testing

668
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,759
and research and development that needs

669
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,558
to be done for us to get to the point to

670
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,640
be able to really lock it in per each

671
00:28:23,558 --> 00:28:29,480
strain I will say like our push OG I did

672
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,440
uh do a small experiment in an incubator

673
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,798
with the HL en vroid um and we did see

674
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:37,440
some resistances but it still picked it

675
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:39,839
up and it's still tested positive um and

676
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,480
as we know in that earlier State plants

677
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:43,720
can still be green you can still have a

678
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,399
solid run but then what happens is over

679
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:48,399
time it gets worse and worse and worse

680
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:50,439
um so yeah I mean it's we're still

681
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,079
learning man yeah no and we're we're

682
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:54,440
learning too on the medicinal genomic

683
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:57,759
side um you know we we sell hop lat and

684
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:59,798
vroid tests for for Growers and breeders

685
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:02,759
um work with a lot of the top

686
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:06,079
researchers on it um like zamir punja

687
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:09,158
out in out in Canada um but yeah there's

688
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:12,359
still a lot to learn and I mean I know

689
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:15,240
our CSO he's doing our his own tests um

690
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:18,959
with the Jamaican lion cultivar um and

691
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:21,319
he saw that you're right where you're

692
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:25,038
gonna find it more more times out nine

693
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:27,759
times out of 10 is in The Roots but in

694
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:29,759
some varieties mainly that one it stays

695
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,359
in the Roots even in flowering and

696
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:34,798
doesn't even get up doesn't get up into

697
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,879
the canopy until much later so he is of

698
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,839
the mind and still a lot more research

699
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,080
that needs to be done um that that

700
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:43,319
potentially could be uh a way out of

701
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:46,079
this you know having the have it stay

702
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:47,839
down in the roots and not affect the end

703
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,480
product there

704
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,918
absolutely absolutely okay now circling

705
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,558
back to kind of breeding what your

706
00:29:52,919 --> 00:29:56,960
targets are and what your customers are

707
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:59,158
looking for you mentioned bag appeal was

708
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:01,360
always kind of top of the list what are

709
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,720
other traits that you know that Growers

710
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,119
are looking for or maybe you know that

711
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,399
you're looking forward to for you know

712
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:11,079
uh the next few years yeah I mean tping

713
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:13,278
so I mean I'm a consumer I've been

714
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:14,798
consuming my whole life um so for me

715
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:17,000
it's the bag appal and then it's the

716
00:30:14,798 --> 00:30:19,519
nose right what does it smell like

717
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,640
there's so many medicinal value uh so

718
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:25,440
much medicinal value that comes with

719
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:28,720
Tarpin um as well as the canabo um my

720
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,159
passion for all of this um is because of

721
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:34,278
my grandfather I lost an 09 to cancer um

722
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,720
and you know back then all they had was

723
00:30:34,278 --> 00:30:39,278
the maritol pill um it was like one of

724
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,759
the first legally synthesized THC pills

725
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,759
and it helped them with radiation it

726
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:45,640
helped them keep down food now on that

727
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,798
end of the spectrum for us that's what

728
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:51,000
got us into developing type two

729
00:30:47,798 --> 00:30:53,519
varieties is we noticed the bag appe

730
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,519
peel and the tpin were very very

731
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,038
profound with our type two varieties um

732
00:30:56,519 --> 00:31:01,159
and so for us it really depends on are

733
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,599
we breeding a type one are we breeding a

734
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:05,200
type two or are we breeding a type three

735
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:07,918
um as I mentioned before those are the

736
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,720
three that we search for but bag appeal

737
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:13,519
Tarpin and plant resistance are are

738
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,798
three top uh that we look for yields

739
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,679
yields are important as well but I would

740
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:22,079
say that comes forth excellent now are

741
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:24,000
you seeing more Growers open to Growing

742
00:31:22,079 --> 00:31:25,439
um you know type two varieties I mean I

743
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,480
can just tell you from personally

744
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,798
looking at at flower that's available

745
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:32,440
Where We Are are where in Massachusetts

746
00:31:29,798 --> 00:31:34,839
um it's all type one um you can find

747
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:37,120
sort of the one to one in more of your

748
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,278
your tentures your Vapes your edibles

749
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:42,119
but in terms of flower it's just all

750
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:45,319
type one yeah no I mean I would tell you

751
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:47,759
this year our top seller were our Tios

752
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,158
um we've got them out in dispos in

753
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:52,798
Michigan uh they're out in dispos in New

754
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:54,639
York Florida so it's starting to Trend I

755
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:57,079
think the consumer as well you know for

756
00:31:54,638 --> 00:32:00,519
a long time it's just like potency of

757
00:31:57,079 --> 00:32:02,599
THC can get the highest THC potency and

758
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:04,000
the problem with that is the breeder I

759
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,918
mean not the breeder the grower is just

760
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,079
rolling it in hash and then getting it

761
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:11,000
tested and so what you see on the label

762
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:14,119
isn't authentic so I think as as the

763
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:16,240
trust and the education come come to a

764
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,558
plateau I think Growers are going to be

765
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,919
more and more interested in growing like

766
00:32:18,558 --> 00:32:22,879
type two varieties um I'm a young Dad

767
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:25,000
I've got two little girls and because

768
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,799
I'm a daily consumer I like type twos

769
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,558
because I still get high I still feel

770
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,960
euphoric but don't have that impaired I

771
00:32:29,558 --> 00:32:34,720
don't have that slowed reaction dry eyes

772
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:36,720
dry mouth because the CBD truly

773
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,038
counteracts that psychotrophic effect of

774
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,120
the THC um so for me it's amazing um

775
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:43,480
I've got guys in Michigan right now and

776
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:45,398
they're selling crops twice they're

777
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:47,679
running a type two and through

778
00:32:45,398 --> 00:32:50,319
chromatography and winterization they're

779
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,960
pulling off the CBD and then pulling off

780
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:56,038
the THC and getting two turns of Revenue

781
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:59,558
on one crop um so it is trending it's

782
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:01,879
becoming bigger um and it's the best

783
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,720
possible form of cannabis medicine is a

784
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:07,159
full spectrum plant that has not just

785
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:10,839
THC but it's got some other beneficial

786
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,320
canabo as well yeah for sure and I think

787
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:14,638
I mean I think there's really a big

788
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,960
market for for the type two varieties I

789
00:33:14,638 --> 00:33:18,439
can't tell you how many times I've heard

790
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:20,759
people say oh you know I've tried to get

791
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:22,759
back into smoking now that it's legal

792
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,839
and you know it's just way too strong

793
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:27,480
for me I got paranoid or got anxiety and

794
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,678
I think it's largely in part of that

795
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,720
it's it's just too high in the THC and

796
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:34,159
you don't have that CBD to kind of

797
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,360
counteract and give you a more balanced

798
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:37,720
experience like you were talking about

799
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:39,719
yeah yeah I mean there's a time in place

800
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,679
for everything I I love high THC

801
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:43,200
varieties too I mean but like I said

802
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,720
there's a time in place so there's

803
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,360
sometimes I want a type two there's

804
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,278
sometimes I want a type one um but yeah

805
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:51,199
I think as consumers become more

806
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:53,278
educated you know for a while there in

807
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,880
2018 the hemp industry a lot of guys

808
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:59,440
were buying hemp flour and mixing it

809
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:02,000
with their their herb they every day and

810
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,120
they're really enjoying the experience

811
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,759
um and so I like I said I think it's

812
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:08,118
kind of like the hotblade and viroid I

813
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,519
think we just need time the more time

814
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:12,200
the more education uh you know the more

815
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,838
consumers are going to realize what I

816
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:17,118
know and I'm sure many other people know

817
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:19,039
as well excellent yeah all about all

818
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,559
about education and and sharing

819
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,639
knowledge that's where we're about here

820
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,559
at camed so kind of wrapping up here

821
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:28,039
Justin I want to give you an opportunity

822
00:34:25,559 --> 00:34:30,159
um share with the audience you know know

823
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:32,878
anything new coming up with uh green

824
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,119
luster fenos and um if they want to

825
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:38,759
learn more about you and what you do um

826
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:40,559
share any resources yeah absolutely so

827
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,159
new and upcoming uh we actually have

828
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:46,358
something really big um so when I was in

829
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:48,119
high school a good friend of mine he's

830
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:51,159
first string of the UNCC Chapel Hill

831
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:54,800
football team um they brought back some

832
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:57,160
really really nice Granddaddy Purple um

833
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:00,160
and we actually found a few seeds out of

834
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:02,399
this bat so this this is a long time ago

835
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,879
and uh what we did was we mixed it with

836
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,519
flour and froze it right away um I've

837
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,800
always been a genetic freak always

838
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,679
keeping seeds and seeds of other

839
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:14,519
breeders and from other countries and so

840
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:17,879
for me collecting genetics has always

841
00:35:14,519 --> 00:35:21,679
been kind of a hobby of mine um and so

842
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,119
we popped um a few two years ago now we

843
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:28,039
popped these bag seeds quote unquote bag

844
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:31,079
seeds um and what we discovered was just

845
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:32,960
remarkable the females were all poor

846
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:35,839
every female we found of course right

847
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,838
was the flower was poor the yields were

848
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:41,920
poor but we found some amazing males

849
00:35:38,838 --> 00:35:45,358
that had amazing stem rubs really really

850
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:48,358
heavy pollen producers and so we use

851
00:35:45,358 --> 00:35:51,199
that um to create new varieties and

852
00:35:48,358 --> 00:35:53,598
we're actually dropping three new uh

853
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:55,559
granddaddy per number three crosses this

854
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,760
year the number three was the mail we

855
00:35:55,559 --> 00:36:00,719
used uh out of all the males we planted

856
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,599
and got in vitro it was just big fan

857
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:07,759
leaves really nice stem rub great

858
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:10,000
internal spacing very Hardy um so we

859
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,720
created three new crosses uh we crossed

860
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:15,440
our wintery fruit which was our top

861
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:18,239
seller in 2018 2019 in 2020 uh we

862
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:20,639
crossed your famous um ice cream cake

863
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:22,519
and then we crossed a Lemon Haze um

864
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,118
Lemon Haze was from Greenhouse

865
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:28,119
Greenhouse seats um so we're super

866
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,000
excited for this I mean it's an amazing

867
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,680
thing to experience something when

868
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
you're younger and then to be able to

869
00:36:31,679 --> 00:36:37,118
bring it back grow it and it's identical

870
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,358
to what it was then uh it's a beautiful

871
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,800
thing so we're really excited for that

872
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,880
so that's kind of what green luster

873
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:45,160
fenos has coming up this year hoping to

874
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,800
release those in December uh we'll do a

875
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:49,598
breeders cut as well uh for those of you

876
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,680
that don't know anyone watching our

877
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,640
breeders cut is just when we pull one

878
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:55,799
out of vitro that's the one that I

879
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:58,400
selected personally out of hundreds and

880
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,318
hundreds of genotypes and so as you know

881
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,680
a lot of Growers a lot of commercial

882
00:37:00,318 --> 00:37:04,719
operators craft cultivators they're

883
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:07,239
having to pop these seeds and spend nine

884
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,598
months sometimes 12 months finding the

885
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:12,039
right plant to turn into a mom with our

886
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,599
breeders cut we do all the work for you

887
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:17,559
um it's fully rooted and we overnight

888
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:20,400
ship for free anywhere in the USA

889
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:22,199
excellent now in terms of if Growers

890
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,160
want to do their own breeding project

891
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:26,639
with your

892
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:27,879
genetics is that is that cool absolutely

893
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:29,879
man I mean that's that's how this

894
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,720
industry exists I mean some of the

895
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,280
greatest varieties we have were produced

896
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:37,399
by other breeders not not by produced uh

897
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,160
by myself but by other breeders so

898
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:41,400
absolutely I think the more uh the more

899
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,799
the better you know we want more

900
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,039
breeders to use our germ plasm and cross

901
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:48,440
it with what they have and and vice

902
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:49,838
versa excellent and now coming back to

903
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,200
the bag SE because that's really

904
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:53,440
interesting you mentioned that the

905
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:57,159
females weren't so hot but the but the

906
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:01,000
males looked great is that typical with

907
00:37:57,159 --> 00:38:02,838
bags seed no no I mean well we we don't

908
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,119
do a lot of bag seed hunting we just

909
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:06,599
have a few where I got some herb and I

910
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:09,280
really liked it and there happened to be

911
00:38:06,599 --> 00:38:11,318
a seed and I kept it um so we're not

912
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,960
normally you know doing projects from

913
00:38:11,318 --> 00:38:16,318
bag of seed that's why this is such a

914
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,199
big deal um but no I mean I would say

915
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,960
normally we find females that are great

916
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:22,399
um and then we you know we'll find some

917
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,039
males that are good and sometimes we're

918
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,639
hunting feminized seeds so then we're

919
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:29,358
not really finding males um but in this

920
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:32,279
case it was a it was a male seat um so

921
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:35,239
we we really uh won with that one that's

922
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:36,960
cool yeah awesome all right thanks again
