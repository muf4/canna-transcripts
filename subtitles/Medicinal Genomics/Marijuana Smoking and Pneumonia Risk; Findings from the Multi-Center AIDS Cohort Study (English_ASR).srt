1
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:13,628
great so good it's good afternoon

2
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:16,179
everyone so the title of my presentation

3
00:00:13,628 --> 00:00:19,778
is does marijuana smoking increase the

4
00:00:16,179 --> 00:00:22,329
risk of pneumonia when considering

5
00:00:19,778 --> 00:00:24,490
treatment with any therapeutic agent one

6
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:27,338
must always benefit whatever it's always

7
00:00:24,489 --> 00:00:32,849
benefit one must always balance benefit

8
00:00:27,338 --> 00:00:36,009
against risk and regarding marijuana its

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:39,460
smoke contains most of the same

10
00:00:36,009 --> 00:00:42,489
ingredients found in tobacco smoke many

11
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:49,000
of which are known to be toxic to lung

12
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:52,270
tissue and we know that marijuana that's

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,730
tobacco is the major risk factor by

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,760
virtue of exposure of the lung to these

15
00:00:54,729 --> 00:00:59,679
toxic components within the smoke to

16
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:05,140
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

17
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:07,920
and lung cancer both of which account

18
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:13,030
for considerable morbidity and mortality

19
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:17,530
worldwide so for some time there has

20
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:22,509
been concern that marijuana because it

21
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:24,129
shares the most of the ingredients the

22
00:01:22,509 --> 00:01:26,978
toxic ingredients contained within

23
00:01:24,129 --> 00:01:31,420
tobacco smoke might actually pose

24
00:01:26,978 --> 00:01:36,179
similar respiratory risks however the

25
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:39,780
weight of evidence thus far does not

26
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:43,539
support a significant association

27
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,700
between marijuana smoking even heavy

28
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:50,129
marijuana smoking and these two

29
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,530
respiratory complications of of tobacco

30
00:01:50,129 --> 00:01:56,828
on the other hand there is another

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:02:01,030
tobacco related respiratory risk namely

32
00:01:56,828 --> 00:02:02,828
community acquired pneumonia 25% of the

33
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,849
cases of which can be attributed to

34
00:02:02,828 --> 00:02:12,359
tobacco smoke there are 1.4 million

35
00:02:06,849 --> 00:02:15,009
deaths due to pneumonia a worldwide and

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:18,849
unfortunately there is little

37
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:19,509
information concerning the possibility

38
00:02:18,848 --> 00:02:22,149
that myrrh

39
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:25,328
smoking might also predispose to

40
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:30,069
pneumonia and so that was the objective

41
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:31,420
of a study that we conducted that I'm

42
00:02:30,068 --> 00:02:33,578
going to results of which I'm going to

43
00:02:31,419 --> 00:02:36,669
be presenting today so I'd like to begin

44
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:40,780
with a brief discussion of the biologic

45
00:02:36,669 --> 00:02:44,378
plausibility of there being at risk of

46
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:47,680
marijuana for for pneumonia so we

47
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:49,780
performed bronchoscopy on a large number

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,969
of smokers of marijuana there were

49
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,340
regular generally heavy smokers of

50
00:02:51,969 --> 00:02:57,930
marijuana alone were with tobacco

51
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,239
tobacco smokers alone and non-smokers

52
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:04,469
and we obtained biopsies at various

53
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:08,829
sites in the lower respiratory tract and

54
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:11,799
found that in contrast to the normal

55
00:03:08,829 --> 00:03:15,579
bronchial mucosa and here we see the

56
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:19,750
nice ciliated columnar epithelial cells

57
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:22,439
that line the the larger airways these

58
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:25,150
were largely destroyed and replaced by

59
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:27,489
mucous secreting surface epithelial

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:33,549
cells so-called goblet cells as well as

61
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:36,069
other cells and this then results in an

62
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:39,730
increased production of mucus from these

63
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:42,878
cells with the limited capacity of the

64
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:46,738
lung to clear the mucus out of the lung

65
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:52,149
because of the Associated ciliary loss

66
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:55,500
so that this excess accumulated mucus

67
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:59,260
mucus could serve as a culture medium

68
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:01,120
for pathogenic bacteria and predisposed

69
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:04,899
to pneumonia and as a matter of fact

70
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,090
there are observational studies

71
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,519
carefully conducted observational

72
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:12,219
studies that do show an association

73
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:16,899
between increased butan production and

74
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:19,598
marijuana use now alveolar macrophages

75
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:23,769
are the primary immune effector cells

76
00:04:19,598 --> 00:04:26,949
that reside in the lung and they serve a

77
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:29,589
very important function to protect the

78
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:32,620
lung against infection when they are

79
00:04:29,589 --> 00:04:36,698
stimulated by bacteria or other

80
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:38,860
microbes then they release toxic

81
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:45,718
products including reactive oxygen

82
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:50,050
species nitric oxide etc that kill the

83
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:53,519
bacteria we wanted to look at the

84
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:55,718
function of alveolar macrophages

85
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:58,448
harvested from the lungs of marijuana

86
00:04:55,718 --> 00:05:00,459
smokers and so we used the technique of

87
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:04,330
Bronco ireally lavage who the bronchus

88
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:06,430
go to rinse the the the cells out of the

89
00:05:04,329 --> 00:05:09,068
lung so that we could examine their

90
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,590
function and we compared macrophages

91
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:13,900
obtained from marijuana smokers with

92
00:05:11,589 --> 00:05:16,119
those obtained from tobacco only smokers

93
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:18,818
combine smokers of marijuana tobacco and

94
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,340
non-smokers and what we found these were

95
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:24,699
this is the old studies but they're

96
00:05:21,339 --> 00:05:28,000
still valid that the macrophages from

97
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:30,728
the marijuana smokers relative to those

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,189
from tobacco smokers were impaired in

99
00:05:30,728 --> 00:05:36,968
their ability to release the reactive

100
00:05:33,189 --> 00:05:38,588
oxygen species when stimulated they were

101
00:05:36,968 --> 00:05:42,009
also impaired in their ability to

102
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:44,168
produce pro-inflammatory cytokines the

103
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:48,069
TNF l46 gm-csf

104
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:51,008
that play a very important role in up

105
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:52,680
regulating inducible nitric oxide

106
00:05:51,009 --> 00:05:56,379
synthase which is the enzyme that

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:58,899
converts arginine to nitric oxide and as

108
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:01,060
I mentioned before nitric oxide is one

109
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:05,560
of the effector molecules that are

110
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:08,439
important in killing bacteria so we

111
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:11,288
culture the macrophages that came from

112
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,210
the marijuana smokers with pathogenic

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:17,288
bacterium staph aureus feels that

114
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:21,338
similar stays with fungi and and then

115
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:23,680
looked at the waited awhile and looked

116
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:27,639
at the ability these macrophages to kill

117
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:30,718
the bacteria on the the upper curve here

118
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,620
represents the occur from the

119
00:06:30,718 --> 00:06:35,228
macrophages obtained from marijuana

120
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:37,658
smokers this is bacteria remaining so

121
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:39,579
the shallower the curve the less the

122
00:06:37,658 --> 00:06:42,009
killing so we haven't see an impaired

123
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:43,658
ability of macrophages from marijuana

124
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:46,060
smokers to kill bacteria

125
00:06:43,658 --> 00:06:50,009
compared to macrophages

126
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:53,829
nonsmokers and also from tobacco smokers

127
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:56,230
and this is a little complex light so go

128
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:59,560
through a little slowly the white

129
00:06:56,230 --> 00:07:02,610
circles represent nitric represent a

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:05,889
bacterial killing and the white bars

131
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:10,900
represent nitric oxide production ignore

132
00:07:05,889 --> 00:07:14,680
the black circles and bars and we here

133
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:16,659
we see again that the bacterial killing

134
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,240
by the macrophages and the marijuana

135
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,450
smokers is impaired in parallel with an

136
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:26,730
impairment in nitric oxide production

137
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:29,860
when we added a cytokine gm-csf

138
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:33,569
exogenously we restored nitric oxide

139
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:36,759
production and at the same time restored

140
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:38,860
the bacterial killing capacity of these

141
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:41,439
macrophages so what is the clinical

142
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,439
evidence that marijuana use might be a

143
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:47,889
risk factor predisposing to pneumonia

144
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:50,439
there are older case series of fungal

145
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:52,930
pneumonia in marijuana smokers

146
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:56,350
immunocompromised by AIDS and other

147
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:57,670
conditions we know that hiv-positive

148
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,790
individuals are particularly high risk

149
00:07:57,670 --> 00:08:03,220
for developing pneumonia including

150
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:06,000
opportunistic infection such as Loomis's

151
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:09,070
karidian pneumonia and there are a few

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,990
older epidemiological studies that

153
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:13,149
showed a significant association between

154
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:15,420
marijuana smoking these were studies

155
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:17,409
included hiv-positive individuals and

156
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,990
and pneumonia

157
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,110
although conflicting findings have been

158
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:27,430
reported so is our objective to

159
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:30,759
reexamine the question whether marijuana

160
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:33,940
smoking does or does not increase the

161
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:37,389
risk for pneumonia and we use data from

162
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:40,440
the Modi Center AIDS cohort study which

163
00:08:37,389 --> 00:08:44,889
is an ongoing prospective observational

164
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,240
study of gay men regarding the natural

165
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:51,490
history of HIV infection so the study

166
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,680
was initiated in 1983 as I mentioned

167
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:58,600
it's still ongoing

168
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:59,709
we analyzed data from subjects who were

169
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,080
either

170
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:06,070
persistently HIV negative or HIV

171
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:08,850
positive we excluded those who converted

172
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:13,320
because we have possible conversion

173
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:16,240
confounding by serial conversion and the

174
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,390
subjects returned to the clinic every

175
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,629
six months and it was at these visits

176
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:24,490
that we then determine whether or not by

177
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:26,950
self-report whether or not the patients

178
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,799
had had experienced pneumonia in the

179
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:31,540
interval and divided the pneumonias into

180
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,250
community acquired pneumonia and

181
00:09:31,539 --> 00:09:36,669
Pneumocystis Carini and pneumonia the

182
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:39,159
most common district pneumonia in in

183
00:09:36,669 --> 00:09:41,379
hiv-positive individuals and in most

184
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:47,759
cases the pneumonia was confirmed by

185
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:50,559
chest x-ray we censored the data

186
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:57,189
whenever a pneumonia was first diagnosed

187
00:09:50,559 --> 00:10:00,189
when AIDS was developed and and when the

188
00:09:57,190 --> 00:10:07,150
subjects reached the end of the study

189
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:11,700
which was the end of the 2013 so at

190
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:14,159
these six monthly visits we also

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:17,709
obtained a lot of information about

192
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:21,429
marijuana use during the interval since

193
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:23,849
the the Wobble first of all about

194
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:26,319
pneumonia but also during the interval

195
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:29,040
prior the six-month interval prior to

196
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:33,480
the development of know as well as

197
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:36,610
baseline information on marijuana on

198
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,769
exposure to other risk factors including

199
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:44,079
tobacco potential risk factors alcohol

200
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:46,059
other recreational drugs and we also

201
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,489
looked at dose response relationships

202
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,609
obtain information on how often the

203
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:53,320
marijuana was used over the previous six

204
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:57,550
months and actually from the beginning

205
00:10:53,320 --> 00:11:00,820
of the study as well and we performed

206
00:10:57,549 --> 00:11:03,939
Cox proportional hazards to estimate the

207
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:08,020
risk for pneumonia either not a

208
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:10,060
community acquired pneumonia or PCP by

209
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,970

215
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:37,979
that's um I think I have the beginnings

216
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:40,889
Alzheimer's but bactrim or septa so

217
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,699
noumic and of course numerous

218
00:11:40,889 --> 00:11:47,409
vaccination against pneumococcal

219
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:49,448

220
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:53,289
smoking of course use of other illicit

221
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:57,429
substances either by smoking or by

222
00:11:53,289 --> 00:12:00,129
injection antiretroviral therapy and in

223
00:11:57,429 --> 00:12:04,000
those who are seedy who were HIV

224
00:12:00,129 --> 00:12:06,519
positive viral load cd4 count and

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:10,659
hepatitis C infection and these were the

226
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:16,110
results so in the motive area analysis

227
00:12:10,659 --> 00:12:18,338
in the persistently HIV negative group

228
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:23,500
there was no association between

229
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:25,600
marijuana use and the development of of

230
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,970
pneumonia community acquired pneumonia

231
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,769
and the positive the control was tobacco

232
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:35,500
and they always do see a significant

233
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:40,328
effect of tobacco on pneumonia risk for

234
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:42,669
the hiv-positive group again marijuana

235
00:12:40,328 --> 00:12:45,359
smoking was not associated with an

236
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:49,179
increased risk for pneumonia

237
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:54,639
whereas tobacco was and of course a low

238
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:57,068
cd4 count that was as well and in with

239
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,308
regard to the risk of Pneumocystis

240
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:02,860
Carini pneumonia in the hiv-positive

241
00:13:00,308 --> 00:13:04,838
group again marijuana smoking was not

242
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:08,639
associated with any increased risk of

243
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,410
pneumonia cd4 counts were a

244
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,589
paradoxically tobacco in this analysis

245
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:16,990
was not we cannot explain this this the

246
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:18,850
finding there may be some residual

247
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,209
confounding that we couldn't adjust for

248
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:26,769
we're not sure when we looked at dose

249
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:29,258
response relationships we failed to find

250
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:33,178
any association between marijuana and

251
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:35,169
the risk of pneumonia whether or not the

252
00:13:33,178 --> 00:13:38,049
irrespective of how frequently than

253
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:41,049
among the marijuana was used monthly

254
00:13:38,049 --> 00:13:44,229
weekly or daily in either the HIV

255
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:46,208
negative or hiv-positive populations for

256
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:48,808
either community acquired pneumonia or

257
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:52,628
for PCP pneumonia

258
00:13:48,808 --> 00:13:54,308
so in summary regular marijuana smoking

259
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:58,389
does increase the risk of chronic

260
00:13:54,308 --> 00:14:00,509
bronchitis it does impair bacterial and

261
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:04,480
fungal killing by alveolar macrophages

262
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:06,999
obtained from marijuana smokers but is

263
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:10,089
does not appear to increase the risk of

264
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:14,170
pneumonia even in individuals immuno

265
00:14:10,089 --> 00:14:16,989
suppressed due to HIV infection and I

266
00:14:14,169 --> 00:14:20,229
these are like to acknowledge actually

267
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:23,528
Josh Quint received his PhD recently in

268
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:25,808
epidemiology from UCLA Roger needles is

269
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:29,198
an epidemiologist used to be the Dean of

270
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:31,389
the School Public Health at UCLA and we

271
00:14:29,198 --> 00:14:34,599
are grateful to the max executive

272
00:14:31,389 --> 00:14:36,459
committee for releasing the the data for

273
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,439
us to analyze although it was rather

274
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:41,109
painful processes took two years to get

275
00:14:38,438 --> 00:14:44,338
a hold of the of the data and I am

276
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:44,339
finished all time

277
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:53,169
[Applause]

278
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,860
and be happy to answer any questions if

279
00:14:53,169 --> 00:15:01,240
I could possibly see you with your hair

280
00:14:55,860 --> 00:15:05,470
I'm on your left Donald yeah over here

281
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:07,899
on your left my left straight ahead okay

282
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:10,778
yeah Ethan Rousseau here

283
00:15:07,899 --> 00:15:14,649
thank you for elegant presentation as

284
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:17,588
usual Donald I wondered whether you

285
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:22,120
examine any patients doing vaporization

286
00:15:17,589 --> 00:15:28,990
in your cohort that's a good question

287
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:32,320
obviously if you vaporize the THC you're

288
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:34,690
not going to expose the lungs to a lot

289
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:38,589
of the particulate material there's

290
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:41,770
within within the smoke my guess is if

291
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:46,440
you studied individuals who vaporized

292
00:15:41,769 --> 00:15:48,909
the THC you might find that there was no

293
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,890
no association with chronic bronchitis

294
00:15:48,909 --> 00:15:53,079
which probably has to do with exposure

295
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:57,069
to the mostly the particulates and

296
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:59,020
possibly some of the the toxic volatile

297
00:15:57,070 --> 00:16:01,870
material within the smoke as well no

298
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:04,329
what we did we did not study vapors

299
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:14,889
nonetheless very helpful thank you thank

300
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:17,920
you okay yes yes so I was interested in

301
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:22,629
the nitric oxide evidence that you have

302
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:27,909
for you know correlations with I guess

303
00:16:22,629 --> 00:16:29,950
macrophage processes so do you see that

304
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:32,860
there's any correlation between the

305
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:35,680
cannabinoid it's signalling off of the

306
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,830
macrophages and suppressing nitric oxide

307
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:42,879
synthase activation so it's not

308
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:44,770
necessarily that nitric oxide is not

309
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:49,990
being able to be expressed it's that you

310
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:51,789
have cannabinoids interacting with your

311
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:55,959
macrophage production since there's some

312
00:16:51,789 --> 00:16:56,469
correlation between those two yes I

313
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,269
think so

314
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:03,670
i cb2 receptors probably exists on

315
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:06,369
macrophages the alveolar macrophages

316
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:09,069
that haven't yet been identified on but

317
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:13,119
they most likely do and so the binding

318
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:15,189
to THC to those receptors then

319
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,289
essentially deactivates the macrophages

320
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,809
impairs their ability to produce

321
00:17:17,289 --> 00:17:23,049
pro-inflammatory cytokines it's the

322
00:17:19,809 --> 00:17:26,289
cytokines that are needed to up regulate

323
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:28,750
it inducible nitric oxide synthase that

324
00:17:26,289 --> 00:17:32,019
then leads to the conversion of arginine

325
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:36,990
within the cell into nitric oxide which

326
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:36,990
is then released thank you one minute

327
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,940
okay I don't see any other hands but

328
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,940
thank you very much
