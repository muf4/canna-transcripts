pasadena california

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,679
just last week we added new presenters

19
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,558
and panels to

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,558
our schedule we also rearranged the

21
00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:59,358
order of some of our presentations and

22
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,679
panels

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,600
so that each of our focus areas gets a

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,359
dedicated time to shine

25
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
on our main stage while you're at

viewed through molecular glasses

87
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,719
which you can view on our canmed archive

cannabis vapor ointment

92
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,000
which explores how the act of heating

93
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:30,399
cannabis oils for vaping

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,400
can alter certain molecules and how that

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,239
information can be applied to testing

96
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,120
regulations

97
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
we discuss what we have learned from the

00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,640
2019

99
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,080
vaping crisis and how those lessons are

100
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:44,479
being applied

101
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,519
what additives pose a threat to vape

102
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:48,000
users

103
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,280
the lasting appeal of vaping products in

104
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,639
terms of convenience

105
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,120
and consistency how inconsistencies and

106
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,598
vaping hardware play a role

107
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
how cannabis vape products differ from

108
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,280

equipment and methods and signs

112
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:09,039

113
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,598
when evaluating the safety and quality

114
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:13,359

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,600
good afternoon jeff thanks for joining

139
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:14,478
us thanks for having me ben

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,720
appreciate the opportunity absolutely

141
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,680
okay so we're talking about

142
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
uh vaping cannabis with you today um

143
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,840
you're going to be doing a presentation

144
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
at canmed2021

145
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:26,719
titled thermal degradation a fly and the

146
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:30,478
cannabis

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,000
vapor ointment um first can you give us

148
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,240
a little bit of a

149
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,199
for for those of us who aren't chemists

150
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,000
in the

151
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,680
in the room here or on the or listening

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,439
on the podcast here what do we mean by

153
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,038
thermal degradation and how does that

154
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,279
apply to vaping cannabis

155
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:47,839
sure that's a great place to start how

156
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,478
do the molecules change upon heating

157
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,038
and degradation usually means breaking

158
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,079
apart

159
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,918
or changing or becoming something other

160
00:05:54,079 --> 00:05:57,758
than what you started with

161
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,240
so degradation i think is usually looked

162
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,919
at in a negative context but it's not

163
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,600
always negative it could be that it

164
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,719
broke down into its starting components

165
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
and there really wasn't that big a

166
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,280
problem with it

167
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,879
so would i be correct in assuming that a

168
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:13,439
simple

169
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:14,079
example of this would be thc a breaking

170
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:16,639
down to

171
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:17,519
thc when it's um when it's heated or

172
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,759
combusted

173
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:21,519
sure the decarboxylation process would

174
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,120
definitely be a you know a thermal

175
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:23,680
change right you heat it up and you

176
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,000
liberate

177
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,959
co2 to you know change the acid to the

178
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,199
neutral compound

179
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:30,239
so and there is a great example of

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,759
degradation

181
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,360
technically not being maybe a

182
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:36,639
deleterious or bad thing

183
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,000
so um good example for sure okay good

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,680
glen i'm on the right track

185
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
all right but let's step back for a

186
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,280
minute here um and i imagine the

187
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,360
inspiration for

188
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,799
doing the the research that you've done

189
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
into looking at

190
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,360
you know how these compounds break down

191
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,038
in vaping has something to do with the

192
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,319
i guess we'll call it the vape crisis of

193
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:57,918
2019 where a great number of people are

194
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,680
getting sick from

195
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:03,918
contaminated vape products so

196
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,720
let's talk a bit about that um what was

197
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,839
the cause

198
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,919
for that do we think and um how has

199
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,119
how have vape products kind of changed

200
00:07:09,918 --> 00:07:13,038
since then

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
sure um i think you know right out of

202
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,240
the gate everyone was questioning what

203
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,319
may have been the cause

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,160
and being you know having the benefit of

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,120
time now i think we're all able to look

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,280
at it and

207
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,879
pretty concretely say we believe it was

208
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:28,000
vitamin e acetate

209
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:30,079
was the culprit in that respects um

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,519
there was some other conjecture that

211
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:32,959
maybe there were heavy metals

212
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
and things of that type that might have

213
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:37,758
caused some of those cases

214
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,038
but um i heard last week in a vape panel

215
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,319
someone commented

216
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:42,399
from the audience they said they were

217
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,479
doing some studies and they've

218
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,799
always done trace metal analysis and

219
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:49,360
they concretely can say that they

220
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,400
don't believe it came from heavy metals

221
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,759
now even though we're going to see

222
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,159
colorado require

223
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,360
you know heavy metal analysis of things

224
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,280
coming up next year

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,560
like i think we're seeing the regulators

226
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,038
react to this

227
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,319
concern and mostly in rightful ways

228
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,000
right i have no problem

229
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,919
studying the metals thinking like let's

230
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,519
really be aware of that that's not a

231
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,878
problem so we don't encourage it or

232
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:10,959
allow it to happen

233
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,000
but i think we can all say we've got a

234
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:14,560
pretty solid handle

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
on it with being vitamin e acetate and

236
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,680
that it broke down

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
upon certain temperatures which are

238
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,560
rather high temperatures and i think

239
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,439
there's an important point to be made

240
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,439
there

241
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:25,038
it broke down into a very reactive

242
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:27,598
molecule called ketene

243
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:29,279
and this molecule then was reacting

244
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,800
rapidly and adversely with the long

245
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:34,158
lining

246
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,560
so it wasn't um anything that had been

247
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:36,399
found

248
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,000
in cannabis this was an additive that

249
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,278
was put into these vape cards

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
predominantly

251
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,838
in markets with no testing um you know

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,679
most likely the illicit markets i think

253
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,560
was the high prevalence of this

254
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:49,120
to give the appearance of a thicker oil

255
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,958
and

256
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,839
when you don't have testing to verify

257
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,399
that that thickness wasn't coming from

258
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,279
thc um

259
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,679
it was a visual representation so they

260
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,080
said

261
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:02,399
like how fast do i see a bubble go from

262
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,399
one side to the other if i flip the vape

263
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:07,278
cart 180 degrees

264
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,399
and that was kind of the visual test you

265
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:11,200
know on

266
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,240
passing along the supply chain without a

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,160
tested label

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,440
so we didn't see this problem in

269
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,159
regulated markets

270
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,240
as nearly as much we didn't see that

271
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,360
because everyone was pushing the potency

272
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
numbers higher and

273
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,440
required testing to put it on the label

274
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,560
you know would tell you hey this was

275
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,160
40 or 50 thc was not 70 or 80 that

276
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,958
everyone was aiming for

277
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:33,278
that visual trickery was what was you

278
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,319
know

279
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:38,080
being at play there and was used vitamin

280
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:41,120
e acetate to get there

281
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,639
and i think you know we the first

282
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,000
assumption was vitamin e

283
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,919
you know everyone kind of familiar with

284
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,519
that one vitamin e acetate

285
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:49,519
generally recognized as safe for

286
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,519
cosmetic and topical use

287
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,560
and i think that there's a big word of

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,320
caution there

289
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:56,399
you know just because it's safe for a

290
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,879
specific type of use does not mean

291
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,200
it's safe in other types of uses so

292
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:03,360
while it's fine to rub it on my skin

293
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,278
it was not fine to put it inside of a

294
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,039
vape device

295
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:08,480
and i'll i'll kind of highlight that

296
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,879
temperature piece you know

297
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
at what temperature does this break down

298
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:15,120
to form

299
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,759
the problematic ketem it's rather high

300
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,399
temperatures

301
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,519
like 500 degrees celsius so it's

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,078
interesting that you

303
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,278
see this and it makes you think it's not

304
00:10:22,078 --> 00:10:25,759
only chemistry

305
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:26,879
and formulation that's at play but also

306
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,559
the hardware device

307
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:30,078
you know how hot does the hardware

308
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:32,239
device get are there

309
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,439
localized hotspots across the heating

310
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,560
element you know

311
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,200
what really do all the molecules feel in

312
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,359
terms of

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,399
temperature or thermal profile from the

314
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,800
devices

315
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,839
and how might we need to regulate both

316
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:45,599
the hardware

317
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,760
componentry and the construction of

318
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,000
those and its performance

319
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,319
in addition to which formulations and

320
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,120
molecules you put in there

321
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,680
okay all right a lot to lots of unpack

322
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,399
there

323
00:10:55,679 --> 00:10:59,039
good question right yeah no it's all

324
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,320
good stuff

325
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,599
so going back to vitamin e acetate um i

326
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,720
think you sort of already answered this

327
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,639
but i'll ask again

328
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,920
so was it known that that would be

329
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,319
potentially harmful

330
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,039
kind of before this event if it were in

331
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
a vape

332
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,719
uh product or was this sort of an

333
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,639
enlightening event that

334
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
kind of revealed that i don't think it

335
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:19,759
was known and i don't think it was even

336
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,000
suspected

337
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:23,360
um so it kind of was you know alarming

338
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,320
and enlightening in the same

339
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,278
uh regard like wow that can happen and

340
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,440
why did it happen

341
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:30,399
in this case and i know there were some

342
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,560
others saying but

343
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,639
wait we think we've been using vitamin e

344
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:36,399
acetate for a while in this respects and

345
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,039
we haven't seen the problem

346
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,759
and i think that then ties to you know

347
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:41,519
how one

348
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,679
we don't know how prevalent it was being

349
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,480
used but we believe it was you know

350
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:48,559
rather prevalent and then two did every

351
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,480
single user that was experiencing that

352
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:52,479
have the problem or was it related to

353
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,480
the hardware that was actually

354
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,560
you know getting really really hot was

355
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:59,120
it a certain hardware and combination of

356
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:02,000
vitamin acetate that caused that problem

357
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,519
i think that question still remains um

358
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,320
but you know i think there's good reason

359
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,120
to suspect

360
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
it was related to specific hardware with

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,320
the use of that

362
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,320
so i think others would say they had

363
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
been using it and didn't see the problem

364
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,278
or it was unbeknownst to them right

365
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,799
maybe it was still happening but it

366
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,639
wasn't reported it wasn't tracked it

367
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:21,599
wasn't in the news and you just never

368
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,000
linked it to that case um so i think

369
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,399
it's

370
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
difficult to always know like you know

371
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,440
what was the

372
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,600
the problematic component there how

373
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,839
might we suspect that this is coming

374
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,200
but it is important that we now know it

375
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
that we apply that to

376
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,360
other things that are coming and i

377
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:40,320
wanted to be sure to try and highlight

378
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,959
the rise of the acetates so vitamin e

379
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,519
acetate is a phenolic acetate

380
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,958
and other acetates that may be present

381
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,360
might impart flavor

382
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:50,239
and other pieces they're known to

383
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,560
cannabis

384
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,360
not every acetate will have this same

385
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,159
fate

386
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,919
but the phenolic acetates will be able

387
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:59,838
to break down at this temperature to

388
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,159
cause ketene you need the phenol

389
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
group to kind of support the chemistry

390
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:08,399
of how that transformation happens

391
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:09,439
thc acetate you know delta 9 delta 8 thc

392
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,320
acetates

393
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,320
um those products are starting to you

394
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,360
know and even cbd acetate could do the

395
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,278
same type of thing

396
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
because those are phenolic structures in

397
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:21,679
the core components of the cannabinoid

398
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:23,599
that would be acetylated as well and you

399
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,159
might see the same chemistry going on

400
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,000
with that

401
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,719
so we've i've started to see in the last

402
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,399
few weeks you know delta 9 thc acetate

403
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,160
becoming more popular

404
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,559
and i'm really concerned that we might

405
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:36,240
see valley types of results for

406
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:38,078
the use of some of those products as

407
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,079
well and i think

408
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:41,198
in general we should say look let's err

409
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,759
on the side of caution

410
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:45,919
these thc acetates weren't produced by

411
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:47,600
the plant they're not found in the plant

412
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,360
that probably is a great line of

413
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,360
demarcation to say let's

414
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,120
stay away from those molecules until

415
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,480
they're formally studied

416
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,440
and they're really looked at and

417
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
understood from a toxicology perspective

418
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,480
to say

419
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,320
should we have those in these devices or

420
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,240
be able to use it in a dab or anything

421
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,800
else of that type

422
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,440
that class of compounds it's it's kind

423
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:09,919
of like

424
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,240
what we know from cigarette world and

425
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:15,838
other worker exposures of

426
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,159
diketones the diacetyl compound is known

427
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,560
to impart a buttery creamy flavor

428
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,559
but it's also known to provide popcorn

429
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:24,879
lung to those that are over exposed to

430
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,799
it so this was a very popular flavoring

431
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,958
over half the components in the nicotine

432
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:31,278
space in 2016

433
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,958
had this compound but it's now been a

434
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:34,720
banned class of molecules you're like

435
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,078
you don't want those things because they

436
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,000
may form

437
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,759
this type of problem and i think we need

438
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,919
to think of phenolic acetates

439
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,198
in the same way because we saw this with

440
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:45,759
vitamin e acetate

441
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:46,719
we don't want delta 9 or delta 8 or cbd

442
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,439
acetates

443
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
to be used in inhalation without fuller

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,880
like more fully

445
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,519
formal studies on them to really be sure

446
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,799
how to best use them that way

447
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,198
okay so what would be the benefit of

448
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,240
using an acetate form of the compound

449
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:04,240
rather than

450
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,000
a non-acetate form like as a as a

451
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,360
manufacturer as a consumer is there a

452
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,958
benefit to that

453
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,560
i don't think there's a significant

454
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:12,319
benefit in this regard so

455
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:14,479
some sometimes you see these they're

456
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,399
called pro drugs so that you know maybe

457
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,240
their absorptivity is a little better

458
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,278
they get more into different places in

459
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,198
the body than you

460
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:23,120
you know may be able to live them

461
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:24,000
deliberate orally whereas before you

462
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,959
weren't having that

463
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,159
actually be absorbed um you see pro-drug

464
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,399
formulations and stuff

465
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,519
in the pharmaceutical space all the time

466
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,600
it also opens

467
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,120
up patentability um you know it's

468
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,120
another molecule so i might have a

469
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,799
reason to kind of go down that path

470
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,879
in this case i think they're looking at

471
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,479
it more from a regulatory perspective

472
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,679
like hey it's a different molecule

473
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,240
that's not

474
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:48,159
um maybe outlawed or banned if it's not

475
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,759
delta eight if i made it in acetate is

476
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,120
that something that the legal language

477
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,440
hasn't caught up with

478
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,480
but physiologically speaking you know

479
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
there's not

480
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,159
perhaps a great deal of advantage to

481
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,120
using that it's typically

482
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:03,360
meant from formulation and absorptivity

483
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,039
we know we get thc in us pretty well

484
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,959
right we i don't see the advantage there

485
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,639
we've formulated it in tons of products

486
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,479
that doesn't seem to be a big you know

487
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,560
advantage in that respects

488
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,519
i think some of the manufacturers are

489
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:15,119
trying to

490
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,639
amplify a message saying the

491
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,639
physiological effects

492
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,720
are bigger and better but i'm not

493
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,079
hearing anyone substantiating that so i

494
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,199
don't know if that's more marketing

495
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,039
speak to say

496
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,319
hey you know like hey come buy this and

497
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:27,838
try it but

498
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,600
you know i think we should err on the

499
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,720
side of caution and say well someone

500
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,480
clinically study that

501
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,399
show me blood data that proves that this

502
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:36,480
would give me those responses

503
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,559
and maybe the form that it's best in is

504
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,240
an oral dosed form and it might be very

505
00:16:38,559 --> 00:16:42,479
helpful in that respects

506
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
but it it doesn't have the ability to be

507
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,399
made manufactured cheaper

508
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
and it's you know gonna definitely not

509
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,519
be as cost effective

510
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:53,360
and physiologically i'm struggling to

511
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,360
find why that would be advantageous

512
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,199
so you mentioned earlier that some of

513
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,000
the regulations are changing

514
00:16:57,198 --> 00:17:01,679
around testing vape products where do

515
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,320
those stand now and where do you kind of

516
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,119
see that

517
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,880
they might be going so colorado took a

518
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,399
good lead in saying let's understand the

519
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,120
heavy metals that are coming out of the

520
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,079
device

521
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,239
um other some states require like end

522
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:16,078
product testing so you'll say

523
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,318
you know one state would say test the

524
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:20,558
oil before you put it in the vape device

525
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:22,000
others will say hey test the oil once

526
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,759
it's been in the vape device and

527
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,679
packaged and we'll take that

528
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,439
that might be able to catch a little bit

529
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,480
more of the leaching but it's not the

530
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:33,519
same as when you're using it of course

531
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,679
we see more and more states saying let's

532
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,440
see what components are going into these

533
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,120
inhalable formulations

534
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,360
they're not necessarily requiring

535
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:42,959
testing for that other than

536
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,558
test for the presence of vitamin e

537
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,960
acetate and assure me there's none

538
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:49,440
in there and some are starting to add

539
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,640
like squalane squalene and a few other

540
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,679
components to that list

541
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,960
so colorado again it said no mct

542
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:59,200
no peg in pg and no

543
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,200
vitamin acetate and some states are

544
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:03,200
saying you know you might have to test

545
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,319
to prove that vitamin e acetate is not

546
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,640
present

547
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,599
but we're not seeing a tremendous amount

548
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,160
of

549
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:11,199
you know outlawing or requiring a lot of

550
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
testing for

551
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,240
different molecules in vape devices but

552
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,159
we are seeing regulators starting to say

553
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,079
okay what are we putting in there

554
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,679
disclose to me your formulation

555
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:23,119
all the ingredients how much of these

556
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,600
things you're using

557
00:18:23,119 --> 00:18:26,479
um and then let us know and some states

558
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,480
are also saying

559
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,960
put this list of molecules in the

560
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,839
package for the consumers to have access

561
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,640
to

562
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,359
um which i i think is is nice and

563
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,440
interesting

564
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:38,959
but some of these you know big chemistry

565
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,038
words people just give me like

566
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,240
whatever you know i think it's kind of

567
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:43,839
like a package insert on your

568
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,599
pharmaceutical product i don't know how

569
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,199
many folks read all of those

570
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:49,119
if you have trouble sleeping it might be

571
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,919
good to start reading some of that stuff

572
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,199
it can be very technical very you know

573
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
it's very informative

574
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,038
but only to someone that may be trained

575
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,279
in a lot of those technical words

576
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,038
um and if you cherry pick you know like

577
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:02,480
one molecule and say hey look i found

578
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,240
this one in here

579
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,640
it's not just the molecule but the

580
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,120
concentration and exactly how much would

581
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,840
be

582
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:11,759
you know introduced to the individual

583
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,678
during normal course of use

584
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,200
i think that's another interesting

585
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,200
challenge with cannabis you might have

586
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:18,960
someone that takes one or two puffs of

587
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,160
their vape device a day

588
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,160
all the way to the other extreme where

589
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,000
someone consumed an entire gram

590
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,279
um you know the entire cartridge in a

591
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,599
day so

592
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,359
what's the exposure limits and use

593
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,558
regimes that we have with that

594
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:32,558
much like we want to say we want to put

595
00:19:30,558 --> 00:19:34,639
a ceiling on the temperature so that

596
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:35,678
we know these devices aren't going over

597
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,440
the temperature

598
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
should we guide users to say like hey

599
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,080
we've kind of looked at like normal use

600
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,919
would be

601
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,000
you know this range if you're going over

602
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,880
that you might see other problems we're

603
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,798
not aware of

604
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,240
and how do we then start to track those

605
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,359
types of things too

606
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,839
but this is a enormously complex

607
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:56,240
and multifaceted problem from you know

608
00:19:53,839 --> 00:19:58,720
hardware to formulation to toxicology

609
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,720
to what chemistry changes are happening

610
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,480
in these types of things so it's it's

611
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,000
going to be a little while till i think

612
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
we start to get a better handle on some

613
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,720
of it

614
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:09,038
yeah i mean i was going to ask you about

615
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,679
that specifically the hardware

616
00:20:09,038 --> 00:20:14,000
um i have to imagine that the different

617
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,240
heating elements in different ways

618
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,240
in different products could you know

619
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,759
really be a variable that'd be hard to

620
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,319
control for

621
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:23,038
exceptionally so and even some uses

622
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:25,759
right if you

623
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,759
you know see the the wick that that is

624
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:29,599
no longer really present anymore but if

625
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:30,960
it wasn't wetted and it was dry

626
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:32,798
like that could be all of a sudden

627
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,159
getting much hotter before the oil melts

628
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:36,240
onto those things

629
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:37,440
some of the heating platforms might have

630
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,679
the same effect

631
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,679
so what's the material of construction

632
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,960
of those are they ceramic is it touching

633
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,159
any other metals

634
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:47,200
um what else may be in or not in the

635
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,760
glass

636
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,400
chamber is it even a glass chamber um

637
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:52,879
there are

638
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,519
a lot of components that are wetted or

639
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,440
in touch

640
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,720
with the the oil and the formulation in

641
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,120
a vape device

642
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,038
so it becomes you know a lot more

643
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:02,558
challenging in that respects now

644
00:21:01,038 --> 00:21:04,319
they're not all at the same temperature

645
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:05,599
right the outside of the chamber is very

646
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:06,240
different than what's on the heating

647
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,519
element

648
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,359
which is very different than what's on

649
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:11,599
the very tip that's at actually at my

650
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,119
mouth and my airway

651
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:14,879
and i think trying to get a better

652
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,119
handle on that is really a difficult

653
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,640
challenge in its own right too

654
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,239
yeah do you foresee that there might be

655
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,880
some standards that

656
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:25,038
need to be uh put in place for for the

657
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,039
hardware so that it is more consistent

658
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,558
i think so i mean i i think that might

659
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:29,038
be one of the things coming down the

660
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:30,720
path

661
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:32,558
we we're going to learn a little more

662
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,960
about hardware and some of these things

663
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:36,079
from the fda and the tobacco space right

664
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,519
as they're all now going about

665
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,720
registering these things i think we'll

666
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:41,679
start to say

667
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,120
okay like these types of hardware were

668
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,559
able to get through the gauntlet

669
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,639
and are acceptable with these

670
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,440
formulations and that

671
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,840
might cause like a de facto

672
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,120
manufacturing

673
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,959
standard because they're going to want

674
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:54,879
to make much the same components or same

675
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,240
devices so you say look if these are the

676
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
ones getting through

677
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,240
then i'll start applying you know my

678
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,079
manufacturing effort elsewhere i've got

679
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,200
economies to scale and now i can offer

680
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:05,439
it cheaper

681
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,880
um there are differences though from

682
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,960
when you're looking at in the nicotine

683
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:10,159
space versus the cannabinoid space you

684
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,480
know cannabis

685
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,480
is more oily it has different components

686
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
in there it needs different temperatures

687
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,360
to vaporize the mixtures

688
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:22,000
so we'll learn some but not everything

689
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:24,240
but there are groups you know like astm

690
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,440
and some other groups that are trying to

691
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,679
be forward-looking and

692
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,279
start to establish some standards for

693
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,840
formulations and componentry of the

694
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,240
hardware

695
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,918
so i think it won't be too long until we

696
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,720
get at least a starting point in that

697
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,480
respect

698
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,240
um and then hopefully we can have many

699
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,159
labs starting to study those

700
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,359
to say hey look here's what we're seeing

701
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,280
across the board on

702
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,038
four or five different hardware devices

703
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,490
not just the one that i i picked for

704
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:47,440
myself

705
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:48,960
[Music]

706
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,880
yeah so i was wondering if you could you

707
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
could talk a bit about the research that

708
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,159
you've done

709
00:22:51,599 --> 00:22:55,119
um what did those experiments look like

710
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,120
what were some of the

711
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:01,038
results you found so we started from

712
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:03,599
looking at you know just the terpene

713
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:07,359
formulation and what might be

714
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:09,678
uh problematic in its analysis so it's

715
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:11,599
it's really easy to say hey look here's

716
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,360
this terpene formulation

717
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:15,279
and i know there's nothing in there

718
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,599
that's not supposed to be but why is it

719
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:19,759
failing for a residual solvent

720
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:21,519
and it was much harder to actually go

721
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:23,599
about trying to understand

722
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:25,918
where that might be forming when it was

723
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,918
present to eliminate all the potential

724
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,679
sources of external contamination from

725
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,919
the lab

726
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,280
and to really start to find out that it

727
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,159
is caused by

728
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:37,759
temperature in the presence of air so

729
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,000
when you start to understand

730
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:41,599
you know oxygen is the enemy of

731
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,679
degradation it is actually the one that

732
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,158
catalyzes a lot of these problems

733
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,240
we see oxidative degrading they can then

734
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,360
form allergens they can form other

735
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,278
products

736
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:53,278
well if i start to form a residual

737
00:23:51,278 --> 00:23:54,480
solvent and i'm failing a residual

738
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:57,119
solvent test

739
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,360
then the products can't go to market you

740
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:01,359
can see it to a greater extent with the

741
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,959
neat terpene formulation so you can

742
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,119
start to understand

743
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,000
okay when i have only these ingredients

744
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,759
in this mixture

745
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,319
and i put it inside the headspace

746
00:24:07,759 --> 00:24:12,720
analysis what am i starting to detect

747
00:24:10,319 --> 00:24:14,158
why am i detecting more than just these

748
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,360
components

749
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,039
it starts to make you think well at

750
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:18,798
certain temperatures i see this and i

751
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,679
can accelerate that if i raise the

752
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:22,000
temperature

753
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,880
and what else might be showing up in

754
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,440
that regard

755
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,400
is generated predominantly by oxygen in

756
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,038
that case

757
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
so in these studies you know air was the

758
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:30,960
enemy

759
00:24:29,599 --> 00:24:32,879
and you probably have a little bit of

760
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,519
air in your vape device too but we

761
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,679
didn't have

762
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:37,278
any external metals or any other like

763
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,759
hardware components that might be

764
00:24:37,278 --> 00:24:42,558
present inside of the vape device either

765
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,079
so the molecules weren't sitting on you

766
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,278
know this wetted surface that was

767
00:24:44,079 --> 00:24:47,759
hitting that temperature

768
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,038
with this metal catalyst perhaps and in

769
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,400
the presence of air

770
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,879
it really was just the molecules

771
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,960
themselves in air in a glass vial

772
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,960
um and you could still see some break

773
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,120
down into a couple of the residual

774
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,640
solvent components that that might

775
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:02,239
like make you wonder why they're there

776
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,720
they're not at alarming levels

777
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,480
and this is a neat formulation so these

778
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,600
things are always used in 10

779
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,960
or less in the vape devices so we're not

780
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,359
even sure if you'll see them

781
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:15,120
outside of the vape device while they

782
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:16,719
may be there they may not be detectable

783
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:17,678
depending upon the actual limits that

784
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,558
are in there

785
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,360
um so it raised the concern of like what

786
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:23,119
temperatures

787
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,558
under what conditions do you start to

788
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:26,798
see these things

789
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,720
um and really i think you start to see

790
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:30,720
them as you raise the temperature and

791
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,400
definitely in the presence of oxygen

792
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,400
then it raises the question of well what

793
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,600
else might accelerate those types of

794
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,759
um those degradation pathways so

795
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:40,639
would the hardware component do it or do

796
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:42,879
i see something

797
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,360
otherwise because of the hardware

798
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,960
component tree as well

799
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:48,798
so am i understanding this correctly

800
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,759
that the actual

801
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:52,798
terpenes or cannabinoids in the oil are

802
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,319
breaking down

803
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,798
to resemble residual solvents or

804
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,240
are the residual solvents in some cases

805
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:01,918
no like they are definitely

806
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,278
solvent free when you get them and when

807
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,440
you test them the right way you can say

808
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:07,278
like i'm seeing none of these but if you

809
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
you know put it in the presence of

810
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,278
oxygen and heat it up too much

811
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,278
you can start to see one of the residual

812
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,159
solvents predominantly acetone

813
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:17,839
um so it's not a significant concern and

814
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,600
certainly at super low levels so from a

815
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,000
toxicology perspective

816
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:24,158
it's not alarming but from a perhaps

817
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,960
regulatory perspective of like oh great

818
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,200
are people going to

819
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
fail their regulatory checks once it's

820
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,319
in the final packaging

821
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,000
and then why would they fail it who

822
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,918
would they be blaming you know who's

823
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,159
responsible for those things

824
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:38,240
are the limits for the regulatory line

825
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,600
set at an appropriate level and or does

826
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,759
this just need to kind of

827
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,359
help educate labs into setting them up

828
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,158
in different fashions so they run the

829
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,558
test without

830
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:48,240
generating that problem so this is much

831
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,558
an analytical problem

832
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,278
um probably more so of that that what

833
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:56,000
we've kind of worked through than it was

834
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,759
um worrying about a toxicology problem

835
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,679
but it does start to make you think

836
00:26:57,759 --> 00:27:01,679
about these degradation pathways and

837
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,960
what else might you start to see

838
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,038
especially when you couple it with

839
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,798
vitamin e acetate and you start to know

840
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:07,679
that there are you know deleterious

841
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,119
degradations

842
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,038
of some of the molecules interesting

843
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:14,239
and i'll just like like maybe i'll throw

844
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,960
it out there to everyone else

845
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:19,038
when you combust cannabis right we know

846
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
how much thc you have on the flower

847
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:22,000
material

848
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,480
but our study that we had done i think

849
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,359
it's 2015 like we can only find

850
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
40 plus percent of the actual thc

851
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,038
molecule

852
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:31,599
so looking everywhere at the smokestream

853
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:33,839
the

854
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:35,918
side streams inside the rest of the

855
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,720
combusted plant material that was there

856
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:40,320
like capture everything possible i don't

857
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,798
know where the rest of it went

858
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,398
right it didn't all become cbn it breaks

859
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:47,119
down into many different things

860
00:27:44,398 --> 00:27:48,398
so if you look at combustion analysis of

861
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,798
plant material

862
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,798
you see some of these same um you know

863
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:54,798
residual solvent pieces like acetone

864
00:27:52,798 --> 00:27:56,480
that's known to form just from the plant

865
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,000
materials because these components will

866
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,440
break down like that

867
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,599
but when you look at a combustion

868
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,080
analysis you see many many many many

869
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,000
more

870
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:06,000
molecules that actually form the

871
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,839
question is what's their concentration

872
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,599
and with cannabis or the good molecules

873
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:10,798
greatly overwhelming any potential

874
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:12,480
concerns

875
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,319
i think we've known people to be

876
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,159
combusting cannabis for long periods of

877
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:18,960
time and we don't see deleterious

878
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,840
toxicological outcomes from that so the

879
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,319
molecules

880
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:24,319
present in cannabis are not nearly as

881
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,439
much of a concern even at combustion

882
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:27,599
temperatures

883
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,278
as something that's a brand new additive

884
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:31,839
like vitamin e acetate

885
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,359
so i think you know that's where you got

886
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,199
to start to say like we're never going

887
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,079
to know this problem tomorrow like we're

888
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,240
not going to have all the answers

889
00:28:36,079 --> 00:28:40,960
tomorrow it's so big and complex

890
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,720
how do we step safely today with some

891
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,319
sort of sense of comfort especially if

892
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,480
i'm a regulator that's tasked with

893
00:28:44,319 --> 00:28:48,398
protecting public health and safety

894
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,558
and even a responsible you know provider

895
00:28:48,398 --> 00:28:52,479
of brands how do we do this

896
00:28:50,558 --> 00:28:54,158
we think that it's best if you stick to

897
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,000
what we know in the plant already

898
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,278
so if those things are modeled after the

899
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,558
plant that they

900
00:28:57,278 --> 00:29:00,240
you know are closest to those

901
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:02,480
formulations they're in similar

902
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,558
concentrations and ratios

903
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,839
then you have a little bit more you know

904
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,519
comfort level with a from a

905
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:09,599
toxicological perspective

906
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:11,440
to say well people have been combusting

907
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,439
these molecules for a long time

908
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,360
and we haven't seen them you know really

909
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,919
with like alarming outcomes

910
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,000
so unless there's something uniquely

911
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,440
being catalyzed or the temperature is

912
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,119
way higher than we think in some of

913
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,278
these vape devices

914
00:29:23,119 --> 00:29:26,398
we're probably going to be you know in a

915
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,839
decent realm

916
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,918
at least one that we can be comfortable

917
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:31,199
enough with today while we embark on the

918
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,360
further study

919
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,120
and you know how long have people been

920
00:29:33,359 --> 00:29:38,639
using cannabis vape devices

921
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:40,079
is another key thing to think of 2013-14

922
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,960
i mean it's not like they just showed up

923
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:43,278
last week and we're

924
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,558
really having these problems so there's

925
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:46,880
been a lot of use

926
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:48,720
so far that we haven't seen you know a

927
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,200
valley in every single scenario

928
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,960
so it does inform us that hey we're

929
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,798
probably in a pretty comfortable realm

930
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,640
we're probably okay when we stick to the

931
00:29:54,798 --> 00:29:58,558
molecules that are in cannabis

932
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,640
but we should be very careful if we

933
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:01,759
choose to step outside of what's there

934
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,360
because we don't have a body of

935
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,480
knowledge with that and we might see the

936
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:06,158
unexpected

937
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,120
and that can be catastrophic like we

938
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:11,840
learned in 2019

939
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,479
yeah and that's a great point and the

940
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,000
fact that

941
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,839
you know these products have been around

942
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,119
for a number of years and

943
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:19,278
it doesn't seem like they're going to go

944
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:20,639
anywhere either because there's a lot of

945
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,440
advantages to their

946
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:25,200
to their appeal right in terms of the

947
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,880
convenience of being discreet

948
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,880
and you know just being something that

949
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:31,360
people can enjoy

950
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,399
um and even consistency and

951
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:34,959
standardization

952
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:36,079
right so if i can make that formulation

953
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,480
consistent

954
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,480
if i can have a solid hardware component

955
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,319
tree that's made the same every time

956
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,319
then i can give a patient something that

957
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,079
they know they can you know i get my

958
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,879
response that's required off two or

959
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:48,480
three puffs

960
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,240
depending on the day and what else might

961
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,720
be going on it's maybe it's not every

962
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,000
single one but i get a rapid response

963
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,159
you know i can really use that to

964
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,200
titrate myself and i can look at it

965
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:01,840
more like a medical delivery platform

966
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,440
than you know highly variable plants or

967
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:04,319
something that somebody keeps calling

968
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,840
the same name

969
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:07,439
and i you know every time i get a

970
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,798
different blue dream experience with

971
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,200
somebody please

972
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:13,200
stop doing that to me you know i think

973
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,200
cannabis patients really

974
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,038
struggle to find something that works

975
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,120
but if you can make it consistently and

976
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:21,119
then they find that it works for them

977
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,879
then that's fantastic there's nothing

978
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:24,319
more cruel to me of saying here this

979
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,278
worked once but i'm never going to give

980
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,678
it to you again

981
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,640
even though i'll label it the same so i

982
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,640
think they you know

983
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,240
they shouldn't go away they represent a

984
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:35,120
really like strong

985
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,359
position for standardization and for

986
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,119
real

987
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,719
you know all the other beneficial uses

988
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,639
that you said but in addition

989
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,319
patients can greatly benefit from the

990
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,559
use of these devices

991
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:46,000
when made well um and i think that's

992
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,720
what we really need to strive for

993
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,839
and set those standards accordingly yeah

994
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,200
that's a great point

995
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:54,798
um and i think that your your call to

996
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,000
kind of stick to

997
00:31:54,798 --> 00:32:01,200
the components of the plant and not

998
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,558
not be adding additives to it and kind

999
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,000
of introducing

1000
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,158
these different variables makes a lot of

1001
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,359
sense but what about you know adding

1002
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,360
in additional terpenes to kind of create

1003
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:14,558
a different profile a different flavor

1004
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:16,079
are there concerns with doing that or

1005
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,599
you know is there certain limits that

1006
00:32:16,079 --> 00:32:19,199
should be placed on you know the

1007
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,119
concentrations of those

1008
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,720
terpenes a huge word to a chemist like

1009
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,759
myself right there's like tens of

1010
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,480
thousands of those

1011
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:28,079
unknown on the planet um we know maybe

1012
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,640
150 of them

1013
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:32,319
inside of cannabis so again if they're

1014
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,240
found in cannabis we've seen some of

1015
00:32:32,319 --> 00:32:36,798
their uses we understand what their

1016
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:38,960
concentrations are in that um and we

1017
00:32:36,798 --> 00:32:41,599
stick within that relative ballpark

1018
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,880
i feel pretty good about that but taxol

1019
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,639
is a terpene

1020
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,559
and you know that's cytotoxic right it's

1021
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,159
a great anti-cancer agent but i wouldn't

1022
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:49,278
want anyone trying to put that in a vape

1023
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,640
device because they thought it was

1024
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,679
another terpene

1025
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,200
so you know that word is very broad to

1026
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:57,038
chemists and maybe to others that are

1027
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,960
looking there now if i'm

1028
00:32:57,038 --> 00:33:00,960
playing with you know botanical terpenes

1029
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,440
or sourced differently

1030
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,440
um molecules a molecule as long as that

1031
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,640
is that molecule it's the right one at

1032
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,798
the right purities

1033
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,080
then i have no concerns with that as

1034
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:12,879
long as again it's at the right

1035
00:33:10,079 --> 00:33:14,079
concentration so too much like high

1036
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,320
terpene extracts

1037
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:17,759
may even be kind of problematic because

1038
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:19,519
too much of those things

1039
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:21,359
the plant makes them to kind of keep

1040
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:23,200
things away like it might become an

1041
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,719
irritant to some folks it could irritate

1042
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,880
the airways

1043
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,558
again oxidative pathways for degradation

1044
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:30,960
of those might cause some of them to be

1045
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:33,440
allergens or really irritating

1046
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
so there's a fine balance and a realm

1047
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,679
there too

1048
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,599
we might find that there's some that we

1049
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,640
want to remove as opposed to

1050
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:43,359
putting in there so having the ability

1051
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,038
to kind of tailor which ones you use

1052
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:47,199
might be very very advantageous

1053
00:33:45,038 --> 00:33:49,599
especially to certain populations

1054
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,519
but you know terpenes from cannabis or

1055
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:53,519
found in cannabis from other sources

1056
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,159
even i i feel pretty comfortable with

1057
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,599
that

1058
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,679
but if you start to grab like you know

1059
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:59,038
some unbeknownst terpene from somewhere

1060
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,159
else because you think it drives a

1061
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:01,919
unique effect

1062
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,760
well then we might have other problems

1063
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:07,278
especially if it was something that was

1064
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:09,519
never heated and inhaled before

1065
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,800
excellent all right winding down here i

1066
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,800
was wondering

1067
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,919
is there anything consumers can look for

1068
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,800
in products

1069
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,519
that can kind of help them determine um

1070
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,919
safety

1071
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,878
quality or anything like that so they

1072
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,398
can maybe

1073
00:34:20,878 --> 00:34:24,639
kind of avoid some of these pitfalls

1074
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:26,398
until we kind of really figure out what

1075
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,919
the regulations or what the standards

1076
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,759
should be

1077
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:31,759
it's probably going to be different in

1078
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,159
different states you know some states

1079
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,000
will

1080
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,679
already have been putting rules in place

1081
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,519
but i think we'll see more of them catch

1082
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,720
up and evolve their rules to do so too

1083
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:40,559
like say

1084
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,878
what's in the product you know are these

1085
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:44,878
components found in cannabis or not

1086
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:47,440
what might their concentrations be which

1087
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:50,078
i can infer from the thc concentration

1088
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,000
or the cbd concentration of the product

1089
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,679
um what does my brand or producer

1090
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,358
tell me about their quality how

1091
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,440
transparent are they

1092
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,400
what are they trying to demonstrate to

1093
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,320
me

1094
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,119
you know what do i see on the label of

1095
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,400
the packaging like those types of things

1096
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,320
you kind of got to look at it

1097
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,079
holistically like each part of it is

1098
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,320
going to be a little bit of a clue

1099
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,839
but i think that along with standardized

1100
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,079
or consistent products

1101
00:35:13,838 --> 00:35:17,599
being generated if i can consistently

1102
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,359
output the same thing

1103
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:21,599
i'm probably watching my quality very

1104
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:23,759
consistently to make sure i'm doing that

1105
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,440
and i'm probably more minded towards

1106
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,800
being careful of what i'm putting in the

1107
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,358
products

1108
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,039
so i think you know ask the brands ask

1109
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:32,639
the producers ask those that are

1110
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,159
providing the products and see what kind

1111
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:36,319
of answers you get

1112
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:37,920
um you know it might not always be on

1113
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,400
the label or in the package

1114
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,720
but most of them are pretty engaged with

1115
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,639
consumers especially via social media so

1116
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,078
you can kind of see hey they're trying

1117
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:48,559
to tell me the right things

1118
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:49,920
you know do i really know well if i'm

1119
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,679
going to use this product for the next

1120
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,039
five years maybe it's worth me sending

1121
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:55,440
one to the lab and paying a couple

1122
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,440
hundred bucks to go find out myself

1123
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:59,679
every lab that i know of will be happy

1124
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,760
to to work with an individual

1125
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:03,039
at pretty reasonable prices to say like

1126
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,640
yeah if you want to

1127
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:06,960
check your consistency or you want to

1128
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,639
know that this one's fine

1129
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,240
most all of them will do that too so

1130
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:11,920
that's a little bit more extreme and a

1131
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,279
little more costly because i know even

1132
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,079
the products can be expensive for

1133
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,760
patients

1134
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,440
but you could go to that extreme if you

1135
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,320
wanted to

1136
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:22,320
excellent all right before i let you go

1137
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:25,760
i wanted to give you a chance to

1138
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:28,559
plug any social media websites any

1139
