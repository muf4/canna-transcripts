00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,718
currently investigates natural products

40
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,599
that are produced by plants and microbes

41
00:01:54,718 --> 00:02:00,919
and their use as medicines and as

42
00:01:57,599 --> 00:02:03,798
biopesticides at C 24 she will present

43
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:06,000
hemp processing byproducts as

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,920
biopesticides which describes her team's

45
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,479
work using tpine Rich Industrial Hemp

46
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:16,598
byproducts to control plant diseases and

47
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:19,238
pests we discuss why tpin are effective

48
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:23,039
biopesticides which pathogens imp pest

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,360
tpine Rich biopesticides can fight what

50
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:28,199
are nanoions and why are they important

51
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,640
to this application how this technology

52
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:33,560
can open up a new Revenue stream for

53
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,199
Growers the regulatory lift for getting

54
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,479
biopesticides approved and more before

55
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:42,039
we get to my conversation with Kim I'd

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,080
good morning Kim thanks so much for

74
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:41,958
joining us on the podcast good morning

75
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,280
it is delightful to be here all right I

76
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:46,158
am excited to talk with you today about

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,719
a novel technology that you and your

78
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:50,318
team have developed to use hemp derived

79
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:52,280
tpin as

80
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:54,598
biopesticides of course you will be

81
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,719
presenting this work at camed 24 this

82
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:58,919
may in Marco Island um but I think a

83
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:01,239
good place to start with this

84
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:03,919
conversation would be for you to explain

85
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:06,840
how your team came up with this idea and

86
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,958
why you started investigating it uh I

87
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,400
have been very interested in uh

88
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,039
biopesticides for a number of years I

89
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,600
think that they are uh a good way for we

90
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:17,918
that we can do be more environmentally

91
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:20,439
uh friendly in

92
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,240
agriculture um one of the problems with

93
00:04:20,439 --> 00:04:26,079
biopesticides is where do we get our

94
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:29,120
materials and so I have been looking in

95
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,758
several different areas for agricultural

96
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,478
byproducts

97
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:37,840
and those byproducts uh can bring more

98
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,439
uh Revenue to Growers so that that was

99
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:45,959
kind of my uh take on it my colleague Dr

100
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:48,680
Tony Wong is a food scientist and she's

101
00:04:45,959 --> 00:04:51,239
uh been very involved in developing

102
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,879
these Nano emulsions uh for different

103
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,280
reasons and so we've teamed together to

104
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,680
develop this

105
00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:02,079
biopesticide excellent so what kind of

106
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:04,160
LED you down the path of using tpin from

107
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,079
uh as the hemp

108
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,199
byproducts yeah Tarpin are great tpin

109
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,000
are like one of these things that we can

110
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,600
use for a number of different things you

111
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,680
think about Tarpin you think about their

112
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,800
smell right they're volatile so they can

113
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,079
be used to prevent things from happening

114
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,840
like an insect Landing they can also be

115
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:26,318
used to encourage an insect to land so

116
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:30,000
you've got to be very careful uh they uh

117
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,759
will also affect how a fungus can grow

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,319
so uh and they are they are part of the

119
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:39,400
plant's natural defense system so what

120
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:41,400
we are doing is taking the H the hemp

121
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:45,198
we're we're not we're just using hemp in

122
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:48,839
this in this work uh we take the hemp

123
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:51,560
and we use its natural defense chemicals

124
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:53,758
and we use those turn those around and

125
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,360
bottle them and turn them into an

126
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,759
emotion and then uh use them as

127
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,840
biopesticide so when you talk about you

128
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:05,759
know byproducts so is this hemp being

129
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:08,000
grown particularly for CBD or

130
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,759
cannabinoids and then so you're sort of

131
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,759
using the the castoff tpes to to create

132
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:15,759
this biopesticide correct correct we are

133
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,199
we are only looking at what is coming

134
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,240
from the CBD uh because that is where a

135
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,759
lot of thines are being uh discarded

136
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,918
when they're just when they go for the

137
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:28,960
cannabinoids then the Turpin are left

138
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:30,439
behind and that's what we are interested

139
00:06:28,959 --> 00:06:31,839
in

140
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:35,279
great

141
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:37,839
so do Growers need to sort of modify how

142
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:40,000
they're already getting the cannabinoids

143
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:41,000
to be able to sort of access these tpin

144
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,079
how does that

145
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,360
work um I think you know the product at

146
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:51,240
least in hemp is is the CBD and is the

147
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:55,400
cannabinoid so they the uh manufacturers

148
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:58,400
the extractors want to maximize that um

149
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:01,359
and leaving behind the Tarpin is not

150
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,758
part of their uh their business plan

151
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,800
they don't really care about the turpins

152
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,840
uh except you know whenever you're

153
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,400
looking at the whole product then you do

154
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:11,560
care about the turpins because that's

155
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,120
what allows you to have particular types

156
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:15,720
of smells and

157
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,360
tastes

158
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,400
great so you mentioned before that

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,759
you've been investigating biocontrol

160
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:26,038
agents for quite some time so what are

161
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:28,280
some other solutions that are available

162
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:31,079
to Growers and how how do they differ

163
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:36,318
from this approach

164
00:07:31,079 --> 00:07:38,800
um if you look at the epa's list of uh

165
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,960
pesticides that are approved for hemp

166
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,759
production uh you will find B pretty

167
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:46,959
much only biopesticides I think there's

168
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:50,680
one conventional and it's a herbicide um

169
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:53,198
most of them are uh from the name plant

170
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:57,478
and also some microorganisms so some

171
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,439
microorganisms are very very helpful in

172
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,560
uh controlling the natural environment

173
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:06,158
on the plant so plants are just like us

174
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:09,720
they have a microbiome so part of their

175
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:12,598
microbiome is actually effectively bites

176
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:16,639
off the pathogens so what we do with a

177
00:08:12,598 --> 00:08:19,360
biocontrol agent is we we put that on

178
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:22,158
the plant and help the plant stimulate

179
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,560
its natural defenses and also some of

180
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:29,158
those actually actively fight against

181
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,879
pathogens so so you mentioned hemp

182
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:33,399
specific spefically so that was going to

183
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,680
be one of my questions was is this

184
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:38,799
biocontrol agent specific to whether it

185
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,759
be hemp or cannabis or could this

186
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,399
potentially be used on other crops as

187
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:45,838
well we've expanded to other crops we've

188
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,759
we've been testing some cucurbits uh

189
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,920
this past year uh both in the greenhouse

190
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:54,838
and in the field excellent and now what

191
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,679
are the pathogens that you're sort of

192
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,480
targeting with this approach you

193
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:01,958
mentioned insects um is it also I know

194
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,759
there's there's fungi there's bacteria

195
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,399
there's weeds is it sort of all of the

196
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:08,278
above or there specific ones that you're

197
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:09,559
looking for um one of the things that

198
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,159
you have to be careful about when you

199
00:09:09,559 --> 00:09:15,399
develop a natural biopesticide is it's

200
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,039
that it is not phytotoxic so it in it's

201
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:21,519
very very uh most concentrated form that

202
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:23,838
we could possibly make it could be used

203
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,240
as an herbicide but that's probably not

204
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:29,360
going to be where we go with it right uh

205
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,039
it's been we've uh actually been able to

206
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,800
control uh powdery mildew on on him with

207
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:37,000
this and it's worked as well as any of

208
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,799
the commercial

209
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,360
products better than some of them too oh

210
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:44,278
wow yeah and that's I know powdery Milo

211
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:46,519
that's one of the the big ones what

212
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:48,919
other sort of targets are you looking

213
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,799
for uh I've just recently switched my

214
00:09:48,919 --> 00:09:54,039
interest to uh fusarium pathogens and so

215
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,519
we've been screening uh different

216
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,958
fusarium pathogens this hasn't been done

217
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,078
on the plant but it's been done in the

218
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,479
lab

219
00:10:00,078 --> 00:10:05,359
and uh we have very effective growth

220
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:09,278
control on the on the

221
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:13,759
fusarium excellent um so you mentioned

222
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:16,159
Nano Emulsion um for those listeners and

223
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:18,958
hosts who might not be familiar with

224
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:21,600
what exactly that is could you sort of

225
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,239
explain well let's go back to the very

226
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,440
Basics on it the very Basics are what is

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,399
an Emulsion so you can think about an

228
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,399
Emulsion is very very simple as making

229
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,839
salad dressing you take your oil and

230
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,559
your vinegar and you shake it and you

231
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:39,240
get something that looks very different

232
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:40,799
than oil and vineger that's an Emulsion

233
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,440
well that's going to be a very very weak

234
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:45,278
Emulsion it's going to separate out in

235
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,000
some cases before you can even get it

236
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,078
out of the bottle onto your salad but

237
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,278
what we do with a nanoemulsion is we

238
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:56,879
make those kind those uh little oil

239
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:58,799
droplets very very very small Nano means

240
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:00,399
like 10 to the 9th when you're talking

241
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:03,240
about things

242
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:07,120
uh and so we we make these very small

243
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:09,879
and we suspend the Tarpin in these uh

244
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:13,120
compounds in these little oil bubbles

245
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:15,720
essentially and they uh will stay in

246
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:19,200
solution we've been able to keep them on

247
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:23,639
the lab bench at room temperature uh for

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:28,240
over two years W and so it's in

249
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:31,839
water it's in water and we use a natural

250
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:36,278
um soap it's called Uh

251
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:39,839
tween uh and basically uh we are going

252
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,879
for things that are extremely safe so we

253
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:44,800
use only use products in what we're

254
00:11:41,879 --> 00:11:46,360
doing that are considered to be grass

255
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:49,799
and grass is

256
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,278
gas and it's an FDA category that's

257
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:55,759
gener generally regarded as safe so the

258
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:57,919
bottom line is this is a pesticide that

259
00:11:55,759 --> 00:12:00,360
you could probably eat no I wouldn't

260
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:03,759
advise it you could probably you could

261
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,320
probably eat it it smells very strong uh

262
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,360
but it's um but it we are trying to make

263
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,360
it as safe as

264
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,600
possible excellent no I'm glad you

265
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,800
brought that up because obviously yeah

266
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,240
tpin they they smell and so if you're

267
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:22,039
adding these to the plant is it going to

268
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,198
affect I mean if it's if it's cannabis

269
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:25,639
it's one thing but um if you're if

270
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,039
you're looking to put this on other

271
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:30,680
crops is it going to affect the smell

272
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:34,679
Taste of those crops

273
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:37,958
um I think that we would have a limit of

274
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:40,519
how late we can spray this on on some

275
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:42,879
crops for example you wouldn't want to

276
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:47,440
dunk your Apple in it and keep that as a

277
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:50,679
post Harvest uh but if you spray uh like

278
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:54,240
the C cbits uh we didn't affect the the

279
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:56,519
quality of those um by doing early earli

280
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,000
earlier sprays we did not spray the

281
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,000
fruit themselves so in you know in most

282
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,839
cases we're not looking for the plant as

283
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,120
the uh product we're looking at you know

284
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,360
a fruit so you just have to be careful

285
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,399
when you can spray those and also

286
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:17,399
remember that that Tarpin are ephemeral

287
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,159
even ours will eventually uh go away but

288
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,839
I have a feeling that we won't be using

289
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:22,759
them on post Harvest because I think it

290
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,560
will affect consumer

291
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:27,720
taste great and now there are a number

292
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:30,278
of different tpin that the plant

293
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:33,959
produces as well are there specific ones

294
00:13:30,278 --> 00:13:37,838
that you're interested in um we have we

295
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:41,119
have not focused on any specific one and

296
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,079
the reason is we want to be able to use

297
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,600
uh these uh

298
00:13:43,078 --> 00:13:49,559
byproducts and so we have used uh by

299
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:51,240
we've done this technology for a couple

300
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:53,879
of different uh

301
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:56,879
extractions and uh we we seem to get the

302
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,720
same effects so uh I think when an

303
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,480
extractor goes in they you know they

304
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,199
have all kinds of different plant types

305
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,879
and cultivars that they're using uh so

306
00:14:04,198 --> 00:14:08,359
we really can't control that if we're

307
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:11,120
using it as a waste product so we just

308
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,680
we do we do have this analyzed and we

309
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,560
know what the the Tarpin are we know

310
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:22,120
what you know residual CBD is there uh

311
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:24,239
and it's um but we are trying our best

312
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,440
not to really pay that much attention to

313
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:29,720
that look at look at it as a whole

314
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:31,839
product but um the ones that are are the

315
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,639
ones that we we when we test them in the

316
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:38,959
lab are anti-fungal and uh anti-insect

317
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:41,839
com okay so is this not limited to just

318
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:44,000
tpin or I mean I know I just I just

319
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:47,040
spoke with a gentleman who published

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,440
this whole paper about other um

321
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,078
compounds that produce Aromas there's

322
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,839
Esters and all these other uh names that

323
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,519
I'm not I can't recall um so are those

324
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:59,680
coming along for the ride too or are you

325
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:02,039
kind of specifically sticking to tping

326
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:03,958
we've focused on tpin because that's

327
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:06,519
really what is the dominant smell in

328
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:09,799
there we know those those will provide

329
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:13,240
the uh compound the the activities that

330
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:16,399
we are interested in um

331
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,039
yeah cannabis SAA is like the miracle

332
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:22,559
plant as far as metabolism goes it

333
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,039
produces so many different compounds uh

334
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,439
I think there's a there's a paper out

335
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:27,559
there from several years ago that calls

336
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:31,639
it the plants of thousands of

337
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:33,359
molecules and um it's you know we don't

338
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:36,000
know what's coming along for the ride we

339
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,360
do know that CBD we have a you know a

340
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,879
small percentage of uh the CBD uh is in

341
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:45,240
there as well and some of the

342
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:47,879
CBG and so is the extraction technique

343
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:49,198
that's used does that play a role here

344
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:51,198
too are there certain ones that are

345
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:53,039
better for this than others we've been

346
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,278
looking primarily at ones that have had

347
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:59,639
an ethanol extraction we um I don't I

348
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:03,278
don't know that the same type of U

349
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:06,560
material is evolved when you use super

350
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:08,399
critical great and now so what is the

351
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:12,078
goal here

352
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:15,639
um is it that eventually Growers will be

353
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:18,239
able to sort of formulate their own

354
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,600
biopesticides or um is that something

355
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,039
that sort of a a specific company that

356
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,519
needs to do yeah I think you're probably

357
00:16:24,039 --> 00:16:28,078
going to have to have that done by

358
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,679
somebody because our our equipment is

359
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:35,318
very expensive

360
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:38,439
uh it's uh so it is uh it's a high

361
00:16:35,318 --> 00:16:40,198
sonication you can make it but it's not

362
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,079
going to be as good as ours it's not

363
00:16:40,198 --> 00:16:45,159
going to stay in solution you can make

364
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:48,239
it with a with a sonicator uh but this

365
00:16:45,159 --> 00:16:51,120
is a high speed sonicator and we've

366
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,919
spent a lot of time getting the

367
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,360
conditions that we do we produce it just

368
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:58,318
right I mean but if you have that

369
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,360
material you can certainly replicate it

370
00:16:58,318 --> 00:17:00,439
we've publ

371
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,519
our

372
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:06,360
methods so but could it be something

373
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:07,959
that you know Growers sort of um I mean

374
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:11,078
it be an extra Revenue stream for them

375
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:13,519
that they could be providing that um

376
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,318
that waste material to to your company

377
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:18,599
or whoever whoever is going to develop

378
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:20,838
this um and turn that into that's the

379
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:24,958
dream yeah the dream is to get extra

380
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:27,119
revenue for Growers get a safe

381
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:30,880
biopesticide uh for

382
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:33,079
producers and uh you know expand this

383
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:38,200
because you know if you have something

384
00:17:33,079 --> 00:17:39,879
that is uh naturally broken down by what

385
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,558
whatever is in the environment on the

386
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,440
plant in the soil and that type of thing

387
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:47,200
that's these natural products are broken

388
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:50,240
down easily more easily than

389
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,240
synthetics uh and then you so you have

390
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,960
something that's environmentally

391
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:57,839
friendly you have something that Growers

392
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,960
get an extra Revenue stream from um and

393
00:17:57,839 --> 00:18:02,959
that you know and works so if you have

394
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:06,400
all of those three things you've got the

395
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,798
kind of the pillars of developing a a

396
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:11,880
biopesticide great and so where are we

397
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:13,440
at in terms of sort of evaluating

398
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,200
whether it works or actually getting to

399
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Market so kind of where are you at there

400
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,720
well I'm I'm hoping that the interest

401
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,440
from cmed will bring people around that

402
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,400
that want to invest in it to be honest

403
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:29,440
with you uh we would love to see this go

404
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:31,038
into a uh a company and uh develop

405
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,400
this technology so that it could be

406
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,440
available to

407
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,600
everyone yeah and so what is sort of

408
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,038
the how how do you get something like

409
00:18:38,599 --> 00:18:44,678
this approved um what are the sort of

410
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:49,038
agencies that that dictate that it's uh

411
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:52,880
it's EPA and the uh there are there are

412
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:56,158
rules for biopesticides for uh

413
00:18:52,880 --> 00:19:00,720
developing those that are less stringent

414
00:18:56,159 --> 00:19:03,320
than um those for synthetics because

415
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,120
most of the those things are natural uh

416
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:08,319
so we would go through the EPA uh we

417
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:10,839
would we would then you know we would

418
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,879
tell them everything that's in ours uh

419
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:16,199
and how it is used and how it's

420
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,880
formulated and then we would uh show

421
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,360
them the efficacy because they don't

422
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,760
approve it unless it's going to it's

423
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:24,599
going to work uh and uh they will do

424
00:19:22,759 --> 00:19:27,759
that but they have approved other

425
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,879
essential oils like garlic oil uh

426
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:32,359
rosemary oil those types of things are

427
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:34,799
already approved as biopesticides and

428
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,038
some of the same tpin are in those as

429
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:38,279
well yeah that was going to be one of my

430
00:19:37,038 --> 00:19:40,279
questions too because I know that you

431
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:42,399
know cannabis hemp that's not the only

432
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:44,480
plant that produces tpin so are there

433
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,480
other other products out there that

434
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,640
utilize tpin yes and then that

435
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,319
essentially when you hear the word

436
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,880
essential oil that's probably a tping

437
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:58,960
mix um we've looked at in the past I've

438
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,880
looked at tping from a uh genus of

439
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:04,640
called menarda which is B bomb and it's

440
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:07,240
got the most amazing different types of

441
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,720
turpins based on cultivar we actually

442
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,919
were able to chemotype them by their um

443
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:17,200
by their turpine chemistry so you had

444
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,960
mentioned other biocontrol agents before

445
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,880
and that sometimes they use actually

446
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,679
microbes whether it be bacteria or

447
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,840
things like that and I know that those

448
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,759
can actually contribute to some of these

449
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:31,119
total count tests um that Growers need

450
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:32,759
to pass in order to get the products to

451
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:36,000
Market whether it's total yeast and mold

452
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:38,319
or total bacteria so I would imagine

453
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,038
that this would be helpful for for those

454
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:43,599
Growers because uh it's not using those

455
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:45,879
microbes right and that that's one of

456
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:48,519
those things as we talked about the you

457
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,720
know when the when you harvest uh you

458
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:55,918
know this might be helpful in uh

459
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,679
reducing the those counts um but we

460
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,400
we've tested it against fusarium which

461
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,320
is one of the pathogens that affects the

462
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,200
inflorescence but we haven't done any

463
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,279
other testing so for right now that's

464
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,640
sort of conjecture on my part but it's

465
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,759
something that we definitely want to

466
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,840
look into yeah that's sounds definitely

467
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,599
promising I know that you know Growers

468
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:18,720
are struggling a lot with aspergilus um

469
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:21,399
being one of them and um imp pythium as

470
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,038
well so um I'm sure those are already on

471
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,880
your radar asilis is definitely on our

472
00:21:24,038 --> 00:21:29,400
radar because asilis can cause problems

473
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,640
in humans

474
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,320
it can colonize the lungs and cause a

475
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:36,480
syndrome called

476
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:39,558
asilios and um that has been connected

477
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:42,599
with cannabis use but in but in immune

478
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:45,720
compromised people yeah exactly yeah

479
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:48,558
it's rare um but something we definitely

480
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,519
uh we like to test for all right Kim

481
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,359
well winding down here I want to give

482
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:56,798
you the opportunity to share any other

483
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,839
links uh that or mention any other

484
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,679
resources that folks might be interested

485
00:21:58,839 --> 00:22:04,000
to read more about sort of the work that

486
00:22:00,679 --> 00:22:06,120
you're doing um and also any websites

487
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,839
social media any ways that folks can

488
00:22:06,119 --> 00:22:09,479
kind of get in touch with you or learn

489
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,158
more about the work you're

490
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,798
doing um I'm sort of an old school

491
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,200
scientist so I don't have a lot of

492
00:22:13,798 --> 00:22:18,918
social media presence um but uh we are

493
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,880
working right now on some of the

494
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,880
fusarium pathogens looking at how to

495
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,640
control those in the inflorescence and

496
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:29,400
looking at the potential that they have

497
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,919
for uh

498
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:35,000
producing mot toxins so we're looking at

499
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:36,520
that as that's where my a lot of my

500
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
future work will be

501
00:22:36,519 --> 00:22:42,158
focused um and hopefully we I can

502
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,159
combine these two and we can use this to

503
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:47,159
control uh fusarium uh in the INF

504
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:49,559
fluorescences because I think that it's

505
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,760
probably more of a problem than we think

506
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:54,918
lots of fusarium disease out there in

507
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:58,759
Greenhouse production as well as field

508
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,720
production yeah absolutely I mean we are

509
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,640
kind of just launched a new fusarium

510
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,600
assay uh for Growers which has been uh

511
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:08,000
very popular and um I know that there's

512
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,959
one scientist that's going to be at

513
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,599
caned um Dr zamir punja who's done a lot

514
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:16,159
of research into that so hopefully you

515
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:18,199
