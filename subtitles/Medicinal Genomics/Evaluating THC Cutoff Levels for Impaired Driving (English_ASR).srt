1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,200
so with respect to driving um cannabis

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,439
increases weaving as does alcohol where

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,440
they're different mostly is that

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,199
cannabis and the big one of the big

5
00:00:11,439 --> 00:00:15,279
findings that we get from Cannabis that

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,439
seems to come out in a lot of papers not

7
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:19,640
all of them is that it tends to slow

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,719
people down because they know they're

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,599
impaired uh so they're they're more

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:25,358
cautious on the road uh doesn't mean

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:27,439
they're better driver it just means that

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:29,519
they know that they're impaired whereas

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,240
with alcohol they speed and they and

14
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,119
they're more they're much more reckless

15
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:36,839
drivers so I I at the beginning of the

16
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,439
interview we talked about um what the

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,960
effect legalization had on driving under

18
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,640
the influence of cannabis and I

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,679
mentioned

20
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,719
that in some jurisdictions the rate of

21
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,198
driving under the influence of cannabis

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,280
went down after legalization or with

23
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,599
legalization and that's because people

24
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,198
think that they're switching from

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,399
alcohol to cannabis so alcohol is much

26
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,920
worse because maybe they're not aware

27
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,920
that they're
