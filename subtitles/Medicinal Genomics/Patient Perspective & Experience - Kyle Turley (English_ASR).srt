here

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:14,000
i'll try to speak loud enough that the

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,679
mic catches it as i'm a bit above it

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,759
um i tend to be that sometimes

7
00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,198
uh again it's an honor to be here my

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,279
name is kyle turley

9
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,800
uh a kid from southern california

10
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:30,240
son of a truck driver decided to play

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,679
football one year in

12
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,238
uh high school and was that good at it

13
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:35,920
that they

14
00:00:34,238 --> 00:00:37,279
decided to give me a scholarship to go

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,399
to college

16
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,239
i had no intention of doing so so that

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,000
required me to spend the rest of my

18
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,399
senior year while everyone was on half

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
day making up all the classes that i

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,719
needed

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,079
to qualify for college and earn this

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,439
scholarship

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,480
so along that way

24
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,839
had some amazing things happen some

25
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:02,558
unbelievable things

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:04,719
met some amazing people did some things

27
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:08,158
that very few people in the world

28
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:08,158
had the opportunity to do

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:14,239
along the same time had some severe

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,599
consequences from it

31
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:19,919
this is life this is

32
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,118
why we're here in my opinion we're here

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,320
to

34
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:25,359
live this life to take on these

35
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,679
challenges

36
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:32,799
to look at these mountains as

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
only obstacles and accomplish great

38
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,960
things

39
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:38,158
the many things that were talked about

40
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,798
earlier in this

41
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,840
discussion today so far by dr mushulam

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,840
who has been an

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,280
unbelievable asset to this discussion

44
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,478
and conversation

45
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,759
for many many years to have brought us

46
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:57,519
here today

47
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:00,478
at harvard what an amazing opportunity

48
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:02,560
thank you again dr mashulam for your

49
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:05,359
excellence and your perseverance

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,439
one of the most amazing parts in meeting

51
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,080
this man

52
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:10,878
to sit and talk with him and see after

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
so long

54
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:16,159
his continued perseverance uh and

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,959
persistence to tell this story

56
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:19,520
uh for obvious reasons that we don't

57
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,479
know

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,719
that some people do know they are uh

59
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,439
intent on keeping this from us

60
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:29,840
uh and to have individuals like uh dr

61
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:31,439
muschilam to to tell that story

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,039
when he could easily be doing so many

63
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:36,719
other things with his life

64
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:38,400
um is uh very inspiring

65
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,800
again i've had the opportunity to meet a

66
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,599
number of people in this world

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,239
through my fame and playing in the

68
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:50,000
national football league

69
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,000
but when people ask me those you know

70
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
moments and who did you meet and all

71
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,719
these cool things that you got to do

72
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,440
uh you know this tops it this is

73
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,639
unbelievable

74
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:02,000
opportunity and an honor uh for me to be

75
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:05,679
present personally

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,039
in this moment at this time

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,680
in our existence as humans

78
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:13,439
this is speaking about a medicine that

79
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,040
will save many people

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:20,079
um that it's taken us this long to

81
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:22,639
redirect ourselves because

82
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
as we know cannabis was not illegal in

83
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:26,958
this country even

84
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,518
until the 1970s when they went on their

85
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,878
tiraden rampage against it

86
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,599
at the same time of the birth of the

87
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:38,000
pharmaceutical industry

88
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,000
and that is why i'm here today

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,759
sometimes in life we have to examine and

90
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,400
contemplate what it is we're here to do

91
00:03:48,719 --> 00:03:53,598
and for some reason i have been put here

92
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:57,039
to be a part of this discussion

93
00:03:53,598 --> 00:04:01,039
so it's a very

94
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:05,120
emotional roller coaster to be on

95
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:08,400
and to be standing here again a kid from

96
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,000
san diego state university uh

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,840
wasn't supposed to make it to college

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,280
wasn't supposed to go to make it through

99
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,560
college

100
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,519
wasn't supposed to be a first-round

101
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,000
draft pick you know drafted higher than

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,798
all the

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,360
guys in the sec in my position you know

104
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,879
this kid coming out of san diego state

105
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:30,720
and it was always because i searched for

106
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:33,600
the answers within myself within

107
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,440
the energy that surrounds us as we

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,720
understand it and many of the scientific

109
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:39,279
minds in here

110
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,320
understand that our energy uh force

111
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:44,399
resonates uh

112
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:48,800
far outside of our physical structure

113
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:50,879
and so i tend to try to tap into that

114
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,560
and that ultimately brought me to where

115
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,639
i am today and having the experience

116
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,879
that i've had with cannabis

117
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,960
to tell my story that came along

118
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,519
from a 20-year addiction to

119
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:07,839
pharmaceutical medications because of

120
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:07,839
trying to climb a mountain

121
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,479
along that climb uh having these amazing

122
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,520
experiences

123
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:16,319
i had the opportunity to have intimate

124
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,519
knowledge

125
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:20,319
of the pharmaceutical industry and what

126
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,198
it does for

127
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,199
injury and illness

128
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
and i can honestly say through prolonged

129
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,320
use

130
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,680
uh of pharmaceuticals uh these man-made

131
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:34,719
concoctions that

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,079
in you know all fairness have been fully

133
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
intended to help

134
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:40,240
uh i think we've realized the

135
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:41,599
consequence of that in our country as we

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,560
see it daily playing out on

137
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,120
our televisions uh with the devastation

138
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,038
that is

139
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,519
uh not just plaguing our athlete

140
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:52,800
community but plaguing uh

141
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,560
our respective communities in our

142
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,319
hometowns where we grew up

143
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,199
major metropolis cities and not just

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:03,600
anymore the excuse of you're from the

145
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:07,919
ghetto

146
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:12,319
cannabis has been a savior to me

147
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:15,439
in that at my lowest point in life of

148
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,639
despair and and loss of of

149
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:20,478
who i was because of

150
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,240
the inherencies in playing the sport of

151
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:25,199
football

152
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:26,478
the damage done by the game but more

153
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,520
importantly

154
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:31,839
the damage done on top of that damage

155
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:32,719
from these chemicals i was putting into

156
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:34,799
my body

157
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
i knew i had to make a decision i was as

158
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,280
i was sitting on my couch

159
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
one day

160
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,399
just returned from the crosby center

161
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:46,239
down in san diego where i was receiving

162
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:49,519
some care

163
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,199
going through therapy sessions for over

164
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:54,959
seven years i went to neurologists

165
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:58,000
neuropsychologists

166
00:06:54,959 --> 00:07:01,279
psychologists counselors

167
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
therapy groups to try and understand

168
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,159
what was happening to me

169
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,280
as a a young man when everybody

170
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,960
says you look amazing

171
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:14,959
to know that inside i felt far from it

172
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,079
uh was a very difficult thing to deal

173
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:17,758
with

174
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,598
and that is the consequence of playing

175
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,479
the game of football

176
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,839
we obviously have severe damage to our

177
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,918
bodies when we get into

178
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,959
car accidents or any other severe cases

179
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,318
of

180
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:35,198
trauma where our bodies are injured

181
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,919
but we do this on a repetitive basis day

182
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,919
in day out

183
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:43,519
an average practice will be 60 to 80

184
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:46,478
plays and at certain positions

185
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:47,918
that is in 60 to 80 collisions

186
00:07:46,478 --> 00:07:50,959
equivalent to

187
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:53,758
a massive car accident and

188
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:54,959
that was the position i informedly chose

189
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,800
to play

190
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:01,918
because of what this game has

191
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:05,280
in store um which is why i'm here

192
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,918
i'm here for athletes uh i started a

193
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:07,679
campaign

194
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,439
called athletes can because i believe

195
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,598
athletes can change

196
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:16,560
this conversation take it away from

197
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:17,839
this singular notion of well it could

198
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:21,038
help these people

199
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:23,119
we have individuals that we expect

200
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,719
to achieve and accomplish great things

201
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,598
in our country

202
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
it's not only spans for athletes but uh

203
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,240
through our military

204
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,278
um where these are not as it is

205
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,639
appearing

206
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:37,120
certain powers uh are trying to position

207
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,679
these

208
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,679
uh choices for our children these were

209
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,038
not always ghetto choices these were

210
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,479
choices in

211
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:48,639
the highest learning institutions to

212
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,800
achieve these high honors playing

213
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:53,360
football at harvard

214
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,278
was no different than playing football

215
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,440
at any sec school

216
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,320
your ultimate goal is to make it to the

217
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,640
national football league

218
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,640
and i have many good friends that

219
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:07,120
attended this school that have done so

220
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:09,360
and we have discussions about what is

221
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
going on in our community

222
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,278
harvard itself has a study right now

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,480
that is taking place with the national

224
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:15,919
football league and the players

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,600
association

226
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:22,479
to analyze players lives

227
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,320
to hopefully help for future generations

228
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,639
of playing this sport

229
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,360
defeat against all of these things that

230
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,399
are coming at us from every angle

231
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,360
as it is in a football game these

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,480
efforts have

233
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:39,519
come to an extent

234
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:43,839
a crossroads of how are we going to

235
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,159
accept the inherencies in this sport

236
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,760
and continue to encourage our children

237
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,919
to play these sports

238
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:52,399
and encourage their dreams to accomplish

239
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:55,439
these amazing achievements

240
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:58,000
when we know that inherently within

241
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,560
these sports lies

242
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:04,399
nine to ten times rate reception of

243
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:07,518
alzheimer's dementia als

244
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,839
parkinson's disease and

245
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,440
10 to 20 kids die every year in youth

246
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,200
football

247
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,800
and it's a guarantee due to the lack of

248
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:22,240
attention given to certain injuries

249
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:24,159
that are inherent in the sport

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,799
you cannot have unfortunately with the

251
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:26,799
human body

252
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,919
injury not occur while putting it in uh

253
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:36,159
precarious situations of collision

254
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,159
uh and these sports these contact sports

255
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,199
or as we're experiencing

256
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,399
even into other sports uh as we've

257
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,360
experienced recently

258
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,000
in the extreme sports community a number

259
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,039
of

260
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,320
bmx riders

261
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:55,519
are starting to kill themselves so

262
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,160
we look at it myself my friends

263
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,278
my colleagues and we try to understand

264
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:02,480
how is this happening

265
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,000
why is this happening and we only need

266
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,240
to look at ourselves

267
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,078
which is a very fortunate position to be

268
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,200
in and that

269
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
i can sit to talk and tell my story and

270
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,200
it is something that

271
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:17,278
is very detailed to anyone even in

272
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
the world of science because i

273
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:22,720
understand these things

274
00:11:19,039 --> 00:11:23,599
that are happening to me the resolutions

275
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
i've

276
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,000
found in certain medicines through trial

277
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,039
and personal error

278
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:34,078
of taking these medicines and that uh

279
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:37,360
is is not just in in in

280
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:40,559
me and in my court this is a uh

281
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,480
relative uh ability for

282
00:11:40,559 --> 00:11:47,439
my teammates to speak to this as well

283
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,519
post football career i went into music i

284
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,920
enjoy playing music

285
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,519
i play guitar and drums and i sing and

286
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,199
so i went to nashville

287
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,959
of course to try and climb another

288
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,560
mountain had the other

289
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:03,599
opportunity to tour the country playing

290
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:06,078
my music coast to coast and

291
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,600
pretty much in every state for over four

292
00:12:06,078 --> 00:12:09,838
to five years and

293
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
uh had the opportunity to play with some

294
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:14,399
amazing artists uh

295
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:15,679
around uh this this great country and

296
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,078
every opportunity

297
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,359
i had to connect with the next teammate

298
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:21,759
i did so

299
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
and across the board every one of us is

300
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:25,838
suffering

301
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:25,838
uh in ways that

302
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,278
people wouldn't believe it's hard to

303
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,720
i know understand this because you're

304
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:33,278
sitting there looking at me like ah this

305
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,879
guy's

306
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:36,399
got it together and he's been able to

307
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:38,958
speak about this and talk about this

308
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:41,200
articulate this and

309
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,399
the only reason i'm here today and being

310
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,120
able to do this

311
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:47,200
is because of cannabis there is thank

312
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
you

313
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:57,278
through my trial and error uh in taking

314
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:59,919
medicine um i realized that

315
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,480
there are certain things that i have an

316
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:05,679
injury

317
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,680
that medicine is good for as far as

318
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:10,159
common medicine western medicine but in

319
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,720
the long-term use

320
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:15,278
of being addicted to these medications

321
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,440
since 1996

322
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:24,320
until exactly a year ago this month

323
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:27,760
when i decided uh at an a position of

324
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:30,959
desperation to take a chance

325
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:34,159
because my daily living was

326
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:35,759
my hands shaking so severe i couldn't

327
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,958
stop it

328
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,919
to where i had suicidal thoughts

329
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:43,198
constantly

330
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:47,360
homicidal thoughts constantly

331
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:49,039
rage to no end and it was ruining my

332
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,240
life my family's life and everyone

333
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,519
around me

334
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,278
um i knew there had to be a something

335
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,839
better there there must be

336
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,759
something better i knew along the way of

337
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
using cannabis for the first time when i

338
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:03,439
was in my second year in the national

339
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,120
football league

340
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
because i was always concerned about

341
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,759
passing drug tests

342
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:11,278
and you know not ever having that be

343
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:13,039
associated with me

344
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,759
as i saw many of my friends being

345
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:17,519
suspended lose scholarships in college

346
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:19,519
because of their use of cannabis i

347
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,879
refrained

348
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,320
and then in my second year in the

349
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:25,360
national football league was going

350
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,000
through some very trying times

351
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:30,159
i had a teammate after a practice one

352
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
day suggested to me as i was

353
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:33,439
losing sleep couldn't sleep a lot of

354
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,879
pressure in the national football league

355
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
a young player

356
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:38,720
going through trying to create a normal

357
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,838
life

358
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:45,680
with a wife and trying to start a family

359
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:49,760
etc very frustrated very

360
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:51,120
very stressful to try and

361
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:52,879
coordinate all those things and make all

362
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,639
those things happen without

363
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:59,600
having a lot of

364
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:02,000
confusion disruption for anyone and then

365
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:05,278
on top of that

366
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,278
trying to associate all these things

367
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:10,720
to being normal in and very unnormal

368
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,039
world

369
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,399
the transition from going from the real

370
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,919
world to

371
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:22,480
an nfl practice facility to an nfl

372
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:24,639
game day is you have to have the switch

373
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,959
and you need to have to you have to be

374
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:31,198
able to turn it on and turn it off

375
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,198
unfortunately the off switch was

376
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:36,559
neglected many times it is

377
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,320
something that through what we

378
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:41,198
understand now about the brain

379
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,480
has created the disruption that we have

380
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,919
in our community

381
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:47,278
that is causing suicide at an

382
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:49,599
unprecedented rate

383
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:50,799
we can no longer stand for this we can

384
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,920
no longer

385
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:54,799
allow a medicine that has been proven to

386
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,439
protect

387
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:58,399
our brains to be kept from us any longer

388
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,880
the things that

389
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:06,480
you heard from dr mashulim and mckernan

390
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,958
are unbelievable in

391
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,079
their science but more unbelievable in

392
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,319
the neglect

393
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:14,879
of this information that has gone on for

394
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,879
too long

395
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,079
can we change this conversation i think

396
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,199
we can i think that it's happening i

397
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:24,638
know it's happening

398
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:27,278
our veteran community is crying for this

399
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,959
and that spans across our military and

400
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,240
all of our veterans of these great

401
00:16:28,958 --> 00:16:33,758
achievements and mountains that we

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,240
expect our children to continue to climb

403
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:38,079
that have consequence it is important

404
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,000
for us to understand that

405
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,838
these things you don't just wake up one

406
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,480
day and become a professional football

407
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,839
player

408
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:47,039
or an elite force military service

409
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,360
member

410
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:51,759
these are incredible accomplishments

411
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,440
that come with incredible cost

412
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,199
and it is imperative if we want to

413
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,240
continue to raise our

414
00:16:55,198 --> 00:17:00,559
children in this great country and

415
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
expect them to achieve these amazing

416
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,838
accomplishments

417
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:05,678
that we find a medicine to help it

418
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,880
there's no doubt about it that cannabis

419
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,679
can be that medicine

420
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,559
it has saved my life personally one year

421
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,519
ago today

422
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:17,119
i was a very different person and could

423
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:20,160
not stand here in front of these lights

424
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:23,759
with this pressure to speak uh

425
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,038
to be around uh these amazing people

426
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:27,759
uh and stand here and tell my story it's

427
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:31,119
important that

428
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:34,240
my story can add to this conversation uh

429
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:37,279
as i speak for athletes across our

430
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,319
world who at young ages are being

431
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,639
stricken to

432
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:45,678
severe addictive drugs like oxycontin

433
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,679
and vicodin and percocet and laura tab

434
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,400
and darvaset and tor doll

435
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,000
and everything else that i can go on

436
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,759
with all the slides and everything that

437
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,960
have been given

438
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:59,359
these things do not help recover injury

439
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,759
especially neurocognitive injury and no

440
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,879
person in my opinion with a brain injury

441
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:05,599
should ever be given

442
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:06,880
anything but cannabis as cannabis has

443
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,480
saved

444
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:13,600
my life period but has proven to me

445
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:16,160
to resolve neurocognitive issues that

446
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:18,240
psych meds like well well butrin

447
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,919
depakote and zoloft which i was

448
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:24,480
on for six years uh were only merely

449
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,440
trying to do

450
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,079
i appreciate the opportunity to be here

451
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,160
but i

452
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:32,720
more importantly urge you to continue

453
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,759
this conversation outside of this room

454
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,640
outside of these hallways and take this

455
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:38,798
conversation

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,160
to the mainstream as that's where it has

457
00:18:38,798 --> 00:18:45,279
to be these uh

458
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,960
studies and all these things to many

459
00:18:45,279 --> 00:18:49,519
people are only going to occur

460
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,960
with full legalization of cannabis and

461
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,200
that has to happen

462
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,480
there's no possible way for us to defeat

463
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,558
the big machine

464
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:58,240
with this medicine unless we have full

465
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:02,240
legalization and that is

466
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,480
at your hands that is at my hand

467
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,919
i implore every one of you vote for

468
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,960
cannabis

469
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:10,480
every chance you get vote to legalize

470
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,880
vote for medical cannabis

471
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,038
wherever it is at on a ballot and change

472
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,400
this world because cannabis will there's

473
00:19:15,038 --> 00:19:20,079
no doubt about that

474
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,600
and athletes can save this conversation

475
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,839
of suicide as we add our stories

476
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:27,558

cannabis coalition

481

and it became a football issue this is a

482
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,159
much bigger issue

483
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,720
whether you're a weekend joe that likes

484

go out and ride your mountain bike when

486

you fall you're going to have an injury

487
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,960
when you go to talk to your doctor

488
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:48,480
they're going to give you a medicine

489
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:51,360
they're going to give it to you

490
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:52,960
freely and willingly in large doses and

491

those medicines

492
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,558
unfortunately are not going to look like

493
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:57,679
that which is something that grows from

494
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,960
the ground

495
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,679
this is a plant we need to understand it

496
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,400
we need to explore we need to research

497
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,759
and develop this as a medicine but we

498
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,240
need to immediately allow

499
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:12,000
access as we understand the incredible

500
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
fight that is against this

501
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:21,839
information coming out thank you for

502
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,839
