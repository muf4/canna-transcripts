this episode we talked to Dr Allison

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:34,978
Justice Allison is founder and CEO of

32
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:37,319
the hemp mine a 30-acre hemp Farm in

33
00:01:34,978 --> 00:01:40,978
South Carolina that supplies premium

34
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,179
hemp genetics bread in-house across the

35
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:44,700
U.S

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:46,920
the hemp mine produces a wide array of

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,618
consumer products ranging from smokable

38
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,079
flour to topicals to tinctures of

39
00:01:49,618 --> 00:01:53,578
different concentrations for both humans

40
00:01:52,078 --> 00:01:56,399
and animals

41
00:01:53,578 --> 00:01:59,039
Allison also co-founded the Cannabis

42
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,680
research Coalition a professional group

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,439
dedicated to addressing the cultivation

44
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,680
and post-harvest issues that challenge

45
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:10,258
today's cannabis industry

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,480
Allison recently co-authored an article

47
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:15,958
in cannabis Science and Technology

48
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:18,238
titled reading the leaves adventures in

49
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,939
the leaf level physiology of cannabis

50
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:24,840
which takes a deeper look into how

51
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:27,780
cannabis plants respond to light and CO2

52
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,819
during our conversation we discuss the

53
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,340
difference in cannabis photosynthesis

54
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:35,039
rates during vegetative and flowering

55
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:37,439
stages the possibility that during

56
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,900
flowering leaves in the Cannabis flower

57
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,039
take over photosynthesis from the fan

58
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,560
leaves

59
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:46,560
why cannabis Growers may want to reduce

60
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,939
light intensity and duration six weeks

61
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,459
into flower

62
00:02:47,939 --> 00:02:52,739
and conversely how maximizing light

63
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:54,239
during flour can increase yield but

64
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,878
reduce quality

65
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,459
and possible varietal differences in

66
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,378
photosynthesis rates

67
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,120
before we get to my conversation with

68
00:03:01,378 --> 00:03:06,479
Allison I want to thank this episode

87
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,760
good afternoon Allison thanks so much

88
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,759
for joining us on the podcast

89
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:15,119
course of course so I came across your

90
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:17,399
article that you co-authored in cannabis

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,798
Science and Technology titled reading

92
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:23,099
the leaves adventures in the leaf level

93
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,198
physiology of cannabis and I also saw

94
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:27,479
the conversation that took place on the

95
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,220
LinkedIn post that you did to share that

96
00:04:27,478 --> 00:04:31,319
article and I thought it'd be a great

97
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,780
topic to discuss on the podcast not only

98
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:35,519
because the research is valuable to

99
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:37,079
Growers but also because it's a good

100
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:39,599
example of something that we've talked

101
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:42,539
about a lot on the podcast and at can

102
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,000
Med which is this whole idea of

103
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,220
we're seeing researchers use the science

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,860
to explain some things that Legacy

105
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,600
Growers have learned through experience

106
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:53,819
but before we get too deep into that

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,919
please explain what it is you did with

108
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:58,079
this project and some of the key

109
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,719
findings that came out of it

110
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,139
yeah so

111
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,139
a project

112
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,900
would like

113
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,840
like lycor is a bioscience company that

114
00:05:09,899 --> 00:05:15,000
makes all sorts of really cool unique

115
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:17,459
tools to

116
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,699
you know take a plant and understand

117
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:23,359
what's going on on the leaf level or

118
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:26,100
even sometimes on the cellular level

119
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,879
they have tools that do plants they have

120
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,039
tools that even go underwater and uh and

121
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:35,219
measure photosynthesis for underwater

122
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,319
plants and and so

123
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:39,479
you know this was a project I was

124
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:40,139
extremely excited about

125
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:42,839
um

126
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:44,759
when when Jason and Rod called me and

127
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:47,579
you know they wanted to

128
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:50,280
to get some measurements on cannabis

129
00:05:47,579 --> 00:05:54,000
um I was completely excited

130
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:56,579
um you know using one of these tools you

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,100
know you could totally say that's a grad

132
00:05:56,579 --> 00:06:01,019
student's dream come true

133
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:05,160
um because it really takes you know the

134
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:09,418
theoretical and let you see on a science

135
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,340
level with math and equations and you

136
00:06:09,418 --> 00:06:13,639
know being able to understand what goes

137
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:16,739
in what comes out and make

138
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,379
conclusions from there is just really

139
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,240
exciting you know these tools are very

140
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,740
intricate you know they can be difficult

141
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,699
to use

142
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:28,560
um not difficult to use just uh tricky

143
00:06:25,699 --> 00:06:31,020
and you really have to understand what

144
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,019
it is you're looking for so you know

145
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:36,659
it's not a tool for every grower it's

146
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:39,180
not a tool for every large corporation

147
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:41,160
you know this we tried to make it very

148
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,038
clear in the article it wasn't a sales

149
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,199
pitch by any means because these tools

150
00:06:44,038 --> 00:06:48,800
are

151
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,360
mostly made for researchers

152
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,180
universities and and people that that

153
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,759
take it a a step further you know people

154
00:06:54,180 --> 00:07:00,360
that really enjoy plant physiology and

155
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,819
and understanding uh photosynthesis but

156
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,860
the thing is you know the conclusion

157
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,379
here is taking

158
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:08,759
all of the information we find as

159
00:07:07,379 --> 00:07:11,639
researchers

160
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:14,639
and applying it to

161
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:16,740
um you know everyday learnings of what

162
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,439
happens in a grow room

163
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,800
um and I you know this is a very very

164
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:25,560
you know high level for this type of

165
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,720
research because you know it was done

166
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,699
with data collected you know only for

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,740
two days

168
00:07:28,699 --> 00:07:33,660
tons more needs to be done for this and

169
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,660
in different ways and we can talk about

170
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:39,780
some of those different methods that I

171
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,819
would like to do on a repeat trial

172
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:43,739
but I think this just kind of brings up

173
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:47,639
some topics that

174
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:50,160
we can take and and and further further

175
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:52,680
do research but then also start to

176
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,080
compare to you know what of what of the

177
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,160
Legacy growner Growers done for so long

178
00:07:55,079 --> 00:08:01,680
and why you know everything from

179
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,539
um you know increasing CO2 levels you

180
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,538
know that's not it's not done just for

181
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:09,839
fun we understand that that goes to

182
00:08:06,538 --> 00:08:11,639
speeding up photosynthesis and which

183
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,939
ultimately increases yields which

184
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:18,418
ultimately increases dollars so it all

185
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,740
plays together it's just not necessarily

186
00:08:18,418 --> 00:08:21,538
a tool

187
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,519
um a grower would use it's something

188
00:08:21,538 --> 00:08:26,818
that we need to take these findings and

189
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,560
apply it and you know bring science into

190
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:32,519
the community

191
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:34,320
excellent so in looking again looking at

192
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,418
your LinkedIn post there were like three

193
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,520
bullet points that were sort of the key

194
00:08:36,418 --> 00:08:39,658
points that came out of your research

195
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:41,759
and if you don't have that in front of

196
00:08:39,658 --> 00:08:43,200
you I have it written down so I can read

197
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,059
it up

198
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,620
um but the first one being

199
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:48,419
um that cannabis has one of the highest

200
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:51,000
rates of photosynthesis and you said

201
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:52,919
it's up there with corn so

202
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,419
um was that a surprising finding was

203
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:56,759
that something that you kind of expected

204
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:59,639
and you know and what does that mean

205
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:03,778
practically for a grower

206
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:05,580
so corn corn and I believe sunflower two

207
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,360
of the

208
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,220
um

209
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,959
two plants that have the highest rates

210
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,778
of photosynthesis

211
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,879
um and you know everybody driving down

212
00:09:12,778 --> 00:09:18,299
the road you can see how fast the corn

213
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,019
grows how aggressively if it's watered

214
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:21,719
um

215
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:27,560
you know these plants are just monsters

216
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:30,778
and very good at assimilation and and

217
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:33,719
understanding or or the capability of a

218
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:36,899
you know turning CO2 into plant material

219
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:40,080
basically a biomass

220
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,278
um and you know cannabis is a tricky

221
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,379
plant

222
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,200
um you know I've always known that as a

223
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:48,720
as a vegetative plant it can handle

224
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,700
great extremes

225
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,860
um you know our Greenhouse there's been

226
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:56,700
times it's the fans have failed and it

227
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:59,580
gets you know 150 in the greenhouse and

228
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:01,800
the vegetative plants are just fine as

229
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,519
long as they have water

230
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,859
um

231
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,139
you know I've seen cold temperatures

232
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,560
under freezing and the plants are okay

233
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:13,439
but when you talk about a flowering

234
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,739
plant they're a lot more finicky

235
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:20,640
um and and what this data shows is

236
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:23,100
is kind of why and puts uh puts data to

237
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:23,819
me just saying they're finicky

238
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,759
um

239
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,680
because they can't they can't handle the

240
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,299
the extremes as much as the vegetative

241
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,219
plants do

242
00:10:30,299 --> 00:10:35,159
so I think we all know that that

243
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:37,440
cannabis in general is a is a beast you

244
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:39,179
know it grows very fast very

245
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720
aggressively

246
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,179
um

247
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,740
so this just shows yeah it's up there

248
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:46,379
with corn

249
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,959
yeah and that's interesting so is the is

250
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:51,120
the hypothesis that the plant is using

251
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,759
so much energy or so much resources into

252
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,259
creating flour that it becomes more

253
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,259
susceptible to stresses

254
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,200
I believe so

255
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,759
looking at the data

256
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:11,459
I imagine you'll put the the link in

257
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,560
where people can read it themselves but

258
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:16,619
so you know if you were to look at

259
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:18,899
figure two and three both of these

260
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:23,399
describe

261
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:26,940
you know two different processes of why

262
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,200
the flowering plants are

263
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:33,660
are less suited to deal with

264
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,320
problems than vegetative plants

265
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:38,120
um

266
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,579
so as far as looking at photosynthesis

267
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:45,600
carbon allocation so you know taking

268
00:11:41,578 --> 00:11:48,000
taking the CO2 and the air and turning

269
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,560
it into biomass again

270
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,860
um and then looking at different light

271
00:11:49,559 --> 00:11:55,859
intensities even though that light is

272
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,500
there the flowering plant

273
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,899
basically throws it away and so you'll

274
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:03,000
see in figure two non-photo chemical

275
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:05,519
quenching and all that means is that

276
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,559
when the plant takes it in

277
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:10,019
or when the when it comes to the plant

278
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:12,419
instead of absorbing it to to go through

279
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,179
photosynthesis it basically throws it

280
00:12:12,419 --> 00:12:17,219
away in a form of heat

281
00:12:15,179 --> 00:12:21,000
and so

282
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,100
um you know looking at these graphs the

283
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,759
flowering plant

284
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:28,259
has a much higher level of

285
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,120
non-photochemical quenching than the

286
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:31,799
vegetative plants

287
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,320
so

288
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,439
um plant basically all it says is

289
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,240
vegetative plants can take up just about

290
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,060
as much light as you could give them

291
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,680
whereas the flowering plants throw it

292
00:12:42,059 --> 00:12:46,619
away

293
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:48,778
in layman terms and so you know this

294
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:50,399
really makes you think about well for an

295
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:52,320
indoor setting where you can control

296
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:55,559
what's going on because this was done on

297
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:59,339
on a field crop you know it makes you

298
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:01,138
think well is there is there reason at

299
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:04,019
certain points during the flowering

300
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:06,778
cycle to provide less light because it's

301
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,278
not actually using it

302
00:13:06,778 --> 00:13:11,338
um

303
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:16,139
and you know

304
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:18,360
I I know a lot of Legacy Growers at the

305
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:20,100
last couple of weeks of flower they they

306
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,899
turned down the lights turned down the

307
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,420
temperatures

308
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,240
um and this could act absolutely be one

309
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,838
aspect of that

310
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,539
um

311
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,320
but then as was brought up on LinkedIn

312
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:36,539
well maybe this is just

313
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:39,360
considering that the leaves because keep

314
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:40,259
in mind this measurement is done on a

315
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,240
leaf

316
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:45,240
you know it's one

317
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,639
basically centimeter spot on a leaf you

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:50,339
know a point in time

319
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:54,720
um or maybe those leaves

320
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:58,079
are not photosynthesizing as much

321
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:01,980
during those later times and flower but

322
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:04,559
the the leaves within the uh the flower

323
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,539
material is actually taking over from

324
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,059
there

325
00:14:06,539 --> 00:14:11,219
um and you know you kind of if you think

326
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:14,159
about the life cycles and what you

327
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:17,940
notice and especially in the field where

328
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:20,819
nutrients you know we we amend the soil

329
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:23,700
we add you know flowable liquid

330
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,300
nutrients through the irrigation system

331
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:29,160
but still it's hard to really provide

332
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:31,620
everything the plant needs in a field

333
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:34,078
setting

334
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:36,539
um and so

335
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:38,819
so especially in in a field setting

336
00:14:36,539 --> 00:14:41,939
where you do not have adequate nutrients

337
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,220
or quite as much for the most part

338
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,440
towards later and flower you'll notice a

339
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:49,320
lot of leaf yellowing and so it's the

340
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:51,839
it's those older leaves that are are

341
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:54,180
yellowing you know eventually fall off

342
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,519
well you know there there's a reason for

343
00:14:54,179 --> 00:15:01,019
that and that's because it's the leaves

344
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,899
then are becoming a a source for that

345
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:06,360
floral material so you know basically

346
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:08,578
just uh moving those nutrients out of

347
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:11,220
the old leaves and and moving that

348
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:11,939
energy towards the flower

349
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,680
um

350
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:16,079
and so

351
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,919
you know even indoors I've seen this

352
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:18,659
happen

353
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:21,899
um and you know the most likely that's

354
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:25,319
an effect of of nutrient but

355
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:27,980
what it really tells me is that it's a

356
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:30,000
shift then from

357
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:32,579
photosynthesizing potentially

358
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,100
potentially from photosynthesizing in

359
00:15:32,578 --> 00:15:37,019
the leaf to that floral material really

360
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,820
taking over

361
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:42,060
um you know another way to kind of look

362
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:44,160
at this and kind of conclude that

363
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:46,379
um again a lot more work needs to be

364
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:49,740
done to have this as the exact

365
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:51,838
conclusion but if you think about the

366
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:53,720
folks who really stripped the leaves off

367
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:55,860
the plants yeah

368
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,600
I was going to bring that up I wrote I

369
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,379
wrote down lollipopping because yeah

370
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:03,899
yeah yeah so those who lollipop or you

371
00:16:01,379 --> 00:16:07,259
know the the old two node what node and

372
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:11,399
Flip or where they really strip the

373
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:13,198
plants you know coming into the industry

374
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:15,299
um a while back I saw that and I was

375
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:17,519
like oh my God you know you're you're

376
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:20,399
pulling off its solar panels to an

377
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,220
extreme but you know I have seen an

378
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,578
incredible yields

379
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:29,278
when when plants are stripped you know

380
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:32,338
just as good if if not better than some

381
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,778
that are not stripped

382
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:37,019
um and so this definitely could

383
00:16:33,778 --> 00:16:40,679
contribute to the leaves not doing as

384
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:42,480
much work than as as the flower and

385
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:46,198
cannabis is a is an interesting plant

386
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:48,778
because you know the flower is green

387
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:51,419
when you think of other plants there's

388
00:16:48,778 --> 00:16:55,259
not a lot of photosynthesis going on I

389
00:16:51,419 --> 00:16:57,240
mean there's no chloroplast there so um

390
00:16:55,259 --> 00:17:01,199
I think that all kind of jobs together

391
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:04,140
to lend towards you know one you you

392
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:06,899
certainly could could cut the light down

393
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,540
but two you know is it really that

394
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:12,900
flower taking over and this kind of

395
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:14,639
leads to you know the desire I have for

396
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,240
another experiment

397
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,939
um

398
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,160
hopefully not too long from now is

399
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:22,740
basically taking

400
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,360
um doing these sorts of measurement in a

401
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,419
chamber

402
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:29,219
um so where everything that goes in is

403
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,960
measured everything that goes out is

404
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:33,058
measured what's changed inside is

405
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,759
measured and you can

406
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:38,759
um really really understand what's going

407
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:41,160
on with the flower not just this one one

408
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:42,839
leaf on one plant

409
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,820
interesting

410
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:46,079
yeah and you know one of the things that

411
00:17:44,819 --> 00:17:48,538
stood out too when you were taking us

412
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:50,519
through figure two and talking about how

413
00:17:48,538 --> 00:17:52,379
when you get into flowering that the

414
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:55,379
leaves not absorbing that light anymore

415
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:57,539
it's sort of giving off heat and I

416
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:59,520
wonder in an indoor setting is that

417
00:17:57,538 --> 00:18:01,319
something that's more commonly seen like

418
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,339
when you have plants that are in

419
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:08,939
flowering is the room warmer

420
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:11,000
that's an interesting thought

421
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,000
um

422
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,798
hmm

423
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,558
so if you're maximizing

424
00:18:16,798 --> 00:18:23,400
the light that it can take up

425
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:25,740
is it actually enough to heat the room

426
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,740
that's a good quite you know I would I

427
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:31,079
wouldn't think so uh okay

428
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:34,140
that that would

429
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,480
this is such you know micro units that

430
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,620
these plants are putting out I would

431
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,259
guess not but that's definitely

432
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:43,798
something I'm going to double check all

433
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:45,058
right sounds good and so yeah in you

434
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:46,379
know one of the conclusions that could

435
00:18:45,058 --> 00:18:48,240
be made from this and you mentioned that

436
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,820
some of the Legacy Growers may already

437
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,980
be doing it is that it's it sounds like

438
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:55,678
and based on your your paper in the post

439
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:58,558
too that after six weeks of flowering

440
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,480
you might be able to either back off the

441
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:02,759
intensity of the light or just even

442
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,038
shorten the duration of the light or

443
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:09,419
both is that the idea

444
00:19:05,038 --> 00:19:12,119
yeah yeah and you know again because the

445
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,940
plant is throwing away

446
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:17,279
um these photons that that you're paying

447
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,960
for in an indoor setting you know it

448
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:20,339
would it would make a lot of sense to do

449
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
that

450
00:19:20,339 --> 00:19:23,879
um

451
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,319
you know even if the floral material is

452
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,000
taking over for a lot of that

453
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:28,740
photosynthesis that's happening

454
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,019
happening

455
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:33,779
um if you think about I guess square

456
00:19:31,019 --> 00:19:36,660
footage of the leaves versus square

457
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:38,460
footage of the flowers

458
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:41,580
um if you were to take the leaves off

459
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,500
there's less less square footage if that

460
00:19:41,579 --> 00:19:46,139
makes sense

461
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,240
um of the flower material so they would

462
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:51,960
have to really be making up for the

463
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:54,298
leaves so I I would my theory would be

464
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,519
that you could back off you know it's

465
00:19:54,298 --> 00:19:58,259
still photosynthesizing but I think you

466
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:59,879
could certainly back off those last

467
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,480
weeks

468
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,700
um but but other things I've noticed

469
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,819
you know they kind of give a thumbs up

470
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:10,620
to backing off on the lights is is

471
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:11,939
really the quality

472
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:15,719
um

473
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:18,960
I've seen people gosh I've seen people

474
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,519
in the last two weeks actually go to 24

475
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,400
hours light

476
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:26,279
and just you know pump them full pop

477
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:28,740
them full of photons

478
00:20:26,279 --> 00:20:30,798
um and in certain settings I have seen

479
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,380
that increase yield

480
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,379
but the flowers look terrible you know

481
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:40,320
they start throwing out little fingers

482
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:42,840
and as far as being a nice quality for

483
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,418
smokable flower you know it pretty much

484
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:48,119
ruins it but if you were just growing

485
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:51,299
these for extract which I'd imagine not

486
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:53,579
many people are indoors at least those

487
00:20:51,298 --> 00:20:57,839
those top nice flowers

488
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:59,639
um you know it would make it unsellable

489
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:03,259
um you know the other thing is the the

490
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,259
really high light intensity

491
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:09,960
I I have seen that really and one thing

492
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,700
we should look at is looking at the

493
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,960
trichome heads and is that highlight

494
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,860
intensity

495
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,200
basically speeding up uh

496
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,719
the the process of going from the clear

497
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:25,380
to the Milky to Amber is it just

498
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:29,100
speeding that up or is the high light

499
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:30,840
intensity causing that color change

500
00:21:29,099 --> 00:21:34,798
um because like I said I've seen people

501
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:37,319
be applying 1200 micro moles like

502
00:21:34,798 --> 00:21:39,720
and you know the plants almost look

503
00:21:37,319 --> 00:21:42,240
burned especially you know the the

504
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:45,419
higher the higher colas that are closest

505
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,519
to the light so you know there certainly

506
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:50,280
could be

507
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:51,900
there certainly could be Merit to to

508
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,359
cutting the lights off the last couple

509
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:56,759
of weeks oh and then to add to that the

510
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,699
the last thought for

511
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:02,220
um that procedure would really be you

512
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:04,798
know are you whether you're cutting

513
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,740
lights off or or providing low

514
00:22:04,798 --> 00:22:12,179
temperatures you know are you are you

515
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:13,079
sending this plant earlier to

516
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:16,140
um

517
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:18,418
to ripeness you know is it doing

518
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,820
something in the flower that we

519
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:24,600
certainly haven't measured yet but that

520
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:27,298
contributes to a to a cure or to an

521
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:30,418
aspect you know decreasing chlorophyll

522
00:22:27,298 --> 00:22:32,579
something that makes the plant taste you

523
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:35,759
know taste better

524
00:22:32,579 --> 00:22:39,359
um the you know I I can't say I doubt

525
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:44,158
that definitely could be right

526
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,959
no and do you think that this whole the

527
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,960
do you think the idea of the plant

528
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:51,779
needing less light later in the later

529
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,840
stages of its life it's I mean that sort

530
00:22:51,779 --> 00:22:57,658
of mimics natural conditions right it's

531
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:59,639
an annual plant and they're finishing in

532
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,440
the fall like like it is now where the

533
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:04,679
days are shorter and there's less light

534
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,900
to to use right yeah I mean in nature

535
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:09,360
that's that's what they get you know

536
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,400
between the the daylight and

537
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:12,658
temperatures you know that all lends to

538
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,298
the plant

539
00:23:12,659 --> 00:23:16,919
basically saying let's hurry up uh

540
00:23:15,298 --> 00:23:19,679
Winter's coming we need to flower and

541
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,520
produce Seed where our species keeps

542
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,519
going

543
00:23:20,519 --> 00:23:26,639
so yeah I mean

544
00:23:23,519 --> 00:23:28,558
it certainly makes sense to me

545
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,740
um and and this data

546
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,480
suggests it so I think with

547
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,000
with some other universities other

548
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:38,220
experiments jumping in we can we can

549
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,380
definitely say at least in the varieties

550
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:42,000
we test

551
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,980
because there's certainly varietal

552
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,339
differences um

553
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,599
I haven't seen that with with many

554
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:53,158
aspects whether we're talking nutrients

555
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:54,658
or like you know CO2 all other things

556
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,940
yeah and that was one of the things

557
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:59,059
mentioned in the paper I think it was

558
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:01,919
with the uh your co-author there Jason

559
00:23:59,058 --> 00:24:03,418
was was mentioning that in other crops

560
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,759
that

561
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:07,980
this sort of this sort of study in this

562
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:10,798
sort of data has been generated not just

563
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:12,599
on the species level but on the varietal

564
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,819
or in our case The Strain or the

565
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,298
cultivar level because there are going

566
00:24:14,819 --> 00:24:20,099
to be differences throughout so

567
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:22,980
um yeah that's that's a great point that

568
00:24:20,099 --> 00:24:25,019
you know this was just done on one

569
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:27,058
variety over two days so there's a lot

570
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:30,720
more that that we can learn

571
00:24:27,058 --> 00:24:33,178
absolutely yeah these tools are used for

572
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,360
breeding projects you know

573
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:38,340
whether Monsanto or whoever out there is

574
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,099
breeding corn

575
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:42,538
um those scientists definitely use these

576
00:24:41,099 --> 00:24:43,259
tools

577
00:24:42,538 --> 00:24:45,058
um

578
00:24:43,259 --> 00:24:48,480
because you know when you're breeding

579
00:24:45,058 --> 00:24:51,000
you can certainly measure yield versus

580
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:54,120
the inputs you give it

581
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:56,460
but you can't necessarily

582
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:59,459
you can't necessarily tell how how

583
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:01,079
strong photosynthesis is without these

584
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,038
tools I mean you can have an estimate

585
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:08,639
again based off of yield but this this

586
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:11,339
certainly gives a deeper insight and a

587
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,980
good tool for breeding

588
00:25:11,339 --> 00:25:15,899
yeah and to that point about sort of on

589
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,038
the varietal level I I know that in the

590
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,320
paper that

591
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:21,058
you also identified a phosphate

592
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,740
limitation in the plants that you were

593
00:25:21,058 --> 00:25:25,379
looking at now is that something that's

594
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:26,519
sort of specific to the strains that you

595
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:29,100
were looking at or is that something

596
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:33,379
that can be more applied broadly

597
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,379
yeah so that was an aspect of my field

598
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,240
a minute as best we can

599
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:41,699
um and and each year it gets better and

600
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:45,900
better you know making acres and Acres

601
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:47,340
just right absolutely takes time

602
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,360
um but no that that's certainly an

603
00:25:47,339 --> 00:25:53,278
aspect of my plants being uh phosphorus

604
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:57,058
deficient

605
00:25:53,278 --> 00:26:00,000
um and so that showed up it certainly

606
00:25:57,058 --> 00:26:02,399
showed up it shows up on my uh my

607
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,220
Elemental Leaf tests it shows up in the

608
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,259
the soil tests and this absolutely

609
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,380
concluded that

610
00:26:07,259 --> 00:26:12,119
got it so okay

611
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:14,520
um and so

612
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:16,739
I guess kind of in general

613
00:26:14,519 --> 00:26:18,778
is there anything that stood out to you

614
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:20,640
or really surprised you

615
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,940
um with the data that you collected with

616
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,940
this project

617
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:29,940
yeah the the the phosphorus aspect that

618
00:26:27,058 --> 00:26:34,200
was that was something else you know uh

619
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:37,080
when when the lycor team told me this I

620
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,840
was like well that's probably right but

621
00:26:37,079 --> 00:26:41,699
you know I I need to jump back into the

622
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:43,500
literature you know it's been a long

623
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,440
time since I've had to sit down and

624
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,740
remember all of the pathways

625
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:52,440
um for photosynthesis and you know why

626
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:53,819
you know put together the pieces of you

627
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,580
know

628
00:26:53,819 --> 00:27:00,058
um phosphate limitation and where that

629
00:26:56,579 --> 00:27:03,240
plugs in in the photosynthesis cycle

630
00:27:00,058 --> 00:27:07,700
um but yeah I mean it once I dug back

631
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,700
into it it absolutely makes sense

632
00:27:08,099 --> 00:27:17,339
so I I can give the uh the the Layman's

633
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:18,240
description of of why why phosphorus in

634
00:27:17,339 --> 00:27:22,199
general

635
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:24,179
is needed to produce good flowers or or

636
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,620
good flowers

637
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:28,080
because

638
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,579
the more photosynthesis the greater

639
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,899
yields

640
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:36,960
um but also just in in general with with

641
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:40,679
a good growing plant

642
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:44,278
um so you know the takeaway there is you

643
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:48,659
think about go back to biology and and

644
00:27:44,278 --> 00:27:50,099
high school or whatnot you know CO2 goes

645
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:52,559
in

646
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:53,879
um the plant deals with that through an

647
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:55,619
enzyme

648
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:58,400
called rubisco

649
00:27:55,619 --> 00:28:01,379
from there it's converted to sugar

650
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:04,038
to do this sugar conversion process

651
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:08,580
there has to be a phosphate attached

652
00:28:04,038 --> 00:28:12,119
well if the phosphate is not there

653
00:28:08,579 --> 00:28:13,918
the plant is continuing to bring in CO2

654
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,918
but there's a backup so there's a

655
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,080
traffic jam and so you know your plant's

656
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:22,500
not getting those sugars that they want

657
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:25,220
to grow and to thrive and so instead

658
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,220
instead of photosynthesis it turns to

659
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:29,220
photorespiration where

660
00:28:29,339 --> 00:28:35,158
um it's not taking up CO2 anymore it's

661
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:38,939
taking up O2 and so O2 plugs in there

662
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:41,820
and basically it it wastes

663
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:44,038
um so the the energy the CO2 is

664
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:45,899
converted to something else

665
00:28:44,038 --> 00:28:48,119
um instead of going through the cycle it

666
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:50,640
won't it should go through which makes

667
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,038
those sugars

668
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,720
so it creates oxygen instead is that

669
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:59,038
what you're saying well it takes up

670
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:02,579
oxygen instead of super two okay yeah so

671
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:05,519
it plugs in there instead of the CO2

672
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:07,740
interesting no and that's I mean again

673
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,179
going back to Layman's biology we're

674
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,620
always taught you know the plant it

675
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,620
takes sunlight and converts it into

676
00:29:10,619 --> 00:29:15,418
energy but you forget that there's other

677
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,278
nutrients that are that need to be

678
00:29:15,419 --> 00:29:19,500
involved to make that process happen too

679
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,119
and that's that's coming from your soil

680
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:23,099
or if you're growing from Hydro the

681
00:29:21,119 --> 00:29:26,278
nutrients that you're adding in there

682
00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:29,339
exactly yeah I mean me as a

683
00:29:26,278 --> 00:29:31,740
non-scientist I've only recently come to

684
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:34,079
that conclusion after attempting to grow

685
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,298
cannabis myself with

686
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:37,500
with so-so results

687
00:29:36,298 --> 00:29:39,538
so

688
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,659
so we started talking about this where

689
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:44,579
you know we were hoping to

690
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:46,559
through this research give some some

691
00:29:44,579 --> 00:29:49,439
practical information to Growers that

692
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:51,359
that they can use so I guess as we're

693
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,538
winding down what are some of those

694
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,379
things that they can apply based on on

695
00:29:54,538 --> 00:29:57,379
what you've learned here

696
00:30:00,558 --> 00:30:04,859
understanding

697
00:30:02,278 --> 00:30:08,819
everything you do to these plants are

698
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:11,339
inputs and if it's not balanced

699
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:13,500
one input would be a waste all right so

700
00:30:11,339 --> 00:30:15,058
let me give an example of that

701
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,740
if you have a grow room

702
00:30:15,058 --> 00:30:20,819
and

703
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:24,740
everything is perfect except fertilizer

704
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:27,720
say you you have a you have a organic

705
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:29,579
fertilizer you have an organic soil and

706
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,558
maybe you haven't supplemented it

707
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:33,538
properly so you're you're limiting

708
00:30:31,558 --> 00:30:35,158
something well

709
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:37,980
let's say your temperatures are right

710
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:41,399
your humidity is right and you're giving

711
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:44,159
it 1500 parts per million CO2

712
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:45,058
well because of those nutrients being

713
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,580
off

714
00:30:45,058 --> 00:30:49,319
you're basically just wasting your CO2

715
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,960
because

716
00:30:49,319 --> 00:30:54,000
going back to the phosphorus and then

717
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:57,360
there's other processes in the plant

718
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:00,898
that you know it won't be the same cycle

719
00:30:57,359 --> 00:31:03,418
of photosynthesis process and phosphorus

720
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:06,239
processes but there's other processes if

721
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:11,159
you don't have those individual elements

722
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:14,460
um or 16 essential nutrients then all of

723
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:16,559
that CO2 you're adding is just wasted it

724
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,179
might help a little

725
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:24,058
um but levels you know well over ambient

726
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:25,679
like 1500 1800 it's just a wasteful

727
00:31:24,058 --> 00:31:28,200
input

728
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,519
um so understanding that you need all of

729
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,240
these pieces

730
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:36,658
to be optimal to really increase your

731
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,278
yields and and put out a good plant

732
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:40,020
yeah and that comes back to the to the

733
00:31:38,278 --> 00:31:41,759
light too right like you said that's

734
00:31:40,019 --> 00:31:43,918
it's very expensive running these lights

735
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:46,079
especially of course indoors it's what

736
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:48,659
we're talking about but you know and if

737
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,278
that's being wasted and you would

738
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:52,919
actually be better off dialing those

739
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:56,099
back then that's I mean that's a win-win

740
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,799
exactly exactly all right Allison so

741
00:31:56,099 --> 00:32:00,719
again winding down before I let you go I

742
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:02,099
did want to give you a chance to plug

743
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,778
any

744
00:32:02,099 --> 00:32:05,459
um any other Publications you have out

745
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:07,619
there that you want people to to be

746
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:10,319
aware of or check out or any you know

747
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:12,058
social media or websites that people can

748
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:13,740
check out to learn more about you and

749
00:32:12,058 --> 00:32:15,960
the work that you're doing please plug

750
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,798
away

751
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,019
hello

757
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:34,678
um it's Dr dot Justice underscore grows

758
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:37,558
um I usually at least give some sort of

759
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:40,019
reference to to new work we put out

760
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:43,798
and then of course we'd love to have you

761
00:32:40,019 --> 00:32:47,519
join the CRC the Cannabis research

762
00:32:43,798 --> 00:32:51,418
Coalition this is a a farmer industry

763
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:55,200
funded group to support the hemp mine

764
00:32:51,419 --> 00:32:57,240
and Clemson University put out

765
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,659
um really important grower relevant

766
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:03,298
research so nothing we we may include

767
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,120
neat tools like this in our research but

768
00:33:03,298 --> 00:33:09,298
our goal is to then take that research

769
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:12,479
and and put it to something that can be

770
00:33:09,298 --> 00:33:13,980
immediately used by The Growers so

771
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,120
um you know everything from looking at

772
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:20,220
different types of oxen for rooting to

773
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,678
understanding well you know with a

774
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:27,058
certain variety what happens if instead

775
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,519
of being just 12 12 you move to 13 hours

776
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:32,819
of flight you know that's one extra hour

777
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,819
of all of those photons you know

778
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:38,460
you know how can that benefit you

779
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:40,619
um so research like that that's that's

780
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,200
extremely relevant

781
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:45,658
um we have a website we just Google

782
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,220
cannabis research Coalition and it'll

783
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,440
pop right up

784
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,659
excellent yeah I'd love the CRC and

785
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,720
hoping to see a good representation from

786
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:56,820
the group uh at can Med absolutely we'll

787
