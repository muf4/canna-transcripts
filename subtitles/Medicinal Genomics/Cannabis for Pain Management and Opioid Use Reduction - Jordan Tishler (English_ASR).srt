1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:12,359
hi guys thank you all for coming my name

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:15,368
is Jorden Tischler I'm a physician and

3
00:00:12,359 --> 00:00:18,570
I'm here to talk to you guys a little

4
00:00:15,368 --> 00:00:21,879
bit about pain management and

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,469
consequentially reducing opiates I'd

6
00:00:21,879 --> 00:00:25,299
like to take a moment to thank you all

7
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,948
for coming I think one of the things

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:32,140
that I've gotten out of this conference

9
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:35,020
in spades today has been the vast number

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,530
of interested folks and the astounding

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,090
amount of research and development

12
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:44,230
that's being done and I think it really

13
00:00:40,090 --> 00:00:45,879
warms my heart as a clinician and I

14
00:00:44,229 --> 00:00:49,628
would also like to take a moment to

15
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:52,719
thank courtesan and medicinal genomics

16
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:58,189
for putting on this kind of an event

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:01,439
[Applause]

18
00:00:58,189 --> 00:01:04,259
so I you know to take a few seconds just

19
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:07,798
to explain Who I am and why I'm here in

20
00:01:04,259 --> 00:01:09,450
blathering at you I am a Harvard

21
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,430
physician I trained in internal medicine

22
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:12,810
at the Brigham Women's Hospital which I

23
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:15,539
think is that way from here but I'm a

24
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:17,609
little turned around and then spent the

25
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:20,340
last 15 years or so working as an

26
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:23,879
emergency physician for the VA and so as

27
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:27,390
you can imagine I became de facto a bit

28
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:30,140
of an expert on drug and alcohol at

29
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,239
least the acute presentation of that and

30
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:35,759
really came to see an awful lot of

31
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:38,459
damage done by by subjects both legal

32
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,978
and illegal and that got me to thinking

33
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:45,209
about cannabis is a safer kind of

34
00:01:40,978 --> 00:01:47,310
medication to treat patients so my talk

35
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:48,689
today is going to be a little different

36
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,269
in that I'm actually going to focus

37
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,429
almost exclusively on clinical matters

38
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:58,379
rather than on research because that's

39
00:01:53,429 --> 00:02:00,269
what I know so pain is a huge problem

40
00:01:58,379 --> 00:02:01,828
I'm not sure why I'm staring at this

41
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:04,560
thing and there's a monitor here but

42
00:02:01,828 --> 00:02:10,379
pain is the number one presenting

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,180
complaint nationally and pain is the

44
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,109
number one complaint that patients say

45
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:18,569
we don't address well so this is a huge

46
00:02:16,109 --> 00:02:20,189
problem and I think one of the things

47
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:22,739
that stems from that that we have to

48
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:25,439
understand as clinicians and as

49
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:28,170
researchers is the problems that we're

50
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:31,439
seeing nationally and even globally with

51
00:02:28,169 --> 00:02:34,949
opiate use are really a demand-side

52
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:38,310
problem right right now we have all of

53
00:02:34,949 --> 00:02:40,108
these governmental missives that say we

54
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,819
should prescribe less and doctors you'll

55
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,100
be held more accountable and you need to

56
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:46,439
look at the PMP and all this stuff and

57
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,599
that's fine band-aids but really the

58
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:50,939
problem here is that we don't have a

59
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,979
particularly good way to meet the demand

60
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:57,000
in a safe and effective manner

61
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:59,159
so enter cannabis we need to understand

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,829
the scope of the problem as I said our

63
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:05,069
current approaches don't work that well

64
00:03:01,829 --> 00:03:06,659
when you look at drug overdoses the

65
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:08,069
current statistics are they kill more

66
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:09,930
people than garz

67
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,620
guns cars and

68
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:15,659
Halling and interestingly we have this

69
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,569
opiate crisis that we're addressing with

70
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,870
major public health initiatives but some

71
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:27,959
of these things I think might well also

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:30,209
qualify when we break it down the

73
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:33,539
problem here is that we only have three

74
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:35,670
alternatives right there are three drug

75
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,408
classes that we can use to address pain

76
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:39,388
unless of course you look at the

77
00:03:37,408 --> 00:03:40,858
Massachusetts DPH silly initiative where

78
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,150
they list in things like sliced inner

79
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,400
pearl which is a blood pressure

80
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,158
medication but really when it comes down

81
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,870
to it we're talking about Tylenol right

82
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:50,489
which is in a class by itself and we all

83
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:52,500
know what that is good for it's good for

84
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:54,989
some things but it also is not good for

85
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,329
other things and it has some attendant

86
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:59,099
risk there are nonsteroidal

87
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:02,549
anti-inflammatory medications like

88
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:04,979
ibuprofen right or Naprosyn which work

89
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:07,379
well for certain things and also come

90
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:09,358
with certain risks of GI bleeding or

91
00:04:07,378 --> 00:04:10,590
renal failure and those sorts of things

92
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:12,389
and not appropriate for all

93
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,209
circumstances and then what's left

94
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:18,989
opiates that's it that's all we got

95
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:21,569
right so we're kind of stuck unless we

96
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:23,189
start to talk about cannabis and then

97
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,860
the question is alright well you know

98
00:04:23,189 --> 00:04:27,839
what do we know about opiates well it

99
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,720
turns out that opiates have been with us

100
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,339
for so long that they haven't been

101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,590
wonderfully well studied particularly

102
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,448
when it comes to chronic pain and so in

103
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:39,060
the last two three years we finally in

104
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,470
the setting of this declared crisis got

105
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,180
around to looking at these things it

106
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:44,880
turns out that opiates aren't that great

107
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,340
for chronic pain and they come with all

108
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:48,959
sorts of side effects you know from you

109
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:50,819
know the obvious addiction issues but

110
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:52,168
how about just constipation anybody

111
00:04:50,819 --> 00:04:53,550
watch on television and there's now a

112
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:54,658
drug out that you can take so you don't

113
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,728
get constipated while you check your

114
00:04:54,658 --> 00:04:59,519
opiates it's it reminds me of a

115
00:04:56,728 --> 00:05:04,199
children's rhyme but this is what we

116
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:05,549
where we are right and opiates are

117
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:07,379
dangerous duh

118
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:10,408
okay I don't know about you but I've

119
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:12,329
known that forever I have had a long

120
00:05:10,408 --> 00:05:14,490
reputation of being pretty stingy with

121
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:16,560
opiates and getting in a lot of trouble

122
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,750
in the early 2000s with my superiors

123
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,028
because you remember we had these groups

124
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:22,709
come in and talk about you know pains

125
00:05:21,028 --> 00:05:24,629
the fifth vital sign and nobody

126
00:05:22,709 --> 00:05:26,009
can come into the IDI without being

127
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:28,920
interviewed about their level of pain

128
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:31,110
and exit interviewed about whether they

129
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,910
were adequately a you know the pain was

130
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:34,139
adequately addressed and stuff and that

131
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:36,180
put a lot of pressure on us to write

132
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:40,019
more scripts and surprising not

133
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,449
surprisingly we did okay what we know

134
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:47,219
now is that when you look at the number

135
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:49,319
needed to harm it's only 3333 patients

136
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,120
one in 33 patients walking into your IDI

137
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,920
you write a prescription they're gonna

138
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,100
have trouble they're gonna either become

139
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:59,879
addicted or worse yet die so not such a

140
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:02,250
great idea let me call you about a

141
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:03,810
success story this is Theresa well

142
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,300
actually it isn't Theresa it's not her

143
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:11,209
name is not her photo but oops

144
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,590
we'll talk about go backwards please

145
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:16,549
excellent wonderful slide but anyway

146
00:06:13,589 --> 00:06:20,459
let's talk about Theresa there she is

147
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:23,939
Theresa whom I met in my clinic about

148
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:25,259
two years ago maybe two and a half it

149
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,420
really wants to show you then the

150
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,829
cannabinoid system but we'll leave it

151
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:34,040
there and maybe it'll stay 42 years at

152
00:06:31,829 --> 00:06:38,219
the time that I met her she's a

153
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:40,560
high-powered local attorney and she had

154
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,800
had the misfortune of having a car

155
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,189
accident and after the car accident she

156
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,930
developed two long-term consequences one

157
00:06:47,189 --> 00:06:51,300
was she ended up with this weird seizure

158
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,530
pseudo seizure thing that was going on

159
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,449
and nobody could quite put their finger

160
00:06:52,529 --> 00:06:56,219
on what that was all about and the other

161
00:06:54,449 --> 00:06:58,769
thing not surprising that she had a lot

162
00:06:56,220 --> 00:07:01,500
of musculoskeletal damage and so she was

163
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:03,750
in a lot of pain so by the time I met

164
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,180
her she was at her wits end she had

165
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:08,579
taken time from her high-powered job at

166
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:13,230
great cost to her financially as well as

167
00:07:08,579 --> 00:07:16,199
emotionally and she was on a serious

168
00:07:13,230 --> 00:07:18,540
handful of oxycodone percocet everyday

169
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:21,029
and tramadol which is a drug I really

170
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:22,710
disliked and she was being followed by

171
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,079
her primary care doctor and neurologist

172
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:27,569
and a pain specialist and none of them

173
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:29,909
knew what to do next with her nor did

174
00:07:27,569 --> 00:07:32,519
they know how to get her off the opiates

175
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,740
because she was in so much pain but on

176
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:36,240
the other hand she was really suffering

177
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,250
from the side effects of

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,129
opiates as well then to make matters

179
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,829
worse this poor lady she had two young

180
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:45,978
teenage daughters the elder was an honor

181
00:07:43,829 --> 00:07:49,050
student whose grades started to fall off

182
00:07:45,978 --> 00:07:52,500
she ended up the daughter ended up

183
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:53,759
starting to use illegal substances and

184
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,500
the younger daughter developed an

185
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,169
anxiety disorder which then manifest

186
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,300
itself and in suicidality and ended up

187
00:07:58,168 --> 00:08:01,379
having to be admitted to a local

188
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:04,319
pediatric psych office psychiatry

189
00:08:01,379 --> 00:08:07,819
facility so life was not good when I met

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:10,889
this woman and what we were able to do

191
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:14,069
was to treat her pain and we treated her

192
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,740
pain with a mixture of cannabis through

193
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:18,689
various preparations and so I'm gonna

194
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,598
come back to this a bunch of times but I

195
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:24,269
like to think of these things in you

196
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:29,158
know the rubric that's were the analogy

197
00:08:24,269 --> 00:08:30,538
to the way we use opiates and it's an

198
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:32,549
uncomfortable analogy because we're

199
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:34,439
trying to avoid opiates by the way we're

200
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:36,478
taught to think about these things is

201
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,630
that we use a long-acting form of opiate

202
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,690
to get baseline coverage and then we use

203
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:44,669
a short-acting form of opiate to deal

204
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:46,589
with breakthrough pain if there is any

205
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:48,539
on a daily basis and so when you think

206
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,770
about cannabis and we've certainly heard

207
00:08:48,539 --> 00:08:52,349
lots and lots about different

208
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:53,519
preparations and ways to use what we

209
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,920
know is that anything that you take

210
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,199
orally gets metabolized by the liver and

211
00:08:55,919 --> 00:09:00,028
has a much longer half-life it's also a

212
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,940
little bit erratic and it's onset so

213
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:05,250
that potential some problems and then

214
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,649
inhaled has a rapid onset in a

215
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:09,899
relatively short half-life so that that

216
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:12,179
works well in in that immediate sense

217
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:14,700
and over the next six months we were

218
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:17,609
able to titrate this to the point at

219
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,399
which she was no longer in pain she was

220
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:22,200
no longer in pain her mood came back she

221
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,789
was able to address family matters and

222
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,220
get her children the help that they

223
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:27,419
needed and ultimately the interesting

224
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,070
thing was even though her other

225
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:32,189
physicians were uncomfortable with the

226
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,839
idea of titrating down her opiates for

227
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,459
reasons that I couldn't understand even

228
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,860
after having multiple conversations with

229
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:39,659
them patient just did it herself she's

230
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,209
like look I feel okay I'm using the

231
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:43,828
cannabis so she slowly weaned off the

232
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:47,278
tram at all and the next came off the

233
00:09:43,828 --> 00:09:48,939
percocet and at at 12 months she was

234
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:50,980
opiate free and

235
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,840
her family was back on track and I've

236
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,789
been following her since and she's had

237
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,560
some ups and downs but the the principal

238
00:09:54,789 --> 00:09:59,829
is there and the success rate I think is

239
00:09:56,559 --> 00:10:01,809
is pretty good so that's that's it in

240
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,300
sort of the nutshell the the success

241
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:06,309
story and I'm gonna now move on to this

242
00:10:04,299 --> 00:10:08,229
slide about the endocannabinoids system

243
00:10:06,309 --> 00:10:09,309
and really basically whizzed past it

244
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:10,870
because you guys have heard so much

245
00:10:09,309 --> 00:10:12,339
about the endocannabinoids system in the

246
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,370
last two days that there's really not

247
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:18,220
much for me to say so we know that it's

248
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:20,190
a complex signaling pathway that it has

249
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,200
both receptor and non receptor mediated

250
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:26,050
ways of functioning and interestingly

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:28,090
enough this what I haven't heard a lot

252
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:29,409
of discussion so far is the ways in

253
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:32,019
which the endocannabinoids system

254
00:10:29,409 --> 00:10:34,689
interact with our inflammatory system

255
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,069
around the prostaglandins and cytokines

256
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:38,290
that are also involved in pain

257
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:41,790
perception did you mention that

258
00:10:38,289 --> 00:10:41,789
yesterday okay

259
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:49,360
so there are interesting bits about the

260
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:51,759
way the ECS works it it works both

261
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,590
peripherally and centrally there's all

262
00:10:51,759 --> 00:10:55,710
kinds of really interesting data coming

263
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:59,980
out now about its peripheral function

264
00:10:55,710 --> 00:11:02,080
this slide basically shows us that it's

265
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,659
they feet and negative feedback loops so

266
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:06,820
that when these neurotransmitters

267
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:10,659
stimulate the postsynaptic cell then we

268
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:12,970
get secretion of the endocannabinoids

269
00:11:10,659 --> 00:11:16,089
typically in and amide which complex

270
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,330
then with cb1 and shut down the calcium

271
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:22,210
influx channels thus shutting off this

272
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,950
release of neurotransmitter but I think

273
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:26,740
you know that's fairly well understood

274
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:29,550
at this point but the interesting bit

275
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:32,519
about this is that we also get into

276
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:35,588
paracrine meaning secretion of

277
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,529
endocannabinoids from non neuronal

278
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,170
tissue that are involved in supporting

279
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:45,299
the neural tissue and then we also get

280
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:47,500
come on slide paracrine we'll come back

281
00:11:45,299 --> 00:11:51,669
I'm really having trouble with those

282
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:54,309
slides today apparently so paracrine

283
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,289
function that affects inflammatory cells

284
00:11:54,309 --> 00:11:58,269
that are also involved particularly in

285
00:11:56,289 --> 00:12:00,730
tissue damage like histiocytes and

286
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:02,559
macrophages so there is a ton of

287
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:04,980
processing going on all

288
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:11,349
at all levels throughout this system

289
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:15,519
here in the central nervous system we

290
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:16,930
know that pain pain systems work both in

291
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,549
an a sending meaning it's going up to

292
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:20,828
your brain right but there's

293
00:12:18,549 --> 00:12:24,068
interestingly a shutoff system where the

294
00:12:20,828 --> 00:12:26,078
pain systems trigger down again to turn

295
00:12:24,068 --> 00:12:30,899
off some of this and to prevent a

296
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:33,399
runaway cycle and we know that there are

297
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:35,318
there's more processing going on there

298
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:37,659
than we previously thought and that

299
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:41,979
there are these neurons in the spinal

300
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:45,219
column essentially here where the opioid

301
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:47,499
receptor works and that the cb1 receptor

302
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,910
is tightly complex to that new receptor

303
00:12:47,499 --> 00:12:56,379
there and again is involved in signals

304
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:59,049
that then dampen this feedback loop is

305
00:12:56,379 --> 00:13:02,438
this even worth mentioning nope okay

306
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:04,929
back to the practical stuff there are

307
00:13:02,438 --> 00:13:07,419
many many ways that we can use cannabis

308
00:13:04,929 --> 00:13:09,698
as we've heard so much about in the

309
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,838
clinical encounters I typically start by

310
00:13:09,698 --> 00:13:12,789
talking about smoking

311
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,490
not because I recommend it I really

312
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:18,818
don't for obvious pulmonary health

313
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:22,919
issues but people understand what I wear

314
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:26,289
I'm starting alright a little mood music

315
00:13:22,919 --> 00:13:29,889
so typically I will recommend that we

316
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:33,009
move on to vaporizing vaporizing avoids

317
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:35,589
products of combustion but it provides

318
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:37,959
an easy repeatable dosing framework

319
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:39,490
based on what I call puffs or you might

320
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:45,099
all call hits although I think that

321
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:47,379
slang is a little painted and it has the

322
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,870
following benefits its rapid onset right

323
00:13:47,379 --> 00:13:52,629
you get effects from it within five to

324
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,428
ten minutes and also it doesn't last

325
00:13:52,629 --> 00:13:55,990
that long which in many instances is

326
00:13:54,428 --> 00:13:58,360
actually a benefit so we're talking

327
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:59,769
about pain today but in many instances

328
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,649
where I'm treating something that's more

329
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:04,269
like anxiety and depression it's nice to

330
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:07,539
have something that has kind of a medium

331
00:14:04,269 --> 00:14:11,409
duration then we get into things that

332
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,328
you can take by mouth right and it turns

333
00:14:11,409 --> 00:14:16,208
out when you look at some of the

334
00:14:13,328 --> 00:14:17,919
bioavailability studies that

335
00:14:16,208 --> 00:14:21,458
is one of the places where the stoners

336
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:24,490
got it right you know that when you take

337
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:26,049
cannabis in an oil form or as a solid

338
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,759
form or those sorts of things it's

339
00:14:26,049 --> 00:14:30,399
really poorly absorbed you get about 30

340
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:33,159
percent absorption whereas if you take

341
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:35,379
it in a brownie you get about 60 percent

342
00:14:33,159 --> 00:14:37,868
or one percent better it's still not

343
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:41,289
great bioavailability and that really

344
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:44,199
impacts how how we treat people and the

345
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:46,480
doses that they can take but we also

346
00:14:44,198 --> 00:14:48,878
have to remember that patients are not

347
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,999
just whatever problem you're looking at

348
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:55,659
patients are complex organisms just like

349
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:57,399
you and me where we need to remember the

350
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:00,399
whole person right we're doing this in

351
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:01,869
part as holistic medicine and so I have

352
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,808
all these patients that come to me and

353
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:06,959
they are elderly and they're obese or

354
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:09,909
they have type 2 diabetes

355
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:13,359
yesterday last night no last week I saw

356
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,669
a young woman 31 years old had been a

357
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,220
type 1 diabetic since she was 18 months

358
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:20,998
she was telling me that her blood out a

359
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:24,759
1 C level which is a measure of her

360
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:27,278
glucose control is was 8.9 and that was

361
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:28,928
the best that she's ever seen and I just

362
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:32,139
marveled that because that's all not a

363
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:34,438
very good number so clearly and she came

364
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:36,610
to me for intractable facial pain

365
00:15:34,438 --> 00:15:37,990
clearly I was not going to go tell her

366
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:40,688
take 2 brownies and call me in the

367
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:43,419
morning right so we have to work out

368
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:44,740
something else there I'm gonna skip a

369
00:15:43,419 --> 00:15:46,719
lot of these other things I think you've

370
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:50,740
heard a lot about them except to mention

371
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,048
this guy I think that that oil based

372
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:55,808
vaporizer pens probably ought to burn in

373
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:57,730
hell because they are filled with all

374
00:15:55,808 --> 00:15:59,889
kinds of nasty things like polyethylene

375
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:02,019
glycol or propylene glycol which are

376
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,698
dangerous and the last thing we want is

377
00:16:02,019 --> 00:16:05,619
to treat somebody's pain and then have

378
00:16:03,698 --> 00:16:09,998
them have a lung transplant because you

379
00:16:05,619 --> 00:16:12,939
know we gave them popcorn low alright

380
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:15,129
what's next which one is right for you

381
00:16:12,938 --> 00:16:18,509
this is a graphic pulled from the

382
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:22,259
internet apologies to its creator but

383
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:25,089
just the question is framing the wrong

384
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:27,579
discussion right the issue here is not

385
00:16:25,089 --> 00:16:29,169
which one is right for you it's how do

386
00:16:27,578 --> 00:16:29,739
we use these things properly

387
00:16:29,168 --> 00:16:32,649
it's

388
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:36,700
not either/or it's complimentary right

389
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:38,590
again I've slipped into dr. speak here I

390
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:41,790
hope that if people under Pio means um

391
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:46,889
by mouth and so this is our long-acting

392
00:16:41,789 --> 00:16:46,889
and then inhaled is a rapid onset

393
00:16:48,389 --> 00:16:52,720
checking my time here and you know this

394
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,599
was where I wanted to mention my

395
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,430
diabetic patient but the point is I see

396
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,350
this time and again I see this

397
00:16:57,429 --> 00:17:02,409
unfortunately we've heard from a few

398
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:05,319
speakers this this week about the

399
00:17:02,409 --> 00:17:07,089
dispensaries misguiding people and i see

400
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:09,429
this a lot in my practice and one of the

401
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:11,859
areas where that comes up is that they

402
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:14,140
don't know medicine they don't know the

403
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:16,479
patient's problems so they may I may

404
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,880
send a patient into gets a capsules of

405
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,579
something and then they say well you

406
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,630
know the yeah sure here buy some

407
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:24,429
capsules but don't you want the

408
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:26,320
chocolate bars too they're so yummy and

409
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:28,299
then the patient goes home and their

410
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,919
blood sugar spikes and cetera et cetera

411
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:31,919
so we need to remember the whole patient

412
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:41,529
we've also heard a lot about dosing and

413
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:44,379
I think dosing is really crucial what we

414
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:46,149
know is that you start to get benefit as

415
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:48,100
you increase the dose and that's not

416
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:50,290
really a surprise but what is more of a

417
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:53,469
surprise is that you turn a corner at

418
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,389
some certain dose and at that point you

419
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:57,009
get much you don't really get any more

420
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:59,350
benefit but you certainly get more side

421
00:17:57,009 --> 00:18:01,660
effect in risk right so these side

422
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,129
effects may be as minor as dry mouth

423
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:04,690
which is something I can attest you at

424
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:08,860
the moment not from cannabis but from

425
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,120
speaking but you also get things

426
00:18:08,859 --> 00:18:12,579
particularly in the elderly like

427
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:15,699
orthostatic hypotension which can be can

428
00:18:12,579 --> 00:18:17,439
lead to false and such like that as well

429
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:19,960
as obviously increasing tolerance over

430
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,140
time so there are reasons why we do not

431
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:25,990
want to push too far past this in my

432
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,110
practice what I have found is that a

433
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:31,150
dose around 10 to 15 milligrams

434
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,029
sometimes up to 20 and I've guessed this

435
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:39,640
is milligrams of THC component in whole

436
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:41,230
flower product or whole flower really

437
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,850
seems to be the sweet spot for almost

438
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,110
the entire population

439
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,879
what is interesting to me and this has

440
00:18:46,109 --> 00:18:49,199
been mentioned by other speakers is that

441
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,639
there are really two populations that

442
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:53,069
come in there are the cannabis naive

443
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:55,918
folks I've never touched this stuff or I

444
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:59,009
or I used it you know in the 60s when I

445
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,750
was 20 and now I'm 75 and then there's

446
00:18:59,009 --> 00:19:02,369
this other group which is sort of the

447
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:04,169
smaller group in my practice at this

448
00:19:02,369 --> 00:19:08,308
point which are people who are coming to

449
00:19:04,169 --> 00:19:13,110
me already using and wanting to either

450
00:19:08,308 --> 00:19:15,148
become legit or they really have

451
00:19:13,109 --> 00:19:17,428
realized that there's needs for best

452
00:19:15,148 --> 00:19:19,829
practices for them and I find that that

453
00:19:17,429 --> 00:19:21,509
group is comes in usually using way more

454
00:19:19,829 --> 00:19:23,898
than I would recommend to them and then

455
00:19:21,509 --> 00:19:26,398
that becomes a much more I think

456
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:29,250
difficult discussion to try and get them

457
00:19:26,398 --> 00:19:31,589
to sort of Ratchet it back and when they

458
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,359
do if they are willing to play ball I

459
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,888
find they get much better benefit they

460
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,109
come back to me say doc Wow

461
00:19:34,888 --> 00:19:39,329
I feel so much better and I'm taking so

462
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:43,319
much less and I'm saving money I'm like

463
00:19:39,329 --> 00:19:45,928
yeah exactly I told you so this is the

464
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:53,538
goal and what's not the goal is this

465
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:53,538
grandma doing bong rips okay yep

466
00:19:55,890 --> 00:20:02,660
so assuming that this actually yep oh

467
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:05,490
come back

468
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,900
alright well on here is how you reach me

469
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:09,720
if you want to ask me questions I'm more

470
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:13,140
than happy to go over any of this stuff

471
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:16,730
with you guys and somewhere up there was

472
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,730
supposed to be the list of references

473
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,859
all right

474
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:24,960
forward one references so if you want a

475
00:20:22,859 --> 00:20:27,329
photograph that you can go that that

476
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,799
link and find all manner of stuff that

477
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:32,240
supports what I actually just talked

478
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,240
about thank you all for listening

479
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:39,419
you
