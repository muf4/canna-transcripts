2021 presentation

53
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,239
will explore the biochemical processes

54
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:09,439
the cannabis plant uses to create

55
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,239
cannabinoids

56
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,000
and how each cultivar's unique genetics

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,920
plays a role

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,719
topics we hit on the conversation

59
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:21,679
include the problems cannabis and hemp

60
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,199
growers are trying to solve via genetics

61
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,439
how lighting in temperature

62
00:02:23,199 --> 00:02:26,238
influences gene expression in cannabis

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,079
plants

64
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
and the cannabinoids and terpenes they

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,640
produce the potential for minor

66
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:34,318
cannabinoids to become more dominant in

67
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,399
future cultivars

68
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,839
and just how far behind cannabis

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,879
genomics research is

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,400
when compared to other crops before we

71
00:02:40,878 --> 00:02:44,159
get to that conversation

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,280
i do want to thank this episode's

73
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,840

and a forum for in-depth exploration of

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,400
issues

78
00:02:55,919 --> 00:03:00,799
important to both scientists and the

79
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,959
science curious public

80
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,280
we tell life science stories that

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,000
researchers and science enthusiasts

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,039

[Music]

105
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,519
hey jordan thanks for joining us here on

106
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,079
the on the podcast how are you doing

107
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,359
today

108
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:59,279
i'm doing pretty good thanks for having

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
me excellent and we're

110
00:04:59,279 --> 00:05:03,198
we're really excited to have you this

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,879
year at canmed 2020. now is this going

112
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,478
to be the first candid that you attended

113
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,319
this will be my first candid that's

114
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:08,719
right um and i hadn't even heard about

115
00:05:08,319 --> 00:05:10,879
it

116
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
until you know last year i was at a

117
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,759
conference

118
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,600
um where kevin gave a talk kevin

119
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,759
mckiernan your cso

120
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,960
um and it was promoting it pretty hard i

121
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:20,479
looked into it and yeah it definitely

122
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:22,719
looked like a conference that uh

123
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,519
i'd be interested in going to the future

124
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,199
and

125
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,359
what do i know you guys asked me to

126
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,280
present so i'm very pleased to join

127
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,319
canva this year

128
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:34,719
yeah we're excited um especially since

129
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:35,519
your your focus is very similar to ours

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,160
so you're

131
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:40,639
very much investigating the genomics and

132
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
the genetics of the cannabis plant and

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,319
why i'm really excited to talk to you is

134
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,679
because you're actually applying that

135
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,599
genomic information and

136
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,879
actually applying it to the plant you

137
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,560
know us here at medicinal genomics

138
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,560
we're sequencing the plant finding all

139
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,038
sorts of interesting markers and

140
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,319
interesting insights into the plant but

141
00:05:57,038 --> 00:05:59,839
we don't we don't grow here

142
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,520
so we don't really get to apply it so

143
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:02,719
i'm always interested to talk to folks

144
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,000
who are actually

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,360
working with the plants um

146
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,879
i don't know if you want to give a

147
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,520
little insight into what you guys are

148
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,478
doing there

149
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,120
at dewey scientific yeah so dewey

150
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:16,879
scientific

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,280
um first and foremost we are a

152
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:21,519
biotechnology company focused on

153
00:06:19,279 --> 00:06:23,279
bettering the cannabis industry

154
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:25,918
and we're doing that through a couple of

155
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,318
of ways the first is through our

156
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,719
scientific service offerings so what we

157
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,240
do there is we sort of offer

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,560
cultivators or other breeders

159
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,840
um a science team you know if you look

160
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,199
at some of the bigger companies they're

161
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,560
starting to swallow up

162
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,478
um scientists but not every cannabis

163
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
company can afford to do that so we sort

164
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,680
of

165
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,959
uh offer you know we have a traveling

166
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
team of scientists that will

167
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,279
will uh come to you and collect the data

168
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,399
we need and then do all the data

169
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:56,959
analysis here and sort of

170
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:00,478
make sense of you know the overwhelming

171
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:01,758
amount of data that genomics can provide

172
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:03,839
and the second aspect of what we're

173
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,400
doing is we have uh an in-house breeding

174
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:06,719
program

175
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,000
with um with one of our very close

176
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:12,639
partners actually so dewey scientific

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:16,800
we don't grow the plants ourselves we

178
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,478
just have very close partners that do um

179
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,038
and for them you know we have a

180
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,038
quantitative geneticist part of our team

181
00:07:21,038 --> 00:07:26,560
actually our co-founder and uh

182
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,360
vp of research paul mahalov he

183
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,680
he's our breeder and he you know can

184
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,000
really

185
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,038
make sense of you know a vcf file while

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,360
not everybody really

187
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,879
necessarily know what that means um it's

188
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
it's you know the variants that are

189
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,560
present in a genome so he

190
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,680
he's has a lot of experiences with using

191
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,918
that kind of data

192
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,319
and applying it to breeding for specific

193
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:48,478
traits

194
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,439
excellent so when a client engages with

195
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:51,279
your team

196
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:53,519
what are they really looking to

197
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:56,000
accomplish or do they even know

198
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:57,038
um yeah i think for the most part they

199
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,918
do know what they're looking for

200
00:07:57,038 --> 00:07:58,959
accomplish

201
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:01,198
to accomplish they just don't

202
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,439
necessarily have to get there

203
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,080
so for example we've worked with some

204
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:09,439
some cultivators in the hemp space

205
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,878
and last year we we helped them identify

206
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
when they should be harvesting

207
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,160
you know if you wait too long all of a

208
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,440
sudden your compliant half crop

209
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,240
is no longer compliant um and you have

210
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:21,680
to destroy

211
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
your summer's worth of labor um and you

212
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,759
know that

213
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,079
unfortunately that that was the reality

214
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,919
last year for many growers so

215
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:29,918
just knowing knowing the plants are

216
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,439
growing at a better level

217
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,278
can really make the difference for

218
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,200
farmers and that's that's what we've

219
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:36,639
been helping people do

220
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,158
yeah and that's an interesting point you

221
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,679
make because there were there were tons

222
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:41,838
of articles that came out

223
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,879
the end of last year with a lot of hemp

224
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,720
farmers who

225
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,639
suddenly discovered that what they were

226
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,839
growing wasn't technically hemp because

227
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,838
it was it was testing hop or thc so do

228
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,160
you offer some services to

229
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,920
to hemp cultivators who are maybe just

230
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,480
starting it to get into this to make

231
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:58,559
sure that

232
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,920
what they're actually planting is going

233
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:00,879
to be what they expect it to be at the

234
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:03,360
end

235
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,799
yeah that's that's an area that we're

236
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,278
looking to get in

237
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:09,120
um this year we're working with a couple

238
00:09:07,278 --> 00:09:10,559
partners out in the yakima valley area

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,480
of washington state

240
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:14,079
um helping them choose the genetics that

241
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,200
they will be growing this year

242
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:19,200
um and you know more than anything uh

243
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,200
it's it's just sort of doing the leg

244
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,879
work uh and doing the background check

245
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,240
on where the seats coming from or where

246
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:26,639
the clones coming from

247
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,440
is this a fly by night clone provider

248
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:31,360
like we saw

249
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,240
so many last year or do these guys have

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
legitimate coas backing up what they're

251
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,959
claiming to have

252
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:40,640
being sold yeah and unfortunately that

253
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:42,879
seems to be such a

254
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,480
such a trend in the cannabis industry as

255
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,799
these fly-by-nights

256
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,920
uh companies not just clone providers or

257
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,039
seed providers but

258
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:52,799
i mean we see it in our end too um so

259
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,879
it's it's nice to see

260
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:55,838
folks like you out there kind of helping

261
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:57,838
to

262
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:59,519
to weed that out for lack of a better

263
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,600
term um

264
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:03,039
so that's great so yeah i and i guess

265
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,399
the segue to that is

266
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,958
i mean there are other companies out

267
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:09,600
there that are offering similar services

268
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,879
um to what you guys are so kind of what

269
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
sets you apart

270
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,320
so yeah we like to take a slightly

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,440
different approach than most

272
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,920
folks we actually take an rna-based

273
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:23,200
approach towards genomics

274
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:25,759
we prefer this approach because you can

275
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,640
answer many questions with a single data

276
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:30,480
set

277
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,600
um you know because this plant has so

278
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,200
many

279
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
there's so much genetic diversity in

280
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,879
what's out there right now relying on a

281
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:40,000
single reference genome

282
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,439
um can be a little problematic so we we

283
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,839
prefer to take a de novo

284
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,279
transcriptome approach um and so when we

285
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:47,839
take that you know we can still get

286
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:50,159
all the necessary structural genome

287
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:53,040
genomic structural information we need

288
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:54,958
we can identify snips across the the

289
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,559
expressed genome if you will which is

290
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,039
the transcriptome

291
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,879
and then we can look at you know we not

292
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,919
only gain insight into which genes are

293
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:04,958
present but we

294
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:06,879
get insight into how

295
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,000
hard those genes are turned on or turned

296
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,720
off

297
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,839
and this is particularly important when

298
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,839
it comes to cannabinoid or terpenoid

299
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
biosynthesis

300
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,759
so it just gives you a comprehensive

301
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,600
view of what's going on in your growing

302
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:25,439
plants

303
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,040
interesting and that kind of brings me

304
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,279
to one of the things i want to bring up

305
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,759
to you is this whole idea of nature

306
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:33,679
versus nurture

307
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,679
you know you can have all this genetic

308
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,519
potential in a cultivar but you know

309
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:40,078
what environment you put it in

310
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,759
is gonna you know determine what

311
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,838
actually gets expressed so now you're

312
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:44,559
taking an rna-based approach does that

313
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,680
sort of

314
00:11:44,559 --> 00:11:49,599
help sort of weed that out as far as

315
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,359
what's actually being expressed and what

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,480
phenotype you're actually going to see

317
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:56,320
yeah absolutely so that's that's uh one

318
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,600
area of emphasis we're looking to expand

319
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,519
on is

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,120
how are the varieties that you purchased

321
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,679
or the varieties that you

322
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:06,320
uh bred how are they actually performing

323
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,319
in your

324
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:10,799
grow area whether you know you're a hemp

325
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,600
farmer on 50 acres or you're a

326
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:14,958
adult use cannabis producer in a

327
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,720
warehouse

328
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,638
you know we can sort of look at the

329
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,160
genetic performance of your variety

330
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,360
in action that's excellent and now do

331
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:26,000
you have any

332
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,759
any sort of data on that are certain

333
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,440
grow mediums or certain

334
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,039
light sources able to um

335
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,360
well i guess lack of a better term

336
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:37,039
express genes more than others

337
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,039
yeah i wouldn't say we've seen much

338
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,360
difference with grow mediums

339
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,519
nor is that really something that we've

340
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,560
really monitored

341
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,560
but lighting has a huge influence

342
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,559
temperature hasn't has a huge influence

343
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:52,239
so you know if we're talking about

344
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,479
cannabinoid synthases it's really

345
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,879
important um

346
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,920
to know the the temperature and the

347
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:00,399
light influence

348
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,838
um on that the plants are receiving you

349
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,320
know a change in

350
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:06,000
temperature or ph can change the

351
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
function of a cannabinoid

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,440
synthase and when it comes to terpenoid

353
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,720
synthases

354
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:16,399
these are our genes that are

355
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:18,000
highly regulated by light

356
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,078
you know and the type of light that they

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,360
get so you know you could you could have

358
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,479
one variety growing

359
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,680
in a say a grow room uh all with high

360
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
pressure sodium bulbs

361
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:29,120
and you move that over to a grow room

362
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,800
that has leds

363
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,959
well you're changing the light influence

364
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:35,439
and you're more likely than not

365
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,239
changing the terpene profile and sort of

366
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,040
changing the

367
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,440
the chemotype of that plant so it just

368
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,278
can lead to inconsistencies in what

369
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,399
farmers think they're growing and what

370
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,759
they think they're going to end up

371
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,078
producing

372
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,600
now is that strain specific are are

373
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:52,399
certain strains more

374
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,519
sensitive to that than others um not

375
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,799
that we've seen

376
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:59,839
um just terpene expression um

377
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:03,599
in in all plants is just very

378
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:06,639
sensitive to to light um

379
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:10,159
especially the expression of those genes

380
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,600
so what's the preferred light source um

381
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,278
you know we haven't done quite enough

382
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,320
work yet to determine that

383
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:20,320
um but i think it's it's uh

384
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,879
it's more of looking at

385
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,360
the the germplasm collection you have

386
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:26,720
and

387
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,039
and seeing how it's performing in your

388
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,759
your grow setup and whether it's attempt

389
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:34,399
or adult use

390
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,519
okay and you mentioned earlier that you

391
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,320
know cannabis being

392
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,879
so genetically diverse and i always

393
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,800
wonder

394
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,078
you know do we fully understand the full

395
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:47,120
genetic potential of cannabis like

396
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,719
through efforts like yours and continued

397
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
breeding could we end up

398
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,879
kind of seeing cultivars that are

399
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
radically different than what's out

400
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,000
there now

401
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,800
yeah i absolutely think we can see

402
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,039
varieties in cultivars

403
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:02,639
or rice that aren't out there right now

404
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:03,278
you know because the majority of this

405
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
crop was

406
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:08,240
was grown in backyards and basements and

407
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,519
deep in the woods

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,600
for so long you know

409
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,039
we're just a ways off uh compared to

410
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,199
other other crops

411
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,399
um and so to you know fully understand

412
00:15:17,198 --> 00:15:21,439
the genetic potential

413
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,639
i think um you know a concerted effort

414
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,839
needs to be made into

415
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,159
stabilizing these genetics because you

416
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,839
know

417
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,159
when you are well sort of what we did

418
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,920
we do a scientific but we the the

419
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,439
cannabis community as a whole was we we

420
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,719
sort of drove evolution in certain

421
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,399
directions

422
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,000
based on what certain people were

423
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,039
selecting for in various regions

424
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,039
of the country

425
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,720
right and so have you done any research

426
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:55,039
or analysis into sort of land race

427
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:57,519
type strains to see you know without the

428
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,719
the breeder's hand sort of what cannabis

429
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
can become

430
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,160
yeah so we've sort of um we've looked at

431
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,159
a

432
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:05,919
couple of land race varieties one of

433
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:08,159
which was featured in our

434
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:09,039
our plant physiology publication last

435
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,159
year

436
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,919
um it was a variety called mama thai and

437
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:15,919
reportedly this was a variety came

438
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,838
straight from thailand

439
00:16:15,919 --> 00:16:19,599
it was grown in a light deprivation hoop

440
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,279
house most of the plants in there were

441
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,600
about five feet tall

442
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:24,639
but this this mama tie was about eight

443
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,800
feet tall

444
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,799
um and then when we looked at the the

445
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,719
chemo print or the chemotype of the

446
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,679
plant the metabolic fingerprint

447
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,120
um you know it did vary quite a bit from

448
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:37,359
the other varieties it was a lot more

449
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,839
heavy on sesquiterpenes

450
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,000
what the implications are that are i'm

451
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,839
not really sure yet

452
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,159
but it was notably different from the

453
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,519
things that had been

454
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:52,719
you know grown or bred for uh

455
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,519
over here in the u.s interesting

456
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,079
and now we are i mean we all know that

457
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,399
you know thc and cbd are sort of the

458
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,198
dominant cannabinoids that we see in the

459
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,119
in the cultivars that are out there now

460
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:06,959
could and that the other cannabinoids

461
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,678
are very much present at

462
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:11,120
at small kind of trace levels but is

463
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,519
there an opportunity to kind of

464
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,759
flip that script and and kind of see

465
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,199
these minor cannabinoids take a bigger

466
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,119
percentage

467
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,439
i i think so you know i think one area

468
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,279
of interest right now are the variants

469
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,279
um you know so they they just have a

470
00:17:23,279 --> 00:17:28,318
different fatty acid precursor

471
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:32,639
towards cannabinoid biosynthesis

472
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,918
thcv and cbdb

473
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,080
you know i don't think that was really

474
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,200
on anyone's radar in you know

475
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,000
much much past the last five years um so

476
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,080
i think as as breeders start to

477
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
go down that route i mean these are

478
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:47,519
these are stemming from um

479
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
you know they're not cannabinoid

480
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,319
synthases that are responsible for this

481
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,519
difference

482
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:55,279
um it's it's upstream in the

483
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:57,200
you know areas of fatty acid

484
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:58,480
biosynthesis

485
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
so i think it's going to be interesting

486
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,720
to see but i do think you know some of

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,519
the

488
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,880
more minor cannabinoids are going to uh

489
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:08,079
rise in prevalence

490
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,720
in the coming years right um

491
00:18:08,079 --> 00:18:11,759
any predictions as far as what's the

492
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,279
what's going to be the new hot

493
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:16,240
cannabinoid

494
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:17,200
oh man i don't know i think um in terms

495
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,798
of new

496
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:24,640
i think folks need to be

497
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:25,038
careful with what is being described as

498
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,200
new

499
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:31,038
or or where it's found or if it's

500
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,038
even actually produced by the plant and

501
00:18:31,038 --> 00:18:36,879
not an artifact of

502
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:39,440
sample prep or

503
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,880
just a faulty hplc run or something like

504
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,798
that

505
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,400
i don't want to make any predictions on

506
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,119
what the markets are going to

507
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,720
prefer in the future but i do think that

508
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:50,000
as as we learn more about the different

509
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,679
cannabinoids

510
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,240
and maybe start to tie those in with

511
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:57,519
some some clinical studies

512
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,440
about the pharmaco uh kinetics of these

513
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,639
cannabinoids um i think that's

514
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
ultimately what's going to drive what's

515
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,480
hot is

516
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,558
what's coming out of the medical

517
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,599
research yeah

518
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:09,279
and i guess to bring that all back to to

519
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,159
what we're doing here at canmed i think

520
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,558
that's a

521
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,400
a great reason why folks like yourself

522
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,720
and cultivators and

523
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,480
and others in the industry could really

524
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,679
get a lot out of out of coming to the

525
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,519
conferences that

526
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,840
we're going to have a lot of the the

527
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,839
latest research

528
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:28,959
into applying cannabinoids for different

529
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,000
medical conditions so if there is some

530
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,720
breaking research

531
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,558
um on a new minor cannabinoid you'll be

532
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,000
the first to know about it so

533
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,399
it's a good thing you decided to join us

534
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,679
this year

535
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,240
i'm glad i did um and so i want to go

536
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:43,919
back to

537
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,919
you said that you know the cannabis

538
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,080
plant is so far behind

539
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:49,840
other plants in terms of understanding

540
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,079
the genomics

541
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:53,519
i mean if you were to make an analogy

542
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:57,199
how how far behind

543
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,798
are we really you know if

544
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,400
let's make a comparison to american

545
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:05,679
legacy crops like soy or corn or wheat

546
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:08,960
you know they've they've been

547
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:10,720
playing with um you know the the

548
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,880
genomics of these these crops have been

549
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:16,558
known for let's say 30 years

550
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,559
um prior to

551
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,360
when cannabis actually started to get

552
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:24,079
some some you know molecular

553
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:24,798
type of work done on it um you know the

554
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,158
genomes of the

555
00:20:24,798 --> 00:20:27,679
these plants obviously haven't worked

556
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,799
sequence 30 years ago but they were

557
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,640
sequenced you know

558
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:32,079
closer to 20 years ago whereas the first

559
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,520
cannabis variety

560
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:37,599
was sequenced uh about nine years ago

561
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,599
um with a lot more coming up in the last

562
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:41,599
few years

563
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,839
but with all of those crops they've been

564
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,639
genetically stabilized you know you

565
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:48,000
a farmer goes and buys pounds of wheat

566
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,240
seed well they expect that

567
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,839
field to grow uniformly there's not

568
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:55,038
going to be differences in

569
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,918
in height or uh you know club length

570
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,839
um within their batch of seeds whereas

571
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,400
you know with cannabis we just

572
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:03,839
aren't quite there with the genetic

573
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,798
stabilization so

574
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:09,119
it just makes it harder to understand

575
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,400
the genomics of cannabis because of the

576
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,359
the diversity and the lack of

577
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:16,559
stabilization that's occurred

578
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:19,038
well that's interesting and so is

579
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:20,000
the fact that cannabis is so diverse

580
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,960
just because

581
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,880
there hasn't been such a stabilization

582
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
effort or is it something that's

583
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,200
that's unique to the plant um i don't

584
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:31,520
think it's something that's unique to

585
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:34,558
the plant

586
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,839
but i do think that well

587
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:37,839
i think one reason that that

588
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,119
stabilization has not really occurred is

589
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,319
that the plant suffers from

590
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,759
inbreeding depression which is you know

591
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:45,519
a very real threat

592
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,679
towards you know making a stabilized

593
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:49,359
variety

594
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,280
but it's it's been overcome in the past

595
00:21:49,359 --> 00:21:58,399
with other deployed

596
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:59,839
deployed crops but

597
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,679
inbreeding depression i'm not i'm not

598
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,158
familiar with that so that's

599
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,159
that's yeah so it's it's if you uh you

600
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:10,480
know in breed within a family

601
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:11,600
um it's most popularly seen or known

602
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,679
i should say it's not really seen

603
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,798
anymore uh with humans you know

604
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,840
um lineages of royal families from

605
00:22:16,798 --> 00:22:21,359
europe you know there was

606
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:24,000
evidence of well um cousins were made

607
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:25,519
cousins uncles were marrying their

608
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,319
nieces things like that

609
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,879
um led to genetic disorders and genetic

610
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,038
effects

611
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,080
in the their progeny or their their

612
00:22:31,038 --> 00:22:33,679
children

613
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:35,839
and you see the same thing with cannabis

614
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:37,120
and it takes a couple of generations

615
00:22:35,839 --> 00:22:38,639
but you know once you're at the the

616
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,319
point of you know four or five

617
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,679
generations of inbreeding the plant

618
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,359
starts to display

619
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,919
um problems and growth uh in development

620
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:47,439
so

621
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,120
to overcome that in cannabis i mean it's

622
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,120
it's really a numbers game

623
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,918
not every single inbred plant is gonna

624
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:55,918
have these these issues

625
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,080
so it's a matter of doing it enough

626
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,038
within the same family to identify

627
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,359
those that are not suffering from

628
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,558
inbreeding depression

629
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:09,199
wow that's interesting so one of my

630
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,960
questions i was going to ask you is

631
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
i guess to start i mean a lot of

632
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,200
commercial cannabis cultivation now

633
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,158
is done through cloning clonal

634
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,319
propagation

635
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,000
do you ever expect we'll get to a place

636
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:23,038
where we could

637
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:25,279
have stable enough seeds that um

638
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,319
that seed propagation would become the

639
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:27,759
norm

640
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:29,839
it sounds like that would be a challenge

641
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:31,279
with this inbreeding depression now

642
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,918
um you know i think we're starting to

643
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:35,918
see it on the hemp side of things

644
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:38,559
a lot more producers are going from seed

645
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,320
than from clone

646
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:42,000
and yeah i absolutely think we'll get to

647
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:42,879
a point where commercial cannabis are

648
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,798
growing from seed

649
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,159
you know if you're going from from clone

650
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,798
ultimately it comes down to the bottom

651
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,960
line

652
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,240
but you know it's it's my point of view

653
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,278
that um

654
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,880
seed is a much more automatable process

655
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:59,679
than than clones you know um

656
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:01,039
and so there are a lot of hurdles that

657
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,320
need to be cleared

658
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:04,240
but you know i think it's all about

659
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:06,399
genetic stabilization and ensuring that

660
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,599
your crop will grow with uniformity and

661
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:12,400
you can rely on

662
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:13,519
your expected results of that crop you

663
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,559
know that

664
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:16,400
these plants are going to grow in

665
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:17,440
uniform they're all going to have very

666
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,240
similar

667
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,278
chemotype profiles and that they they

668
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,480
are all going to have

669
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:25,679
relatively similar yield numbers

670
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,599
and they're all going to be female for

671
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,000
the most part too right yeah i mean

672
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,319
that's

673
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,440
that was you know a big topic in 2019

674
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:32,960
when people were buying what they

675
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,679
thought were feminized seeds

676
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,798
turns out they weren't um their crops

677
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,880
got pollinated and

678
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:40,558
you know you see a tenfold reduction in

679
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,600
cannabinoid production

680
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:46,879
um and you know i think this year those

681
00:24:43,599 --> 00:24:48,240
uh farmers who learned a lesson last

682
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,039
year they're

683
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,558
absolutely going to look specifically

684
00:24:51,038 --> 00:24:55,440
for feminized seeds from a

685
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,440
reputable source

686
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,879
you know i think the adult use industry

687
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,720
will get there but because of the the

688
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
fragmentation we've seen from state to

689
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,000
state

690
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:08,240
um clones are going to remain prevalent

691
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,319
for the time being

692
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,440
all right so so we talked about what

693
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,158
cannabinoids

694
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:16,240
that breeders and growers might be

695
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,880
interested in selecting for but

696
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,000
are there other genetic markers that you

697
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,120
think could make a

698
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,480
huge impact on cannabis cultivation

699
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,639
yeah i think you know if we we go back

700
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,480
to cannabinoids really quickly it's um

701
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,159
you know a lot of these cannabinoids

702
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,319
synthases are leaky

703
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,400
um so if we can better characterize

704
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,599
those and develop markers

705
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,600
um around those regions of the gene that

706
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,359
may lead to a leaky synthase

707
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:44,798
versus a non-leaky synthase i think that

708
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,719
will go a long way

709
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,200
but outside of cannabinoids you know i

710
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,200
do believe the the metabolic pathways

711
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,960
um that are responsible for other

712
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,840
bioactive compounds that cannabis

713
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,558
produces like the terpenes like the

714
00:25:54,839 --> 00:25:59,199
flavonoids

715
00:25:56,558 --> 00:25:59,839
you know if we can uh design genetic

716
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
markers

717
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,839
based on on the production of those

718
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,519
compounds you know that will

719
00:26:03,839 --> 00:26:06,959
ultimately initially help the the

720
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:10,158
medical field

721
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,519
so so breeders can produce varieties

722
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,159
that are more predictable

723
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:15,679
in their their overall chemotype not

724
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,919
just cannabinoids but

725
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,038
in these other bioactive compounds that

726
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,080
might

727
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,759
might be playing a role in the uh

728
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,798
the medical properties medicinal

729
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,079
properties of cannabis

730
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,158
excellent and this will probably be a

731
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:32,639
great segue into the topic that you're

732
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,600
going to be presenting on at canmed

733
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
which is

734
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:37,519
gene networks underlying cannabinoid and

735
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:40,000
terpenoid accumulation

736
00:26:37,519 --> 00:26:40,798
in cannabis so i was wondering can you

737
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,319
give us a little

738
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:44,079
a little preview of what the folks can

739
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,200
expect yeah

740
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,000
yeah so this my talk is is largely based

741
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,038
around

742
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,798
a paper that we had published in

743
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,759
may of 2019 with the same title as the

744
00:26:54,798 --> 00:26:58,158
talk

745
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,960
but basically um it you know comes down

746
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,440
to that

747
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,558
chemical profiling is currently employed

748
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,640
and it's a

749
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:07,440
is a fairly powerful tool in

750
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,200
differentiating one strain from the next

751
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
but you know if you add genotyping

752
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:14,880
information uh whether that be

753
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,720
you know a static genetic level or at a

754
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,080
transcriptome level

755
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,079
it's just going to increase the

756
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,599
resolution of differentiating one strain

757
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,558
from the next and then that ultimately

758
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:25,599
helps

759
00:27:22,558 --> 00:27:29,200
um you know clinical researchers if if

760
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:31,839
uh with their work you know

761
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,480
is it a certain compound that is uh you

762
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,798
know

763
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
leading to an effect is it is it five

764
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:37,918
compounds is it

765
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,200
uh dozens of compounds that are leading

766
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,000
to an effect

767
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,200
um and really you know with it with this

768
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,480
with this research

769
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:50,798
um we took an approach that's been used

770
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:53,839
um in many a number of crops you know

771
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:57,918
including alfalfa corn and wheat

772
00:27:53,839 --> 00:28:00,398
and it's been been successful

773
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,080
but really you know it just sort of puts

774
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,278
everything into a functional context

775
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:05,439
you know what what what are the

776
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:07,759
functions that are active in the plant

777
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,759
as it's

778
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:11,839
as it's growing and ultimately before

779
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:13,278
it's harvested

780
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,278
excellent no and one of the things you

781
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:15,679
mentioned there that that reminded me

782
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,359
was

783
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,399
when you're talking about sort of the

784
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,759
the different combination of

785
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:21,038
cannabinoids could be used for a

786
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,759
specific treatment

787
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,440
um david miri spoke at last year's

788
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,119
canmed and he was talking about the

789
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,038
research that he's doing in his lab in

790
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,918
israel which is just fascinating

791
00:28:29,038 --> 00:28:33,200
and they were they were finding that um

792
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,120
it was a combination of

793
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:38,399
three cannabinoids that they were using

794
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:40,158
to to treat this specific type of cancer

795
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:41,439
and it was when those three were present

796
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:44,080
that they would see the effect

797
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,000
if you took away any one of them or i

798
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,278
believe if i remember correctly even

799
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,159
added an additional one it did not work

800
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:54,480
so it's pretty fascinating this whole

801
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:58,399
idea of the entourage effect how that

802
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:00,880
actually is is being applied

803
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:02,558
yeah absolutely and you know i think us

804
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:06,159
on the plant side of things

805
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:08,558
um we just need to be uh

806
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,840
more responsible with with what we're

807
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:12,720
putting out there

808
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:14,158
and just so you know users can have a

809
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,480
better idea of what they're

810
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,320
they're consuming um and ultimate and

811
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,640
you know beyond that what researchers

812
00:29:18,319 --> 00:29:21,678
are

813
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,640
actually testing um for you know whether

814
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,840
it's cancer or alzheimer's or epilepsy

815
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
um these types of

816
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:33,038
clinical trials can only benefit from a

817
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:35,119
more precise understanding of what that

818
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:38,398
plant is capable of and what it is

819
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:39,278
actively producing excellent and now you

820
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:41,599
mentioned that you

821
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:42,798
had published a paper on the on that

822
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,918
same topic the one you're going to be

823
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:45,759
discussing at cam

824
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,640
where can folks find that yeah so that's

825
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,119
that's available um at plant

826
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,880
physiology.org

827
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:52,798
um it is an open source paper so you

828
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:55,120
don't have to worry about a uh

829
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:56,798
a pay to read firewall that is common in

830
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:58,359
academic papers

831
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,240
but yeah it's available at

832
00:29:58,359 --> 00:30:02,558
plantphysiology.org

833
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,759
excellent excellent um and then you want

834
00:30:02,558 --> 00:30:05,678
to tell the folks where they can

835
00:30:03,759 --> 00:30:07,919
find out more about dewey scientific and

836
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,440
yeah more about you absolutely if you're

837
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:12,640
interested in doing scientific

838
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,320
dewey scientific.com um deweyside.com

839
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,120
we'll get you there as well

840
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:18,398
we are active on uh twitter linkedin and

841
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:21,439
instagram

842
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,359
um and yeah we're always always happy to

843
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,399
answer questions and help

844
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:29,519
cultivators know more about their growth

845
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,839
and ultimately improve the economics of

846
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:33,200
their

847
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,879
