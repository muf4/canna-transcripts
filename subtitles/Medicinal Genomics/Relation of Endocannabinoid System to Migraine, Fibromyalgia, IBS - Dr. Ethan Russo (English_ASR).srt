1
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:05,519
thank you you'll notice i'm lowering the

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
microphone

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,678
well we're going to go quickly through

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,759
this data um my email is there ethan

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,719
rooster comcast.net

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,640
i'll be happy to send a 2004 paper that

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:17,759
goes through some old data and i've just

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,320
submitted

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
a newer paper that reviews all this data

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,560
and more

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,599
hopefully when it's accepted it'll be

12
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,038
open source

13
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,439
in keeping with recommendations

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,640
so we're going to talk today about a

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,439
theory

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,880
i developed that i call clinical

17
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:40,079
endocannabinoid deficiency

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:43,120
the hypothesis was that we all have an

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,320
underlying endocannabinoid tone that

20
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,919
reflects the

21
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,079
amount of cb1 receptors and the amount

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,640
of the endocannabinoids

23
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,799
we have and how fast they're produced or

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,399
broken down

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:01,358
then the theory is that due to a genetic

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,600
condition or an acquired condition

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,719
such as a head injury that produces

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,920
migraine

29
00:01:04,719 --> 00:01:10,158
like post-traumatic headaches

30
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,359
the endocannabinoid tone becomes

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:15,680
deficient

32
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:18,959
and a variety of symptoms result

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,920
um so i came up with this theory about

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,599
the year 2000 i had a couple of initial

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,320
publications and then

36
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:28,798
a larger review paper in 2004 which

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,959
you'll find here

38
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,400
what i'm going to focus on today from

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:35,599
this long list

40
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
of disorders is the top three in red

41
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,839
migraine fibromyalgia and irritable

42
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,759
bowel syndrome

43
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,439
now these are what are called comorbid

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,519
conditions meaning that they tend to

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,118
appear in the same individuals

46
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,599
they have a lot of things in common

47
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,118
they're all hyperalgesic states meaning

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,919
that the pain

49
00:01:53,118 --> 00:01:57,040
is there even though the tissue looks

50
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,478
normal and it's

51
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,640
it's it's more than it should be

52
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,560
there's no characteristic tissue

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
pathology if you look at the tissues

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
under the microscope

55
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,399
and they're no lab tests for any of

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,439
these disorders

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,560
the headache disorders

58
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,560
headaches appeared in about 97 of

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,598
fibromyalgia patients when that was

60
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,878
examined

61
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:25,519
similarly over a third of people who had

62
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:29,039
chronic daily headache

63
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:30,719
had criteria that indicated a diagnosis

64
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,878
of fibromyalgia

65
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,840
similarly again about a third of

66
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,239
patients with irritable bowel had

67
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,640
fibromyalgia

68
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,560
and a third of the fibromyalgia patients

69
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,479
had a

70
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,000
irritable bowel in the olden days

71
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,159
these were called psychosomatic

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,439
disorders and if

73
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,519
a patient came in uh and had migraine

74
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,719
fibromyalgia an irritable bowel at the

75
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,640
same time

76
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:58,800
chances are that it was a woman and she

77
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,158
was labeled as having a semitization

78
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,000
disorder by a male

79
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:07,120
md anyway we all make mistakes hopefully

80
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,840
we learn we're going to start uh by

81
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,080
looking at irritable bowel syndrome

82
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
it's frequently said this is a lifelong

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,560
condition but a lot of people really

84
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:17,839
develop

85
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,560
it after a bad exposure like they had

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,519
oysters or something else that went bad

87
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,080
on them

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,280
so an episode of food poisoning or

89
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,239
especially after

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,360
antibiotic treatment and then it may

91
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:34,080
become a lifelong condition

92
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,400
despite being called functional or

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
assumed to be psychosomatic this is the

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,158
most frequent diagnosis in

95
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:41,759
gastroenterology practices in this

96
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:45,280
country

97
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:48,079
no physical signs are patho-mnemonic

98
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,318
again it's a diagnosis of exclusion you

99
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,159
might get a colonoscopy and a bunch of

100
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,759
other blood tests they all come back

101
00:03:52,158 --> 00:03:58,000
negative and we call it ibs

102
00:03:55,759 --> 00:04:01,519
there are formal criteria called the rum

103
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,158
criteria for this diagnosis

104
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,158
i really love this quote i was called a

105
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:08,079
disorder of unknown origin

106
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:09,359
as being treated by agents with an

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,680
unknown mechanism of

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,599
action in other words the everything in

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
the kitchen sink gets thrown at this

110
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:17,039
usually

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,079
with bad results it is a

112
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:22,000
visceral hypersensitivity uh

113
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,319
with features of gastrointestinal

114
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,279
allodynia means that even a little

115
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,639
stretch is

116
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:31,359
perceived as pain and an overabundance

117
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,360
thereof

118
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,879
this has been looked at in relation to

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,160
the endocannabinoid system

120
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:44,000
this group from australia looked at

121
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:46,560
colonic smooth muscle and circular

122
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,560
muscle and they showed that a nandamide

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:51,439
co-localized with the cholinergic

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,800
receptors that are the main propulsive

125
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,680
force in the colon

126
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,720
and there was some kind of non-cb1

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,038
mechanism

128
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,720
or an alternative cannabinoid mechanism

129
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,959
that seemed to be operative

130
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,360
uh they suggested the endocannabinoid

131
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:09,279
system is

132
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,520
functionally important in disease and

133
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:13,119
especially inflammatory states that

134
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:16,319
would include

135
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,439
irritable bowel syndrome

136
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:22,240
then subsequently these

137
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,360
this group looked at a small randomized

138
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,038
controlled study

139
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,520
52 normal patients that took 7.5

140
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:32,000
milligrams of thc

141
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:34,719
versus placebo and they were able to

142
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,720
show increases in colonic compliance the

143
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,919
stretch ability

144
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:43,039
also decreases in tone after meals

145
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:45,439
um and decreased pressure

146
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,399
on the colon with a trend towards

147
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,199
relaxing

148
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,719
so it shows that this does perform a

149
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,639
modulatory function in the gut

150
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
then at mayo clinic there were a couple

151
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:58,160
of studies where they looked at some of

152
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:03,360
the genetics

153
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,360
they're different forms of ibs mixed

154
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:08,879
the situations where

155
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,439
it's predominantly constipation and

156
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:14,159
those predominantly diarrhea

157
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,759
so in the variant ibs with diarrhea

158
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,880
which is the most common

159
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:21,840
uh they tried thc as as marinol

160
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,199
on the show to delay colonic transit in

161
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:29,000
subjects with this cnri

162
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,000
rs 806 378

163
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,038
ct-tt i'll let you read that next time

164
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,038
that particular genotype

165
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:39,839
and then the same group showed a

166
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:42,000
significant association of the same gene

167
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,159
with colonic transit in the patients

168
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,399
with ibs-d

169
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,720
and they said cb1 receptor-related

170
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,598
mechanisms modify colonic transit and

171
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
sensation

172
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,319
and may influence the development of

173
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:57,360
symptoms in caucasian patients with ibs

174
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,960
particularly ibsd so limiting the

175
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,879
applicability but

176
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,318
many of these same things would apply to

177
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,839
a more general population

178
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,720
a very interesting study last year on

179
00:07:07,839 --> 00:07:12,959
nina clooney on her group in calgary

180
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,400
alberta

181
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:16,239
there were you may have heard recent

182
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,598
reports that people were surprised

183
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,960
that thc when used chronically led to

184
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:25,120
a lower weight so the the archetype has

185
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:25,519
been a skinny hippie it hasn't been a

186
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,120
fat

187
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:32,399
slacker but

188
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:36,160
in her group uh nina was able to show

189
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:36,879
uh the thc altered the microbiome

190
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,439
balance

191
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,478
we we heard a little bit before about

192
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,598
normal

193
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:47,360
flora in the gut on and so

194
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:50,719
uh in obese d i o mice that have this

195
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,680
uh mutation uh there was a change in the

196
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,160
firm acuities bacteroidetes ratio that

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,160
was statistically significant

198
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,840
basically thc prevented

199
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,080
weight gain despite a high fat diet

200
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,758
and this is very important it shows

201
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:10,159
again

202
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
this important interaction between

203
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,160
cannabinoids the endocannabinoid

204
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:19,519
system normal flora in the gut

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,560
and weight there was a bestseller last

206
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:26,000
year called brain maker by pearl mudder

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,199
all about probiotics and prebiotics

208
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,080
probiotics of course are normal bacteria

209
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,800
that you get in yogurt or kefir

210
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,599
those kinds of foods the fermented foods

211
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,718
but those are

212
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,759
fed in turn by prebiotics and

213
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,879
these are sources of dietary fiber from

214
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:45,679
vegetables

215
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,720
and going from top to bottom left to

216
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,799
right

217
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:54,639
we have acacia senegal gum arabic

218
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,439
chicory jerusalem artichokes dandelion

219
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:58,159
greens

220
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,959
burdock and then the the whole onion

221
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,120
family

222
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,439
and if you have one of these kinds of

223
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,480
problems that's a book worth reading

224
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:10,399
and these are vegetables worth eating um

225
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:13,920
they in turn i believe will positively

226
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,958
affect your endocannabinoid balance

227
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:19,759
shifting to fibromyalgia um

228
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,159
schleidol did an uncontrolled study this

229
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:22,399
was

230
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,639
really a strange study they had nine

231
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,919
fibromyalgia patients and they gave them

232
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:27,838
thc

233
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:29,519
their ethics committee wouldn't let them

234
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,720
use a placebo

235
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,480
so it was an observational study

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,600
because they were pushing the doses of

237
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,480
thc alone and has a lousy therapeutic

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,560
index

239
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,600
they had a lot of dropouts five out of

240
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:43,759
the nine

241
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,560
but the four subjects who completed the

242
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,399
study per protocol

243
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:51,278
had prominent reductions in their

244
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:53,440
perceived pain so these are fibromyalgia

245
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:55,919
patients whose

246
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,519
pain threshold is is diminished to begin

247
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,719
with and that was statistically

248
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,000
significant

249
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,959
as we see here now it's not really fair

250
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,120
to look at a

251
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:09,838
protocol population but um

252
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,919
you know this was the best we've got

253
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,880
considering the limitations we have on

254
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:18,240
these kinds of studies

255
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:20,360
in a study done in canada

256
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
they use nabalone so this is a

257
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,839
semi-synthetic

258
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:28,078
thc analog 40 patients with fibromyalgia

259
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:30,560
using one milligram bid which would be

260
00:10:28,078 --> 00:10:31,359
equivalent to about 20 milligrams of thc

261
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:32,799
a day

262
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,399
and again you're going to have side

263
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:36,000
effects at that level

264
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,958
but after four weeks there were

265
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,278
significant improvements in pain

266
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:43,119
fibromyalgia impact questionnaire and

267
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:46,958
anxiety

268
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:50,639
so again a significant signal there

269
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:53,000
um our friend mark ware also in canada

270
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:54,559
looked again at nabalone versus

271
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,240
amitriptyline

272
00:10:54,559 --> 00:11:00,399
a little bit lower doses at those doses

273
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,759
there wasn't any effect on pain in the

274
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,759
fibromyalgia patients

275
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,240
but or mood or quality of life but there

276
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:10,719
was

277
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
improvement in sleep which is one of the

278
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,200
cardinal symptoms of

279
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,519
of fibromyalgia it's a scenic unknown um

280
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
inferiorly there's a sleep disturbance

281
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,120
associated with it and the patient

282
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
will not get better until that's

283
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,000
addressed

284
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:27,199
um then another study done with cannabis

285
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,320
but acutely

286
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,278
this wasn't a long-range study this was

287
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
done in spain

288
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:35,039
28 patients with cannabis versus

289
00:11:33,919 --> 00:11:39,039
controls

290
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:42,319
after two hours the visual analog scales

291
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:45,039
for these various parameters

292
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,399
uh were different uh to a significant

293
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:49,759
level particularly pain

294
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:53,200
stiffness enhancement of relaxation

295
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:56,240
but increase in side effects somnolence

296
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,320
as well unfortunately the

297
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,240
increase in the mental health component

298
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,800
of the sf-36

299
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,600
was also significantly higher going

300
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:06,879
along

301
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,079
with um psychoactive

302
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:13,360
changes in this as

303
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:15,359
we've been hearing uh very low doses are

304
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,000
probably what are required here and

305
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
those that

306
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,879
hopefully will not produce these kind of

307
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,278
acute side effects

308
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:24,078
now our best evidence is probably this

309
00:12:23,278 --> 00:12:27,278
one

310
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:29,439
now i am a proponent of

311
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:31,039
randomized controlled trials it's the

312
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,519
only thing the

313
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,278
fda and other regulatory bodies will

314
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,278
accept

315
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:38,320
however this is a very interesting

316
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:40,159
survey

317
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
this came out a couple of years ago from

318
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:44,719
the national pain report

319
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:46,639
over 1300 patients with fibromyalgia

320
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,480
who answered this questionnaire so they

321
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
were self-selected but let's look at

322
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,240
this

323
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:55,120
we have three fda approved drugs

324
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,440
to treat fibromyalgia being duloxetine

325
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:01,200
melnacipran

326
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,399
those are a dual serotonin and

327
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,079
adrenergic

328
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:08,958
reuptake inhibitors so antidepressants

329
00:13:06,078 --> 00:13:12,479
and then pregabalin and anticonvulsant

330
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:14,879
masquerading as an analgesic

331
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,519
if you look at the graphs this is uh the

332
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,078
percent

333
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,078
improvement you'll see that with the

334
00:13:18,078 --> 00:13:21,359
three prescription drugs you don't have

335
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:24,559
a lot of green

336
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:28,240
you've got 10 or less showing

337
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:31,359
these to be very effective only

338
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,399
about 30 percent or less

339
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:36,399
showing them as helping a little and the

340
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,958
vast majority saying they don't help a

341
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,078
law

342
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:41,039
at all compared to cannabis where 62

343
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:42,958
percent

344
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,159
thought that they were very effective

345
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:47,359
and and very

346
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:50,958
much fewer thought that they were not um

347
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,120
so i'd call this a no contest at best

348
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:55,838
and it should indicate the future

349
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,600
direction of research

350
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:00,720
moving into migraine and we'll go

351
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,720
through this quickly

352
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:04,879
this was the thing that got me into the

353
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,399
study of cannabis

354
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:11,039
um uh 20 years ago now

355
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,720
but um i'd known for a long time that

356
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:14,838
cannabis was effective in

357
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
treatment of migraine both acutely and

358
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,079
chronically

359
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:19,439
but it's only been in the last decade or

360
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,078
so that we have some real

361
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,199
evidence of the relationship to the

362
00:14:21,078 --> 00:14:25,039
endocannabinoid system

363
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,278
and most of the studies have come from

364
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:30,078
italy on this they showed an

365
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,120
increase in the nandamide membrane

366
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,519
transporter

367
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,440
and phi activity fob being the enzyme

368
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
that breaks down in nandamide

369
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
uh we're shown in the platelets of

370
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,240
female migraners

371
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:44,399
uh and compared to patients with tension

372
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,360
headache and controls

373
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,639
the levels of cb1 were equivalent in the

374
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,519
groups but there was an

375
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,480
increased degradation of anandamide by

376
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,679
platelets

377
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,959
and decreased blood levels in the female

378
00:14:55,679 --> 00:15:01,120
migraners and

379
00:14:56,958 --> 00:15:03,838
again those were significant

380
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,799
ackermann at all did a series of three

381
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
studies showing

382
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:10,240
a very important relationship of the

383
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,639
endocannabinoid system the migraine

384
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,720
they showed that anandamide reduced

385
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:17,278
dural blood vessel dilation

386
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,240
by calcitonin gene related peptide 30

387
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,198
percent

388
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,959
and also by these other agents it seemed

389
00:15:21,198 --> 00:15:25,439
to work

390
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,239
presynaptically to prevent uh the cgrp

391
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,639
induced

392
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,399
nitric oxide release and smooth muscle

393
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,120
of the dural arteries

394
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,360
um it showed that they showed that

395
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,320
nanomine was tonically released and had

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,120
a modulatory role in the

397
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,160
trigeminovascular system

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,039
that's felt to be the patho

399
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:46,719
pathophysiological mechanism in migraine

400
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,879
in the next study they looked at

401
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:52,160
anandamide and showed that it

402
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:55,519
caused a increase in dural

403
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:59,278
vessel diameter caused by capsaicine

404
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:03,360
and that doses required were pretty high

405
00:15:59,278 --> 00:16:05,120
um and we'll go on from there

406
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,039
similarly here they were looking at

407
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,278
synthetics

408
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,519
these are much more powerful than thc

409
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,360
but again there's a relationship

410
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,560
probably our best piece of evidence is

411
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:18,320
this one done in italy

412
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,278
in this study they looked at cerebral

413
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,120
spinal fluid did spinal taps on normal

414
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,679
patients and patients with migraine i

415
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:28,078
proposed this study in 2004 but didn't

416
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:31,838
feel it could be done in this country

417
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:34,799
viva italia anyway they showed this

418
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,240
tremendously significant difference in

419
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,958
the

420
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,919
anandamide levels being decreased in the

421
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:43,119
migrant nerves

422
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:45,360
one chance in 10 000 that this is due to

423
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,919
chance

424
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,199
and basically they said here that this

425
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,399
seemed to lie at the

426
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,439
the root of the problem in

427
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:59,360
migraine another study from italy

428
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,480
both 2eg and anandamide were markedly

429
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,680
reduced in the

430
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,798
platelets of micronerves as compared to

431
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:08,000
controls again

432
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:11,199
very highly statistically significant

433
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
this is from an animal model

434
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,959
again showing the importance of the

435
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
various

436
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:23,279
nuclei in the brain stem

437
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,279
then a genetic study youhosh at all

438
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:31,280
the cb1 gene cnr1 mapped to chromosome

439
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:33,759
6q1415 was linked to migraine

440
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,079
with haplotype typical tagging with high

441
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:39,119
significance

442
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,599
and they related this to other migraine

443
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:43,599
concomitants such as photophobia the

444
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:46,480
sensitivity of light

445
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,798
nausea and disability they also related

446
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,720
it to some personality traits such as

447
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:53,839
neuroticism

448
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:58,720
guilty as charged depression

449
00:17:53,839 --> 00:18:02,079
and other tendencies towards drug abuse

450
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,240
so bad thing to have um

451
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:06,399
then another observational study this

452
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,679
came out of colorado just a few weeks

453
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,720
ago

454
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:14,160
these were patients selected to get

455
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,679
cannabis to treat migraine and

456
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,320
um two-thirds of the patients had used

457
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
cannabis

458
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:24,079
previously um but there was a very

459
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,480
significant decrease in attack rate from

460
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:31,519
10.4 to 4.6 attacks per month

461
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:34,558
85 percent had decreased frequency

462
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:37,599
and uh almost 40 percent um

463
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,839
had other benefits now obviously this is

464
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:42,558
an

465
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:46,000
uncontrolled population uh self-selected

466
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,079
um and no control group but it surely

467
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,119
indicates that the study i tried to

468
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:54,399
start 20 years ago should be done now

469
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:57,038
um i'd highly recommend this study by

470
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,590
john mcpartland i i think it's the

471
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:02,798
uh endocannabinoid article of the decade

472
00:19:00,589 --> 00:19:06,240
[Applause]

473
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:09,440
there's john with this iheart anandamide

474
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,679
t-shirt was discovered in pigs

475
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,279
which is an odd thing to have happen in

476
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,320
israel but we'll let

477
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,960
rafi tell that story but

478
00:19:16,319 --> 00:19:20,639
john reviewed the literature and showed

479
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,558
all these other

480
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,038
disorders that have been linked to

481
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,119
possible

482
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:29,759
endocannabinoid deficiency states

483
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,599
so read that one when you can well where

484
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,319
do we go from here

485
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,240
we need additional clinical studies of

486
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:37,759
irritable bowel fibromyalgia and

487
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,480
migraine

488
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,359
hopefully to look at serum or even csf

489
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,558
levels

490
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:46,319
it would be great if we have better

491
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:49,119
physiological scans of the brain to show

492
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:51,918
cannabinoid density or real-time

493
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:54,159
anandamide levels

494
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:56,480
i would like kevin and his crew to look

495
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,558
for common genetic markers of

496
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,759
endocannabinoid regulation and disk

497
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,119
control

498
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:03,440
and i think we'll have some better

499
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:06,000
answers there

500
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,919
additionally we need the clinical

501
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,200
studies hopefully within rich

502
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:15,120
designs to reduce the placebo effect

503
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:17,840
which is a huge problem in these studies

504
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,239
and i'll let you take a quick look at

505
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:21,439
this

506
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:24,240
quote from the original article

507
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,000
we've got many disorders that cannabis

508
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,798
treats where nothing else does

509
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,798
and there's a lesson there that needs to

510
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:35,119
be heated

511
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:36,960
finally let's keep in mind that

512
00:20:35,119 --> 00:20:38,798
the endocannabinoid system can be

513
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,319
regulated a different a lot of different

514
00:20:38,798 --> 00:20:43,440
ways with drugs

515
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:45,359
with herbs beyond cannabis with diet

516
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,519
with exercise

517
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:49,359
and hopefully this will lead to better

518
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:57,918
health for us all in the future

00:20:49,359 --> 00:20:57,918
