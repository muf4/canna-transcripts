1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:09,189
so for many of you have heard me speak

2
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,349
before seeing some of the things I've

3
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:13,808
done you'll see this is a bit of a

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:15,548
contrast to it but if you remember what

5
00:00:13,808 --> 00:00:17,618
we're trying to do all this time is to

6
00:00:15,548 --> 00:00:19,179
solve the question of is there a way to

7
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:22,178
accurately and consistently dose

8
00:00:19,179 --> 00:00:24,129
cannabinoids across disease sets over

9
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:26,409
time with that being the question that

10
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:29,168
we're trying to solve we're doing it by

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:31,629
the clinical experience that we're

12
00:00:29,169 --> 00:00:34,689
having working with excuse me working

13
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:36,909
with patients let's go back working with

14
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:38,679
patients through aunt Zelda's the

15
00:00:36,909 --> 00:00:40,238
preclinical research is going on with

16
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,539
competency university and other

17
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:45,369
researchers like DeeDee and others and

18
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:46,539
then also through Zelda therapeutics

19
00:00:45,369 --> 00:00:48,759
which is the hat that I'm wearing here

20
00:00:46,539 --> 00:00:51,189
today where we're actually funding the

21
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:53,018
clinical trials and the preclinical work

22
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:54,820
that's going on to prove out some of

23
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:56,469
these theories so that we can answer

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:58,929
this dose in question and create

25
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,789
solutions for patients so this is a

26
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:07,599
collaboration that went on between Spain

27
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:09,730
California and Australia so let's go

28
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:12,819
here so there's been a lot of work done

29
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:17,140
in the past showing the anti-tumor

30
00:01:12,819 --> 00:01:18,459
effect of cannabinoids in most cases the

31
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,349
ones that have been studied have been

32
00:01:18,459 --> 00:01:25,719
using pure compounds of CBD and THC so

33
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:27,879
and there's fantastic evidence of that

34
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:30,609
but when you get into the human trials

35
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,019
and human looking at the the anecdotal

36
00:01:30,609 --> 00:01:33,429
and the experience that we're having

37
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:36,699
working with patients this is not

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:39,280
necessarily the case so what we've done

39
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:41,560
is we've hypothesized that whole plant

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,560
extracts are in fact more effective

41
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,629
anti-tumor tools than pure compounds and

42
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,670
why do we believe this we believe it

43
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:50,259
because the as as our previous speaker

44
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,540
and excuse my typo there

45
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:55,090
because as our previous speaker has said

46
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,400
there are hundreds of compounds that we

47
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:59,140
don't know even what they are yet now

48
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,460
apparently we do have ways that we can

49
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,769
test and I look forward to collaborating

50
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,239
more on those things with you moving

51
00:02:02,769 --> 00:02:06,819
forward because it's all about solving

52
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:08,318
this conundrum so because there's other

53
00:02:06,819 --> 00:02:10,090
cannabinoids in there and there's other

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,548
cannabinoids within the plant itself

55
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:16,810
that contain anti-tumor properties such

56
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:18,110
as the THC a CBD a and etc etc there's

57
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,000
also other non

58
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,410
cannabinoid compounds within it that

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,780
activate the receptors such as

60
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:26,120
beta-carotene that has been shown to

61
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,759
activate the cb2 receptors and also have

62
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:30,080
effects on the tumor response as well so

63
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:32,120
because there's so many things that have

64
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,250
not been studied how can we reduce it

65
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:36,140
down to a pure compound and say this is

66
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,159
it because if it doesn't work on one

67
00:02:36,139 --> 00:02:39,169
does that mean that there's no other

68
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:41,329
solution well there's last time I looked

69
00:02:39,169 --> 00:02:43,879
on seed finder there were over 10,000

70
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:46,430
different cultivars out there probably

71
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:48,709
you know boils down to quite a few less

72
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:50,659
but depending on where within the

73
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:52,009
greenhouse it's being grown what part of

74
00:02:50,659 --> 00:02:53,509
the hill that's being grown what time of

75
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:56,449
day you pick all these different factors

76
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,979
that it greatly influences what the

77
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:59,988
actual compound is going to contain

78
00:02:57,979 --> 00:03:02,988
within the medicine itself there's also

79
00:02:59,989 --> 00:03:05,209
evidence already and things like Marinol

80
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:07,400
that is a pure compound or it's a

81
00:03:05,209 --> 00:03:09,650
synthetic in this case but it does not

82
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:11,030
work nearly as well as a full plan so

83
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,730
why would we think that it would work in

84
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,520
other areas as well so the aim of this

85
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:18,229
was to is to I'm looking at breast

86
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,209
cancer in this case and we're and we're

87
00:03:18,229 --> 00:03:22,879
going to be concentrating on the subtype

88
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:26,000
of her2 positive in particular however

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:28,459
one in eight women in the and we're will

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,709
be affected impacted by breast cancer in

91
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:34,159
their lifetime and as you get older this

92
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:36,140
risk factors go up considerably as you

93
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,139
can see and we are an aging population

94
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:42,319
so this is a considered problem moving

95
00:03:39,139 --> 00:03:44,839
forward an estimate of the cost for this

96
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,759
well moving forward are at the moment

97
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,039
we're spending in excess of fifteen

98
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:53,090
billion dollars a year treating breast

99
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,620
cancers and as we move to 22 and 2010 so

100
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,650
that's already outdated and as we're now

101
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,719
closer to 2020 we're looking at an

102
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:02,420
excess of twenty two billion dollars a

103
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:03,889
year to extend the life and what a great

104
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:06,048
percentage of that spent in the final

105
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:08,509
year of life for a lot of these patients

106
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,610
so we wouldn't we need to do something

107
00:04:08,509 --> 00:04:13,939
about this so we there's been you know

108
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:15,920
right now the her2 positive er positive

109
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:17,839
PR positive and then of course the

110
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,488
triple negative or the three mode major

111
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,589
subtypes without getting into all the

112
00:04:19,488 --> 00:04:23,989
genetics and the anomalies of each of

113
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,989
those in their cases so we have the

114
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,560
targeted therapies for ER and PR

115
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,699
positives of tamoxifen which many people

116
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,740
choose to take

117
00:04:31,699 --> 00:04:36,949
part of their therapies in the

118
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:39,019
her2-positive RTK targeted which is

119
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:41,170
lapatinib is pretty well the standard of

120
00:04:39,019 --> 00:04:43,849
care in both cases it's with or without

121
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,920
chemotherapy and/or radiation depending

122
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,170
on what your doctor has recommended for

123
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,750
you or your oncologist triple-negative

124
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:53,660
there are no targeted so chemotherapy is

125
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,339
really the only option for these so if

126
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,900
we're gonna look first of all so what we

127
00:04:55,339 --> 00:04:59,899
did is I'm going through the methodology

128
00:04:56,899 --> 00:05:02,389
right now is we started out with two two

129
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:06,049
compounds the first one was a pure THC

130
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,969
compound that was sourced from THC farm

131
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,009
it's very typical used in a lot of

132
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,470
different research projects and then the

133
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:15,649
second was and I still have no idea how

134
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,860
our extract got to Spain but aunt

135
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:21,019
Zelda's extract from California we

136
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,060
selected one that was not extraordinary

137
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:24,109
we did not pick the one that was like

138
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,990
ooh this is gonna have phenomenal

139
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:28,850
numbers we picked a an average that we

140
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:31,340
may use as a starting point with a

141
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:32,900
cancer patient and we only remember in

142
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:34,759
this study we're only really concerning

143
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:36,799
ourselves with the THC so I'm not

144
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,079
showing you the whole profile in the

145
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,079
terpenes etc this actually happened to

146
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:44,449
be one called purple Arkell the names

147
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:48,620
don't even get me started but it was

148
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:51,289
about about 55 percent THC within this

149
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:55,250
and what's important is that we used the

150
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:59,300
same concentration dose in both in vivo

151
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:01,189
and in vitro so the differences in will

152
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:05,180
only be responsible based upon the pure

153
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:08,120
compounds versus the full plant extract

154
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:09,829
all these numbers the first labs for

155
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:13,040
aunt Zelda's were done by Sonoma lab

156
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:15,620
works which has been verified multiple

157
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,140
times in other labs for the accuracy of

158
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:20,930
their numbers and in this case they were

159
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:23,000
all both of these compounds were double

160
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:26,629
checked through canna Foundation in

161
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,910
Spain so the what we did is we started

162
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:32,240
out of course and I say we absolutely

163
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:34,220
have no if that's a that's a not a real

164
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,180
we because I didn't do it this was all

165
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:38,210
done in the in

166
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:40,038
Christina Sanchez Manuel Guzman's lab in

167
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:45,049
Spain but what they did is they started

168
00:06:40,038 --> 00:06:46,939
out with the cancer cells in petri dish

169
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:51,379
which is pretty typical and they were

170
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:53,750
incubated with THC or the vehicle which

171
00:06:51,379 --> 00:06:56,839
in this case was sesame oil or the THC

172
00:06:53,750 --> 00:07:00,288
extract for 24 hours and then they were

173
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:02,359
subjected to the MTT of you know putting

174
00:07:00,288 --> 00:07:05,800
the yellow and what what lights up

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:08,900
what's still alive will be blue using

176
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,189
they're able to identify which cells are

177
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:12,319
still alive and the viability the

178
00:07:10,189 --> 00:07:14,300
intensity of the blue tells them the

179
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:18,560
viability and how many cells are alive

180
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:22,069
and this was the first results we had on

181
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,620
the her2 positive that we showed pretty

182
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:27,079
clearly that the full plant extract at

183
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:30,050
the 50% mark which is really what's the

184
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:33,079
most significant here we had far greater

185
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:35,720
cell death with the full plant extract

186
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:39,918
than with the pure compounds and then

187
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,099
these are two different variety her2

188
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:47,658
positive breast cancers with the bt 474

189
00:07:43,098 --> 00:07:49,728
and the HCC in one 1954 to move forward

190
00:07:47,658 --> 00:07:51,408
on that we then went ahead and tested on

191
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:53,149
the triple negative because even though

192
00:07:51,408 --> 00:07:55,639
it was not initially the focus of this

193
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:57,228
we know that we have to check all of

194
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,780
them and there are no other alternatives

195
00:07:57,228 --> 00:08:01,610
at the moment for targeted therapies for

196
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:04,369
this particular type so it's imperative

197
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:07,490
that we find something to help this this

198
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:09,500
group of sufferers so at this point we

199
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,158
also can show once again that the THC

200
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:15,978
extract is more potent than the THC pure

201
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:19,759
compound in decreasing triple negative

202
00:08:15,978 --> 00:08:23,899
breast cancer cells so then it was time

203
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,538
to move on to the mouse models and I'm

204
00:08:23,899 --> 00:08:28,519
not going to even pretend to understand

205
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:30,199
exactly all the things but I'll just

206
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:32,299
explain the way it was explained to me

207
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:36,229
what was going on in the process is that

208
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:39,109
these breast cancer cells in this case

209
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:41,360
it was the bt 474 were injected

210
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:44,419
subcutaneously into the mice that had

211
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,810
been that were immune deficient they'd

212
00:08:44,419 --> 00:08:48,838
been nude mice as the is the term calls

213
00:08:47,809 --> 00:08:51,688
it in this case

214
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:53,160
and they were when the when the tumors

215
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:55,259
actually they were checked on a daily

216
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,620
basis and when the tumors achieved the

217
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:00,778
200 cubic millimeters then they were

218
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:04,889
then ready to be treated they were

219
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:08,039
divided randomly into seven there were

220
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:10,799
seven in each group put into these four

221
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:13,980
different the vehicle once again the THC

222
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:16,378
pure compound our extract and then also

223
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,220
with the lapatinib which as we mentioned

224
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:23,159
before is the RTK for targeted therapy

225
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,309
for this type of cancer and what we

226
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:30,179
found was that if you can look it's very

227
00:09:26,308 --> 00:09:32,578
it's very very clear here excuse me I

228
00:09:30,179 --> 00:09:36,929
went back a slide let me go back up it's

229
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:39,929
very clear that the full plant extract

230
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:42,479
was far more effective in killing cancer

231
00:09:39,929 --> 00:09:45,688
cells than the pure which was really

232
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:49,019
much more statistically the same as the

233
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:51,480
vehicle in this case and then when we

234
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:54,629
moved on to then comparing it to the

235
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:58,289
lapatinib once again the lapatinib and

236
00:09:54,629 --> 00:10:01,289
the THC rich extract performed almost

237
00:09:58,289 --> 00:10:03,058
IED statistically identically in killing

238
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:05,370
the cancer cells which is very very

239
00:10:03,058 --> 00:10:06,389
promising to now see what we're going to

240
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,000
do and run and see together

241
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:11,068
synergistically to see how they work and

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,139
killing those cells if we can get even a

243
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:15,568
greater said the similar to what the

244
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:18,720
same lab discovered years ago

245
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:20,878
comparing TMZ with THC and finding that

246
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,350
each one works very well on its own but

247
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:28,680
it was a 50% increase in apoptosis when

248
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:30,899
they were combined so what are what are

249
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:33,299
our next steps on this so next we will

250
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:35,639
be comparing the THC versus the THC rich

251
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:37,859
of course obviously in the ER positive

252
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,870
and the PR positive breast cancer cell

253
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:42,750
lines we're then going to do the same

254
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:45,480
exact set of experimentations with CBD

255
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:49,409
pure and CBD extracts there's a huge

256
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:52,110
amount of of noise around CBD and CBD

257
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:54,480
Pyrrhic compounds with people there's a

258
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:56,818
lot of salesmen and marketing going on

259
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,159
around this and the evidence just is not

260
00:10:56,818 --> 00:11:01,198
showing that using these pure compounds

261
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,519
is giving anywhere near the medical

262
00:11:01,198 --> 00:11:06,179
benefits that we can achieve

263
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,829
of using full plant in any of these if I

264
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:09,659
and a lot of its for the reasons that we

265
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:11,430
just don't know what we don't know yet

266
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,649
so we're then going to go ahead and

267
00:11:11,429 --> 00:11:15,479
compare the different combinations of

268
00:11:13,649 --> 00:11:17,490
the major cannabinoids and then

269
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,470
including with that also looking at some

270
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,210
of the other compounds that within the

271
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:23,070
plant seeing where we can add those in

272
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,900
we'll be doing a combination of

273
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,970
cannabinoids with standard therapies to

274
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:28,319
see where we find the best numbers we

275
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:30,210
had a lot of work to do and then

276
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,670
validating of course all the results

277
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:35,970
from the in vitro into the via in vivo

278
00:11:32,669 --> 00:11:37,769
and I just was very quick presentation I

279
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:39,720
just want to thank obviously this the

280
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:42,809
hard heavy lifting in this study was

281
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:46,649
done by Christina Sanchez and her in her

282
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:49,349
team in particular Sandra who was a you

283
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,360
know doing all the gavage and doing the

284
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:53,639
the autopsies and doing all the testing

285
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,649
on it which were very very pleased with

286
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:58,679
and then of course our team at Aunt

287
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,860
Zelda's that has worked very hard over

288
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:04,529
the years and creating these wonderful

289
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:11,310
compounds to help treat cancers and I

290
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:13,230
beat the time thank you yeah so if

291
00:12:11,309 --> 00:12:16,019
anybody has if anybody has any questions

292
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:21,779
I'm more than happy to see if I can fake

293
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:24,600
my way through it so the pure THC

294
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:28,649
extract how was that extracted that is

295
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,330
an ethanol extraction we have found from

296
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:31,980
our experience working with patients

297
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:34,080
where we've actually done an experiment

298
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,659
in the past where we took the same plant

299
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:40,200
had it extracted was with the same same

300
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:42,659
crop of plant we had it extracted with

301
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:44,340
co2 we had it extracted with ethanol we

302
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:46,709
compared that very same results on

303
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:48,540
patients and patients did better on the

304
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:52,080
ethanol extract using the same than they

305
00:12:48,539 --> 00:12:54,689
did on co2 sorry that wasn't ethanol

306
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,340
extraction comparing though the THC farm

307
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:58,350
that was an extract that you were

308
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:00,800
comparing that was a pure compound and

309
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:04,050
where how was that extracted that was a

310
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:06,689
isolate and I have no idea the answer of

311
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:08,429
that interesting short path distillation

312
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:10,840
there you go interest that's what it was

313
00:13:08,429 --> 00:13:13,629
thank you

314
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,250
my wife has Stage four breast cancer

315
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:20,629
metastasized to five tumors in liver I

316
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:24,019
turned to you last year and it worked

317
00:13:20,629 --> 00:13:32,330
she has no evidence of any cancer in her

318
00:13:24,019 --> 00:13:34,429
body and this is this comes from the

319
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:37,220
head of the breast oncology department

320
00:13:34,429 --> 00:13:40,370
at University of Colorado who is

321
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:42,950
aggressively ignorant and aggressively

322
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:44,450
opposed to cannabis having said that my

323
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:47,570
question to you and follow-up to

324
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:50,660
yesterday is what now what talk to me

325
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:53,020
about a maintenance dose yeah

326
00:13:50,659 --> 00:13:55,490
maintenance dose is a very interesting

327
00:13:53,019 --> 00:13:57,409
conundrum also and I will do love that

328
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:59,480
word because it seems so appropriate in

329
00:13:57,409 --> 00:14:01,610
this in this environment that we're in

330
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,519
right now what we've been doing with

331
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:06,230
patients as a general rule and like I

332
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,699
said general rules are broken they're

333
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,899
the medium there's people on this side

334
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,879
on this side that we do different things

335
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,769
with but for the average patient what we

336
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:15,379
do especially when they respond as well

337
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:17,090
as for example your wife has without

338
00:14:15,379 --> 00:14:19,129
getting into specifics because it's a

339
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:20,930
little slightly different than this but

340
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:24,830
to say what we usually do is after we

341
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:26,569
have two full cycles of anyd which

342
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:29,740
usually is between six months and a year

343
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,440
we'll start a titration down to about

344
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:36,470
between 10 12 % is statistically where

345
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,080
it's working out on a graph of what the

346
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:40,430
highest therapeutic dose was and we

347
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,470
leave them at that maintenance dose

348
00:14:40,429 --> 00:14:45,889
indefinitely and now when we have

349
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:47,870
patients with with quite a few cancers

350
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:50,659
what we're doing is when we see that

351
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:53,210
there's id-1 gene involved and I I have

352
00:14:50,659 --> 00:14:57,559
told already that I'm I have a you know

353
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:59,269
a little bit of a girl crush our next

354
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,549
speaker because of his work with the ID

355
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,470
one and we've taken that forward and

356
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:05,419
said okay we're in a human laboratory in

357
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:07,870
California because of the lack of

358
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:10,759
regulation we've been able to do

359
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:12,740
phenomenal amount of work with patients

360
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:14,480
with their consent of course but when

361
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:16,519
their ID one gene we're able to and a

362
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,000
lot of breast cancers have we're able to

363
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,769
flip that and have very high levels of

364
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,419
relatively high levels of CBD in

365
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:26,980
comparison to THC

366
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,099
anybody else still time for few more

367
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,100
questions

368
00:15:32,789 --> 00:15:39,370
which we all know is very time-consuming

369
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:41,889
and exhausting and toxic and there and

370
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:45,429
its cost can you comment on the cost of

371
00:15:41,889 --> 00:15:48,870
this type of regime versus what we're

372
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:52,120
typically seeing in medicine right the

373
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:54,460
first of all the one I actually gave a

374
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:57,909
presentation a couple of years ago where

375
00:15:54,460 --> 00:16:00,639
I took some of the standard I took some

376
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:03,069
of the standard dosing protocols that

377
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,460
are out there on the internet and in

378
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,990
mouse models and other things and I

379
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:10,090
extrapolated them forward and showed on

380
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,250
a chart what that would mean for human

381
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,750
consumption and it was ridiculous you

382
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:15,970
cannot take from mice what you would

383
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:17,950
give to a human having said that though

384
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:19,600
what we have found over our years of

385
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:21,790
experience and working with the plant

386
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,320
and working with patients is that we've

387
00:16:21,789 --> 00:16:24,879
been able to get a pretty good idea of

388
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,610
what the ratios of the major

389
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:29,500
cannabinoids what the terpene profile to

390
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:32,560
the best of our ability to understand it

391
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:34,750
we test for about 33 terpenes right now

392
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,149
I believe is the latest number and we're

393
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:39,789
able to look at that and create the the

394
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:42,220
regimen for the patients however it's

395
00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,929
it's a lot of it is based upon the

396
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,340
individual comorbidities other

397
00:16:43,929 --> 00:16:47,049
treatments going on with the patient

398
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,790
it's you can't really just say what it

399
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:53,370
would be but I can tell you that a

400
00:16:48,789 --> 00:16:57,039
patient a woman probably age 45 with

401
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:00,360
breast cancer let's say she has her to+

402
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:06,190
or breast cancer she can expect to spend

403
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:08,259
in below $500 a month during her peak

404
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:08,529
treatment maybe even a lot less than

405
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:10,599
that

406
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:12,730
I have one patient for example one

407
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,789
breast cancer patient right now that

408
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:18,880
came to us at Stage four she was really

409
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:21,549
circling the drain so to speak and she

410
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,540
is able to successfully on a hundred

411
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:29,409
milligrams of CBD and 30 milligrams of

412
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:32,589
THC along with the other profile of the

413
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:35,500
plant she's able to have had extreme

414
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:36,639
reduction in her tumor activity and is

415
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,579
now living a pretty

416
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,230
pretty healthy life so I would say at

417
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:43,059
that if you look at the cost somewhere

418
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:44,740
around seven cents a milligram nine

419
00:17:43,059 --> 00:17:46,210
cents a milligram then you can just run

420
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,390
the numbers yourself and figure it out

421
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:52,600
yes but to your point it's a very

422
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,460
inexpensive way to save your life and

423
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:56,439
it's a much more comfortable way to do

424
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,299
it the only problem is insurance doesn't

425
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:00,759
cover it and these are populations that

426
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:03,069
are usually off of work because they're

427
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:04,779
sick and they're the most at risk even

428
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:07,210
when treating the children that might be

429
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,099
on these higher doses a lot of times the

430
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,900
you know nowadays to try to live in

431
00:18:09,099 --> 00:18:12,759
California on one income is almost

432
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:15,090
unheard of the mother or the father

433
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,829
somebody has to taste stop working to

434
00:18:15,089 --> 00:18:19,959
address the child's needs so right at

435
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:22,089
the point when they're financially most

436
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,680
at risk is when they then have to take

437
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:27,089
on treatments that are not covered by

438
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:29,920
insurance so it's a real problem yes

439
00:18:27,089 --> 00:18:31,599
Thank You Maura for the work you're

440
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:33,490
doing on the front lines helping

441
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,619
patients and now on the back lines with

442
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:37,870
the research I really appreciate it

443
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:40,059
there's a concept that's been spreading

444
00:18:37,869 --> 00:18:42,309
through the medical cannabis world that

445
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:44,470
THC is a bad thing for estrogen

446
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:45,970
sensitive breast cancer and I've looked

447
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:47,589
through the literature to find try to

448
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:49,779
find any evidence of this and haven't

449
00:18:47,589 --> 00:18:51,879
been able to seems like your research

450
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:54,879
also disputes that I wonder if you could

451
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,710
comment on this kind of thought process

452
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,020
and how it's been spreading and and what

453
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,240
you're seeing clinically yeah I would

454
00:18:59,019 --> 00:19:06,759
say that first of all thank you I am

455
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:08,589
another fan of yours as you know and we

456
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,269
have found that that oh there's a lot of

457
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:11,679
rumors out there and usually when we can

458
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,000
come back to is there either

459
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,890
you know promulgated from the

460
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,589
pharmaceutical industry or from the

461
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:20,700
naysayers or whomever is trying to keep

462
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:23,740
people away from using cannabis --is is

463
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,259
an option but what we have found is that

464
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:28,569
you can keep the THC levels pretty low

465
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:31,269
in the triple a in the in the breast

466
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:33,819
cancers and do a lot more with the CBD

467
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:36,430
and get the same effect but we have not

468
00:19:33,819 --> 00:19:38,769
found that are any of our cancer

469
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:42,519
patients have had increased tumor

470
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:45,160
activity as a result of using THC i00

471
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:47,170
yeah I've had patients where it hasn't

472
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,640
worked but I haven't and that's probably

473
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:50,440
because we don't know enough about what

474
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,270
the content of that actual medicine

475
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:56,250
but I've never had a patient where it's

476
00:19:52,269 --> 00:20:00,279
grown as a result of using the medicine

477
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:02,799
have you seen any examples of people

478
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,720
developing resistance meaning you know

479
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,750
recurrences while they're maintaining

480
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,120
themselves on maintenance doses yeah I

481
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:12,220
think what happens is people get become

482
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:14,169
where they don't no longer having the

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:15,900
therapeutic effects depending on what

484
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:19,350
the effects are that they're going for

485
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:21,310
because when you are using the cannabis

486
00:20:19,349 --> 00:20:24,929
therapeutically and you get to a

487
00:20:21,309 --> 00:20:26,919
therapeutic dose you do not have to feel

488
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:29,890
disassociative you do not have to have

489
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:32,190
the psychotropic effects necessarily etc

490
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,480
you're able to do an awful lot with

491
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,480
without because you titrate up to the

492
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,450
point where it you no longer able to

493
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:41,860
adjust to that dose and then you know to

494
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:44,200
back off a little bit because you've

495
00:20:41,859 --> 00:20:47,769
exceeded your therapeutic dose and as a

496
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:49,930
person improves their health improve the

497
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:51,670
dose can go down because otherwise that

498
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:55,120
same dose will start making them feel

499
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:56,830
more psychotropic effect that they may

500
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,409
or may not be interested in but what

501
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:02,259
happens is over time you become where

502
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,300
you're acclimated to it and one of the

503
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:06,970
things that we do about it is we try to

504
00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,769
keep our medicines very similar in their

505
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,350
profile for treating different disease

506
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:13,139
that's but we'll change them up so that

507
00:21:11,349 --> 00:21:15,399
the people are constantly being as

508
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:18,040
having different medicines that they're

509
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,560
getting in addition to that after about

510
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:23,409
every six months we tell we suggest that

511
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:25,899
they titrate down they go off to town to

512
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:28,779
nothing they spend about 48 to 72 hours

513
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:30,640
off of any cannabis whatsoever and then

514
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:33,730
start back up again and find this

515
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,100
they're able to once again increase and

516
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:38,140
and have their tolerance be much lower

517
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:39,480
and start having results again from the

518
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,259
medicine

519
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:44,838
thank you

520
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:44,838
[Applause]

521
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,019
