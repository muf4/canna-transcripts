00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,459
hello thank you for the invitation it's

2
00:00:02,638 --> 00:00:07,830
my pleasure to be here today I'm going

3
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,990
to talk about recent advances in

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,809
cannabinoid infighter cannabinoid and

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:15,419
endocannabinoid research I'm a scientist

6
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:18,509
I work with professor of human shulam so

7
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:20,609
this work this is the recent work that

8
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:27,118
has been done in our lab in

9
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:29,039
collaboration with other labs over the

10
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,109
last few decades research on

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,600
cannabinoids has gone through several

12
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:35,700
distinct phases

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:38,870
phyto cannabinoids endocannabinoids and

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:41,129
endocannabinoid like research and

15
00:00:38,869 --> 00:00:44,218
thousands of publications have been

16
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:46,769
published on cannabinoids and some of

17
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:51,480
them are already in use as therapeutic

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:53,910
agents phyto cannabinoids research I'm

19
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:59,909
going to cover nausea anxiety and

20
00:00:53,909 --> 00:01:02,099
depression cannabis sativa

21
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:04,558
it contains money bioactive compounds

22
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,420
and the most representatives are

23
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:11,310
cannabinoids flavonoids and depends and

24
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:14,129
among the cannabinoids we have the tetra

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,340
hydro we have the tetrahydrocannabinol

26
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:21,390
THC which is responsible for the

27
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:24,900
cannabis psychoactive effects and other

28
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,659
main cannabinoids include the

29
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:29,460
tetrahydrocannabinol ik acid can have

30
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:35,540
been all Canobie they all and kind of

31
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:36,899
dialect acid now cannabinoids they are

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,390
biosynthesized

33
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,930
in the in their acid form in the plant

34
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:45,840
tissue and kind of acrylic acid is the

35
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:50,189
main bio synthetic precursor of the

36
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,829
acids of CBD THC and cannibal

37
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:55,889
and these can generate their

38
00:01:52,828 --> 00:02:01,349
decarboxylated counterparts under the

39
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:04,500
action of heat or light cbda will give

40
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:06,780
CBD THC air will give THC cannabic

41
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,899
Romanick acid will give connect remain

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:12,860
and kind of acrylic acid will

43
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:16,419
if can a bigger order now

44
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:20,120
cannabidiol acid which is the main major

45
00:02:16,419 --> 00:02:23,268
constituent of cannabis sativa was first

46
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:28,250
isolated in 1955 and its structure was

47
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:31,069
elucidated in 1965 it has been shown to

48
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,759
inhibit breast cancer cell migration and

49
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:37,458
to have anti nausea and anti-anxiety

50
00:02:33,759 --> 00:02:39,769
effects now the stability of this

51
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,769
compound weakens the case of developing

52
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:45,259
it as a medicine and therefore we

53
00:02:42,769 --> 00:02:56,480
decided to compare it with its methyl

54
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:59,959
ester since the deep sorry okay

55
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,119
this deeper box elation of the acids it

56
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,060
proceeds through the formation of the

57
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:08,480
carboxyl anion and this is not readily

58
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:10,959
formed in the methyl ester and indeed we

59
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:13,848
found that the CBD methyl ester is

60
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,109
stable under different conditions up to

61
00:03:13,848 --> 00:03:20,179
six months now in collaboration with

62
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:22,549
Professor Roger Parthians in the paper

63
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:25,040
and knowing that the endocannabinoid

64
00:03:22,549 --> 00:03:29,569
system plays a major role in the

65
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,878
regulation of nausea and anxiety we we

66
00:03:29,568 --> 00:03:35,089
were able to see that the CBD metal

67
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:39,318
ester was much more potent than the CBD

68
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:41,930
a in enhancing the serotonin 1a receptor

69
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:45,168
activation and therefore it was much

70
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:49,239
more effective in reducing the acute

71
00:03:45,169 --> 00:03:54,919
nausea and anticipatory nausea induced

72
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:57,590
behavior in the rod capping model also

73
00:03:54,919 --> 00:04:01,050
CBD a metal ester proved to be an

74
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:06,960
anti-anxiety compound

75
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:10,719
in a model of stress-induced angiogenic

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,719
responding we were able to see that when

77
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:17,620
the rat they received a kind of stress

78
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:20,680
it is the food shock stress and 24 hours

79
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,889
later they were given fatal or CBT or

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,740
CBT amet Lester and then they were

81
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:30,039
placed in the dark compartment of the

82
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:32,259
light dark box and the time that is

83
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:36,040
spent in the light box

84
00:04:32,259 --> 00:04:38,110
it was trapped now if the mice spend

85
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,050
time in the light box then they have

86
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:43,210
they don't have they are not anxious but

87
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,910
if they spend time in the dark box then

88
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:50,620
they are anxious and indeed we found

89
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:57,280
that food shock greatly enhanced the

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:05:01,240
stress induced behavior responding in

91
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:04,389
the food shock stressed mice and cbda

92
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:07,930
Matty Lester it reduced this effect

93
00:05:04,389 --> 00:05:13,689
meaning that the CBD emiti Lester has

94
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:16,090
anti-anxiety effects on the mice now in

95
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:18,430
order to expand the results that we got

96
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:22,449
with the CBD enmity Lester that it has

97
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,300
anti-anxiety effect and knowing that a

98
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:29,229
serotonin one a receptor is important

99
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:31,540
for the treatment of human depression we

100
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:35,290
were able together with Professor Aaron

101
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:38,319
Weller to see that CBD MIT Lester it

102
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:41,860
reduces the anti-depression behavior in

103
00:05:38,319 --> 00:05:43,689
rats and usually the anti-depressive

104
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:47,650
like behavior the depressive like

105
00:05:43,689 --> 00:05:51,129
behavior and mice are seen as increased

106
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:54,969
in mobility and decreased swimming in

107
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:57,219
the forced swim test and CBD a meta

108
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:03,840
Lester decreased the a mobility and

109
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:06,660
increased the swimming in these rats now

110
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:08,669
the endocannabinoids and endocannabinoid

111
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:11,340
like compounds research I'm going to

112
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,900
cover here two types of topics which are

113
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:21,379
antimicrobial potential and addiction

114
00:06:14,899 --> 00:06:24,870
now after the discovery of THC in 1964

115
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:27,990
the first endogenous lipophilic molecule

116
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,350
that was able to activate the cb1 and

117
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,600
cb2 that are activated by THC was

118
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:36,390
discovered and this compound was

119
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,230
identified in 1992 to be an and amide

120
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:42,240
and shortly after another compound which

121
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,700
is important and the cannabinoid

122
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,750
compound was discovered which is 2r

123
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:52,469
cadonia literal to AG following that

124
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:54,779
Omega 6 other Omega 6 fatty acid

125
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:58,229
compounds that have kinetic properties

126
00:06:54,779 --> 00:07:01,109
as well such as knowledge in ether

127
00:06:58,228 --> 00:07:02,519
viroid amide and in her original

128
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,150
dopamine nada

129
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:09,599
there they were listed among the

130
00:07:05,149 --> 00:07:12,779
endocannabinoid family and in the last

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:15,780
25 years and and amide and all of these

132
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:17,849
compounds they had key biological

133
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:24,059
activities in the central nervous system

134
00:07:17,850 --> 00:07:28,650
and in the periphery now compounds that

135
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:31,740
are considered a amides of long-chain

136
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:34,469
fatty acids with amino acids all with

137
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,079
ethanolamines they represent a major

138
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:39,570
group of endogenous lipids and these

139
00:07:37,079 --> 00:07:42,168
compounds they are found in the brain

140
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:44,728
and in the part of them in the periphery

141
00:07:42,168 --> 00:07:48,569
they do not bind to the cannabinoid

142
00:07:44,728 --> 00:07:53,120
receptor cb1 or CB 2 however they have a

143
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:56,639
a cannabinoid dependent activity and

144
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,360
therefore they are considered as parts

145
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,709
of the endocannabinoid family and these

146
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,840
compounds they have numerous

147
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:06,810
physiological functions in the mammalian

148
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,969
tissues for example palmitoyl

149
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:10,139
ethanol amid PA it is anti-inflammatory

150
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,090
aunt in

151
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:17,069
receptive neuroprotective anticonvulsant

152
00:08:14,089 --> 00:08:20,068
allylic Anala mean it regulates food

153
00:08:17,069 --> 00:08:23,729
intake our Daniel serine it's vasoactive

154
00:08:20,069 --> 00:08:25,770
as a neuro protective as well and all in

155
00:08:23,728 --> 00:08:31,110
Syrian was shown to have anti

156
00:08:25,769 --> 00:08:33,509
osteoporotic effects now there is

157
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,320
limited information for the role of the

158
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:41,929
endocannabinoid system during infection

159
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:44,579
especially against invading bacteria and

160
00:08:41,929 --> 00:08:50,989
we wanted to see the role of the

161
00:08:44,578 --> 00:08:53,399
endocannabinoid system in East microbes

162
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:55,980
so together with professor Dorner

163
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,198
Steinberg we studied the antimicrobial

164
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:02,100
potential of endocannabinoids and

165
00:08:58,198 --> 00:09:05,189
endocannabinoids like compounds now

166
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:09,180
quorum sensing is a bacterial

167
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:11,760
communication process and bacteria they

168
00:09:09,179 --> 00:09:14,489
use quorum sensing in order to attach

169
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:17,730
themselves to surfaces and form

170
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,159
bacterial biofilms and the bacteria in

171
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:22,829
inside the bacterial biofilms

172
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:26,159
there are 10 to 1,000 times more

173
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:29,729
resistant to antibiotics than the free

174
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:32,639
planktonic bacteria and we use here the

175
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:38,009
Vibrio Harvey bacteria in order to study

176
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:42,269
the the quorum sensing and because it

177
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:44,639
emits bioluminescence as a result of as

178
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:48,470
a respond to quorum sensing stimulation

179
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:51,149
and what we saw that then i

180
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,889
endocannabinoid another might among

181
00:09:51,149 --> 00:09:55,350
other endocannabinoids and

182
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:59,278
endocannabinoids like compounds it

183
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:03,028
inhibited the quorum sensing of the

184
00:09:59,278 --> 00:10:05,639
Vibrio Harvey strains it reduced the

185
00:10:03,028 --> 00:10:09,000
gene expression of the quorum sensing

186
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:13,500
pathway and it inhibited the mortality

187
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:15,828
of the Vibrio Harvey moreover another

188
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:18,778
kind of bacteria which is the

189
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:20,569
methicillin-resistant as our s it is a

190
00:10:18,778 --> 00:10:22,669
kind of bacteria that is

191
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:26,660
responsible for many difficult to treat

192
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:29,599
infections in humans and this kind of

193
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:32,620
bacteria is a biofilm forming microbe

194
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,720
and the biofilms they are formed on the

195
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:39,799
implanted medical devices such as

196
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,680
catheters and on the necrotic tissues in

197
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:45,019
wounds and we were able to see as well

198
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:46,909
that an under mild and the

199
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:50,199
endocannabinoid like compound are hidden

200
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:55,459
in syrian they were those dependently

201
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:57,980
inhibited showed inhibition for the

202
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:00,680
biofilm formation they inhibited the

203
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:10,840
colony spread and they reduce the

204
00:11:00,679 --> 00:11:15,919
bacterial aggregates addiction now a

205
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:19,070
publication in 2007 in science stated

206
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,250
that cigarette smokers with brain damage

207
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,770
involving the insular cortex they

208
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:28,789
display cessation of tobacco smoking

209
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:30,679
which implicates that the insula is a

210
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:33,819
region in the brain that may contribute

211
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:37,909
to nicotine addiction and therefore

212
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:42,290
together with another three groups in

213
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:44,750
Canada Richmond Virginia and Italy we

214
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:49,549
wanted to find molecules that were able

215
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:53,590
to treat nicotine addiction and we can

216
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:57,049
do this by searching for neuro chemicals

217
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:59,389
in the insular cortex of the brain that

218
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,649
can be altered by traumatic brain injury

219
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:04,558
and

220
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:07,860
by using lip Adamic analysis we were

221
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:11,578
able to see that by comparing traumatic

222
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:13,499
brain injury and normal brain areas the

223
00:12:11,578 --> 00:12:15,899
traumatic brain injury elicited

224
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:18,329
substantial increases in the

225
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:23,879
endocannabinoid like compound allele

226
00:12:18,328 --> 00:12:27,928
it's in now we wanted to see if the

227
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:29,999
exogenous allele glitzen will will alter

228
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:32,909
the withdrawal responses in the nicotine

229
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:37,470
dependent mice the mice were given

230
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:40,139
nicotine or saline for 14 days then the

231
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:43,439
nicotinic group they were given orally

232
00:12:40,139 --> 00:12:45,899
seen or vehicle 15 minutes later they

233
00:12:43,438 --> 00:12:49,198
were given the nicotine acetylcholine

234
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:50,698
antagonist Mika melamine and 25 minutes

235
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:54,438
later they were elevate they were

236
00:12:50,698 --> 00:12:57,088
evaluated by the elevated plus maze and

237
00:12:54,438 --> 00:13:00,178
physical somatic withdrawal signs now

238
00:12:57,089 --> 00:13:04,019
the elevated plus maze this is a test in

239
00:13:00,178 --> 00:13:07,499
order to assess the anxiety-like

240
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:11,669
behavior in mice if the mice they are

241
00:13:07,499 --> 00:13:13,829
anxious as a result of withdrawal then

242
00:13:11,669 --> 00:13:18,088
they will be they will not be exploring

243
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:19,979
the open arm if they are not anxious if

244
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:23,249
they are not anxious then they will be

245
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:27,360
exploring the open arm and what we saw

246
00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:30,259
is that the mice the nicotine dependent

247
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:34,139
mice undergoing mekka melamine

248
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:37,818
precipitated withdrawal signs they had

249
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:42,240
reduced time exploring the open arm and

250
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:45,088
allyl glitzen actually increased the

251
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:48,028
open arm time indicating that it is

252
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:52,300
attenuating the withdrawal symptoms and

253
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:56,379
these dependent mice in addition

254
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:59,289
this compound was able to attenuate or

255
00:13:56,379 --> 00:14:02,369
interfere with physical somatic

256
00:13:59,289 --> 00:14:06,938
withdrawal science and these usually

257
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:13,178
they are seen as body tremors head

258
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:15,969
shakes backings curling's and etc in

259
00:14:13,178 --> 00:14:21,938
addition we saw that allele it's in it

260
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:25,600
reduced the reward effect of riccati in

261
00:14:21,938 --> 00:14:29,889
this was seen by conditioned place

262
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:33,699
preference test the mice exhibited to

263
00:14:29,889 --> 00:14:36,129
neutral environments and these two

264
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:39,729
environments distinct environment they

265
00:14:36,129 --> 00:14:43,300
are paired spatially and temporally with

266
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:45,610
unconditioned stimuli for example on

267
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:48,729
these two four and six they were given

268
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:51,730
the mice were given drug in the dark

269
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:54,308
compartment and on days three six and

270
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:57,699
seven they were given saline in the

271
00:14:54,308 --> 00:15:00,068
white compartment and on day eight they

272
00:14:57,698 --> 00:15:03,490
are given the freedom to explore both

273
00:15:00,068 --> 00:15:06,548
compartments and the time spent in any

274
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:08,499
of these compartment is an indication of

275
00:15:06,548 --> 00:15:11,740
the reinforcing effect of the

276
00:15:08,499 --> 00:15:16,290
unconditioned stimuli and what we saw is

277
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:23,169
that allele glitzy and those dependently

278
00:15:16,289 --> 00:15:26,828
inhibited the reward effect it inhibited

279
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:29,248
the development of the nicotine in

280
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:34,239
douche conditioned place reference

281
00:15:29,249 --> 00:15:37,990
allele it seen didn't interact with CB

282
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:40,119
one or CB 2 however it inhibited far

283
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,879
which is the enzyme responsible for the

284
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:45,939
degradation of an and amide and it

285
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:52,329
behaved as a PPA our alpha receptor

286
00:15:45,938 --> 00:15:56,139
agonist in order to see if we can do as

287
00:15:52,328 --> 00:15:59,198
well the same with morpheme we could

288
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,418
find that allele it's in it blocked the

289
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,019
aversive effect of the morphine

290
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:08,149
withdrawal

291
00:16:03,019 --> 00:16:14,360
and this indicated that only be seen

292
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:16,429
might have might affect or decrease the

293
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:19,370
impact of their morphine withdrawal and

294
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:26,389
this effect was reversed by cb-one

295
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:28,549
antagonist in addition there are somatic

296
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:30,919
withdrawal signs for the morphine

297
00:16:28,549 --> 00:16:33,969
addiction and these were seen as

298
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:37,429
mouthing movement abdominal contractions

299
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:39,700
diarrhea and lying on belly and what we

300
00:16:37,429 --> 00:16:44,569
saw is that a legally seen as well

301
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:48,650
attenuated these morphine withdrawal

302
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:52,160
nausea somatic behaviors and this effect

303
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:56,779
it was prevented by the PPA are alpha

304
00:16:52,159 --> 00:17:00,110
and cb-one antagonist now all it's in it

305
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:02,240
has an amide bond which means that it

306
00:17:00,110 --> 00:17:06,819
can be hydrolyzed in the body by

307
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,720
amylases so we thought of is there any

308
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:15,859
way of stabilizing this compound

309
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,338
metabolically by introducing something

310
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:21,169
to stabilize the compound and in a

311
00:17:19,338 --> 00:17:24,169
similar molecule which is an and amide

312
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:26,900
the introduction of a methyl group

313
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:28,100
adjacent to the amide bond was able to

314
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,590
potentiate

315
00:17:28,099 --> 00:17:33,559
its activity and stability of the anand

316
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:36,009
amide and therefore we prepared in the

317
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:38,539
lab methylated all include seen and

318
00:17:36,009 --> 00:17:40,640
demethylated all agreed seen with the

319
00:17:38,539 --> 00:17:45,289
hope that methylation will do the same

320
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:49,580
in all in a lit scene as it did in an

321
00:17:45,289 --> 00:17:53,089
and amide and indeed we found that only

322
00:17:49,579 --> 00:17:55,909
the monomyth really seen it produced a

323
00:17:53,089 --> 00:17:59,119
larger or longer lasting interference

324
00:17:55,910 --> 00:18:03,560
with the allele glitzy and precipitated

325
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:07,459
morphine withdrawal and to explain this

326
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:10,849
if allele it seen was given 10 minutes

327
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,210
before the naloxone then it had it

328
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:14,490
effect while it was if it was given 60

329
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,470
minute

330
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:21,480
before the naloxone it didn't give any

331
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:24,569
effect but the mono material it's in 10

332
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:28,230
minutes or 60 minutes if it was given

333
00:18:24,569 --> 00:18:35,279
before naloxone then it gave its effect

334
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:38,610
and okay and this effect was as well

335
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:43,200
prevented by cb-one antagonist and epa

336
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:45,869
are alpha antagonist and to summarize we

337
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,990
can say that the CBD a metal ester is a

338
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:52,409
potential medicine for treating nausea

339
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:57,120
anxiety depression and other disorders

340
00:18:52,410 --> 00:19:00,480
that are mediated by the v serotonin 1a

341
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:04,579
receptor activation however still we

342
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:08,970
need more research to be done more

343
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:10,889
models animal models and etc the

344
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,890
endocannabinoid and endocannabinoid like

345
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,259
compounds they may act as a natural line

346
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:19,410
of defense against antibiotic resistant

347
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:22,109
bacteria the endocannabinoid compound

348
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:24,120
like compound allele it's in it

349
00:19:22,109 --> 00:19:26,490
interferes with a nicotine withdrawal

350
00:19:24,119 --> 00:19:29,219
and with analog some precipitated

351
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,380
morphine withdrawal and a more stable

352
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,289
compound which is more material or

353
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:37,620
leaflets in it may be more stable agent

354
00:19:34,289 --> 00:19:39,899
to combat the aversive effect of acute

355
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,659
naloxone precipitated morphine

356
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,450
withdrawal than all ill klitzy and

357
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,860
finally I would like to thank all of our

358

[Applause]

364
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:18,869
hello thank for the great presentation a

365
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:20,490
question about these compounds getting

366
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:23,039
into the brain if they're administered

367
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:24,319
systemically in the periphery so what

368
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,549
sort of evidence is there that

369
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:29,039
endocannabinoid or endocannabinoid

370
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,899
compounds administered in the periphery

371
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,710
or systemically across the blood-brain

372
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:37,559
barrier and can affect the brain well we

373
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:40,679
we did some tests and we shall we we

374
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:44,849
have showed that for example when all

375
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:47,250
ele seen is given and then it penetrates

376
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:49,799
the brain there is evidence and there

377
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,720
are studies but I didn't show this music

378
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,089
but it also worked for an and amide or

379
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:57,058
two AG administered in the periphery to

380
00:20:54,089 --> 00:21:01,019
cross the blood-brain barrier yes thank

381
00:20:57,058 --> 00:21:02,428
you um hi there I was wondering if you

382
00:21:01,019 --> 00:21:06,569
compared when you were looking at the

383
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:08,370
binding of the methyl ester CBD a25 ht1

384
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:11,220
a if you did compare it to the neutral

385
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:15,178
form of CBD as well as CBD a or just a

386
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,970
CBD a actually it is it does not bind

387
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:22,650
deep to the serotonin 1 a receptor okay

388
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:26,308
yeah it is a activating it and it was

389
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:29,250
yes we compared it with CBD and CBD a

390
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:33,720
and it was more effective than both of

391
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:35,789
them oh cool thank you yeah thank you

392
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,429
for your overview quick question is

393
00:21:35,789 --> 00:21:40,879
there any evidence for Fito cannabinoid

394
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:43,470
inhibition of your quorum sensing

395
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,710
bacteria biology the same way you were

396
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:49,980
talking about for the endogenous

397
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,529
endocannabinoids actually in a previous

398
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:55,019
paper we did

399
00:21:52,529 --> 00:22:00,660
the same studies quorum sensing and

400
00:21:55,019 --> 00:22:03,210
bacterial biofilm with the HQ 210 which

401
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:05,610
is the synthetic compound that binds to

402
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:11,789
both cannabinoid receptors C 1 and C B 2

403
00:22:05,609 --> 00:22:13,189
and it did the same what in the

404
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,500
literature there is limited information

405
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:19,830
regarding this kind of studies there

406
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:26,250
there is only a certain cannabinoids

407
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:31,619
that are anti bacterial so cannabinoids

408
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:34,920
anti bacterial 210 HP 210 which binds to

409
00:22:31,619 --> 00:22:36,869
cb1 and cb2 it acts actually as anti

410
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,980
biofilm formation and anti quorum

411
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:40,439
sensing and

412
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:44,870
our studies on the endocannabinoids this

413
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,870
is the only data we have yes

414
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:02,328
okay thank you

415
00:22:56,819 --> 00:23:02,328
