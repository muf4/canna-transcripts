thanks happy to be here okay you are

161
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,478
participating in a panel discussion that

came at 2021

163
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,000
that's all about understanding the

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,160
environmental impacts of cannabis

165
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,160
and hemp cultivation and i know you are

166
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,960
an expert specifically in the area of

167
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,919
emissions and

168
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:29,359
air pollution so maybe we can start the

169
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:31,279

cultivation can impact

172
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,160
air quality that's a great question and

173
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:37,680
i think

174
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,039
it might be really helpful if we kind of

175
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,959
start with a little bit of some

176
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:42,000
definitions of names and a lot of names

177
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,519
being thrown around and

178
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
we're going to be doing somewhat

179
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:47,680
technical terms so

180
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,360
let's talk about emissions from these

181
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,918
plants and a lot of folks kind of talk

182
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,560
about terpenes i know that's a word

183
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:56,399
that's used quite a bit or vocs there's

184
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,160
another word that's used quite a bit

185
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,000
so let's just find what define what that

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,479
is so a voc is a volatile

187
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,879
organic compound so that's an organic

188
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:06,959
molecule so carbons and hydrogens

189
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,478
that at room temperature would rather be

190
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,719
in the gas phase so that's what we call

191
00:07:08,478 --> 00:07:13,038
them volatile organic compounds

192
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,840
and volatile organic compounds include

193
00:07:13,038 --> 00:07:16,000
lots and lots of kind of organic

194
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,399
molecules

195
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and one important organic molecule is

196
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,638
called isoprene

197
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,439
now isoprene is emitted by every living

198
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:25,680
thing on the planet

199
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,360
you and i right now are emitting

200
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,759
isoprene out of our breath

201
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,720
and so is plants right and we've known

202
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
that for

203
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,319
quite a while now if you take that

204
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,319
isoprene and you put

205
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,560
two isoprenes together as a building

206
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,240
block what you end up with is what we

207
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,759
call

208
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,680
monoterpenes which is a class of

209
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,319
thousands of molecules including alpha

210
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,759
pinene

211
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
d limonene some of these things maybe

212
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,680
your listeners are familiar with

213
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,400
if you put three isoprene molecules

214
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,319
together you have something we call

215
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:56,159
sesquiterpenes right and so people like

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:57,759
to talk about terpene but when we talk

217
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,759
about terpenes there's actually

218
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,280
two large classes of terpenes one's

219
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,479
called monoterpenes and others called

220
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,239
susquaterpenes

221
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:06,159
and isoprene which is a building block

222
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,759
for those those things

223
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:13,280
now all these vocs that come from plants

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,960
we call biogenic vocs or biogenic

225
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,399
volatile organic compounds

226
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:18,239
the ones that are made from humans that

227
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:18,719
usually come from gasoline or things

228
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,960
like that

229
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
we call anthropogenic volatile organic

230
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,159
compounds

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,598
and now we know in the air quality field

232
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,520
where i come from

233
00:08:25,598 --> 00:08:29,680
all these vocs whether they're from

234
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:31,598
plants or from people

235
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,320
can participate in chemistry in the

236
00:08:31,598 --> 00:08:37,038
atmosphere and form both ozone

237
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,360
and particulate matter or aerosols and

238
00:08:37,038 --> 00:08:39,838
so

239
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,959
understanding how these vocs come from

240
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
these plants

241
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,199
is just as important as understanding

242
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,959
where these vocs are coming from people

243
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,800
otherwise we won't get a full picture of

244
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,079
our air quality as being impacted in the

245
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,719
atmosphere and so that's how

246
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,720
i came about looking at these emissions

247
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,278
of these terpenes and their impact on

248
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,278
air quality

249
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
excellent and i know that you um you

250
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:04,399
published a pretty

251
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,360
notable study analyzing the

252
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,000
air quality in denver specifically with

253
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,839
relation to

254
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,600
cannabis cultivation i was wondering if

255
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,560
you could kind of explain the results of

256
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,360
that

257
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:16,958
yeah sure so um you know like i was

258
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,639
saying before we've known for a long

259
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,838
time scientifically there's a connection

260
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,240
between

261
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,279
these vocs monoterpenes sesquiterpenes

262
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,799
and isoprene

263
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:27,120
and the formation of air pollution in

264
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,838
the atmosphere now i should note that

265
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
you know these

266
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,600
molecules by themselves are not toxic to

267
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,119
humans

268
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,879
in fact most of these things have that

269
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
you know nice smells and things and

270
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:37,919
we've

271
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,399
come to become accustomed and like these

272
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,278
sorts of

273
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,278
molecules and so being exposed to high

274
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:46,159
levels of these terpenes

275
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,519
is is not harmful to human health

276
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,278
however when you have

277
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,639
combustion sources that are with these

278
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:56,799
vocs in the presence of sunlight

279
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,679
they can form ozone and particulate

280
00:09:56,799 --> 00:10:01,278
matter

281
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:03,359
now it actually depends um how much

282
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,039
existing vocs are already in the

283
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,639
atmosphere to see how much that really

284
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,039
has an impact

285
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:10,319
and in denver colorado denver happens to

286
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,039
be high desert

287
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,160
and there happens not to be a lot of

288
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,360
biogenic or

289
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:21,759
vocs that come from plants due to its

290
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,839
um its you know its high altitude

291
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:25,039
and so you have a city that has lots of

292
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,600
combustion sources

293
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:29,360
which are the cars right uh from a large

294
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,159
metropolitan city

295
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,680
um but is starved if it only had more of

296
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:38,000
these vocs it could produce more ozone

297
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,039
now the other issue with denver is that

298
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,679
the city of denver

299
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,240
is in near what we call a non-attainment

300
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,639
or

301
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
is in violation of the federal standard

302
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:48,958
for ambient ozone

303
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:50,239
so any little bit of ozone contribution

304
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:53,359
is going to push them

305
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,159
in the wrong direction now that's unique

306
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,560
about denver

307
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,879
is that it needs those vocs but the

308
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:00,559
state of colorado has also made

309
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,320
cannabis production under secure

310
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,359
premises which has forced a lot of

311
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,839
cannabis production

312
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,839
indoors and mostly in warehouses and

313
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:10,720
warehouses are usually located

314
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,440
right near major transportation hubs and

315
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,720
so

316
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,000
if i wanted to create more ozone in a

317
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:19,120
place that was starved

318
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,159
for vocs i would place those vocs

319
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,600
as close to the transportation centers

320
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,719
as i could and that's effectively what

321
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,240
has happened

322
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,639
and so i saw this and i thought well

323
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,399
we need to figure out whether it's large

324
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:33,679
enough that it could have an impact on

325
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,320
the regional air quality because that's

326
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:37,039
really what

327
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,278
the question is now if i wanted to do

328
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:41,599
this for say automobiles or new power

329
00:11:39,278 --> 00:11:44,240
plant or a new gas station

330
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,159
i could go to the epa scientists and

331
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,839
literature and look up what

332
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,759
you know the emissions would be from

333
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,839
burning so many tons of coal or

334
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:53,120
for burning so much fuel or for

335
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,040
decreasing an engine

336
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,720
and i could look up how much emissions

337
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:58,240
would go into the atmosphere

338
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,160
and then we have existing tools that

339
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,519
both the state of colorado and the epa

340
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,000
run that could predict

341
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,679
its impact on air quality and so when i

342
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,639
went to look at this for the cannabis

343
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:09,039
industry there was

344
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,039
no information available no emission

345
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:12,240
factors there to allow me to build an

346
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,599
inventory

347
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,600
no information to allow me to create

348
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,040
those inputs into an air quality amount

349
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,240
to allow me to predict

350
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:24,319
and so through a phd student

351
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,839
and some money from the national center

352
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,959
of atmospheric research in the state of

353
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,519
colorado

354
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,958
and some collaborators were able to for

355
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,639
the very first time

356
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,319
um measure what these emissions would be

357
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,399
build an inventory for the cannabis

358
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,040
industry for the state of colorado

359
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,000
and then used epa or approved air

360
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:44,000
quality models

361
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,839
to assess its impact on regional air

362
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,360
quality

363
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,399
so that's interesting so i just want to

364
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,680
make sure i'm understanding this

365
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,320
correctly so

366
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,439
is the issue it's not so much the vocs

367
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,079
that are coming from

368
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,680
the plant themselves it's when it's in

369
00:12:56,078 --> 00:13:00,799
combination with

370
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:04,399
uh the emissions from um

371
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:07,359
like you said um combustion or some sort

372
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,639
of um power plant or cars or something

373
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,000
like that

374
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,360
that's absolutely right and you also

375
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,078
need sunlight as well so it's a

376
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
combination of

377
00:13:12,078 --> 00:13:15,599
all three of those things yeah denver

378
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,480
right exactly um

379
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,040
and you know so in the atmosphere and

380
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,759
and so

381
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,120
it also depends it's a it's a very uh

382
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,519
complex chemistry

383
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,480
so in fact it's so complex that the

384
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,720
clean air acts

385
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,399
specify specifically that you have to

386
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,079
use an air quality model

387
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,600
to assess whether your controls are

388
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,759
going to work in the future

389
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,800
because there's all this combination of

390
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,439
emissions

391
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:40,559
chemistry and meteorology both winds and

392
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,199
sunlight

393
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,119
all forming together to in this really

394
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:46,719
complex non-linear chemistry

395
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
that's occurring in the atmosphere so

396
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,920
it's it's really difficult which is why

397
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,320
we run these air quality models right

398
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,240
because i couldn't tell you you know

399
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,000
just from looking at denver to tell you

400
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
what its impact would be because

401
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,360
of all the interactions of these things

402
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,040
right and so you're exactly right

403
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,039
you could also think of indoors as well

404
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:04,399
like if you had these vocs

405
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:06,480
you have a light source which could be

406
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:08,399
your uv lamps your grow lamps

407
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,920
and if you have any kind of combustion

408
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,159
source or you're bringing in nox

409
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,838
combustion sources from the outside

410
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,919
you have a possibility of also

411
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,160
generating ozone or particulate matter

412
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:19,039
inside your facility as well but you're

413
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,159
absolutely correct

414
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:24,159
the vocs themselves are not toxic

415
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:25,838
you can breathe them in at elevated

416
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:28,159
levels but as soon as

417
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:30,320
they mix in certain combinations with

418
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,600
what we call nitrogen oxides or nox from

419
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,079
combustion sources

420
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,079
in the presence of some sort of light

421
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:37,599
there's a potential for forming ozone in

422
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,759
particular matter

423
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,079
yeah so that's interesting so moving

424
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,958
forward will some attention need to be

425
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:45,278
paid

426
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,638
as to where these cultivation facilities

427
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:48,879
are placed

428
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:50,480
that's absolutely correct so you know we

429
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,559
have we know what's nice about this is

430
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,720
that we have the tools to do this right

431
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,599
uh you know anytime somebody wants to

432
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,278
install a new boiler or do a new

433
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,278
power plant right and they go for

434
00:14:59,278 --> 00:15:02,799
sighting there are tools that are out

435
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,799
there to predict

436
00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:06,159
what the impact on air quality water

437
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:09,278
quality is going to be

438
00:15:06,159 --> 00:15:11,519
if that facility was put in

439
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:13,439
right and so we have those tools epa has

440
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,278
those tools we uh the permitting

441
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,800
we have a nice long history of being

442
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:17,600
able to use these tools to develop these

443
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,799
things

444
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,800
what is missing is the input data is the

445
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:24,000
understanding how the cultivation of

446
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:26,479
these plants and

447
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,360
what the response and temperature and

448
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:31,360
light and type of strain and life cycle

449
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,199
contributes to these emissions and then

450
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,600
once we have that then yeah i could we

451
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,278
could

452
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,720
cite these things we could predict its

453
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:38,639
impact on communities

454
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,000
we could talk about setbacks we could

455
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:41,519
talk about um

456
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,278
you know what sort of controls would

457
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,959
would be required

458
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,278
and what those controls would do in the

459
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,879
future if we had this sort of so

460
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,360
it kind of all goes back to if we

461
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:53,278
understand how these plants behave and

462
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,360
what they emit into the atmosphere then

463
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:56,320
we can rely on tools that we already

464
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,320
have

465
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:59,759
to learn about those impacts on both air

466
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,000
quality on terpene drift

467
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,120
and also on odor but it goes back to

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,198
understanding

469
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,039
what is being emitted by these plants

470
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,000
and before my publication there was

471
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:11,039
absolutely nothing

472
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,799
out there on what is coming out of

473
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:17,519
these plants so how

474
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,559
does the emissions from cannabis compare

475
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,600
to

476
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,638
other commercially grown crops

477
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,040
yeah so as it turns out the amount of

478
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,240
emissions that come from plants are as

479
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,799
varied and wide as there are species of

480
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,879
plants

481
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,159
um just to give you an example an oak

482
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:36,480
tree admits

483
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,679
oh i think an order of magnitude higher

484
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,839
rates of isoprene

485
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,120
than a pecan tree right they're both

486
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,040
trees

487
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,639
and so there's a wide variability which

488
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,759
and this is why this has been a

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:50,079
subject of investigation and research by

490
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,759
epa noaa and a bunch of other national

491
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,039
laboratories all around the world

492
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,480
trying to understand these emissions

493
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:55,599
from all these different kinds of plants

494
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
and species

495
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,079
and so we have a nice database of you

496
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:03,039
know other commodity products

497
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,639
and other large species of trees because

498
00:17:03,039 --> 00:17:05,438
we have to run those in our air quality

499
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,759
models

500
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,880
now when it comes to cannabis as it

501
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,519
turns out

502
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,360
they contain a lot of the similar kinds

503
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:15,439
of what we call mono terpenes

504
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,119
which is a class of those terpenes and

505
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,079
some cesque terpenes

506
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,479
that we find in many other planets and

507
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:25,838
so there's nothing really unusual

508
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,120
as far as the type of monoterpene that's

509
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,038
being emitted

510
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,639
as far as the rate the amount the

511
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:32,640
magnitude that's being emitted

512
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,400
there i would say on average i mean

513
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,440
they're not the highest emitting plants

514
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,200
that we've ever seen

515
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,798
but they're also not the lowest emitting

516
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,240
plants that we've ever seen

517
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:42,400
um and so they're you know about an

518
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,160
average emitter now what's really

519
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,440
interesting about the cannabis plant

520
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,798
however that's

521
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,519
may or may not be different than other

522
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,879
plants um and that we've seen in our own

523
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,918
analysis

524
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,160
is that the amount so the rate

525
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,000
and the kind like you know the profile

526
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,600
of gases of monoterpenes that are being

527
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,798
emitted and cisco terpenes

528
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:04,240
varies wildly by strain so

529
00:18:02,798 --> 00:18:06,160
depending on the strain you can have a

530
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,919
much different amount

531
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,200
of monoterpenes and cisco terpenes being

532
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:12,240
emitted as well as

533
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,080
kinds of and we also see differences in

534
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,720
the life cycle whether it's a juvenile

535
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,480
or a flowering plant we also see subtle

536
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,720
differences whether it's grown indoors

537
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,240
or outdoors

538
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,759
and so that was actually the most

539
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,480
surprising finding i found in my

540
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:28,160
research is

541
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,880
how varied widely in composition and

542
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,919
rate among the life cycle and strain

543
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,840
that we see

544
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,160
and that means that there's not a

545
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,519
one-size-fits-all emission factor

546
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,519
um and every facility if you want to

547
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,960
build an inventory has to do what we

548
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:44,480
call a site assessment like which

549
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,679
specific strains are you doing

550
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,038
what life cycle are they are they're

551
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,000
being grown indoor they've been growing

552
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:49,519
outdoor

553
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,599
and because all those things affect the

554
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:53,440
emission rate and then once we have

555
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,279
that information then we can build in

556
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,120
control we can have impacts on air

557
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,798
quality on terpene drift and odor but

558
00:18:57,119 --> 00:19:00,719
again it goes back to understanding

559
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:02,639
those emissions

560
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,480
sure it makes complete sense that you

561
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
would see a wide variety in the

562
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,839
different strains

563
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,240
we see it in every other aspect of the

564
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,639
plant whether it be the height or the

565
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,960
the the size of the flowers the the

566
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,960
amount of the trichome so i

567
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,558
imagine that you know the emissions

568
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,279
wouldn't be any different

569
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:22,240
um now you said that there's a diff

570
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:24,558
difference in the

571
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,400
concentration in the different types of

572
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,240
of terpenes or emissions that the plants

573
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:31,280
are giving off are there any

574
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:33,200
uh molecules specifically that are

575
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,720
more troubling than others or is there a

576
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,919
certain combination that

577
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,279
that's more um a threat or is it kind of

578
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,640
all the same

579
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,558
well it kind of depends on the problem

580
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,280
that you're dealing with um so

581
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:45,918
what we're able to do in our own work is

582
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:48,000
um

583
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,160
we can give a full compositional profile

584
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,679
full characterization of every single

585
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,038
kind of molecule and there's

586
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,120
lots of different kinds of things it's

587
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:55,759
more than just the terpenes but there's

588
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:57,038
other

589
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,558
kinds of molecules that are being

590
00:19:57,038 --> 00:19:59,919
emitted by those plants and so the

591
00:19:58,558 --> 00:20:01,599
techniques that we have allow

592
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,038
us to measure all those things right and

593
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:04,879
so we have a good understanding of

594
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:06,079
almost every molecule that's coming from

595
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,320
that plant

596
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:09,839
and so then your your question was which

597
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:10,319
which molecules are the most important

598
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:11,678
and so

599
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,519
that depends on the question you're

600
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,320
trying to answer so for example

601
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,839
if we're looking at terpene drift one of

602
00:20:16,319 --> 00:20:21,279
the culprits that has been

603
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,798
um identified as as uh has the potential

604
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,399
to taint wine

605
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:26,400
is eucalyptol which is a type of

606
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,280
monoterpene and so

607
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:31,120
for um terpene drift we would model

608
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,918
eucalyptol that would be the um

609
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:35,439
the molecule of question right and since

610
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,120
we're able to measure all the molecules

611
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,880
i can say okay i know exactly how much

612
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,479
eucalyptus coming from each strain

613
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,400
and each plant and we can build an

614
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,679
inventory and we can model eucalyptol

615
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:45,919
going forward

616
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,320
if you're interested in air quality then

617
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,080
it's all the molecules actually so every

618
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,599
single one of those vocs

619
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,879
um can react um and and potentially form

620
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:58,079
ozone or particulate matter

621
00:20:54,880 --> 00:21:00,240
uh it has more to do with the um the

622
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,119
the alkene where the double bonds are so

623
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
the reactivity

624
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:04,399
and in fact in our air quality models we

625
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,200
treat almost all the mono terpenes the

626
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
same

627
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,640
from a reactivity standpoint and however

628
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,640
from an odor standpoint it's something

629
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,759
else altogether and so

630
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,720
we um things define that it's not the

631
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:19,519
terpenes

632
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,558
um that are a main driver for the other

633
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:21,918
although i think they

634
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,918
play a part in that we're still trying

635
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:25,840
to figure that out but it's a different

636
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,600
molecule that you'd have to track and

637
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:29,759
follow if you're interested in odor

638
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:31,038
um and so you know all three of those

639
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,640
problems right

640
00:21:31,038 --> 00:21:34,720
come down to what's being emitted by the

641
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,000
plant and so if you know which molecules

642
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:38,960
are emitted by the plant

643
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:41,200
you can target those you can model those

644
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:44,640
and you can also control specifically

645
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,919
for those molecules no and that

646
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,440
that's interesting you bring that up and

647
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,200
this might be a great way to kind of

648
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,558
pivot into

649
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,558
another area that your group is

650
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,599
concerned about which is odor

651
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:58,240
um and i know that recently your team

652
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,158
had either put out a study or a press

653
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,079
release i think i saw the press release

654
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,919
about that you have identified the

655
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,399
molecule

656
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,200
excuse me responsible for the skunky

657
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,960
odor

658
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,919
um associated with cannabis i was

659
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,519
wondering if you could speak a little

660
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,320
bit more to that

661
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,119
yeah so um you know there's been a lot

662
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:17,599
of

663
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,639
work trying to understand odor impacts

664
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,879
right and it's it's

665
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,759
certainly an issue it's definitely a

666
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,559
community issue

667
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:25,200
it's a real issue and i think it's one

668
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:27,918
that

669
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,400
you know responsible cultivation owners

670
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,159
should

671
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,240
keep an eye on uh and it's also

672
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,720
something that's coming down the pike

673
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,679
with regulations um you know whether

674
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,640
it's there already

675
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,000
or coming it's happening right and so

676
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,640
understanding this odor

677
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,200
issue has become a focus of our research

678
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
in our

679
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,720
in our company for for some time now um

680
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,319
and we've been

681
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,839
able to collaborate with some really

682
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,960
interesting folks um

683
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,079
who have also been in the odor space but

684
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,000
in other industries

685
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,918
not necessarily in the cannabis industry

686
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,440
like i think landfills and

687
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,720
and meat rendering facilities and so

688
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,200
um working closely with these folks

689
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,038
including iowa state university

690
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,400
we and our own techniques and our

691
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:13,359
ability to um

692
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,798
fully characterize the profile of these

693
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:18,079
plans

694
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,240
we use both odor experts and high-end

695
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:20,960
analytical equipment to try to identify

696
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,679
what we think

697
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:28,079
might be ultimately driving a large

698
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,840
source of the objective over cannabis

699
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:32,399
and so the compound we found was this

700
00:23:29,839 --> 00:23:33,199
thing called 3-methyl 2-butene 1-dial or

701
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,320
3-2-1

702
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,200
mbt it's a type of file so it's a sulfur

703
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:39,599
containing

704
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:42,159
compound and so we were able to identify

705
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,678
that and we've seen that in other

706
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,600
industries as well however that's just

707
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,679
kind of the beginning because

708
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:52,079
we're seeing all kinds of other

709
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,400
molecules that are also there as well in

710
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:57,599
addition to the mbt

711
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,519
and it's not quite clear how the

712
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:00,558
interaction between those terpenes and

713
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,440
vials

714
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:05,200
impact our perception of smell um so

715
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,558
there's a lot going on so we you know

716
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,720
i think it's just the start here that

717
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:09,119
we've been able to identify what we

718
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,919
think

719
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:12,319
might be one of the objective molecules

720
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,480
um

721
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:16,319
that um it makes a lot more sense in

722
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,360
assuming the monoterpenes were driving

723
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:19,678
odor which

724
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:21,278
didn't make sense just from you know

725
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,840
smelly monoterpenes on their own they

726
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,480
don't

727
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:25,199
have that odor but you know these styles

728
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
that seem to

729
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,440
make more sense to that and so currently

730
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,679
since we're able to identify the kind of

731
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
molecules there are we're able to adapt

732
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,840
our

733
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,440
control mitigation strategies to really

734
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:36,399
go after those sorts of molecules

735
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,360
prevent them from

736
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,798
leaving the facility at all yeah that's

737
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,879
that's really interesting

738
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:47,359
and i wonder if you could speak more to

739
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,799
the issue of odor in regards to cannabis

740
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,359
cultivation facilities

741
00:24:48,798 --> 00:24:53,200
in general what is sort of the risk to

742
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,199
cultivators if they don't have their

743
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,080
order under control

744
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,880
yeah yeah um so you know i'm not an odor

745
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,839
expert so

746
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,480
um i can't talk about um you know for

747
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:05,038
example

748
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:06,079
are there medical issues associated with

749
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,079
odor

750
00:25:06,079 --> 00:25:09,599
and so i'm not going to speak on but i

751
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,199
do know it's a nuisance right i mean at

752
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,678
the very minimal

753
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,600
people are not happy when they're

754
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,440
smelling um that odor and it's

755
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:22,399
strong odor um and it carries a very

756
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,440
very long way um and depending on how

757
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,640
you're growing if you've

758
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,480
i mean we've seen even juvenile strains

759
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,960
have odor issues right and i remember i

760
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,798
was saying that even juveniles and

761
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,640
and mature plants have different

762
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:36,240
profiles and different strains well

763
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,640
sometimes we come across a juvenile that

764
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,038
may have a higher you know

765
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,799
emission rate and those are skinky so

766
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:45,200
you could have at any point in time from

767
00:25:42,798 --> 00:25:48,240
your facility you know 24 7

768
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,880
you know odor issues um and so yeah you

769
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,278
know

770
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,600
you know i've heard enough communities

771
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,919
who are next to these facilities who are

772
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:57,759
being impacted by these odors to know

773
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,278
that it may affect your quality of life

774
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:00,158
right you don't want to be outside you

775
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,519
don't

776
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,600
you have to close up your windows and

777
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:05,839
doors um you know and

778
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,359
and some people do suffer you know

779
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:09,599
physical um

780
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,278
you know impacts as a result of

781
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:13,599
continuously smelling that order

782
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
so it's not a good neighbor policy right

783
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,639
nobody wants to be next to something

784
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,599
that stinks really bad

785
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,000
um and and it brings a lot of attention

786
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,399
uh

787
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
and issues um to a facility that might

788
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,679
normally

789
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,880
might try to be doing the right thing um

790
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,440
and and

791
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,200
because of that odor it puts all kinds

792
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,720
of scrutiny

793
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,798
on the facility's operation and what

794
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:36,000
it's doing um and they may have the best

795
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:37,599
intentions

796
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
and so you know it's a naturally

797
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:40,639
occurring process that comes from the

798
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:43,038
cultivation of these plants

799
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,038
um and there's really no way to get

800
00:26:43,038 --> 00:26:45,679
around it and so you have to control for

801
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:47,200
it and

802
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,798
you should strive to be a good neighbor

803
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,319
otherwise you're going to get

804
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:52,639
the scrutiny of not just the community

805
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,720
but also the regulators

806
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,640
yeah you mentioned regulators and i

807
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,519
think you mentioned it earlier too

808
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,320
have there been any you know regulatory

809
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,119
actions

810
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:04,879
in terms of requiring that cultivation

811
00:27:03,119 --> 00:27:06,719
facilities control their order or is

812
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,720
that still coming

813
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,880
well so you know the thing with the

814
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,759
legalization of recreational medicinal

815
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,559
marijuana

816
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,278
is that it's a it's really a patchwork

817
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:17,519
kind of

818
00:27:15,278 --> 00:27:19,278
place across the country right there's

819
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:20,960
no there's no federal

820
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:22,960
and even within the states sometimes the

821
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,240
counties have different ways of doing or

822
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:28,079
approaching it so

823
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:31,200
um you know are there places that are

824
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:33,199
regularly saying that you can't do odor

825
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,640
from a county yes i have seen that or

826
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,919
the places that don't have it yes i've

827
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,919
seen that as well

828
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,840
are there places where it's exempt for

829
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,278
example it's considered agricultural and

830
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,480
therefore it doesn't have an order i've

831
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:44,640
seen that as well so

832
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,720
you know it's all across the board right

833
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,720
um and it also depends on where the

834
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,278
facility is if it's an indoor girl like

835
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,519
in denver

836
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:53,679
there's more likelihood that they'll be

837
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:56,319
next door to residential communities

838
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,919
if it's grown outdoor on a farm you know

839
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:58,480
maybe their neighbor is a vintner and

840
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:00,080
not a

841
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,200
you know community so you know they're

842
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:02,720
more interested in the odor from their

843
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,159
tasting room than they are

844
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,159
you know from a you know community so

845
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:08,399
it's it's always

846
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,200
you know again just like the uh strains

847
00:28:08,398 --> 00:28:11,278
and how they're

848
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,720
site-specific i think dealing with this

849
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:14,960
odor issue is also a

850
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:16,000
specific thing because our approaches

851
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,600
are different depending whether you're

852
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,519
an indoor grow an outdoor group

853
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,959
a hoop house you know all these things

854
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:24,079
require kind of different

855
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,919
um approaches for control mitigation but

856
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,278
again if you understand the rates and

857
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,919
where you're what's coming out your

858
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:29,440
plans

859
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,080
you know you're already halfway there

860
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,840
and trying to combat that issue

861
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,678
yeah so what are some of the solutions

862
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,439
that you've developed in terms of

863
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:40,798
controlling order

864
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,840
sure so um buyer scientific has a number

865
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,480
of equipment

866
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,839
um that's available um for mitigation

867
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:49,278
technologies

868
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,759
um so uh this includes uh combinations

869
00:28:49,278 --> 00:28:53,200
of

870
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,278
um you know filtration systems where we

871
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,080
sequester odor molecules so molecular

872
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,200
scrubbing

873
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,439
which uses carbon um then we have uh

874
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,278
our patent vapor phase system that uses

875
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,320
waterless vapor technology and that

876
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:05,919
controls

877
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,000
uh some of these kind of what we call

878
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,880
fugitive odors odors that

879
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,359
kind of leak out or that there aren't um

880
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,120
uh

881
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,359
you know effectively mitigated by a

882
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,918
molecular filtration system right

883
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:20,719
um and so you know with the combination

884
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,200
of those two things that allows us to

885
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,839
um have a very good success for not only

886
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,519
capturing

887
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:27,278
you know preventing the majority of it

888
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:29,679
leaving in closed facilities

889
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:31,440
but also allowing us to deal with

890
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,278
facilities that aren't enclosed that

891
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:36,399
aren't conducive to for example

892
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:39,440
um carbon control all right um and so

893
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,839
and then we use um what we call a

894
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,759
coconut shell carbon uh so these are

895
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:45,199
campfill coconut shell carbon canisters

896
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,599
that we're using

897
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,600
we also have an option to include a

898
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:52,398
photocatalytic oxidation

899
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:54,000
as another means of reducing some of the

900
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:57,119
organics if you want to we want to do

901
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,720
that so that's in that system that

902
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:00,879
allows us to

903
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,519
uh you know uh mitigate these kinds of

904
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,559
odors and you know it also allows us to

905
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,720
capture the vocs that may contribute to

906
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,839
terpene drift or may contribute to air

907
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:14,399
quality impacts as well

908
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:17,278
yeah so are these air filters that are

909
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:20,239
sort of incorporated into the hvac

910
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:22,558
system they can be yeah so you know so

911
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,880
each um so we

912
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:25,918
do on-site solutions so it depends on

913
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,200
the system that

914
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,480
you know it depends on what how you're

915
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,720
growing or how you want us to be putting

916
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,120
but yeah i mean eventually what

917
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,519
we want to provide is um so what the

918
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:38,158
emission rates allows you to

919
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:39,440
quantify is what exactly is the breeding

920
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,000
rate of the plant right

921
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,558
what are they breathing out in what

922
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,240
amount

923
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,519
is that happening and so with that

924
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,120
information we can size our

925
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:47,839
instrumentation and our flow rates to

926
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,158
capture

927
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:52,000
what it breathes out we breathe in right

928
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,520
no more no less right you don't want to

929
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,079
do more because you're just wasting

930
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,599
energy

931
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,918
you don't want to do less because

932
00:30:55,599 --> 00:31:00,719
that'll lead to a violation right

933
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,720
and so um and so we work with the

934
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
facility to make either an integral part

935
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,200
of the hva system is a standalone

936
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,440
process

937
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,159
or however it works best with the

938
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,320
facility that we're dealing with

939
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,840
and what about outdoor facilities i

940
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:14,720
imagine that's going to be quite the

941
00:31:13,839 --> 00:31:16,480
challenge

942
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,038
right so that's where we have that our

943
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,159
vapor system and so it's a it's called a

944
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:25,278
stationary vapor system um it's quiet

945
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:27,440
and um it it's it creates an it's an

946
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,480
it's a mist but it's invisible miss uh

947
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,038
so you can't

948
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,000
really see it and and that has and that

949
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,558
it creates kind of

950
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,359
um uh you know like a curtain if you

951
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,359
will right

952
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:38,639
and so and then when the emissions from

953
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,639
the facilities

954
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,480
hit this kind of curtain it mitigates a

955
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:45,200
lot of eliminates the odors

956
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,599
from going downwind so in places where

957
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,038
you

958
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:51,359
can't control uh with um

959
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:52,398
carbon right which is like an open farm

960
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,240
or things like that

961
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:55,918
uh you can control with some of these

962
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
vapor systems that we've been able to do

963
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:59,679
outdoors so we've been successful in

964
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:01,518
mitigating odors both in

965
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,440
indoor outdoor grows and kind of mix

966
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:06,880
pros as well

967
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:09,038
so do you essentially set up a perimeter

968
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,679
around the grow and that sort of creates

969
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:14,720
that curtain so that if any molecules

970
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:17,840
interact with that they're sort of um

971
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:21,278
neutralized yep that's right wow that's

972
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:23,678
that's pretty that's pretty cool um

973
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,359
you didn't mention terpene drift as well

974
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,000
i didn't want to touch on that um

975
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:28,398
i'm i'm pretty sure that you you all

976
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,440
were

977
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,558
involved in a a lawsuit where i think it

978
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,200
was a

979
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:37,119
um a wine producer who was claiming

980
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,919
terpene drift from a nearby cannabis

981
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,319
facility

982
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:42,000
was tainting their grapes um i hope i

983
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,599
have that correct and if so i wonder if

984
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
you could speak a bit to that

985
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:46,639
yeah sure yeah so we were definitely

986
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,480
involved in that and so

987
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,919
um yeah that was the question and it

988
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,839
continues to be a question

989
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:54,240
and so they asked us to kind of

990
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:57,359
investigate and research that and so

991
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:58,720
we developed a scientific way of trying

992
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:01,199
to quantify

993
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,839
uh the amount of of material that would

994
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
end up

995
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:05,119
you know and whether it would or would

996
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
not taint um so

997
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:09,038
let me just back up a second so you know

998
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,359
there's been there's a published

999
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,038
literature out there that has shown that

1000
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,359
eucalyptol

1001
00:33:13,038 --> 00:33:16,558
which is a type of terpene and a terpene

1002
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,359
that is emitted

1003
00:33:16,558 --> 00:33:20,480
in the gas phase by um the cannabis some

1004
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:21,918
cannabis plants

1005
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,599
not all of them by the way but some of

1006
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,080
them and um

1007
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:28,000
eucliptol has been found when it makes

1008
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,158
its way into the wine process

1009
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,919
uh is has tainted the wine and the taste

1010
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
of the wine ruining the wine

1011
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,038
and so this is a known thing uh so

1012
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,960
things when you have vineyards that are

1013
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:38,558
near eucalyptol trees by the way and you

1014
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:40,480
get eucalyptol leaves

1015
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,319
as part of the harvesting those leaves

1016
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,120
make it through the processing and

1017
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,480
that's a large amount of eucalyptol oil

1018
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:50,239
that ends up in your

1019
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,278
in your wine and so uh when it was found

1020
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:54,079
out that eucalyptol

1021
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:55,200
is a molecule that is emitted by some of

1022
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:57,119
these cannabis plants

1023
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,558
then the question became is in

1024
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:59,359
sufficient quantities that it could

1025
00:33:58,558 --> 00:34:02,079
taint

1026
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:03,359
the grape tissue right so how do you

1027
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,678
find that out well again

1028
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,278
like i've been saying this whole podcast

1029
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,519
it goes back to the emissions right so

1030
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:10,878
if you know how much is being eucalyptol

1031
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:12,079
is being emitted by these plants for a

1032
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:13,918
facility

1033
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,960
you could input that into an air quality

1034
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:19,279
model that uses local meteorology

1035
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,159
you could then predict where those

1036
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:23,519
eucalyptol

1037
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:24,878
molecules end up and go and you can see

1038
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:27,838
how many of those end up

1039
00:34:24,878 --> 00:34:28,799
at the um the vineyard in question and

1040
00:34:27,838 --> 00:34:30,159
then you can

1041
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,159
calculate you can predict what the

1042
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,119
concentration of that eucalyptus would

1043
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,679
be

1044
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,960
outside that grape tissue and then you

1045
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,838
could predict okay well

1046
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,079
of that gas phase eucalyptol this is how

1047
00:34:39,838 --> 00:34:44,320
much that's absorbed by the grape tissue

1048
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:45,919
and that would be the amount of

1049
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,599
eucalyptol in your grape tissue

1050
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:49,440
and then we could compare that to the

1051
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:52,159
other studies that showed

1052
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,679
um taint and how much material they had

1053
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,679
in their grape tissues

1054
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:57,119
and see how close we would get to that

1055
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,760
right

1056
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,240
okay so what we did is we went on site

1057
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,240
or

1058
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,679
rather this was a take that back this

1059
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:05,358
was a facility that was being proposed

1060
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,199
so there was nothing on site so

1061
00:35:05,358 --> 00:35:09,440
what they did was they told us which

1062
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:11,358
strains that they were going to grow

1063
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,000
and then we went to our other various

1064
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:14,400
contacts in the business and we did our

1065
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,400
own

1066
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
measurements and develop leaf enclosure

1067
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:20,320
measurements and develop emission

1068
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:22,559
factors for those proposed strains

1069
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,760
he the facility told us how many plants

1070
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,799
they're going to build and we built an

1071
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,040
inventory

1072
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,720
then we took three years of neurological

1073
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,759
data from the closest weather

1074
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:33,358
station was at the proposed site uh and

1075
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:36,560
we ran three years of

1076
00:35:33,358 --> 00:35:39,119
model simulations using that meteorology

1077
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,719
um and predicted the you know the worst

1078
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,440
case kind of concentrations

1079
00:35:40,719 --> 00:35:44,959
at the location of the of the existing

1080
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:47,280
vineyard right

1081
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,519
and then i said okay of that this is how

1082
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,440
how much of it would uh deposit

1083
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:53,759
and then this is how long it would take

1084
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,880
at that rate under the worst conditions

1085
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,960
of meteorology

1086
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,480
uh for it to equal what was published

1087
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,760
for um taint

1088
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,358
and it ended up being i don't have the

1089
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,560
numbers in front of me unfortunately but

1090
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,119
i mean it was something

1091
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,279
on the order of a couple years for it

1092
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,160
for the amount that's been predicted

1093
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,079
to get to levels that were seen in other

1094
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:13,838
publications as far as taint

1095
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,839
um and so that's kind of what we we

1096
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,358
ended up with and so

1097
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:19,599
and it makes sense if you think about it

1098
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,319
right because yeah the the difference

1099
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,480
between what

1100
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,240
has been reported is that eucalyptol

1101
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,119
leaves which contain

1102
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,358
um pools of oil of eucalyptol and so

1103
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,039
that's a large amount of eucalyptol when

1104
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:32,159
you're in that concentrated oil form

1105
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:34,800
right

1106
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,078
what's coming off the cannabis um is in

1107
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,320
the volatilized form

1108
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:39,680
it's in the gas phase and these are

1109
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,000
volatile organic compounds so they don't

1110
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,319
want

1111
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,599
it's hard for them to go back into a

1112
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,119
liquid phase

1113
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,720
and once they're volatilized and they're

1114
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,240
in the gas phase they tend to stay in

1115
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,399
the gas phase

1116
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:52,000
and so very you know we have some that's

1117
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,639
being emitted some that makes it over

1118
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,320
there

1119
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:56,000
some that makes it on the grape tissue

1120
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,480
is but just not at

1121
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
really measurable quantities and that's

1122
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,800
what the predictions and then

1123
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,440
the data told us okay so in this example

1124
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,960
it's good news terpene drift is not

1125
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:12,240
tainting any grapes

1126
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,400
are there any other potential um

1127
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,439
scenarios where chirping drift

1128
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,480
potentially could be

1129
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,079
an issue for other agricultural crops i

1130
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,639
mean so i'm not sure

1131
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,240
because um you know that i'm not in that

1132
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,639
area where you know what what sort of

1133
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:27,838
uh terpenes may be harmful to what sort

1134
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,400
of plants the only thing we've heard

1135
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:30,639
about

1136
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,440
is is wine and specifically eucalyptol

1137
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:33,519
and maybe

1138
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,880
a couple others that have been shown in

1139
00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:36,639
the literature right

1140
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,240
um and so that's why that's an issue

1141
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,078
right now i mean there's still several

1142
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,279
things that we don't know about i mean

1143
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:44,320
for example

1144
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,359
uh you know i've measured we have this

1145
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:48,559
library right of um emissions factors

1146
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:50,159
from these strains but

1147
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:52,639
you know just in the state of colorado

1148
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,799
alone there's 600 plus different strains

1149
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:56,159
you know we have a number of strains but

1150
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,000
not nowhere approaching

1151
00:37:56,159 --> 00:38:00,159
the order of hundreds of strains right

1152
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,239
so there's still a lot of uncertainty

1153
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,000
and just within the strains that we have

1154
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:05,439
we see some plants with no eucalyptol

1155
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,679
emissions and some with right

1156
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,280
and so there's a lot of uncertainty just

1157
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:11,598
in the emission factors and then

1158
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,680
you know there's uncertainty as to you

1159
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:14,480
know how much is too much stain right

1160
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,319
you know

1161
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,760
there's this number that we got from

1162
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,160
this other study

1163
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,960
but you know that's a whole lot you know

1164
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:22,480
is there

1165
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
you know what's the minimum amount

1166
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,199
what's the threshold value like what

1167
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,280
would be the target

1168
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:28,399
and that's still kind of an unknown

1169
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,920
thing right

1170
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,039
there's a lot of research that still

1171
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:35,200
needs to be done to really understand

1172
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,719
whether this is an issue or not you know

1173
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,199
but from what i've seen and

1174
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,399
my gut tells me is that since these

1175
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:42,078
things are volatile

1176
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:44,000
and given the amount of emission rates

1177
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,320
that we see it's something that we

1178
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,440
should

1179
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:48,480
probably model and look at but

1180
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,880
you know just from the data that i've

1181
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:52,639
seen so far it may not be a huge huge

1182
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,920
issue right um not something that's

1183
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:57,118
really surprising

1184
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:58,639
or really popping out but you know

1185
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:00,079
unless we have some data we can't

1186
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,440
quantify these things we can't predict

1187
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,039
these things and this is what we're

1188
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,440
trying to do we're trying to fill in

1189
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:05,358
these

1190
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,039
answer these questions with some real

1191
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:08,639
data and some real science so that we

1192
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,759
have an understanding of whether things

1193
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:12,078
are an issue or not

1194
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,079
and to what extent they're an issue and

1195
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,320
you know and by the way

1196
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:18,079
those models were done with no controls

1197
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,039
right and so if we had controls in that

1198
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,440
facility

1199
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:22,960
uh we would even less eucalyptus would

1200
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,480
make it over to the vintner

1201
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,000
and lastly i don't know if you remember

1202
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,760
me saying this earlier but you know

1203
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,400
these monoterpenes like to react in the

1204
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,839
atmosphere

1205
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,000
in the middle of the day they have an

1206
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:34,159
atmospheric collapse time of a few hours

1207
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,440
so they're not just hanging around in

1208
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,118
the middle of the day they're actually

1209
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,559
reacting away pretty quickly

1210
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,838
and that's another thing that we didn't

1211
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:43,599
assume in the model so we had a very

1212
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:45,759
conservative upper bound concentration

1213
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:47,200
and we still didn't even get near

1214
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,960
what we would think would be shocking

1215
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:52,480
levels of eucalypton like grape tissue

1216
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,639
you know it's funny i've been doing this

1217
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,039
podcast for over a year now and i can't

1218
00:39:54,639 --> 00:39:58,879
tell you how many times guests have said

1219
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:00,320
we just don't know yet and there's still

1220
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,358
so much we need to learn

1221
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,760
um it's just such a common refrain

1222
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:08,159
in this industry which is what makes it

1223
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,680
so fascinating so exciting and

1224
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:11,199
why we love doing this conference every

1225
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,318

1230
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,519

social media or additional resources

1233
00:40:25,838 --> 00:40:28,239
that you think might be useful to the

1234
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,240
