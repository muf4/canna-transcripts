1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,280
I could good afternoon to you all and

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:10,480
many thanks for the introduction and

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:12,699
take you the organizers for the

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,330
invitation to talk here

5
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:17,919
I'm psychopharmacologist from Brazil

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,570
most of you probably don't know me my

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,699
main contribution to the field so far

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:24,338
with the dent ocation of the endogenous

9
00:00:21,699 --> 00:00:27,910
mechanism of allosteric modulation at

10
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:29,678
cb1 receptor but today I I dare to come

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,250
here to talk about a meta-analysis study

12
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:35,500
I did on the potential benefits of CBD

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,738
for epilepsy bringing together other

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,469
viable clinical data and I think it's

15
00:00:38,738 --> 00:00:43,899
appropriate to express my conflict of

16
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:47,020
interest because I recently acept a new

17
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:49,960
challenge in life so I'm leading product

18
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,500
development as a scientific director in

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,170
Entourage

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,359
fighter lab and Rogers a start-up

21
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,309
pharmaceutical company who is starting

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,309
to develop cannabis based products is

23
00:00:57,308 --> 00:01:02,409
starting from varieties of bad rockin in

24
00:01:00,308 --> 00:01:05,289
Brazil so we are the exclusive partners

25
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:07,479
of better con in Brazil and as I said

26
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,680
today I'm going to talk about this

27
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:13,600
meta-analysis studies of CBD on epilepsy

28
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,400
this whole field is being pushed by

29
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:18,569
stories like this one that you know

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:21,370
Charlotte fish a small child with

31
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:24,009
treatment-resistant epilepsy who started

32
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,320
to take and benefit from cannabis based

33
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:29,020
treatments and there are many other

34
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:31,989
stories like hers in Brazil we also have

35
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:34,449
our Charlotte Figi she's called any

36
00:01:31,989 --> 00:01:37,689
fissure his picture here with her family

37
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:39,670
and by starting taking these products in

38
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:43,090
particularly high CBD varieties of

39
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:47,099
cannabis she went from 64 conversions

40
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:49,480
per week to vertel to zero as his dad

41
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:52,209
norbert officially saying in this

42
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,760
picture and this is the patient zero in

43
00:01:52,209 --> 00:01:57,280
brazil and she was the first patient to

44
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:59,490
receive the authorization to import

45
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,680
cannabis based products in brazil and

46
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:04,780
from there on there's a lot of other

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:07,050
patients he's starting to import these

48
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:11,020
products I'm saying port because they're

49
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,908
not a single registered product on

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,620
Brazil right now for this for this

51
00:02:12,908 --> 00:02:17,389
children of course there there is

52
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,700
sativex which was recently

53
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:21,949
register but there's not a viable yet in

54
00:02:19,699 --> 00:02:23,509
the pharmacist and of course Sativex is

55
00:02:21,949 --> 00:02:26,750
not the best option for this children

56
00:02:23,509 --> 00:02:29,899
but right now we have over 2,000 people

57
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,150
being able to import cannabis based

58
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,950
products in Brazil and the majority the

59
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:39,500
vast majority of them are epileptic

60
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:41,569
patients I'd say close to 70% and they

61
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,969
have a lot of products of viable but

62
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:45,289
it's quite confusing at this time the

63
00:02:43,969 --> 00:02:47,810
patients don't know how to choose

64
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:49,909
they're pressing the clinicians the

65
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,770
doctors don't know exactly what is the

66
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:52,909
difference between the products and the

67
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,459
fact that these products are not

68
00:02:52,909 --> 00:02:57,469
standardized and this FDA warning

69
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,250
letters saying that they might contain

70
00:02:57,469 --> 00:03:03,169
contaminants herbicides and we cannot

71
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,239
trust in the levels of cannabinoids that

72
00:03:03,169 --> 00:03:08,149
they express in the labels don't help at

73
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:10,700
all so this is the gap we want to feel

74
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,620
with the belacan varieties and proper

75
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:14,659
pharmaceutical development in enter our

76
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:17,060
fighter lab and what's the behavior of

77
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,520
Brazilian clinicians right now they like

78
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,560
to say there's not enough evidence this

79
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,980
is very comfortable isn't it like a

80
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,979
patient is pressing you there's a lot of

81
00:03:23,979 --> 00:03:30,590
clinical reports study reports as sorry

82
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,329
case reports as we saw this morning but

83
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,189
the physicians are say there's not

84
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:37,250
enough evidence they're sitting there

85
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:39,949
comfortably in the chair and we rely on

86
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,739
just a few pioneers it's really just a

87
00:03:39,949 --> 00:03:44,449
handful or two of clean

88
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:46,250
Brazilian clinicians who are starting to

89
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,048
prescribe I'd like to name here Paula

90
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:50,030
doll Stella which is in the audience one

91
00:03:48,049 --> 00:03:53,620
of the pioneers treating over 100

92
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:55,860
patients with this kind of products

93
00:03:53,620 --> 00:04:00,120
[Applause]

94
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,680
and and really I mean people no matter

95
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,349
what we do people are starting to take

96
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,439
this this product and do they work I

97
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:08,789
absolutely agree we don't know exactly

98
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:10,109
especially because when it comes to

99
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,389
Herbert products they are not

100
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:15,270
standardized so it's really hard to

101
00:04:12,389 --> 00:04:17,969
raise evidence using these products but

102
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:21,150
so far we do have some evidence and

103
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:23,850
that's what I propose to do I search for

104
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:26,039
a child together with epilepsy and

105
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:29,640
cannabis cannabinoids cannabidiol all

106
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,980
sort of things to do a systematic review

107
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,930
and the idea was to really dig into this

108
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,750
data and see whether there is any

109
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:40,579
coherence between them and I could find

110
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:44,250
six papers in the first in the first

111
00:04:40,579 --> 00:04:46,109
search and I had another one by hand

112
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:49,860
which was impressed at a time and of

113
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:52,740
course a few data from the partial

114
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:56,189
public reports of GW so this is the

115
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,689
viable clinical data that I included in

116
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:00,269
the systematic review you can see

117
00:04:57,689 --> 00:05:02,370
they're all respected a neurologist

118
00:05:00,269 --> 00:05:04,229
centers mostly from us and they're

119
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:06,000
different designs you see surveys you

120
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,300
see with respective and prospective

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,189
medical records some with a lot of

122
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,660
patients some not and different

123
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,730
durations of treatment I'm going to

124
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,430
summarize in the next slides so the

125
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:18,990
characteristics of these studies are

126
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:20,970
children and adolescent adolescents with

127
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:23,850
treatment-resistant a Pepsi most of them

128
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,530
with a plastic encephalopathy including

129
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,750
reveille and an August Oh which is very

130
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:30,000
important in this case and in many many

131
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,550
cases patients write at least four

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,649
different treatments for up to twelve

133
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,780
different treatments before trying CBD

134
00:05:34,649 --> 00:05:39,449
oil so it's a very treatment resistant

135
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:43,199
population so to speak and it's it's

136
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:45,990
summer up to four 442 patients so it's

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,240
it's a lot of evidence with an average

138
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:50,850
freedom in duration of half a year and

139
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,379
the products are either CBD rich tracts

140
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:57,150
or purified CBD with a wide range why do

141
00:05:55,379 --> 00:05:59,699
those range which is always intriguing

142
00:05:57,149 --> 00:06:01,769
me like when we talk to the patients and

143
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:03,689
and the clinicians who are supporting

144
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:06,839
the patients the majority of the case

145
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:08,870
are in the low dose range one maybe to

146
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:11,509
five milligrams per kilo per day

147
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,480
but that's in clear contrast contrast to

148
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:17,750
what we see in the clinical trials

149
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:19,640
reporter reported so far so this is

150
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:22,699
something I wanted to understand using

151
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,740
this data so my main objectives is the

152
00:06:22,699 --> 00:06:26,959
this systematic review was to understand

153
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,509
whether there was any consistent

154
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,159
evidence of efficacy and safety but I

155
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:34,310
also tried to understand whether there

156
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:37,640
were difference between people using CBD

157
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,610
rich tracts in purified CBD of course

158
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,949
you know that cannabis phyto complex has

159
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,230
a lot of different compounds just to

160
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:47,930
mention the potential anti platic

161
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:50,870
compounds we have of course CBD and the

162
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:53,990
obvious thing GC is also anti platic

163
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:57,019
it's even more potent in CBD but of

164
00:06:53,990 --> 00:07:00,650
course it has more restrict therapeutic

165
00:06:57,019 --> 00:07:02,449
window and also we have GCV CBD CBN and

166
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:06,229
also non cannabinoid compounds like

167
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:07,550
linen all and mercy this is the table

168
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:10,790
that summarized the efficacy results

169
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,090
it's quite complex I just wanted to show

170
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:16,790
that they're different efficacy rates

171
00:07:14,089 --> 00:07:19,069
and and different in different studies

172
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,860
and all of them are complete so that's

173
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,060
why you see the numbers fluctuating in

174
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,879
the next slides but I'm going to

175
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,160
summarize it and make it very visual to

176
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,170
be easier to understand so first things

177
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,180
first there was clear evidence of

178
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:35,330
efficacy in a treatment resistant

179
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,629
population so when asked did the

180
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:41,029
treatment improve the seizures 66% of

181
00:07:38,629 --> 00:07:44,719
the patients or the parents said yes

182
00:07:41,029 --> 00:07:47,179
there was improvement so 66% if you

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,960
considered the traditional threshold of

184
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,759
improving more than 50% to be considered

185
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:55,609
a responder then this number is down to

186
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:58,099
35% so to say one-third of people are

187
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:02,120
considered responders when taking CBD

188
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:04,689
based medicines which is it's to a lot I

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,160
mean remember that we are talking about

190
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:10,009
treatment resistant population and one

191
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:12,470
in every three patients are benefiting

192
00:08:10,009 --> 00:08:15,709
from from then in a very rigorous

193
00:08:12,470 --> 00:08:18,650
clinical threshold there are evidence of

194
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:20,810
superior efficacy in this particular

195
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,669
population in dravet syndrome compared

196
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,160
to the general population

197
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:28,030
not for Alan August or at least in this

198
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:31,520
in this cohort in this population and

199
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:34,279
here come the more surprising things for

200
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,029
me when we split between the purified

201
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,899
CBD and CBD basis tracks there are a

202
00:08:38,029 --> 00:08:43,730
higher rate of improvement in herbal CBD

203
00:08:41,899 --> 00:08:45,709
as I nicknamed here in the slides just

204
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,170
to make it easy there a higher

205
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:50,870
improvement here than on purified CBD

206
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:53,329
this doesn't hold true when you consider

207
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,730
just the responders they're both high so

208
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:58,160
40% but there's no difference in this

209
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:00,889
case when you consider just people that

210
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:03,679
achieve more than 50% of improvement and

211
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:07,909
here comes the more striking thing at

212
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:11,509
least for me the average those reported

213
00:09:07,909 --> 00:09:13,459
by people taking purified CBD is close

214
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:17,149
to 20 milligrams per kilogram per day

215
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:20,030
whereas people taking CBD basis tracks

216
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,069
report an average joe's of 7 milligrams

217
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:25,220
per kilogram per day it's quite striking

218
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,720
isn't this is 3 times difference so for

219
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,490
me it means that there are something

220
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,420
else in these tracks which are

221
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:35,360
cooperating for the CBD if effects so we

222
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:38,769
would say that CBD is more potent when

223
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,779
given in fighter strikes then purified

224
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:45,559
of course there are adverse adverse

225
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:48,709
events reported Bay is quite often

226
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:50,629
overlap with efficacy so with close to

227
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:52,400
half percent of people report the

228
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,879
frequency but they also report adverse

229
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,399
event

230
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:59,419
most of them mild just a small fraction

231
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:01,429
of people report severe adverse events

232
00:09:59,419 --> 00:10:04,000
and the most common ones is habit

233
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:06,069
appetite alterations on Sunderland's

234
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,179
gastrointestinal pain diarrhea

235
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:12,950
alterations in weight fatigue and nausea

236
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:15,979
and rare and uncommon adverse events

237
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,540
also also happen but most of the time in

238
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:21,950
combination with other drugs valproic

239
00:10:17,539 --> 00:10:24,559
acid and kléberson as highlights when I

240
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:26,390
did this split in data form I'll adverse

241
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,029
events there are also this difference a

242
00:10:26,389 --> 00:10:32,059
high report of mild adverse events in

243
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:34,669
purified CBD than on CBD basis tracks

244
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:35,989
and this is also true for severe adverse

245
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:38,778
events

246
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:41,060
a higher report for purified CBD than

247
00:10:38,778 --> 00:10:43,850
horrible CBD and of course it's

248
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:46,009
important to mention this is all the

249
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:48,080
adverse events which you were reported

250
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:52,399
they're not necessarily attributed

251
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:55,550
directly to the drug that's a highlight

252
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:57,919
phone from one of the studies describing

253
00:10:55,549 --> 00:11:00,879
over 100 patients but I think it's a

254
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,399
very important one to be made is that

255
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,649
the the profile of adverse events was

256
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,589
already very high when people were

257
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:13,399
taking the anti avulsed medicines before

258
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:16,370
CBD and most of them almost all went

259
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,070
down when CBD was included just two of

260
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:20,899
them went up which is weight gain and

261
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,370
increases appetite which is not exactly

262
00:11:20,899 --> 00:11:27,440
a bad adverse event is is considered

263
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:30,289
beneficial one in some populations for

264
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,930
instance oncological pain patients and

265
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:36,949
last but not least other aspects that

266
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:39,409
are improved by CBD aspects of quality

267
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:42,379
of life even despite efficacy in some

268
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:44,600
cases people report improvement in

269
00:11:42,379 --> 00:11:48,679
alertness sleep or more behavior

270
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:51,259
language and motor skills stating that

271
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,778
the cognitive development of these

272
00:11:51,259 --> 00:11:57,528
children children is being improved by

273
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:59,838
the drug to conclude so I would say yes

274
00:11:57,528 --> 00:12:03,039
there are evidence CBD works for

275
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:05,360
epilepsy at least as far this

276
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,569
observational clinical data in treatment

277
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,028
resistant population is concerned it's

278
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:13,970
tract composition here is very very key

279
00:12:11,028 --> 00:12:16,039
so one must understand what kind of

280
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:18,259
cannabis train what is the stability of

281
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,099
the compounds quality controls must

282
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:24,588
improve a lot in this product and CBD

283
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,470
rich tracks seems to be a better choice

284
00:12:24,589 --> 00:12:29,750
over purified CBD at least in this

285
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,790
population in this meta analysis studies

286
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:33,559
here's my contact for those who are

287
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:36,620
interested to extend this conversation

288
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:40,069
and I would say that of course we will

289
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,850
benefit for controlled clinical trials

290
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,829
but not enough evidence is is not a

291
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,870
reasonable excuse anymore

292
00:12:45,828 --> 00:12:50,948
to prevent patients from have access to

293
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,948
these medicines thank you

294
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:58,479
you
