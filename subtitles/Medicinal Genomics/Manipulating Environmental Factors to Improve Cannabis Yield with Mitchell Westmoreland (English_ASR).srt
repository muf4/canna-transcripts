my guest today is Mitchell Westmoreland

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,420
Mitch is a PhD candidate working for Dr

31
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:39,900
Bruce bugbee in the crop physiology

32
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:43,019
laboratory at Utah State University

33
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,840
his PhD research focuses on whole plant

34
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:48,599
physiology and cultivation of medicinal

35
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,880
cannabis in controlled environments

36
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:53,759
he has published his research on

37
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,379
photobiology and plant nutrition and

38
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,519
high impact peer-reviewed scientific

39
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,859
journals

40
00:01:56,519 --> 00:02:01,140
I spoke with Mitch about the various

41
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,539
environmental factors that contribute to

42
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:07,019
cannabis yield specifically light

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,959
temperature humidity and CO2

44
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,719
Mitch does a great job explaining the

45
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,939
energy Cascade which is a way of

46
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,639
describing the underlying mechanisms

47
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,579
that plants use to convert photons to

48
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:23,579
energy and ultimately biomass

49
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,400
Mitch also explains how these factors

50
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,860
can be manipulated to not only increase

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,060
yield but also make better use of

52
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,819
resources

53
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,039
I really enjoyed this conversation and I

54
00:02:32,818 --> 00:02:38,039
expect we will see Mitchell on the can

55
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:40,019

56
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:42,179

73
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,519
good morning Mitch welcome to the

74
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,799
podcast fun sprung happy to be on her

75
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:42,719
all right so today we are going to

76
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,180
explore the different factors that

77
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:46,919
contribute to cannabis yield

78
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,140
um and I know you are a good person to

79
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:51,539
talk to because you've done a lot of

80
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,279
research into these factors and you

81
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:54,780
recently presented some of your work at

82
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
the Cannabis Conference out in Nevada

83
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,878
which is what got you on my radar so I

84
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,860
expect we'll have a good conversation

85
00:03:59,878 --> 00:04:04,500
about these factors and how they

86
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,319
contribute but before we do that I think

87
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,080
it might be wise to establish what we

88
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,719
mean by yield because I think sometimes

89
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,599
and at least in my mind the term gets

90
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:17,220
used interchangeably when talking about

91
00:04:14,598 --> 00:04:19,680
biomass or the amount of flour the plant

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,699
produces and cannabinoid concentration

93
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,840
so maybe when you're talking about yield

94
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:26,400
which of those are you're talking about

95
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,039
if not both

96
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:31,258
yeah I mean with any crop plant when we

97
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,360
talk about yield we're talking about the

98
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,879
harvestable part of the plant right so

99
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,400
for tomatoes it's the tomatoes for wheat

100
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:41,579
it's the seeds and so for cannabis

101
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:44,819
medical cannabis it's the flowers

102
00:04:41,579 --> 00:04:46,139
um now that sort of you know depends

103
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,759
there's a lot of it depends in the

104
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,740
Cannabis world if you're going for

105
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
extraction you might be using all that

106
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,079
biomass but generally when we talk about

107
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,138
yield we're talking about the mass of

108
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:00,719
flowers and in my mind one of the bigger

109
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,699
issues is all of the different metrics

110
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,400
that are used in the Cannabis industry

111
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:08,220
so you'll hear things like yield per

112
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:10,319
plant or yield per light yield per

113
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:12,540
fixture things like that

114
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:15,120
and if you've got sort of a standardized

115
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,400
plant size or a light source then that

116
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,978
can be useful useful but for the most

117
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:22,258
part those don't really tell you a whole

118
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:24,959
lot is it a big plant small plant high

119
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,240
pressure sodium light versus LED lights

120
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:29,819
and so we can take it you know one step

121
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,680
further and say yield per area right so

122
00:05:29,819 --> 00:05:33,478
grams per square foot ounce per square

123
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,379
foot and that gets us a little bit

124
00:05:33,478 --> 00:05:39,899
closer to being able to compare and see

125
00:05:37,379 --> 00:05:44,038
how a different facilities are

126
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:44,758
functioning But ultimately

127
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:46,620
um

128
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:49,080
you know even with that yield per area

129
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:50,939
did it take you eight weeks to get that

130
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:53,339
yield but it could be 10 weeks so

131
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:55,259
there's time component in there too and

132
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:59,159
so one thing that we're really trying to

133
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:02,220
push is this uh concept of photon

134
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:07,080
conversion efficiency so we're talking

135
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,360
about how efficiently a crop of cannabis

136
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:12,000
takes the light that it's given and

137
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,800
converts it into flowers

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,959
right

139
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,759
um that's kind of what I want to get in

140
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:20,038
today and we can break up that Photon

141
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:23,280
conversion efficiency into smaller

142
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,699
components to try and untangle you know

143
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:28,079
some of these environmental effects

144
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,478
um and then when we're talking about

145
00:06:28,079 --> 00:06:33,240
cannabinoid concentration that's

146
00:06:30,478 --> 00:06:34,560
typically what we would call Quality and

147
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,360
both of those things are important

148
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,918
yields for Quality sometimes you're

149
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,259
willing to sacrifice a little bit of

150
00:06:37,918 --> 00:06:43,318
yield if you can get your cannabinoid

151
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:45,538
concentration a little bit higher

152
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,639
but that's sort of the distinction for

153
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:50,459
me yield is flower Mass

154
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:53,639
quality is the cannabinoid concentration

155
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:55,439
or the terpene concentration

156
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:57,960
yeah and you make a good point in that

157
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:01,199
it it sort of the term is dependent on

158
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:02,758
what your goals are right because in

159
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,639
some cases if you're if you're looking

160
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,860
to extract the cannabinoids then

161
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:09,860
I guess the yield would be the amount of

162
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,900
cannabinoids contained in the flower

163
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:15,538
exactly yeah the cannabinoid yield and

164
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:17,519
so yeah as with everything and I'm a

165
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:19,439
scientist so I'm really hesitant to

166
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,719
speak in absolute but it it always

167
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,300
depends you know what is what is your

168
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,919
growth goal what capabilities do you

169
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,860
have what are your limitations and

170
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,180
ultimately what are you striving for

171
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,500
there's a lot of Depends in there for

172
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,720
sure

173
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,199
yeah okay and so now you made reference

174
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:40,319
to sort of this idea of how well the

175
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,939
plant converts the photons into actual

176
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,919
flowering and that there's a number of

177
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:45,418
different

178
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:47,399
mechanisms that contribute to that so so

179
00:07:45,418 --> 00:07:50,399
let's dive in let's let's talk about

180
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,478
those yeah so

181
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,418
you know

182
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,818
cannabis is just recently been

183
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:59,098
started to be studied right it's been

184
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:00,598
illegal for so long but now research

185
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,339
institutions are starting to get on

186
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:04,860
board

187
00:08:01,339 --> 00:08:06,719
and you know all what you'll hear all

188
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:08,280
the time is we don't know anything about

189
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,840
this plant because we haven't been able

190
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:12,179
to study it and to some extent that's

191
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:14,939
true but at the same time it's it's just

192
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,280
a plant right and so we know based on

193
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:19,918
Decades of research and other crops

194
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,198
what the basic nutritional needs are how

195
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:24,598
they respond to CO2 irrigation water

196
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:27,120
stress things like that and so

197
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:29,939
optimizing all of those things isn't

198
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,519
necessarily difficult

199
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:36,479
once you get all of the environmental

200
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:39,179
factors optimized nutrition CO2 watering

201
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,278
light becomes the limiting fact of the

202
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,019
growth and what's remarkable about

203
00:08:41,278 --> 00:08:45,720
cannabis and we'll get into this a

204
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:48,480
little bit more it can harm a lot of

205
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,560
light it really likes exceptionally High

206
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,100
light

207
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,739
um

208
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,659
but with that sort of perspective

209
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,980
nothing else is limiting other than

210
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:58,379
photons

211
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,899
how do we efficiently convert those

212
00:08:58,379 --> 00:09:02,759
photons into flowers which is ultimately

213
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:05,039
what we're going to harvest right

214
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,500
and so the very first thing that that

215
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,039
needs to happen and again at this point

216
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,600
we're considering a canopy a big

217
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:15,838
community of cannabis plants rather than

218
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,000
a single leaf or a single plant

219
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,940
the very first thing that canopy has to

220
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,860
do is absorb those photons right you've

221
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,899
got a small plant that's not taking up

222
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:26,519
the entire ground area there's photons

223
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:29,759
that are just hitting the floor and

224
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:32,179
those aren't driving in growth right so

225
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:34,500
the very first step is capture those

226
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:37,500
photons and we'll talk a little bit

227
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,958
about how the environment can influence

228
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:43,440
that here in a little bit but once we've

229
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:45,799
captured those photons

230
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,399
some of them are going to be absorbed by

231
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:49,679
non-photosynthetic pigments like

232
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:51,419
anthocyanins things like that some of

233
00:09:49,679 --> 00:09:52,679
them get reflected right we see the

234
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:55,500
plants they're green

235
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:58,079
and so the next step is how efficiently

236
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:01,980
do we take those photons and use them to

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,220
drive photosynthesis to fix CO2 from the

238
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,259
atmosphere so step two is photosynthetic

239
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:11,339
efficiency

240
00:10:07,259 --> 00:10:14,159
now the next one is you know sometimes

241
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:16,860
I'll mention this in talks and sometimes

242
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:19,458
I won't uh but the next one is carbon

243
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:22,919
use efficiency this isn't a very

244
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:26,039
well-known metric but once the plants

245
00:10:22,919 --> 00:10:29,278
fix that carbon through CO2 some of it's

246
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:30,778
going to be respired again as CO2 right

247
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:33,899
they've got to make DNA they've got to

248
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:36,360
make proteins uh

249
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,500
so the carbon use efficiency this one's

250
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,839
really hard to change with the

251
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:42,000
environment it's it's remarkably

252
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,160
consistent across species and

253
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,039
environmental conditions the plants will

254
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,039
respire in proportion to how much CO2

255
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:54,059
they fix through photosynthesis

256
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:57,599
the last one is one that can be heavily

257
00:10:54,059 --> 00:11:00,299
influenced by the environment and this

258
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,000
is sort of the last component that gets

259
00:11:00,299 --> 00:11:06,179
us to yield and that's carbon

260
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,000
partitioning efficiency or harvest index

261
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:12,359
so how much of that carbon that's fixed

262
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,220
and stored in biomass is put into the

263
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,740
flowers that's ultimately what we're

264
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,620
what we're interested in

265
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,600
so what's what's great about these four

266
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,578
components and we call it the energy

267
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,860
Cascade model because we're following

268
00:11:23,578 --> 00:11:28,739
the energy from the photons all the way

269
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:31,379
down into the flowers these are all

270
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:35,180
efficiencies so it's an input over an

271
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:37,980
output or an output over an input right

272
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,319
and then you know with a little bit of

273
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:43,259
behind the scenes math and some units

274
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:46,200
conversions we can multiply all of these

275
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:48,360
values together and get that Photon

276
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:52,440
conversion efficiency

277
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,959
and that has units of grams of flour per

278
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,600
mole or photons you know everybody

279
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:59,278
measures their ppfd and micro multimeter

280
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,019
squared per second and I think most

281
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:03,360
people are familiar with the concept of

282
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:05,639
Daily Light integral which is the total

283
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,539
amount of light that's received

284
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:10,799
um

285
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,799
over the course of a day and

286
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:15,240
that's ultimately how we how we arrive

287
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,519
at that value and what's great about

288
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,860
this is it doesn't matter how long you

289
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,560
brew the crap crop it doesn't matter if

290
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:24,060
it was 10 000 square feet or a hundred

291
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,639
thousand square feet

292
00:12:24,059 --> 00:12:28,979
this sort of normalizes all of that and

293
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,799
we could start to compare across

294
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:35,778
facilities and how efficiently they're

295
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:35,778
using the light to make the flowers

296
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:40,799
so if I understand correctly

297
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:43,379
what you're really driving at is to be

298
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:47,159
able to say okay if your input of light

299
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:51,179
is X you would expect at the end to get

300
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:54,600
an output of Y correct exactly exactly

301
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:56,578
and you know what's that's a

302
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,459
great point because when we arrive at

303
00:12:56,578 --> 00:13:02,519
this Photon conversion efficiency grams

304
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:06,419
per mole we can take you know whatever

305
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:09,360
DLI we print at input and multiply it by

306
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:12,319
that value to get the expected yield for

307
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,419
theoretical yield so we can start to

308
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,220
sort of put numbers to these now they

309
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:20,819
you know I know that proton conversion

310
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,220
efficiency isn't a very well-known

311
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,200
metric but I'll just to give you some

312
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:29,220
perspective for cannabis we typically

313
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:31,680
see something between 0.2 and 0.3 grams

314
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,600
per mole and then again with some with

315
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:36,659
some math and some units conversions you

316
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,180
can take a DLI input and predict what

317
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,120
your yield should be in grams per square

318
00:13:39,179 --> 00:13:45,958
meter or Brands per square foot

319
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:48,360
right and so then if if by the end your

320
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:51,000
output isn't what you expected you could

321
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:53,120
sort of Trace things back and kind of

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,559
see where you're kind of leakage was

323
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,620
exactly you can go back to those four

324
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,239
components you know and say was my

325
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,820
Photon capture low was the

326
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,480
photosynthetic proficiency low

327
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,959
um

328
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:10,079
or was there something else limiting

329
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,059
like water or nutrients or CO2 something

330
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:14,338
like that

331
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:15,838
but it's it's a it's a really elegant

332
00:14:14,339 --> 00:14:18,540
model

333
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,000
um mostly for its Simplicity you know

334
00:14:18,539 --> 00:14:22,439
it's kind of hard to talk about I wish I

335
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,059
had a whiteboard so I could go through

336
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,779
it and show the units

337
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:27,958
um

338
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:30,659
but it's it's a very simple way for us

339
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:34,679
to start to understand how the

340
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:37,379
environment influences yield and

341
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:40,439
ultimately if there is an effect of the

342
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:43,198
environment on yield it has to come back

343
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,360
to one of those four components was it

344
00:14:43,198 --> 00:14:48,838
Photon capture photosynthetic efficiency

345
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:50,579
and so once you have that once you have

346
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,320
a good understanding of that you can

347
00:14:50,578 --> 00:14:54,899
sort of get away from all of the snake

348
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,800
oil claims that you know this product is

349
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,000
going to boost your yield by 40 you know

350
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,099
on and on

351
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,078
and you can ask yourself okay well which

352
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,000
of these four components is this product

353
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:09,000
actually affect them

354
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
now

355
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,000
I have to imagine that genetics play a

356
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,379
big role in this too right with all the

357
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,220
different strains they're going to sort

358
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:23,000
of have different uh

359
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:26,639
different roles to play big time and

360
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,919
with the with the genetics

361
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,560
you know the the two components that

362
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:34,319
it's most likely to influence is the

363
00:15:31,559 --> 00:15:36,138
photon capture efficiency right is it a

364
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,699
blank that sort of spreads out

365
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:41,519
horizontally to capture more light or is

366
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:45,120
it more of a tall slender growth habit

367
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,278
does it have thick leaves or thin leaves

368
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,860
um that can have big effects on how

369
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,259
efficiently that crop is absorbing that

370
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,480
light and then the other one is carbon

371
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:56,819
partitioning efficiency you know some

372
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,360
varieties just put more of that

373
00:15:56,820 --> 00:16:02,220
uh carbon that they fix into flowers

374
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:04,919
some of them don't make a whole lot of

375
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,720
leads and stems on the other hand some

376
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,179
of them make a whole lot of leaves and

377
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,680
stems and that's not what we necessarily

378
00:16:09,179 --> 00:16:13,559
interested in when we're talking about

379
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:16,259
high value Medical phone numbers

380
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:19,739
interesting okay

381
00:16:16,259 --> 00:16:21,659
go ahead but the other two were really

382
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:24,299
fundamentally

383
00:16:21,659 --> 00:16:27,179
um limited by physiology and they're

384
00:16:24,299 --> 00:16:29,039
well understood at the basic biology

385
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:31,078
level

386
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,578
um genetics aren't going to have a huge

387
00:16:31,078 --> 00:16:35,638
impact on those

388
00:16:32,578 --> 00:16:38,219
interesting okay so so let's talk about

389
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,019
environment how is the environment

390
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:42,240
affecting sort of these different

391
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,299
underlying mechanisms and I mean I know

392
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,399
that's sort of broad so maybe you know

393
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:50,039
you could you could start with you know

394
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,799
light or or whichever one you think

395
00:16:50,039 --> 00:16:53,698
yeah let's let's start with light

396
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,439
um

397
00:16:53,698 --> 00:16:57,659
and when we're thinking about light and

398
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
you sort of uh hinted at this earlier

399
00:16:57,659 --> 00:17:02,879
there's sort of three characteristics

400
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,000
that we're interested in the quality or

401
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:08,279
the Spectrum the color of the lights and

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,740
the quantity of the light or the

403
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:13,379
intensity and then there's also the

404
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:14,818
duration or the photo period

405
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,620
and

406
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:19,199
you know I'll just kind of pick out some

407
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:23,219
of the the highlights let's start with

408
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,058
light quality so the colors of Lights

409
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:27,058
um

410
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:29,579
Photon capture uh spectral quality can

411
00:17:27,058 --> 00:17:31,558
have a big effect on photon capture and

412
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:35,099
I think people are starting to to get a

413
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:37,619
lot more of this but especially far red

414
00:17:35,099 --> 00:17:40,319
light has received a lot of attention

415
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:43,099
over the over the last few years but

416
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:47,058
it's well known to cause Leaf expansion

417
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:49,740
and increase Photon capture

418
00:17:47,058 --> 00:17:53,759
unfortunately you also get a lot of stem

419
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:56,038
elongation along with it so for cannabis

420
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:57,779
it's not often used for this purpose but

421
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:59,519
for things like lettuce it's extremely

422
00:17:57,779 --> 00:18:01,619
valuable to give them some Far red light

423
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,038
so they expand and capture that light

424
00:18:01,619 --> 00:18:04,038
faster

425
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,500
um green light is an interesting one

426
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,080
that's also starting to get some more

427
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,819
recognition you know people typically

428
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,740
think that green light isn't used by

429
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:16,740
plants we see that they're green so they

430
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:19,380
don't absorb any of it which is not in

431
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:21,599
fact true they do absorb and use green

432
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,340
light for photosynthesis and one of the

433
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:25,379
valuable things

434
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:28,379
about green light is it can penetrate

435
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:30,059
deeper into the canopy whereas red and

436
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:31,620
blue light tends to get absorbed on the

437
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:33,599
outside and you have a whole bunch of

438
00:18:31,619 --> 00:18:36,538
stuff in the middle that's not getting

439
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,759
uh that's not capturing any light and so

440
00:18:36,538 --> 00:18:42,298
those green photons can penetrate deeper

441
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:43,859
and increase that Photon capture a

442
00:18:42,298 --> 00:18:45,839
little bit

443
00:18:43,859 --> 00:18:47,219
those are sort of the big ones with

444
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:50,699
light quality you know in terms of

445
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:53,339
photosynthetic efficiency there's some

446
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:55,019
small effects for the most part you've

447
00:18:53,339 --> 00:18:57,720
ever heard of the McCree curve it's

448
00:18:55,019 --> 00:18:59,339
often cited as you know the relative

449
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,600
photosynthetic proficiency of different

450
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,259
colors

451
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:03,418
um

452
00:19:01,259 --> 00:19:07,879
but under high light intensity that

453
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:07,880
tends to be a pretty minor minor effect

454
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:14,819
and then going on to quantity uh this

455
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:16,259
one's this one's an interesting one and

456
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:18,359
it's kind of counterintuitive when we

457
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:21,119
start to think about proton inversion

458
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:23,819
efficiency

459
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,459
so if we if we think about the

460
00:19:23,819 --> 00:19:28,558
photosynthetic efficiency so how much of

461
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,440
those absorbed photons are the plants

462
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:34,139
putting into

463
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:38,038
photosynthesis to fix carbon and you

464
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,740
know if I were to say to you you know

465
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:42,839
if I give my plant more light what's

466
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,579
going to happen to you the obvious

467
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:47,099
answer is the yield is going to go up

468
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,439
right but when we think about the

469
00:19:47,099 --> 00:19:52,259
efficiency with which they're converting

470
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,360
that light it actually goes down with

471
00:19:52,259 --> 00:19:57,000
increase in life intensity and the

472
00:19:54,359 --> 00:20:00,479
analogy that I like to use is imagine

473
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,400
you're drinking from a faucet right

474
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,019
you're going to get most of the water

475
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,120
that's coming out of that faucet ready

476
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:09,119
to get the Melt right on it now imagine

477
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:11,459
you got a fire hose up to your mouth the

478
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:13,918
quantity is way larger and you might be

479
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,798
getting more on an absolute basis but

480
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,799
you're also wasting a whole lot right so

481
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:22,079
the efficiency with which you're

482
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:24,839
ingesting that water goes down so that's

483
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:27,058
the same or photosynthetic deficiency

484
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:31,220
you just dump and light on the plants

485
00:20:27,058 --> 00:20:31,220
this will be efficiency goes down

486
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:38,279
so there's a sweet spot there you want

487
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,538
to be giving it enough to to generate

488
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,678
big flowers but you don't want to be

489
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,919
wasteful

490
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:46,380
well it again it comes down to what is

491
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,538
your goal do you want to maximize your

492
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,000
yield per square foot or your yield per

493
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:52,619
area dump the light on there because

494
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,519
that's going to keep going up and up and

495
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:55,798
up

496
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,720
um if you're interested in maximizing

497
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,460
the efficiency if you've got to pay for

498
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,279
those photons for example or other

499
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:05,819
electric lights you might try and find a

500
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,319
sweet spot where uh you're not wasting

501
00:21:05,819 --> 00:21:10,500
too much but you're still getting high

502
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:15,379
enough yield per square foot to to reach

503
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,380
your goals so again it depends

504
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,900
and then the photo periods you know this

505
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:20,519
is something that's starting to be

506
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:22,019
increasingly studied in cannabis for

507
00:21:20,519 --> 00:21:24,599
right now

508
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:25,980
um most people still do the the 1212

509
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,538
although there's been some nice papers

510
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,700
that have been coming out

511
00:21:27,538 --> 00:21:32,940
um that is sort of starting to challenge

512
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,980
that concept but really this this has

513
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:37,140
the biggest effect on carbon

514
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:39,839
partitioning right once we give those

515
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:42,120
plants a short day whether it's 12 12 13

516
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:45,720
11 they're going to start shifting that

517
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,599
carbon into flowers maybe if we go less

518
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,940
than 12 hours we might be shifting more

519
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:52,379
of that carbon in the flowers right

520
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:54,960
right

521
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:55,679
and then saving on those photons too

522
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,220
right

523
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,400
yeah exactly exactly you know and

524
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:05,519
a circle back kind of to light quantity

525
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:08,400
really quick you know ultimately what's

526
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,500
driving growth is the Daily Light

527
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,019
integral the total amount of photons

528
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,538
that are falling every single day you

529
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:17,038
know we're out here in Utah in the

530
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:18,298
Western United States we don't get a lot

531
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:20,038
of rain

532
00:22:18,298 --> 00:22:22,079
um but when we do we're not interested

533
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,879
in how many raindrops are falling every

534
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,279
single second we want to know how much

535
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:31,080
we got over the course of the day over

536
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:33,298
the week or over the entire year and so

537
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:36,720
if you've got a variety that will still

538
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:39,240
flower under a longer photo period you

539
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,600
can give the plants a lower light

540
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,440
intensity a lower ppfd for a longer

541
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:49,079
period of time and get the same DLI

542
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:51,179
but the photosynthetic efficiency is

543
00:22:49,079 --> 00:22:52,460
going to be higher because they're under

544
00:22:51,179 --> 00:22:55,019
a lower

545
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,319
light intensity that's looking for my

546
00:22:55,019 --> 00:22:59,460
faucet rather than a fiber hose so I

547
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,500
think there's a lot of potential to

548
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:04,079
start breeding for and selecting

549
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,759
varieties that flower under a longer

550
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,220
photo Boot and we've got the you know

551
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,599
the autoflowers and things like that but

552
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,900
I think there's a lot of potential there

553
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,819
to to optimize both yield per area as

554
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,419
well as the efficiency the yield

555
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,418
efficiency

556
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,798
so those are kind of the big ones with

557
00:23:20,339 --> 00:23:24,720
light light is kind of the sexiest of

558
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,359
all the environmental factors right now

559
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,640
like nutrition

560
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:31,678
but you know generally what we say is if

561
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:33,600
you want to get high yields

562
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
give them highlight and at that point

563
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:39,779
respectful quality as a as a really

564
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,400
small effect on especially yield but

565
00:23:39,779 --> 00:23:43,399
also inhabinoids and quality

566
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,460
no and you make a good point that light

567
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,400
is you know one of the more more popular

568
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:52,220
more well-known uh of these factors but

569
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,440
with that said are there sort of

570
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:57,120
misconceptions or sort of maybe false

571
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,500
narratives that are out there in terms

572
00:23:57,119 --> 00:24:02,038
of light

573
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,640
uh I think most of those come down to to

574
00:24:02,038 --> 00:24:07,379
Quality to cannabinoid concentration

575
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:09,780
um you know the one that's sort of

576
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,280
persisted since the 1980s is this idea

577
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,619
of UV

578
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,879
um and we published a paper earlier this

579
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,558
year and there's there's been some other

580
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,140
papers that have come out of uh

581
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:22,079
University of Guelph that have really

582
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:24,900
not shown not been able to repeat the

583
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,899
initial results that found that you be

584
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:29,580
increased when appenoids

585
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:31,080
um and so I think I think people are

586
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,298
starting to get on board with that and

587
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:36,119
sort of to ditch the idea that that UB

588
00:24:33,298 --> 00:24:39,599
is the Magic Bullet to give your plants

589
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:41,158
you know like cannabinoids

590
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,439
oh

591
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,740
that's that's sort of the biggest one I

592
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,798
I just think generally speaking spectral

593
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:52,259
quality it's too much focus and light

594
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:54,058
intensity doesn't you know what we

595
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:56,940
always recommend is

596
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:58,558
get a light source that is if you're

597
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,480
growing under electric lights get a

598
00:24:58,558 --> 00:25:02,639
light source that's super efficient

599
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,380
gives you a lot of photons but not a lot

600
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:09,960
of energy and a light source of the high

601
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:12,419
output a high protein output don't worry

602
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,980
about the spectral quality so much

603
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,460
you should really be focused on

604
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:19,980
electrical efficiency and that Photon

605
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,538
conversion efficiency

606
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,058
yeah and it's interesting you say that

607
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:25,619
too I mean I've I've dabbled with kind

608
00:25:24,058 --> 00:25:27,119
of home cultivation a little bit and

609
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:29,099
I've definitely walked the floors of

610
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:31,259
different trade shows and everything and

611
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:33,119
when you look at the light uh the

612
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:34,859
different light manufacturers it seems

613
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,778
like they really focus in on this sort

614
00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,278
of spectral quality they have the graphs

615
00:25:36,778 --> 00:25:40,679
and everything like that but you're

616
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:42,659
saying that's not as important as just

617
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:44,940
the amount of photons that they're

618
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:46,740
getting yep and I think I think some of

619
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:49,019
these lighting companies are starting to

620
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:50,579
to see that but with the way the

621
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:52,798
Cannabis industry is going you know

622
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:55,918
prices are falling people have got to

623
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:57,658
start doing this more efficiently more

624
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,340
cost effectively if they want to stay in

625
00:25:57,659 --> 00:26:02,220
business if you're growing under

626
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:04,740
electric lights that the only way that

627
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:06,480
you're going to do that efficiently is

628
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:09,120
by sourcing an efficient light source in

629
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,360
your high profile output you know after

630
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:15,839
that it can maybe be some some small

631
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:18,778
effects on anabinoids you know I sort of

632
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:20,339
use the analogy of the microscope if

633
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:22,859
you've ever been inside science class

634
00:26:20,339 --> 00:26:24,298
you've got a course Focus knob and I get

635
00:26:22,859 --> 00:26:25,918
you kind of up and down and close to

636
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:27,960
where you need to be and you've got to

637
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,840
find Focus knob to kind of dial it in

638
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,880
not find Focus knob as sort of the the

639
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:35,220
spectral quality that can maybe have a

640
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,440
small effect but really

641
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,538
that efficiency in the proton output is

642
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,720
dispute

643
00:26:39,538 --> 00:26:45,538
interesting yeah good analogy

644
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,480
um so with light too and something that

645
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:51,778
you mentioned earlier was this idea of

646
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:53,940
broader Leafs or plants that sort of

647
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:56,819
spread out and can absorb more light

648
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:59,100
could theoretically you know convert

649
00:26:56,819 --> 00:27:02,899
more of that into flour so what about

650
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:06,480
the practice of pruning or lollipopping

651
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:08,940
plants to kind of increase flowers that

652
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,319
seems to be kind of counterintuitive

653
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,759
yeah

654
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,278
um you know this is another thing that's

655
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:15,900
that's really a Hot Topic in cannabis

656
00:27:14,278 --> 00:27:17,400
people love to prune their plants and I

657
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,259
get it I mean I love to be Hands-On with

658
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:21,298
my plants too

659
00:27:19,259 --> 00:27:24,359
um

660
00:27:21,298 --> 00:27:26,519
I think oftentimes the the daily thing

661
00:27:24,359 --> 00:27:28,798
is overdone you know if you can look

662
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:31,200
underneath your crop of cannabis and you

663
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:34,259
can see light coming through it that

664
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,019
means you're wasting photons right

665
00:27:34,259 --> 00:27:38,819
but at the same time if you can kind of

666
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:41,278
pinch and manipulate your plants to

667
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:43,859
encourage them to grow out while still

668
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,179
keeping that that sea of green as they

669
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:47,219
call it

670
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:50,100
um you know you can

671
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:51,960
sort of force the plants to capture more

672
00:27:50,099 --> 00:27:55,259
of those photons which you'll end up

673
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:57,298
with with a higher yield right the other

674
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:58,919
way you can do that is with planting

675
00:27:57,298 --> 00:28:00,538
density you know you see all the time

676
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:03,659
people start out with really small

677
00:28:00,538 --> 00:28:05,339
plants that are super uh super spaced so

678
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:07,860
you've got a lot of light there early on

679
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,899
that's just falling on the ground so you

680
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:11,099
can give your plants a shorter veg pack

681
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,019
them in there

682
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,819
prune them and pinch them to keep them

683
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:18,839
short and to sort of fill that canopy

684
00:28:16,819 --> 00:28:21,480
automatically start out with a higher

685
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,220
Photon capture uh more of that light is

686
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,839
being absorbed more that's going in the

687
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:30,120
flowers so these cultural techniques are

688
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:32,699
another way to sort of influence these

689
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:35,579
these four components but again it comes

690
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,460
down to one of those four components for

691
00:28:35,579 --> 00:28:40,798
the most part it's Photon capture

692
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,778
yeah and the way it was always explained

693
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:44,940
to me was that you know you want to get

694
00:28:42,778 --> 00:28:47,700
rid of those big fan leaves to get more

695
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,460
light to the actual bud sites to grow

696
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:53,220
those does that make sense or does the

697
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,019
plant really care or is it just going to

698
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:58,679
kind of convert whatever energy it

699
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:59,639
absorbs from those leaves to to all the

700
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,679
flowers

701
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:05,520
yeah I mean

702
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:07,740
there's emerging evidence that

703
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,240
flowers that are lower in the canopy

704
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:11,640
that have been shaded the entire time

705
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,500
and have a lower cannabinoid

706
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,820
concentration we've seen it in our lab

707
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,419
and I know that other people have seen

708
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:20,879
it too so I think there is something to

709
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:23,700
delivering light to those flowers in

710
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:25,980
order to maximize the cannabinoids

711
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:28,259
but

712
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,899
the the thing to keep in mind is that

713
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:33,119
you can you can make sure that you have

714
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:34,979
all of your flowers at the top of the

715
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:38,579
canopy absorbing the light without

716
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:40,620
sacrificing Photon capture and so one of

717
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:43,859
the things that we do and a lot of

718
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:46,739
people are starting to do is

719
00:29:43,859 --> 00:29:50,398
a relatively short veg period and then

720
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:53,759
multiple pinches even after you know 10

721
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:57,178
to 14 days of short days and again what

722
00:29:53,759 --> 00:30:01,200
that does is spread the canopy out and

723
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:03,659
it promotes fewer but smaller or more

724
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,819
numerous but smaller flower buds at the

725
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:08,880
top of the canopy that are absorbing the

726
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:11,939
light you know a single leaf can absorb

727
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:13,740
like 95 of the protons that hit it so

728
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:16,919
when you've got flowers that are down

729
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:18,778
low in that canopy even if the ppfd is

730
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:20,759
you know a thousand at the top of a

731
00:30:18,778 --> 00:30:24,119
canopy those plants might only be seen

732
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:26,038
50 micro moles at most and that's just

733
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,359
not enough for them to dissustain

734
00:30:26,038 --> 00:30:30,839
themselves

735
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,359
so yes there is something to it

736
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:36,240
um but I still think the focus should be

737
00:30:33,359 --> 00:30:38,879
on maximizing that proton capture not

738
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,759
removing too many of those fan leads and

739
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,640
just promoting more numerous smaller

740
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:47,460
flower buds at the top

741
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:49,259
right that are more spread out so you

742
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:51,240
know instead of going you know

743
00:30:49,259 --> 00:30:53,579
three-dimensional vertically try to keep

744
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:56,339
it all kind of one level spread out

745
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:58,019
exactly right yeah and I think a lot of

746
00:30:56,339 --> 00:30:59,519
people do that right now with the with

747
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,099
the netting and things like that right

748
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,440
and that's that's a fine way to do it

749
00:31:01,099 --> 00:31:05,879
but again the goal is maximizing that

750
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:08,519
Photon capture

751
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,778
excellent excellent okay so I guess

752
00:31:08,519 --> 00:31:12,359
moving on from light how about

753
00:31:09,778 --> 00:31:14,519
temperature it's yeah temperature is a

754
00:31:12,359 --> 00:31:16,439
big one uh so this is this is sort of

755
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:18,839
the focus of my

756
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,880
um dissertation and this is one of those

757
00:31:18,839 --> 00:31:22,500
things in cannabis that just hasn't been

758
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,360
studied

759
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,819
um and part of the reason for that it's

760
00:31:24,359 --> 00:31:28,379
really hard to do in order to do

761
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:30,480
temperature studies you've got to have

762
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:34,620
separate Chambers separate rooms

763
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:36,298
separate aerial environments right and

764
00:31:34,619 --> 00:31:37,739
so we're fortunate in our lab to have

765
00:31:36,298 --> 00:31:40,740
some really good facilities some great

766
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:43,339
growth Chambers to sort of do these

767
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:45,960
temperature studies

768
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:49,500
and so the first you know we go back to

769
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:51,538
our core components uh Photon capture I

770
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,398
think this one's sort of intuitive you

771
00:31:51,538 --> 00:31:55,440
know as you increase the temperature the

772
00:31:53,398 --> 00:31:56,639
plants grow faster they absorb more

773
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,240
light

774
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,700
um early on so high temperature early on

775
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,259
is great to increase that Photon capture

776
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,058
and

777
00:32:04,259 --> 00:32:08,519
you know I'll get through these and then

778
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:10,200
we'll talk about this idea of changing

779
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:11,879
environmental conditions throughout the

780
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,919
life cycle which you sort of hinted at

781
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,000
earlier

782
00:32:12,919 --> 00:32:16,860
but if you

783
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,640
light temperature early on is great to

784
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:23,298
help increase that Photon capture

785
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,299
now

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,319
high temperatures

787
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:33,200
forest plants to just move super fast

788
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:33,200
and what that does is sort of

789
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,759
I don't want to say damage but it just

790
00:32:36,058 --> 00:32:40,558
makes the Machinery tired so at the end

791
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:42,538
of the life cycle if you keep that

792
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,460
temperature hot the photosynthetic

793
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:46,319
efficiency starts to go down

794
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,440
pretty dramatically the plants are just

795
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,599
tired and they're pushing them too hard

796
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,919
so low temperature late in the life

797
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:54,719
cycle

798
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:56,399
has the potential to keep that

799
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,319
photosynthetic efficiency High the

800
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:00,959
plants are still fixing carbon still

801
00:32:58,319 --> 00:33:03,778
putting it into the flowers

802
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,120
and so you know typically what I

803
00:33:03,778 --> 00:33:07,980
recommend is high temperatures early on

804
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,658
what that means is kind of going to

805
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,220
depend on what you can do and the

806
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,500
varieties that you have

807
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,240
but high temperature until that canopy

808
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,099
closes the plants are absorbing all of

809
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,140
the light and then bring that

810
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:22,579
temperature down to preserve that

811
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,580
photosynthetic efficiency

812
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,100
but one of the things that I've seen in

813
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,320
in my studies is that

814
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:35,639
in addition to high temperature increase

815
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:37,918
in photon capture it helps to promote

816
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,659
carbon partitioning to the flowers so

817
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,538
the plants need some

818
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:45,659
base temperature early on in order to

819
00:33:42,538 --> 00:33:47,419
set those flowers to start developing

820
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:49,620
those those valuable

821
00:33:47,419 --> 00:33:51,419
inflorescence so

822
00:33:49,619 --> 00:33:53,699
the high temperature early on both

823
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:54,919
increases Photon capture and carbon

824
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,700
partitioning

825
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,679
and then

826
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,058
you know one of the other things that

827
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:02,100
I've seen and I don't think people think

828
00:34:00,058 --> 00:34:03,898
about a whole lot is

829
00:34:02,099 --> 00:34:06,658
those flower buds at the top of the

830
00:34:03,898 --> 00:34:08,219
canopy are just big dense clusters of

831
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:11,338
mass they don't have a lot of

832
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:14,658
evaporative cooling like Elite does and

833
00:34:11,338 --> 00:34:17,039
so it can get really really hot

834
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:20,220
six seven eight degrees Fahrenheit

835
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:22,739
warmer than the air temperature

836
00:34:20,219 --> 00:34:24,000
and of all of the environmental factors

837
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,598
that I've studied

838
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,539
temperature has the biggest effect on an

839
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,359
ethnoid concentration so we've seen at

840
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:35,699
high temperatures that the cannabinoids

841
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:37,980
just go through the floor and part of

842
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:41,398
the reason for that is the flower buds

843
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,559
are always warmer than air temperature

844
00:34:41,398 --> 00:34:46,259
gender HPS that would be 10 degrees

845
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:49,320
Fahrenheit warmer than the air so even

846
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,899
if you've got a nice you know 70 72 air

847
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:53,059
temperature the flowers are 82 something

848
00:34:51,898 --> 00:34:55,079
like that

849
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:57,358
so the other thing that the low

850
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:59,279
temperature latent life cycle does is

851
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,819
help to keep that flower temperature low

852
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:06,180
and and preserve the photosynthetic

853
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:10,220
machinery and the Machinery needed to

854
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,219
synthesize those cannabinoids

855
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:15,000
yeah and that sort of aligns with sort

856
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,118
of the the lore or at least what I've

857
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,858
heard in terms of of growing is that you

858
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,660
want to have low temperatures during

859
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:23,940
flour and that's going to give you more

860
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:26,519
Frosty buds so that would be the

861
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,380
cannabinoids yep and you get the nice

862
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,719
purple color at the end if you go low

863
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:35,460
enough right so there's a lot of there's

864
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:37,379
a lot of potential to use temperature

865
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:40,079
and manipulate it throughout the life

866
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,920
cycle to achieve whatever goal you

867
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,060
wanted

868
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,039
achieve

869
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:46,199
but in terms of yield again it comes

870
00:35:44,039 --> 00:35:47,579
back to those those four components

871
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,019
according to capture them the biggest

872
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,940
one

873
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:52,800
so when you talk about high temperature

874
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,659
low temperature I mean what are we

875
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,720
talking about in terms of you know the

876
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:59,578
ranges there yeah and this is where

877
00:35:57,719 --> 00:36:01,319
people usually get frustrated with me

878
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:04,200
and I get frustrated too because the

879
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:07,460
answer is it depends yeah okay you know

880
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:07,460
I've talked to enough scientists

881
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:12,900
yeah

882
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:14,759
temperature is not only the the thing

883
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:16,980
that I've seen have a biggest effect on

884
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,099
cannabinoids it's also the thing that

885
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:22,858
I've seen most variable among varieties

886
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:25,140
so there are some cultivars where the

887
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:28,039
cannabinoids start to plummet at an air

888
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,039
temperature of

889
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,720
72 74 something like that so not

890
00:36:31,739 --> 00:36:35,699
terribly hot

891
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:38,098
um and then there are others that can go

892
00:36:35,699 --> 00:36:39,439
up into the 80s and they're they're just

893
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:44,400
fine

894
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:46,260
so it really depends but generally what

895
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,980
I say especially if you're interested in

896
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:52,500
maximizing the cannabinoids is air on

897
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:54,719
the cold side rather than the hot side

898
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:57,059
because if you go one degree too warm

899
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:59,519
you might be screwed you go one degree

900
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,078
too cool you might not be that big of a

901
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:03,358
deal

902
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:06,180
especially during the flowering part I

903
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:08,098
assume right yeah especially once those

904
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:09,899
flower buds start to form they're at the

905
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:12,119
top of the canopy they're absorbing a

906
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,320
lot of energy a lot of heat and they

907
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:15,539
just get hot

908
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:17,820
yeah okay

909
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:19,380
all right so we talked about heat what

910
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:21,000
about humidity

911
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,039
you know this is

912
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,639
I've seen a lot of people talking about

913
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:27,779
you know crop steering with BPD and with

914
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:30,118
humidity

915
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:33,480
and this is another one of those things

916
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,559
that in my mind is is sort of

917
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,059
overly focused on in cannabis

918
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:42,779
um

919
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:46,799
the biggest thing that humidity

920
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:49,320
has an effect on is disease pressure you

921
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,560
know once you start to get really crazy

922
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:55,200
and you've got you know 20 humidity and

923
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,320
80 degrees Fahrenheit then things might

924
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:59,338
start to get a little bit

925
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,220
um

926
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:05,420
stressful for the plant but for the most

927
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:07,039
part humidity has a small effect on

928
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:10,800
growth

929
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:13,619
now it can have some pretty big indirect

930
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,940
effects and the biggest one is on

931
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:17,579
temperature

932
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,619
so plants cool themselves by evaporating

933
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:22,940
water just like we cool ourselves by

934
00:38:19,619 --> 00:38:26,220
evaporating sweat in a humid environment

935
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:28,440
you know the plants can't transpire as

936
00:38:26,219 --> 00:38:31,078
much they can't cool themselves as much

937
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,380
and so when you've got a high humidity

938
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,079
or a low vapor pressure deficit those

939
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:41,338
flower buds can get

940
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,920
even warmer so the biggest effects of

941
00:38:41,338 --> 00:38:45,480
humidity are really an indirect effect

942
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,200
of

943
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,199
temperature

944
00:38:48,858 --> 00:38:53,159
we sort of try and look at all of these

945
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,780
different environmental factors piece by

946
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:56,819
piece but in reality they're all

947
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,740
interact with each other right it's it's

948
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:01,500
not a very simple straightforward thing

949
00:38:58,739 --> 00:39:04,919
there's a lot of back and forth

950
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,320
um and that the back and forth between

951
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,619
humidity and temperature I think

952
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,200
should be focused on more and less on

953
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:16,200
you know you got to get a BPD of 1.2 for

954
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:18,179
week one and then 1.25 for week three

955
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,078
and so on

956
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,379
um

957
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:25,500
just sort of understanding what affects

958
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:29,280
humidity to have is going to get you a

959
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:30,838
lot further than trying to dial it in

960
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,700
yeah no and that makes sense that

961
00:39:30,838 --> 00:39:35,400
humidity might not have a direct effect

962
00:39:32,699 --> 00:39:37,500
on on yield which is the topic of the

963
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,300
conversation but I know from from our

964
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,519
perspective too medicinal genomics we

965
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:43,200
deal a lot with microbials and plant

966
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,820
pathogens

967
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,578
um and I know that humidity can play a

968
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,820
big role in you know particularly mold

969
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:52,500
yep which I wish I would imagine if the

970
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:54,838
plant's infected with mold it's it's

971
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,519
going to compromise your yield your deal

972
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,299
yeah you can't you can't stop that right

973
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:02,338
so that's and that's that's the biggest

974
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,140
humidity does so the best way to deal

975
00:40:02,338 --> 00:40:06,239
with that and ensure that you know

976
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:07,980
you're not throwing those molds is to

977
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,779
make sure that you've got good air flow

978
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:12,719
through that canopy to blow out any

979
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:14,519
humid air and prevent those sort of

980
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:16,199
microclimates been forming around the

981
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:19,980
flower buds and the leaves

982
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:22,139
right excellent all right and what about

983
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,079
CO2 I know that you know a lot of

984
00:40:22,139 --> 00:40:27,659
Growers kind of supplement their CO2 yep

985
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,940
yep and CO2 you know this kind of comes

986
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:34,618
down again to basic plant physiology the

987
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:37,079
fundamental processes of photosynthesis

988
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:39,358
you know Carbon gets fixed a little bit

989
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:42,380
of water and goes to Sugar

990
00:40:39,358 --> 00:40:47,940
um so obviously CO2

991
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:50,039
enrichment helps to increase yield right

992
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:52,440
and we you know this is another thing

993
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:53,579
that's not well studied in cannabis

994
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,200
right now for the same reason as

995
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:58,019
temperature you've got to have separate

996
00:40:55,199 --> 00:41:00,899
Chambers separate rooms

997
00:40:58,019 --> 00:41:04,440
we've done a couple of preliminary

998
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:07,338
studies on co2 going you know all the

999
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:11,400
way up to 1500 PPM something like that

1000
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:15,059
and really once you get up to about

1001
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:17,579
our ppfe of a thousand excuse me CO2

1002
00:41:15,059 --> 00:41:20,519
concentration of a thousand PPM you

1003
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:24,240
don't really get any more increasing

1004
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:26,219
yield and going from ambient to a

1005
00:41:24,239 --> 00:41:28,979
thousand you might increase yield by

1006
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:32,338
about 30 which is actually consistent

1007
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:35,159
with most other crop species that have

1008
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:38,159
been studied in response to CO2

1009
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,019
um but the main component that that's

1010
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:42,000
affecting is the photosynthetic

1011
00:41:40,019 --> 00:41:45,780
proficiency there's just more CO2

1012
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,099
available for the plants to fix

1013
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,800
now

1014
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,440
since we were just talking about

1015
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,420
interactions and temperature CO2 is very

1016
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:59,159
much like humidity in that it can have

1017
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:02,358
indirect effects on temperature so when

1018
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:04,980
the plants are in a high CO2 environment

1019
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:07,019
they close their stomachs the little

1020
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:09,240
pores on the leaves where CO2 goes in

1021
00:42:07,019 --> 00:42:10,980
and water comes out they don't need to

1022
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,379
have them quite as open because there's

1023
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,900
a whole bunch of CO2 outside and what

1024
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:18,180
that does is reduce the evaporative

1025
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:20,820
cooling at the leak surface and so your

1026
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:25,379
canopy and your flower temperature gets

1027
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:27,720
bottom right so again something you know

1028
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:30,240
I think it's great to enrich with CO2 we

1029
00:42:27,719 --> 00:42:31,858
always do enrich with CO2 it you know

1030
00:42:30,239 --> 00:42:33,719
reduces water use there's a whole bunch

1031
00:42:31,858 --> 00:42:35,759
of benefits to it

1032
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:38,578
um but you've got to think about it in

1033
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:41,700
the context of all of your and other all

1034
00:42:38,579 --> 00:42:44,280
of your other environmental factors to

1035
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:45,779
make sure that your co-optimizing all of

1036
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:48,720
them

1037
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,180
excellent excellent all right Mitch well

1038
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:52,559
I definitely want to be uh respectful of

1039
00:42:51,179 --> 00:42:54,719
your time we've already spent a lot of

1040
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:55,739
time talking about this but before I let

1041
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:57,598
you go

1042
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,500
um so I mean we've mentioned that

1043
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,119
there's a lot of these different

1044
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:03,000
environmental factors and some of them

1045
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:04,440
haven't been as well studied what is it

1046
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,300
that you're working on now what can what

1047
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:09,480
can we uh anticipate

1048
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,800
yeah so I'm I'm in my fourth year of my

1049
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,219
PhD so I'm hoping to get out of here

1050
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,039
soon and I've got a lot of data on

1051
00:43:14,219 --> 00:43:18,480
temperature that bits I think is going

1052
00:43:17,039 --> 00:43:20,460
to be extremely valuable for the

1053
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,679
industry that I'm really looking forward

1054
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,539
to to getting out

1055
00:43:22,679 --> 00:43:26,460
um the other thing that that we've done

1056
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:30,719
a lot of in our lab that's very unique

1057
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:34,199
is measurements of canopy photosynthesis

1058
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:35,699
so we can watch Plants fix carbon and

1059
00:43:34,199 --> 00:43:38,578
respire carbon

1060
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:40,919
uh continuously throughout the life

1061
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:43,920
cycle and what that allows us to do is

1062
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:45,960
separate some of these four components

1063
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,880
and say was this an effect on photon

1064
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,159
capture is this a direct effect on

1065
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:53,160
photosynthetic efficiency so we can

1066
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:54,838
start to really take apart these these

1067
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:58,440
environmental factors

1068
00:43:54,838 --> 00:43:59,699
um but but in my opinion I think the

1069
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,119
biggest thing that's going to come out

1070
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:05,159
is all of this this temperature data you

1071
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:07,079
know I talked anecdotally to Growers and

1072
00:44:05,159 --> 00:44:08,879
they'll say yeah we had a you know a

1073
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:11,220
string of hot days in the greenhouse or

1074
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,519
cannabinoids went through the floor but

1075
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:16,500
there's just no no data on it yet and so

1076
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:18,358
I think that's going to be that's going

1077
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:20,400
to be valuable the other thing that

1078
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:22,739
we're doing is you know I talked about

1079
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:25,920
how this plant just loves light it'll

1080
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:27,118
hog light all day long or you know we're

1081
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:30,599
trying to

1082
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:33,480
figure out where that upper limit is we

1083
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:36,420
just did a study like going up to a DLI

1084
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,519
of like 100 moles per day and I think

1085
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,960
there have been some

1086
00:44:38,519 --> 00:44:41,759
commercial companies and lighting

1087
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:42,780
companies that have done similar stuff

1088
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,760
but

1089
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:48,359
we've got data that the yield continues

1090
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:51,000
to go up up to 70 80 moles a day which

1091
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:53,719
is like 30 percent higher than anything

1092
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:56,280
we would ever see in the field

1093
00:44:53,719 --> 00:44:58,318
practically you may not ever want to do

1094
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,380
that in your facility it's expensive to

1095
00:44:58,318 --> 00:45:02,400
get to 100 miles a day but

1096
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,900
physiologically that there's a lot of

1097
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,838
interesting things that we can learn

1098
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,180
about uh cannabis and use it sort of as

1099
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:11,578
a model prop

1100
00:45:08,179 --> 00:45:13,519
to understand the limits of plant

1101
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:16,500
physiology

1102
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:17,759
excellent well that is that is exciting

1103
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,199
and hopefully

1104
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,940
um hopefully you'll have some data out

1105
00:45:19,199 --> 00:45:23,879
and you'll submit an abstract and we'll

1106
00:45:20,940 --> 00:45:25,139
see you present some of that at can Med

1107
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,880
um

1108
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,858
so before I let you go I want to give

1109
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,019
you an opportunity to share with the

1110
00:45:28,858 --> 00:45:32,519
with the audience any ways to maybe get

1111
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:33,960
in touch with you or read more about

1112
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,280
some of the work that you've done please

1113
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,300
plug away

1114
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,040
yeah um we've got my email address I

1115
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,500
don't know if you can link this with the

1116
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:45,480
podcast uh it's

1117
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:48,420
mitchell.westmoreland usu.edu

1118
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:50,639
um you know our lab for the past two or

1119
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,159
three years has been putting on an

1120
00:45:50,639 --> 00:45:55,019
online cannabis class that's available

1121
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:57,480
to the public you don't need to be a

1122
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:59,219
registered USU student uh we're just

1123
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,318
getting ready to start the Third Edition

1124
00:45:59,219 --> 00:46:03,118
of this course we're still working out

1125
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:06,500
some of the details uh but if you're

1126
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:08,760
interested in that I go to

1127
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,219
cannabis.usu.edu and that'll have all

1128
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,359
the information

1129
00:46:10,219 --> 00:46:14,639
registration details and things like

1130
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,559
that coming soon

1131
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:19,500
um and then if

1132
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,739
uh if possible I can link some of our

1133
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:25,079
our papers we've looked at phosphorus

1134
00:46:22,739 --> 00:46:27,598
nutrition uh blue light and then I

1135
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:30,300
mentioned the the UV light paper that we

1136
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,260
can link here if if anybody's interested

1137
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:31,800
in that

1138
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:33,960
um

1139
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,818
but I'm happy to answer any emails any
