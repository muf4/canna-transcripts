2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,440
no and in reading through your abstract

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:17,399
as well um it said that you found that

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:20,719
cannabis aphids and thps can acquire and

5
00:00:17,399 --> 00:00:23,198
transmit hlvd as well can you talk a bit

6
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:27,640
more about the significance of that

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:29,759
Discovery yes so this was um it was not

8
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,000
surprising in fact what was surprising

9
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:37,079
is was was that in hops they found that

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:41,399
hops Aid did not transmit hop latent

11
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:43,640
vroid and this was published where my in

12
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:45,079
in our world I mean aphids as you can

13
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:49,719
see in my background you see how

14
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,558
prolific they are in the on him and um

15
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,679
they can pretty much and they've been

16
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:57,439
shown to transmit other viroids so it

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,518
was kind of surprising that they that

18
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:03,799
they didn't find it in Hops and so we

19
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:05,920
set up out to um test aphids and thrips

20
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:08,560
and the reason we pick those are they

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,359
are the most common Greenhouse P right

22
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,719
they love the green house environment

23
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:16,799
because it's hot humid this makes some

24
00:01:13,719 --> 00:01:20,000
the populations grow uh faster they and

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:23,799
there's a year round supply of uh uh

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,400
host host plants for them within five

27
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:30,200
minutes both insects can acquire the the

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:32,560
vroid which is really interesting it is

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:36,159
in the flum and aphids feed in the flum

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,478
of the plant but it's also in the but

31
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,560
trips have much shorter mouth Parts

32
00:01:38,478 --> 00:01:42,679
aphid's mouth parts are like mosquitoes

33
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,359
they're the mosquitoes of the Plant

34
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:48,799
World so they can go all the way down to

35
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:50,959
the flow and suck up the vroid uh thps

36
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,040
are not but they must be picking it up

37
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:54,279
from the they're cell content feeders

38
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,600
they're going to just suck up all the

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,478
cell content cytoplasm nucleus every all

40
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:00,359
of it so that so there are different

41
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:02,879
mechanisms by which they're

42
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,319
acquiring the viroid but both are doing

43
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,959
it super

44
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:10,439
quickly um and and so that was that's

45
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:12,639
great any any any insect could acquire

46
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:16,159
it but the proof of the concept was to

47
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:19,238
then test uh transmission and to do that

48
00:02:16,159 --> 00:02:23,959
we then starve the insects to to make

49
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:25,480
sure all of the gut content is is out of

50
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,039
the insect it's not just in there

51
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:30,199
transiently

52
00:02:27,039 --> 00:02:32,878
right and then we place those in effects

53
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:36,639
on healthy plants and sure enough both

54
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,679
of them can transmit I think um my um my

55
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,119
other Master student is uh re retesting

56
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,879
some things but retesting some assays

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:48,800
but it's between 10 to 25% transmission

58
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:52,439
and we sequence every single amplicon we

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:57,480
don't just rely on the band on the PCR

60
00:02:52,439 --> 00:03:00,680
uh uh gel band every single one is um

61
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:03,119
sequent so not entirely surprised in the

62
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,080
other one that I'm very keen to test is

63
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:09,719
spidermites which is another huge

64
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,760
problem a huge Greenhouse pest um and we

65
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:16,919
also find it in outdoor hem um so couple

66
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:20,759
of other insects to test the other uh

67
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:24,039
interesting aspect is uh last year uh we

68
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:26,519
saw that hops can also infect other host

69
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:27,719
right some really important host host

70
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:32,799
plants like

71
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:37,519
tomatoes um and um cryan so we want to

72
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,200
see if these vectors cannabis AIDS or um

73
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,799
thps Can transmit it to other host

74
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:45,759
plants as well because it just takes um

75
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:51,280
a few minutes to acquire and seemingly a

76
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:51,280
few minutes to transmit too interesting

77
00:03:55,969 --> 00:04:05,360
