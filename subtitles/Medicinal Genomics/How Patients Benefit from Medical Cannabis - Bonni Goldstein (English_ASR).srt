1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:09,330
welcome everybody and thank you for

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:11,070
having me and I just want to start off

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,750
by saying thank you to mckernon and

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:15,179
cordage in and to doug kennedy for

5
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:21,060
putting this together we're starting off

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:23,789
with a video that when Doug Kennedy

7
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:27,359
approached me about speaking he wanted

8
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:29,910
to do a little vignette on one of my

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,600
patients who's had success with cannabis

10
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:36,238
so I haven't seen the video yet so let's

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,469
all watch it together and I can tell you

12
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:39,468
more about the patient afterwards

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:49,170
Rhonda molar my daughter is Malia she is

14
00:00:44,999 --> 00:00:51,300
7 and she was diagnosed with autism at 2

15
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,629
years 9 months she wasn't making eye

16
00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:56,698
contact she wasn't responding to her

17
00:00:54,628 --> 00:00:59,759
name and she just was lost in her own

18
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:01,738
world she was very active so she would

19
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:04,198
constantly be running up and down she

20
00:01:01,738 --> 00:01:06,780
couldn't really sit down very long she

21
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:09,319
couldn't really stay focused on anything

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,780
we didn't want to try pharmaceuticals

23
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:15,508
but we were open to trying anything that

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,118
was alternative that might not be so

25
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:19,799
drastic but maybe had some changes in

26
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:21,629
her behavior and we tried restricting

27
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,610
her diet for gluten we tried restricting

28
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:25,500
you know casein you know something's

29
00:01:23,609 --> 00:01:29,159
helped here and there but it was nothing

30
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,618
that helped with the overall picture of

31
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,868
her behavior there was a discussion

32
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,578
between some parents and I saw dr.

33
00:01:33,868 --> 00:01:37,170
bonnie goldsmith name so we made the

34
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:39,538
appointment and went to go see her and

35
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:41,728
she was awesome she explained the whole

36
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,409
thing to me upon her accommodation we

37
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:45,659
tried a CBD oil

38
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,030
cannabidiol she told me well let's try

39
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,280
and add in the THC the THC is a

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,640
psychoactive component of cannabis

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,618
we found a ratio of THC the CBD that was

42
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,649
it was this life-changing for my

43
00:01:55,618 --> 00:02:01,590
daughter she began to sit down and focus

44
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,299
her aggression that she was experiencing

45
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,880
before the cannabis that was gone

46
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,429
and I started hearing feedback from

47
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:10,868
therapists and teachers asking me

48
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,299
what's going on with your daughter like

49
00:02:10,868 --> 00:02:15,519
what's changed she's no longer

50
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:18,280
aggressive she's no longer hitting

51
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:20,670
students she's no longer spitting at

52
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,408
people she's no longer yelling at staff

53
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:26,339
she's sitting down she's doing her work

54
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:28,568
and I was so excited that it was working

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,280
and I didn't care anymore

56
00:02:28,568 --> 00:02:32,429
I didn't care so I just started telling

57
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,949
people that this is what we were doing

58
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:43,840
[Music]

59
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:46,959
[Applause]

60
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,950
so that was a family that came to me

61
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,650
fairly desperate many of the people that

62
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:55,780
come into my office are at that

63
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,090
desperate moment for this family

64
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,439
she said they didn't go anywhere with

65
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:01,000
their child they couldn't go to the

66
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,359
grocery store they couldn't go to Chuck

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:07,180
E Cheese going to school in the morning

68
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,100
was you know she woke up the mom woke up

69
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,129
with dread just getting their daughter

70
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,719
out of the house and so you have to

71
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:15,789
remember that it's not just the patient

72
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:18,909
that is struggling but the whole family

73
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:20,859
and what's amazing is I just saw this

74
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,169
family a few weeks ago and this little

75
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,000
girl graduated from ABA therapy because

76
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:27,549
there's no more therapy to correct are

77
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,770
no more behaviors to correct she's

78
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:31,480
starting to speak and although they

79
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,240
still have their challenges their life

80
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:37,689
has changed significantly

81
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:40,600
this mom now has become a huge advocate

82
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:44,349
and has started a Facebook page for

83
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,810
parents seeking help with children with

84
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,689
autism they've been collecting data and

85
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:52,030
they have data from over 850 families

86
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:53,709
using cannabis and they're looking at

87
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:55,810
the different cannabis strains that are

88
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:59,050
being used the terpenoids the ratios

89
00:03:55,810 --> 00:04:01,209
trying to really dial in on what's

90
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,590
working best for these children and you

91
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:08,229
know I applaud this family because they

92
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:10,689
really went past the fear they tried it

93
00:04:08,229 --> 00:04:17,529
out and I like the mom said it's been

94
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:19,600
life-changing so so I'm medical director

95
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:23,019
at counter centers and there's not a lot

96
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:25,689
of time so let me go through here I

97
00:04:23,019 --> 00:04:28,209
opened my office in 2008 we have two

98
00:04:25,689 --> 00:04:30,639
locations in Southern California we see

99
00:04:28,209 --> 00:04:32,709
somewhere between 250 and 300 patients a

100
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,829
month between the two practices remember

101
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:37,659
I live in a large metropolitan city with

102
00:04:35,829 --> 00:04:39,370
millions of people but also we get

103
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,040
people from all over the state and also

104
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,480
some out-of-state patients as well many

105
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,569
of the most of these patients are

106
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,970
returning patients over the you know

107
00:04:45,569 --> 00:04:49,949
almost decade that we've been there we

108
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,050
see about 20 to 40 new patients a month

109
00:04:49,949 --> 00:04:55,079
our youngest patient was a six week old

110
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,060
with a devastating genetic illness who

111
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:59,009
started having seizures probably in

112
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,530
utero first documented seizure within

113
00:04:59,009 --> 00:05:03,269
two hours of birth and then our oldest

114
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,359
patient my oldest patient was a hundred

115
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,159
year old woman who was probably on oh I

116
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:10,020
don't know like 15 or 17 different

117
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,240
medications and the family came to me

118
00:05:10,019 --> 00:05:13,560
and said is there any possible way we

119
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,050
could get her off some of these drugs

120
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,509
and we did do that successfully the

121
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:21,629
average age of adult patients is not 21

122
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:23,430
it's 58 we are seeing a lot of baby

123
00:05:21,629 --> 00:05:24,750
boomers coming in who are saying I do

124
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,879
not want to be on these medications

125
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:29,069
anymore and I will tell you about 75

126
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,259
percent of patients come in are already

127
00:05:29,069 --> 00:05:33,420
on multiple medications and they are

128
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:36,509
looking to get off those medications

129
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:38,220
because of either side effects or that

130
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:39,779
the drugs are ineffective or the

131
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,370
philosophically they just really don't

132
00:05:39,779 --> 00:05:43,169
want to take that many medications

133
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:45,600
they're fine to take their blood

134
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:48,150
pressure medication or or their heart

135
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,700
medication but to take sleeping pills on

136
00:05:48,149 --> 00:05:54,000
top of pain pills on top of other kinds

137
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,409
of quality of life medication that's one

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,180
of the biggest things that we see in the

139
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:58,710
practice and then definitely we're

140
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,660
seeing a changing demographic in

141
00:05:58,709 --> 00:06:02,549
California I know some of my colleagues

142
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,170
and I have talked about this where

143
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:05,699
initially when I started in this

144
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,740
practice it was mostly people who are

145
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,629
already using cannabis and just wanted

146
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,780
to be legal they no longer wanted to be

147
00:06:09,629 --> 00:06:14,730
part of a illicit drug market and now

148
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,709
what we're seeing is people who are what

149
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,210
we call cannabis naive they've not used

150
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,089
cannabis but they're seeing it as a

151
00:06:18,209 --> 00:06:22,439
possibility and I'm very happy to say

152
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,789
that in the last two years I've gotten

153
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:25,709
more referrals from mainstream

154
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:29,100
physicians like rheumatologists

155
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:30,629
oncologists and neurologists than ever

156
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,879
before and so I really think that

157
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:36,659
cannabis is now becoming accepted and

158
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:38,430
it's no longer fringe here's a list of

159
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,439
adult conditions I'm not going to go

160
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:42,120
through all of them but if you think

161
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,709
about what dr. Michelle um talked about

162
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,329
this morning about the distribution of

163
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:47,370
receptors it corresponds with the

164
00:06:45,329 --> 00:06:50,699
diseases that we're seeing in a medical

165
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:52,949
cannabis practice and so by far my adult

166
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:55,019
patients are chronic pain I would say

167
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:57,599
the top three are pain anxiety insomnia

168
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:59,109
which all run together and then of

169
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,689
course we're seeing a lot of patient

170
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:07,330
with autoimmune disease as well as

171
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:09,459
cancer in Pediatrics it's a it's a

172
00:07:07,329 --> 00:07:11,769
little shorter list by far treatment

173
00:07:09,459 --> 00:07:14,169
resistant epilepsy and autism are the

174
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:15,879
two most common conditions although I am

175
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:18,280
seeing a fair amount of patients being

176
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,769
referred for advanced cancers but I will

177
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:22,479
also tell you that a couple of the local

178
00:07:20,769 --> 00:07:24,430
children's hospitals are now referring

179
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,450
patients for symptomatic relief of

180
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:30,009
nausea vomiting weight loss and pain

181
00:07:27,449 --> 00:07:33,250
because we can really do some nice

182
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:35,139
things with very low dose CBD THC a and

183
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,629
THC and these children who are really

184
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:39,459
struggling who are non-verbal for the

185
00:07:37,629 --> 00:07:41,170
most part and they're not able to tell

186
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,449
their parents they feel lousy from the

187
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,490
chemo or from the radiation and so we

188
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:48,159
are seeing a lot of those kids being

189
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,810
referred in and again part of it is the

190
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,430
parents asking as well when they're at

191
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:52,870
the doctor's office are you okay if

192
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,689
we're doing this and I'm definitely

193
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:58,780
seeing an openness that we did not see

194
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:00,850
before I'm also seeing a fair amount of

195
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,039
patients with pandas and pans and I'm

196
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:06,280
again because of time I can't go into

197
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:07,930
that but this is a pediatric autoimmune

198
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:10,629
disease that can be very quite

199
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,990
devastating attacks normal healthy

200
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:16,899
children and as is really devastating to

201
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:19,540
the family and we are seeing some really

202
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:21,219
nice response most of these kids I have

203
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,810
a couple of families where the children

204
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,850
were actually institutionalized and

205
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:29,079
we've been able to get them out and back

206
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:31,210
functioning in society now the goals of

207
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:33,009
treatment pretty common everything that

208
00:08:31,209 --> 00:08:34,929
we think that cannabis does medically so

209
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:37,059
pain relief alleviating anxiety

210
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:40,478
depression improving sleep helping

211
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:42,549
appetite lessening nausea vomiting gut

212
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,500
symptoms now a lot of people don't think

213
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:46,149
about enhanced focus and concentration

214
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,460
but if you have an endocannabinoid

215
00:08:46,149 --> 00:08:50,590
deficiency and you're suffering with a

216
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,900
DD but also autism and other conditions

217
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:55,180
where you can't focus and remember the

218
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:57,009
baseline status of the endocannabinoid

219
00:08:55,179 --> 00:08:58,509
system is going to dictate how you

220
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:00,519
respond for many of these people they

221
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:01,919
say I'm able to do well I'm able to go

222
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:04,120
to work I'm able to study at school

223
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,529
parents are reporting to me also that

224
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:08,230
their children are doing much better in

225
00:09:05,529 --> 00:09:09,610
school and of course reducing and

226
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:11,200
eliminating seizures when we see

227
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:12,230
patients who have intractable seizure

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,059
disorder

229
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:16,999
but there's also other other goals of

230
00:09:15,058 --> 00:09:19,708
treatment and kind of behind the scenes

231
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:22,170
apart from just feeling better at the

232
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:24,678
moment that you take cannabis we're also

233
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:27,948
seeing some long-term effects mostly

234
00:09:24,678 --> 00:09:27,948
anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective

235
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:34,740
and many patients just report we even

236
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:36,448
have a space on my intake form how does

237
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,028
cannabis affect your quality of life and

238
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:41,688
people actually right I have a sense of

239
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:43,980
well-being I just feel better and

240
00:09:41,688 --> 00:09:47,368
sometimes it's hard to put it into words

241
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:49,289
less pain is easy but in general having

242
00:09:47,369 --> 00:09:50,910
just a better quality of life and

243
00:09:49,289 --> 00:09:52,498
feeling better this is coming from

244
00:09:50,909 --> 00:09:56,028
balancing your endocannabinoid system

245
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:58,800
and achieving that and I will say that

246
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:59,999
there cannabis is not the only thing

247
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,528
that will balance your into a

248
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:05,249
cannabinoid system and my colleague

249
00:10:01,528 --> 00:10:07,470
Dustin Sulak from Maine at his table out

250
00:10:05,249 --> 00:10:11,308
there he has a wonderful I actually

251
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:12,959
brought it up here endocannabinoid ayat

252
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:15,149
and activities other things that can

253
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,498
enhance your endocannabinoid system so I

254
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:18,269
do encourage people to look at that

255
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:21,720
because it's not just cannabis cannabis

256
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:23,188
is a piece of the puzzle but one of the

257
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,829
main things is you know we can talk

258
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:27,389
about pain scales and these kinds of

259
00:10:25,828 --> 00:10:28,888
things but one of the things that I see

260
00:10:27,389 --> 00:10:31,079
in my practice that I find really

261
00:10:28,889 --> 00:10:33,600
important is that when people come into

262
00:10:31,078 --> 00:10:36,088
my office who are desperate they have

263
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,490
lost control of their daily life they

264
00:10:36,089 --> 00:10:40,649
are not participating with family with

265
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,589
work in their social activities exercise

266
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:45,749
and what happens is it starts to spiral

267
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:48,449
out of control and what I'm finding with

268
00:10:45,749 --> 00:10:50,939
cannabis is that even though the medical

269
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:52,708
condition is not being cured what's

270
00:10:50,938 --> 00:10:54,629
happening is that shift of power that

271
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:56,578
control is going back to the patient

272
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:59,548
they're able to manage their condition

273
00:10:56,578 --> 00:11:01,618
with less side effects they're not

274
00:10:59,548 --> 00:11:03,240
worried about the medication long term

275
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:05,399
that they're putting into their body and

276
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,980
it's simple they take a little bit and

277
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,778
it works and if they feel well they can

278
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,149
skip it without worrying about feeling

279
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:16,078
withdrawal the next day or even for a

280
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:18,808
week and so that that power play between

281
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,628
the medical condition being in control

282
00:11:18,808 --> 00:11:23,759
versus you having control of your life I

283
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:25,480
think is one of the most very important

284
00:11:23,759 --> 00:11:28,800
essential things that I see

285
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:31,029
in this particular kind of specialty and

286
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:33,819
improvement of quality of life and a lot

287
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:36,549
of people come in and say I'm not better

288
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,700
I still have cancer I still have anxiety

289
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,500
but I am in control I am no longer being

290
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,910
led around by my medical condition so

291
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:45,940
it's very important that we that we

292
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:48,069
acknowledge that now here's a patient

293
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:50,980
report I had a 36 year old female came

294
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:53,200
into my office in 2013 10 year history

295
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,970
of fibromyalgia and saw me and anxiety

296
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,280
and as you can imagine she was having

297
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:59,320
frequent bouts of depression you can see

298
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,059
her list of multiple medications she

299
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:03,100
came in with a big bagging and she said

300
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,739
I'm on all this and it's not working I

301
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:07,509
feel terrible and she was extremely

302
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,370
nervous because the type of work she

303
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:11,860
does she did not want to be outed as a

304
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:15,009
cannabis user and within a week of

305
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:16,750
seeing her I got this email where she

306
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:18,399
sums it up I came in to see you last

307
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:21,190
week and went straight to the dispensary

308
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,449
that means she was pretty desperate I've

309
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,190
been trying all sorts of different

310
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,750
cannabis for my insomnia and pain I'm

311
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:27,370
very excited to report that my pain

312
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:30,009
levels have gone down so much that I

313
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:31,840
feel like a normal person again I don't

314
00:12:30,009 --> 00:12:33,129
even have to do it every day it lasts

315
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,870
for two to three days and that is

316
00:12:33,129 --> 00:12:36,730
something that I see is that patients

317
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,919
don't have to medicate all the time I

318
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:41,379
will tell you 80% of my patients are

319
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:45,549
night time users of cannabis and

320
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:48,159
probably at least 50% do not medicate

321
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:49,870
every day and then she what my my whole

322
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:51,579
life has changed thank you and I just

323
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,259
saw her probably maybe three months ago

324
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:54,639
and she's continued to do well and in

325
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:56,259
fact when she comes in she's like I'm

326
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,899
fine I want to talk about my brother who

327
00:12:56,259 --> 00:13:01,450
needs to come see you so so it's almost

328
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,549
as and she still has her conditions it's

329
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:05,700
it's just that they're well managed and

330
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:08,079
they're easily managed with cannabis and

331
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:10,270
then here's a more recent patient who

332
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:12,940
just came to see me last year 44 year

333
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:15,460
old female with severe migraines she did

334
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:17,140
not respond to many pharmaceuticals and

335
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:20,230
what's interesting is she worked for one

336
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:22,539
of the large entertainment movie

337
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,149
companies out in California and she was

338
00:13:22,539 --> 00:13:27,099
kind of a bigwig there but her migraines

339
00:13:25,149 --> 00:13:28,509
were so debilitating that she had to

340
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,450
take a leave of absence and that was

341
00:13:28,509 --> 00:13:33,939
devastating to her she was trying so

342
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:35,800
hard not to miss work and she had told

343
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,840
me she was missing at least 2 to 3 days

344
00:13:35,799 --> 00:13:38,740
a week and they told her you know you

345
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,120
can't

346
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:42,430
we have to you know we're not getting

347
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,330
the work done we have to ask you to take

348
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:47,979
time off and so she was super stressed

349
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:51,820
when she came to see me not only from

350
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:53,889
the pain and the years of this but also

351
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,930
from the financial hit she was taking by

352
00:13:53,889 --> 00:13:58,120
not working and so here's the email from

353
00:13:55,929 --> 00:13:59,379
her it's been almost eight weeks since I

354
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,120
saw you I just want to give you an

355
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:02,710
update the CBD oil has been a miracle

356
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,750
and controlling my chronic migraines

357
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,850
I've only had three very mild migraines

358
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:08,710
since starting the oil this is a huge

359
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:11,080
improvement to the ten plus migraines I

360
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:13,150
was getting monthly I've titrated up to

361
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,950
about eighty milligrams daily and that's

362
00:14:13,149 --> 00:14:16,959
important because you notice it's two

363
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,210
months in we start low dose and we

364
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,690
titrate up and this is where she found a

365
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:24,639
good spot and she adds a couple of drops

366
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:26,020
of THC when I feel that migraines coming

367
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,669
on I definitely feel more relaxed

368
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,039
overall and finally have quality restful

369
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:31,539
sleep and I was happy to I'm very happy

370
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:36,219
to say that she went back to work after

371
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:39,279
four months of starting cannabis oil now

372
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:41,860
in children I've listed here quotes from

373
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,139
emails and text messages from families I

374
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:48,029
won't go through all of them but as you

375
00:14:44,139 --> 00:14:51,340
can see they're all pretty impressive

376
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:54,279
the big things are that what I am seeing

377
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:55,420
in Pediatrics and you know I talked last

378
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:57,129
year we don't know about long-term

379
00:14:55,419 --> 00:14:59,709
effects but we know what long-term

380
00:14:57,129 --> 00:15:01,330
effects of intractable seizures do we

381
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,269
know what long-term effects of a child

382
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:06,129
who is autistic at a young age and

383
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:10,029
unable to participate in therapy and

384
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:12,669
then becomes a teenager and gets large

385
00:15:10,029 --> 00:15:15,730
size and and and difficult to control

386
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:17,379
and so what I'm seeing is that when

387
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:19,690
someone is a responder what we're seeing

388
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:21,610
is is a child moving forward in life and

389
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:23,710
I write in my book about a little girl

390
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:26,950
who came to me at nine years of age who

391
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:28,629
was not reading and writing and I write

392
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:30,100
in the book that she came to me and read

393
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,500
me a book and wrote her name in cursive

394
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,230
and that was a huge accomplishment so I

395
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,029
am seeing I do not see children

396
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,370
regressing with cannabis I see

397
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,959
children's brains progressing to reach

398
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,169
their full potential whatever that may

399
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:46,900
be for that particular child and here's

400
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:49,599
a patient report this is Thomas and the

401
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:51,669
Thomas's mom has given me permission to

402
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,490
talk about him this is a young boy who

403
00:15:51,669 --> 00:15:54,409
was born with

404
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:59,389
congenital brain malformation and he was

405
00:15:54,409 --> 00:16:00,889
having intractable seizures he one of

406
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,330
the main things that they came in for

407
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:04,189
was the seizures but the second thing

408
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:07,040
was the severe self injurious behavior

409
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:08,630
and so he had came in wearing arm braces

410
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,849
so that he couldn't bend his arm so his

411
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:12,740
hands couldn't be by his face because I

412
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:16,278
saw pictures that the mom showed me of

413
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:17,330
black eyes and hematomas on his ears

414
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:18,860
that they had to take him to the

415
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:22,220
emergency room to get drained I mean he

416
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:24,169
was really beating himself up um he also

417
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,879
had severe acid reflux to the point

418
00:16:24,169 --> 00:16:28,309
where the family walked around with

419
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:29,720
little cups to catch his vomit all day

420
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,759
long the mom said they went through

421
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:34,370
thousands and thousands of cups every

422
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:37,399
year and he was also unable to walk he

423
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:39,470
had tried ten different seizure

424
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:42,070
medications we started him on cannabis

425
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:45,950
oil at age seven years this was February

426
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,170
2015 and again we start low dose and we

427
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,670
titrate up it takes time he was also on

428
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:52,039
seizure medications that we're being

429
00:16:49,669 --> 00:16:53,838
weaned off but he had complete

430
00:16:52,039 --> 00:16:56,179
resolution of vomiting this was just a

431
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,339
perk the mom was thrilled with that but

432
00:16:56,179 --> 00:17:01,219
he had 90% reduction of seizures and

433
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,790
continues to have that and then it can

434
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:08,689
you play this video for me this is

435
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:11,149
Thomas who yep maybe I can do it oh here

436
00:17:08,689 --> 00:17:16,939
it is I got it and this is Thomas he

437
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:17,300
learned to walk unassisted if I can get

438
00:17:16,939 --> 00:17:19,670
it to go

439
00:17:17,299 --> 00:17:23,088
oops sorry there we go and the mom sent

440
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:26,140
me this video cuz she was just so

441
00:17:23,088 --> 00:17:26,139
shocked and surprised

442
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:59,429
tom is over here come here come here

443
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:59,429
come here come here good job keep going

444
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:12,130
[Music]

445
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:13,870
there's Mario come on keep going and so

446
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:17,500
apparently he discovered the mirror and

447
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:19,599
liked to go look at himself so and this

448
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,548
was a kid that really everybody had

449
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,139
written off and so one of the things

450
00:18:21,548 --> 00:18:25,240
that the mom said in the last visit was

451
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:27,400
not only is it keep getting better she

452
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,960
says I have no idea what it what the

453
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:30,160
next year is gonna bring it just keeps

454
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,919
getting better and better and I think

455
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:34,929
part of it is where we want to see you

456
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:36,520
know more and more balanced and allow

457
00:18:34,929 --> 00:18:38,440
him to reach his potential because I

458
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:39,668
just don't think that we know and you

459
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:41,259
know I thought about what dr. Michelle

460
00:18:39,669 --> 00:18:43,330
um said in his video and he said some of

461
00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:45,369
these kids are being saved and I we

462
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:47,349
really don't know what the future holds

463
00:18:45,369 --> 00:18:48,789
because this is a whole new brand brand

464
00:18:47,349 --> 00:18:52,839
new generation of children that are

465
00:18:48,789 --> 00:18:54,308
getting intervention with cannabis now I

466
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:56,678
don't have a lot of time to go over this

467
00:18:54,308 --> 00:18:58,558
but in California we have lots of

468
00:18:56,679 --> 00:19:01,210
different oils there's no restrictions

469
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,668
some people say that's bad I say it's

470
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:06,730
good my patients can get medicine and so

471
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:09,700
I have divvied up the cannabis medicine

472
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:11,740
into four different groups just based on

473
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:14,558
the main cannabinoids the dominant

474
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:17,849
cannabinoids so THC rich in the top left

475
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:21,250
bottom left is the high ratio CBD to THC

476
00:19:17,849 --> 00:19:22,509
bottom right is the low ratio CBD to THC

477
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,910
and the top right is the raw

478
00:19:22,509 --> 00:19:26,950
cannabinoids because basically patients

479
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,660
need a road map what am i what's in this

480
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:30,759
product knife people come in who say oh

481
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:32,350
I've tried just about everything and I

482
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:34,179
came to you because I have a card but

483
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:35,859
nothing's working and really all they've

484
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,240
tried is just one of these categories

485
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,500
because they don't know how to read

486
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,509
labels and they're not sure what they're

487
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,890
getting and so when you break it up like

488
00:19:40,509 --> 00:19:46,029
this it gives a patient a road map of

489
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:46,780
different things to try I've got 20

490
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:49,029
seconds so I'm going to

491
00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:50,470
real quick here these are various

492
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:53,139
products you can see they're all labeled

493
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:54,759
and in California we went from not very

494
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:58,390
many labeled things about eight years

495
00:19:54,759 --> 00:20:00,309
ago to now we're seeing labeled and also

496
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:01,840
January 2018 everything's going to be

497
00:20:00,309 --> 00:20:04,349
tested that's on the market so we've

498
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,699
really made some progress in that regard

499
00:20:04,349 --> 00:20:08,259
these are I was just going to mention

500
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:10,299
the terpenoids very important especially

501
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:12,279
in pediatric patients

502
00:20:10,299 --> 00:20:15,220
it appears Lyn Tallulah Mir seen both

503
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:20,559
very calming are excellent for children

504
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:23,019
with epilepsy and autism and then people

505
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,849
often ask me which cannabinoid I don't

506
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:28,119
know I can make an educated guess but

507
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:30,579
your body's going to respond and so for

508
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,039
most patients you have to have a wide

509
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:35,829
variety of choices so that person can

510
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:38,619
find what works best for them and then

511
00:20:35,829 --> 00:20:40,720
this is why we should have cannabis

512
00:20:38,619 --> 00:20:42,929
right here it sums it up thank you very

513
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,930
much

514
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:50,480
you
