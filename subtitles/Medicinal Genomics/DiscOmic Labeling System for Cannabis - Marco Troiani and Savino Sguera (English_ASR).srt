1
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,320
all right hello hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,179
so just a quick warning this was

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,440
originally tend to be a little longer so

4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:14,160
we had to cut it down our strategies

5
00:00:13,439 --> 00:00:16,108
we're going to move through it very

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,640
quickly and any parts we skipped over

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,060
too quickly please ask us questions at

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,490
the end

9
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:22,259
god-willing all right so let's start

10
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:24,059
this is me this is what I've been up to

11
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,070
this is my partner Savino here this is

12
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,750
what he's been up to and this is the

13
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,570
main idea we're gonna go over there are

14
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,640
958 unique flower samples of cannabis

15
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,189
that we analyzed 420 terpenes with

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,409
chemical analysis GCMs the main idea is

17
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:39,238
we took these 20 variables times about a

18
00:00:37,409 --> 00:00:40,949
thousand strains use computer-assisted

19
00:00:39,238 --> 00:00:44,339
algorithms to reduce it down to six

20
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:45,960
variables from there we use those six

21
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,579
variables for two things one we mapped

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,079
it to possible enzyme pathways that

23
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,600
explain the theory of biosynthesis of

24
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,160
terpenes and cannabis 2 we use them to

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,649
create the discounted labeling system of

26
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,299
which this presentation is named after

27
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:00,030
and additionally hope for the future is

28
00:00:57,299 --> 00:01:01,198
that this reduced six variable group

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,879
that can describe the terpene profile

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:04,558
can assist medical doctors in

31
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,718
recommending or maybe even one day

32
00:01:04,558 --> 00:01:08,819
prescribing cannabis strains to patients

33
00:01:06,718 --> 00:01:10,318
based on their disorder so why are we

34
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:12,719
focusing on terpenes just a real quick

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,159
overview we've got some data up on the

36
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:16,108
on the wall here and this is cannabinoid

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,700
profile so each little box or the four

38
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:19,318
box is a different strain and you see

39
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,020
replicate analysis from different cuts

40
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:23,009
of that strain CBD shows up in blue

41
00:01:22,019 --> 00:01:25,348
other than that all you're really gonna

42
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:27,509
see is THC green we look at the next

43
00:01:25,349 --> 00:01:29,009
four we see pink that's CBG the

44
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:30,328
precursor that blood was plucked early

45
00:01:29,009 --> 00:01:33,239
but otherwise same story we're just

46
00:01:30,328 --> 00:01:34,708
seeing THC last three same thing THC

47
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,478
when we look at the global average in

48
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,459
our 958 sample dataset

49
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,078
18 percent THC but even though some

50
00:01:38,459 --> 00:01:43,200
strains are like half CBD the average

51
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:45,328
comes to less than one percent so let's

52
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,159
focus on terpenes instead we see instead

53
00:01:45,328 --> 00:01:48,238
with terpenes huge diversity not only do

54
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,409
the strains agree with each other

55
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,060
meaning when you test the same string

56
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:52,499
twice you get the same probe or a very

57
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:54,329
similar profile

58
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:55,379
you also see diversity from one

59
00:01:54,328 --> 00:01:56,848
straining to another it's very hard to

60
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:58,429
confuse these profiles with each other

61
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,779
you can see the replica tests show

62
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:02,308
distinct replicate profiles this one up

63
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:03,539
here juicyfruitz a great example of how

64
00:02:02,308 --> 00:02:05,658
when you test the same strain you're

65
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:08,280
gonna get very similar profile ratios

66
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:09,719
honestly this goes on forever and also

67
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,759
what this opens the door for is

68
00:02:09,719 --> 00:02:12,930
fingerprinting terpene profiles are

69
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:14,908
really unique between strains there's a

70
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:16,079
lot of strain fraud in dispensaries Blue

71
00:02:14,908 --> 00:02:16,799
Dreams selling great I'll grow whatever

72
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:17,939
I have and

73
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,040
call it blue dream and how's the

74
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:21,689
budtender gonna know with a terpene

75
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,370
based system you can see a match and

76
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:24,870
based on actual chemical science and say

77
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:27,750
this was actually you know the same

78
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,640
string so the methodologies got three

79
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,900
phases phase one is chemistry chemical

80
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,089
analysis how do we know what terpenes

81
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,400
are in what phase two is computer

82
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,930
assisted algorithms and data analytics

83
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,569
and phase three is putting it all

84
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:42,750
together making the enzyme pathways work

85
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:44,009
so phase one our stage 1 of methodology

86
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,240
is just chemical analysis so for those

87
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:47,909
of you familiar with chemical analysis

88
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:50,520
it's a chromatography GCMs headspace

89
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:51,840
sampler so it's a gas phase sampler and

90
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,340
we're just basically evaporating the

91
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,930
terpenes off the cannabis sample and

92
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,969
separating them and quantifying them

93
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,920
with the mass spec we had to really

94
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:01,109
reduce the data because there's a lot of

95
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:02,219
not so defensible data out there in the

96
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:03,570
cannabis market and that would have

97
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:05,069
thrown off our phase 2 or

98
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:07,289
computer-assisted algorithms so we had

99
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:09,840
to really limit it to just a couple labs

100
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:11,519
that we had to audit very closely total

101
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,629
data set was 958 at the bottom of the

102
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,950
screen here if you're familiar with

103
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,229
terpenes and cannabis i'm sure you're

104
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:18,599
familiar with all of these 20 at the

105
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:20,699
bottom and so a little bit about our

106
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,569
methodology here we have four techniques

107
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:26,969
LC u VL CMS LC liquid and GC liquid

108
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,560
injection and GC headspace they all have

109
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:29,969
advantages and disadvantages we chose

110
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,979
the one all the way at the end the GC

111
00:03:29,969 --> 00:03:33,539
headspace main reasons being it's a very

112
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,929
clean loading with low interference you

113
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:37,859
get good accurate data GC a mass liquid

114
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,750
injection which I know some other

115
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,459
researchers are very fond of has some

116
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,199
maintenance and I only breakdown issues

117
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:45,659
but otherwise it's very comparable the

118
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,979
LC I would honestly stay away from and

119
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:48,030
this is what a chromatogram looks like

120
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,769
for those of you familiar with chemical

121
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:51,509
analysis we can see the numbers here 1

122
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,189
through 36 are the different turbines

123
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:55,709
that were isolated from a cannabis

124
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:58,859
sample and I'll pass it to my partner

125
00:03:55,709 --> 00:04:00,719
for stage 2 so there's been an

126
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,489
exponential increase in the the amount

127
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:04,169
of data associated with cannabis

128
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:06,509
chemical profiles and genetic profiles

129
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:07,889
and as such a lot of traditional as

130
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:09,689
we've seen today a lot of traditional

131
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:12,179
chemometric and metabolomic methods have

132
00:04:09,689 --> 00:04:15,030
been applied including PC Ald a linear

133
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,650
regression and these are great and what

134
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,779
we want to do is take these and put them

135
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,310
into a form that could be better

136
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:22,458
understood and absorbed by the general

137
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,459
public

138
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,150
so some previous studies have found that

139
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:33,340
strain named there's no significant

140
00:04:31,149 --> 00:04:34,839
terpene profile clustering around stream

141
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,388
name so strain aim is not a very good

142
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:41,709
predictor of what the final terpene

143
00:04:37,389 --> 00:04:44,439
profile is going to be and as well last

144
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,120
year we found that the strains can be

145
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:48,370
subdivided into overlapping groups as

146
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,680
we've also seen here based on dominant

147
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,060
terpenes but we what we wanted to do is

148
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,709
instead of basing it on the dominant

149
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,418
terpene we base it on the ratio of some

150
00:04:53,709 --> 00:04:58,089
of the dots several dominant terpenes to

151
00:04:55,418 --> 00:04:59,589
each other so we started with

152
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,939
self-organizing maps which used

153
00:04:59,589 --> 00:05:03,039
basically a bunch of iterations of

154
00:05:00,939 --> 00:05:04,509
principal component analysis to group

155
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,479
the samples into a higher dimensional

156
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:09,219
space use this to see which ones are

157
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,109
appear to be related to each other and

158
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,280
test it out with some k-means clustering

159
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:16,780
use that to translate into our label and

160
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:17,949
just give you a quick overview this is a

161
00:05:16,779 --> 00:05:21,009
self-organizing map

162
00:05:17,949 --> 00:05:22,449
red indicates high concentration that

163
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,759
light whitish blue indicates low

164
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,800
concentration as you could see CBD a

165
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,930
high CBD a strains and high THC a

166
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,160
strains are on opposite sides because

167
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:31,240
they occur differently in different

168
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,070
places in the data there they're

169
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,389
organized by their chemical profile and

170
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:35,918
the profiles are in separate places

171
00:05:34,389 --> 00:05:38,228
there's a little bit of crossover in the

172
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,459
middle but for the most part they exist

173
00:05:38,228 --> 00:05:43,629
on different sides there are different

174
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:45,399
genes that code for each one alright and

175
00:05:43,629 --> 00:05:47,079
so now we're on to the third stage of

176
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:48,489
the methodology once we have the

177
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:50,228
chemical data once we play with it with

178
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,470
let the computers play with it we got to

179
00:05:50,228 --> 00:05:54,788
map this together and explain how these

180
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:56,380
terpenes are being made by enzyme so

181
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:59,288
step one is we needed peer review

182
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,939
literature on enzymes terpene synthases

183
00:05:59,288 --> 00:06:02,469
in higher plants just to get us in the

184
00:06:00,939 --> 00:06:03,939
ballpark and so this is just a

185
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,740
screenshot from a database we've built

186
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:07,360
as you can see there's there's these

187
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,829
columns in the middle you know output 1

188
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,030
output 2 some of them just make one

189
00:06:08,829 --> 00:06:11,889
turkey and some of them make a family

190
00:06:10,029 --> 00:06:13,478
some of them may come in fixed ratios

191
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:15,879
some don't so that's part of the

192
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:19,719
complexity of mapping this out all right

193
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:21,610
and so the idea is to filter through all

194
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,570
of those entries and match them to the

195
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,889
data that we're getting from the

196
00:06:22,569 --> 00:06:25,089
computer assisted algorithms and

197
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:27,550
generate a map that would look something

198
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:29,469
like this but this is a more

199
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:30,728
hypothetical but a more defensible map

200
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,550
think we can link directly back to the

201
00:06:30,728 --> 00:06:34,899
data so now that we've overview the

202
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:37,329
methodology let's actually go through

203
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,649
the data stage one was chemical analysis

204
00:06:37,329 --> 00:06:40,389
so we have 900

205
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:43,599
to eat samples times 20 terpenes which

206
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:44,680
is you know 20,000 data points we

207
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,570
started with a standard approach

208
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,280
statistics right we do average or

209
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,110
standard deviations global Maxima and

210
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:51,219
see what it looks like we did get eleven

211
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,750
terpenes that are at significantly

212
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,580
higher levels than the others and I

213
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:57,220
listed them here at the bottom but it's

214
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:59,019
more fun to look the blue is the mean

215
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,449
blue plus red is mean plus standard

216
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:02,978
deviation blue plus red plus yellow we

217
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:04,629
threw the global maximum on top of that

218
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:05,829
and so when you tally them up you can

219
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:07,029
see that statistically there's 11

220
00:07:05,829 --> 00:07:09,579
players that are going to kind of tower

221
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:10,689
over the others in these profiles so you

222
00:07:09,579 --> 00:07:12,519
think okay we got our eleven that we're

223
00:07:10,689 --> 00:07:14,259
gonna look at there's some issues with

224
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:16,198
that focusing on high concentration

225
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:19,478
turbans is a problematic approach

226
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,860
terpenes are not known to have a same

227
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:22,719
medical effect on the human body just

228
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,280
because of the milligram of linalool

229
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,690
does something doesn't mean that the

230
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:27,099
active dose for another terpene couldn't

231
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:29,019
be much higher or much lower so looking

232
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,189
at the absolute concentration doesn't

233
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:32,439
really give us a good idea of why things

234
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,848
are medically efficacious additionally

235
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,228
there's a lot of been a lot of reports

236
00:07:33,848 --> 00:07:36,969
that terpenes have very complex

237
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,740
metabolic pathways and very complex

238
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:40,900
medical effects on the body and that

239
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,519
small concentrations of other terpenes

240
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,138
can affect the way our bodies processing

241
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,728
the higher concentration turbulence what

242
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,949
some people call the entourage effect or

243
00:07:45,728 --> 00:07:49,598
synergistic effects this means we need a

244
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:51,430
analysis me to go past a dist achill

245
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,990
analysis and do something a little

246
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:55,689
fancier so we can look at the complexity

247
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:58,960
of this 20 variable data set that's

248
00:07:55,689 --> 00:08:02,019
where you come in alright so we turn to

249
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,819
the self-organizing maps here we see the

250
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:05,228
results of the terpenes running the

251
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:08,050
self-organizing maps as you could see

252
00:08:05,228 --> 00:08:10,360
the alpha pining beta pining occur most

253
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,819
often together as well carry off lean

254
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,919
whom you lean and neural light all as

255
00:08:12,819 --> 00:08:16,329
and over here we see limonene alone a

256
00:08:14,918 --> 00:08:18,370
Lawal occurring in a very tight

257
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,779
correlation together and the terpenes

258
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:22,649
occurring together and as you can see

259
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:25,448
they don't occur in the same space

260
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:26,709
Mersin a nossa mean were occurred in

261
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:28,360
different spaces but there is some

262
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,750
overlap and we'll go over that in a

263
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,150
moment

264
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:36,190
and this is just a normalized data

265
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:37,708
plotted plane and all we see is the sum

266
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:42,669
of the points seem to cluster around

267
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:44,829
axes and here we've run it into k-means

268
00:08:42,668 --> 00:08:47,289
clustering and as you could see this is

269
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:49,990
the limonene linalool group versus the

270
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,879
terpenes group and there's three major

271
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,289
clusters that separate very nicely and

272
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:55,169
this into

273
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:56,429
it's three different genetic variants

274
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:59,789
that are producing different relative

275
00:08:56,429 --> 00:09:01,289
amounts of these terpenes and again we

276
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:05,458
see this when comparing the paintings to

277
00:09:01,289 --> 00:09:07,169
the terpenes here we have the merci and

278
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,000
AH sameen so there's a group that

279
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:11,629
produces merci alone is the group that

280
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,909
produces Mersin and AH sameen together

281
00:09:11,629 --> 00:09:17,370
and here the sesqui terpenes carry off

282
00:09:14,909 --> 00:09:18,990
than human occur in a very tight

283
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:23,940
correlation with about a 1 to 3 ratio

284
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:26,370
the others not so much in order for this

285
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:27,959
to work the the there have to be valid

286
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:30,360
methods the methods have to match very

287
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,919
tightly there at the proficiency rounds

288
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,810
and make sure that all the data can be

289
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,299
aggregated and also we want a diverse

290
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:38,099
data set genetic geographically as well

291
00:09:36,299 --> 00:09:41,909
as environmental growing conditions all

292
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,709
that stuff alright so now that we've

293
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:45,659
looked at the patterns we saw from the

294
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:47,278
computer assisted algorithm analysis

295
00:09:45,659 --> 00:09:48,600
let's look at how we can map to how

296
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:51,419
would you make sense of this so just a

297
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,860
quick review you know when you have a

298
00:09:51,419 --> 00:09:54,208
theory where there's two compounds

299
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:55,769
coming from one enzyme with one

300
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,539
precursor we expect to see positive

301
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:59,250
correlation right as that precursor one

302
00:09:57,539 --> 00:10:00,750
at the top as that concentration

303
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:01,919
increases the concentration of the two

304
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:03,299
compounds at the bottoms can increased

305
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:06,568
in a fixed ratio so we see positive

306
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:08,009
correlation when we see two compounds

307
00:10:06,568 --> 00:10:11,028
that have a common precursor would have

308
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:13,708
two enzymes we will see a competitive a

309
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:15,740
situation where their sum is relatively

310
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:17,759
constant as the amount of the precursors

311
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,720
competed by the two substrates we see a

312
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,088
negative correlation and the

313
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:23,190
concentration of those two compounds so

314
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:25,980
using these principles we looked at

315
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:27,810
Koto's 1987 paper to kind of create a

316
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,730
landscape if you will how do other

317
00:10:27,809 --> 00:10:31,409
plants that are more well study than

318
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,839
what we're looking at cannabis make

319
00:10:31,409 --> 00:10:36,719
their terpenes and try to map out a

320
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,579
cannabis map from the materials in the

321
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,959
croteau paper and we got something that

322
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:41,638
looked like this now you can see the

323
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,559
colors don't seem to correlate in these

324
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,778
competitive groups like they should have

325
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:47,278
a moment to go and so this is you know

326
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:49,948
the genetic variation from one plant to

327
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:51,958
the next causing some difficulty so if

328
00:10:49,948 --> 00:10:54,000
we zero in on the different axes that my

329
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:55,318
partner was talking about before before

330
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,360
he was talking about ostomy merci merci

331
00:10:55,318 --> 00:10:59,159
and can appear alone awesome in Kent

332
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,449
there's two real groups one with both

333
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:02,879
and one with only one the best way to

334
00:11:00,448 --> 00:11:04,620
explain this is two enzymes one the

335
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:05,710
produces just machine and one that

336
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,379
produces merci

337
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:10,509
in a fixed ratio assuming that they are

338
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:13,299
of the same gene and they are shuffled

339
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:14,830
alleles we're gonna see you know almost

340
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:16,359
I guess and heterozygous plants of

341
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:17,740
different combinations of this giving us

342
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,649
three ratios which is what we saw

343
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:22,269
nursing only one ratio of Mercy NOS mean

344
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:26,079
which was lighter and then a heavier

345
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:26,679
hasta mean favoring ratio look at the

346
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,850
next one

347
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:29,279
fortunately they get much more

348
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:32,950
complicated than that when you look at

349
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,569
terpene families so the Terpening family

350
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,550
had four we looked at three terpenes

351
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:39,010
Alpha Delta and gamma and then we looked

352
00:11:36,549 --> 00:11:41,259
at caring and they seemed to have the

353
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,819
common precursor that moves their

354
00:11:41,259 --> 00:11:45,129
concentration together which here we

355
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,470
labeled as - but we're hypothesizing to

356
00:11:45,129 --> 00:11:50,350
be a trip in your pyrophosphate or some

357
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:53,080
sort of trip in eel cation on the other

358
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:54,340
side from the common precursor we see

359
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,320
that an enzyme moves it the other way

360
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,399
towards precursor 3 which we're

361
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,379
hypothesizing is Lynn Allen

362
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,970
pyrophosphate because it's known to be a

363
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:02,590
precursor to both limonene linalool

364
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:05,680
which co-occur in our data set very

365
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,450
tightly and again using literature and

366
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,949
other higher plants other than cannabis

367
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:10,240
we're hypothesizing that the common

368
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:13,390
precursor they're competing over is

369
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:15,220
geraniol pyrophosphate now as for the

370
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:16,720
last group orange versus green it's more

371
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:18,820
difficult because the PI names don't

372
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,399
show a very clear correlation with any

373
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,570
other group we at first thought this was

374
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:24,519
anomalous but when we started looking

375
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:27,190
through that literature database we saw

376
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:29,319
that pi mean is synthesized a very large

377
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,390
number of ways there's countless number

378
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,590
of ways to get to that product and in

379
00:12:31,389 --> 00:12:34,179
other plants there's a great diversity

380
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,710
of those enzymes that can get you to

381
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,779
that same product so it's not easy to

382
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,040
draw these linear correlations like we

383
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,169
were doing earlier with a positive or

384
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:43,779
negative correlation conversely on the

385
00:12:41,169 --> 00:12:45,309
orange side we see enzyme for creating

386
00:12:43,779 --> 00:12:47,860
carry off lean and humulin which we

387
00:12:45,309 --> 00:12:50,109
hypothesize uses the precursor farnesyl

388
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,669
pyrophosphate and we think this agrees

389
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:53,050
with our datasets showing a positive

390
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:54,699
correlation in a fixed three-to-one

391
00:12:53,049 --> 00:12:59,049
ratio between carry off lean and human

392
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:00,640
across the dataset so all this comes to

393
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:02,649
the labeling system our goal was to

394
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,049
create a label that would be simple and

395
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:06,579
intuitive for the average consumer it

396
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,259
would provide a standard approach to

397
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:09,310
product categorization in selection it

398
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:11,889
would take something that has been

399
00:13:09,309 --> 00:13:14,319
qualitative the choosing of strains

400
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:15,970
usually by smell and taste and turn it

401
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,860
into something more quantitative and non

402
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,450
subjective like we would see with a

403
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,889
nutrition label over the chemical

404
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:24,210
hazard labels something easy to

405
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:26,740
recognize but also quantitatively based

406
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:29,080
so here's the label and here's sort of

407
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:30,399
how it's set up so we have the thickness

408
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,200
of each radius in a ring that

409
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,899
corresponds to the normalized

410
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,120
concentration of that subgroup the

411
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:40,720
groups that we talked about before which

412
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,580
are splayed out here and so the the

413
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,019
rings can be either solid or split

414
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,750
depending on which of the clusters it

415
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,370
falls into and if they are split then

416
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,659
the ratio of each color corresponds the

417
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:51,730
ratio of those two groups with each

418
00:13:49,659 --> 00:13:53,409
other and what does this translate into

419
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:55,750
so when we run the actual numbers

420
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:58,329
through this system what we get are

421
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,730
these color-coded labels that are very

422
00:13:58,330 --> 00:14:02,470
indicative of the terpene profile and as

423
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,420
you could see you can match strains

424
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,750
using this but you could see the gorilla

425
00:14:04,419 --> 00:14:09,639
glue has almost identical labels whereas

426
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,320
the Casey Jones and cherry diesel are

427
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:13,870
very very close to each other they are

428
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,879
very similar and and if one were to were

429
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,679
to run out of Casey Jones and want

430
00:14:15,879 --> 00:14:18,850
another strain that was very similar and

431
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:23,729
well they could go for that cherry

432
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:26,730
diesel and these are sort of the major

433
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,220
27 major groups since each each of the

434
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:32,920
concentric rings has three possible

435
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:35,259
formats so here are the 27 possible and

436
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:37,539
then here are a histogram of how many

437
00:14:35,259 --> 00:14:38,710
samples in our database were in each of

438
00:14:37,539 --> 00:14:40,809
the groups and as you could see there

439
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,400
are some groups that where most of the

440
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:45,099
data falls and there's there's some that

441
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:48,309
weren't represented at all and this

442
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,680
could mean either these are areas where

443
00:14:48,309 --> 00:14:51,789
breeding needs to happen or areas where

444
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:57,159
it's impossible because of the

445
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:58,959
underlying genetics so that concludes

446
00:14:57,159 --> 00:15:00,309
what's actually been done let's talk

447
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,220
about where we want this to go three

448
00:15:00,309 --> 00:15:05,019
minutes we have a on the left here you

449
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,070
see the 958 that's the database we've

450
00:15:05,019 --> 00:15:07,840
been talking about this whole time on

451
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,910
the right is a small medical paper

452
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,440
database of stuff not behind a paywall

453
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,500
that studies either a cannabinoid or a

454
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,110
terpene and its effect or efficacy on a

455
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,970
known human disorder and the idea is

456
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,190
with this labeling system we're hoping

457
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,660
to facilitate doctor recommendations and

458
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,100
possibly prescriptions of specific

459
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:26,110
cannabis strains with specific chemical

460
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,120
content to specific disorders of course

461
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:30,240
that's the hardest part out of all this

462
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:32,529
is not the chemistry but the medicine so

463
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,470
this is just a screenshot of what this

464
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:34,610
database looks like

465
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:36,680
we only have about five hundred papers

466
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,450
in there again they can't be behind

467
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:40,519
paywalls and they study cannabis so you

468
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:42,140
know Slim Pickens but you know we see on

469
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:43,519
the Left all the publication data and on

470
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:45,679
the right you see those green checkmarks

471
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,360
they're tracking chemical compounds on

472
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,329
the far right you're seeing cannabinoids

473
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,740
THC CBD all that stuff in the middle we

474
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,910
see which disorders being looked at and

475
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,860
on further to the left we're looking at

476
00:15:52,909 --> 00:15:56,059
what terpenes this the study might have

477
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:58,430
looked at now a lot of these studies

478
00:15:56,059 --> 00:16:00,439
didn't look at cannabis because you know

479
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,000
the history is is not easy to do

480
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,950
clinical trials on cannabis so a lot of

481
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,090
this is essential oils a lot of this is

482
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:08,540
other compounds that contain these

483
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:11,750
terpenes and so when we output these

484
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:13,429
5:01 we get a very slim slim pickings

485
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,710
output chart but the idea here is that

486
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:17,209
you see the terpenes in the first column

487
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,879
and then the disorders across the top

488
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:20,900
the number represents the number of

489
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,970
peer-reviewed papers from our database

490
00:16:20,899 --> 00:16:25,069
that indicate a positive effect for that

491
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:26,240
compound on that disorder and so right

492
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,320
now we're in the double digits we're

493
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,820
nowhere we need to go up orders of

494
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:30,980
magnitude before this becomes an actual

495
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:33,590
usable resource or could even possibly

496
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:35,690
be one but the idea is to connect it to

497
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:37,879
the dis comic system to make better

498
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:39,650
recommendations and so this is another

499
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,259
form of output where we basically listed

500
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:43,459
each peer-reviewed paper in a list going

501
00:16:42,259 --> 00:16:45,259
down the left and right and then to the

502
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:47,389
right we have columns basically

503
00:16:45,259 --> 00:16:48,769
populated when a terpene is one of the

504
00:16:47,389 --> 00:16:50,269
compounds of interest studied and then

505
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,309
we eliminated the cannabinoids for this

506
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:54,139
purpose and then we also programmed it

507
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:56,509
to be color coded to the dominant

508
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:58,340
terpene group from our label system so a

509
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:00,439
resource like this with many thousands

510
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:02,570
or hundreds of thousands of papers maybe

511
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,519
would be a much better resource for

512
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:06,199
medical doctors to look qualitatively at

513
00:17:04,519 --> 00:17:07,699
what's actually in the strain and how

514
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:09,110
that is statistically been proven to be

515
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,650
effective against a variety of disorders

516
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:14,899
in in humans one minute and that pretty

517
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,490
much sums up now special thanks to DB

518
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:20,240
labs and MCR labs and I'll leave

519
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:22,689
therapeutics round of applause thank you

520
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,689
very much
