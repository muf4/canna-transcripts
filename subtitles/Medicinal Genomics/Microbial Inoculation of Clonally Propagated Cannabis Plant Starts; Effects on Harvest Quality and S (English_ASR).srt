1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
hello everyone thanks for coming and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:07,519
seeing my talk here appreciate it hope

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,269
everybody had a good lunch

4
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:15,839
so microbial inoculation of clonally

5
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:18,118
propagated plant starts so you know I

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,980
consider this more of a white paper just

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:21,809
so I think everybody in the room needs

8
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,089
to be informed you know we're non

9
00:00:21,809 --> 00:00:26,788
scholar you know really honored to be

10
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:29,399
here in you know this facility with this

11
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:31,710
crowd and you know this audience we

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:34,500
really have a passion for cannabis and

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,390
the scholarly side of it is something

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,909
that we really just have enjoyed as a

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,189
fan base and really using those as tools

16
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:42,869
to advance our learning so appreciate

17
00:00:41,189 --> 00:00:48,988
everybody in this room in this community

18
00:00:42,869 --> 00:00:51,738
a lot I'm Daniel Hendricks I'm the

19
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:55,078
co-founder and CEO of Hendricks farm

20
00:00:51,738 --> 00:00:58,288
we're a cannabis clone nursery so we're

21
00:00:55,079 --> 00:01:01,469
located in Humboldt County we have four

22
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:03,870
operating partners all of the founders

23
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:06,960
were born in Humboldt County we are

24
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:08,670
commercial nursery so what we do is we

25
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:11,339
create clonal starts for other

26
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,849
businesses in specifically Humboldt

27
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,060
County but all around California we have

28
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:19,798
our annual license right now there in

29
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:22,920
the beautiful redwood rain forests of

30
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:24,659
Humboldt County and people have rather

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,609
enjoyed our services and we're really

32
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,520
grateful for that it's our community and

33
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:31,950
that's kind of how we discovered this

34
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:33,929
opportunity to do some research into how

35
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,509
we can maybe contribute to a better

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:41,610
product and just a more environmentally

37
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:44,149
sound cannabis industry so in Humboldt

38
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:48,118
County it's the redwood rain forest

39
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:49,560
mycelium connects all of these trees

40
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,349
they're able to talk and communicate

41
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,899
with each other what they do is the

42
00:01:52,349 --> 00:01:57,209
signal to each other you know pathogens

43
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,840
nutrient exchange a lot of really

44
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:04,919
amazing stuff so underneath our feet is

45
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:07,049
this web of really intelligent

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,959
you know bacterial bio technical

47
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:11,700
applications and I don't know how

48
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:12,250
trained everybody is I'm sure everybody

49
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,349
has

50
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,430
a really strong understanding of some of

51
00:02:14,349 --> 00:02:18,180
the stuff but I'm gonna go over it

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,330
anyways just give some general terms so

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:24,360
raizo bacteria are root colonizing

54
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:28,630
bacteria that form symbiotic

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,520
relationships with many plants so in

56
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:34,150
other industries this is a really common

57
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:37,090
application plant growth promoting raizo

58
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:39,340
bacteria PGP ours have been reported to

59
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,349
support plant growth suppress plant

60
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,420
diseases and increase the yield

61
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:46,629
productivity of many crop producing

62
00:02:43,419 --> 00:02:48,069
plants so in all other agricultural

63
00:02:46,629 --> 00:02:50,139
industries this is really common

64
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,289
they inoculate their crops they see

65
00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:55,059
different kind of agricultural results

66
00:02:53,289 --> 00:02:57,579
and you know the term plant growth

67
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,979
pronating right so bacteria is just an

68
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:03,130
attractive you know acronym we want to

69
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:04,899
see our plants perform better and maybe

70
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:10,030
this is a good opportunity for us to

71
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:12,849
discover how so like I said non Scholar

72
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,520
the the way I was introduced to these

73
00:03:12,849 --> 00:03:18,430
kind of concepts you know was from Jeff

74
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,360
Lowen fells and Elaine Ingraham you know

75
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,519
I worked in the cannabis industry as a

76
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:29,410
pot grower you know for over 20 years

77
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,330
and it was around 2014 I started to get

78
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,150
my curiosity going about what other

79
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:36,010
types of applications whether other

80
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,689
industries could help influence the

81
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,969
cannabis industry because I believes

82
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:42,219
legalization was gonna have a major

83
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:44,829
impact and the cannabis was going to be

84
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:47,680
a big part of our economic success in

85
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:50,890
California in the country in our

86
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,950
community and humble so the concept of

87
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:56,109
the soil food web is to me common sense

88
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:58,659
you know the big things eat the smaller

89
00:03:56,110 --> 00:04:01,000
things and specifically right there at

90
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:04,000
that bacterial point you know the

91
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,909
bacteria are able to digest and make

92
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,379
more available all of these amazing you

93
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:13,209
know phosphates all kinds of nutrients

94
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:15,489
supply that's already there in your soil

95
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,858
so the bacteria is able to break that

96
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:20,590
down and deliver it to your rhizosphere

97
00:04:17,858 --> 00:04:24,219
to your roots of your plant now that is

98
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:27,099
amazingly interesting ok so

99
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:30,040
I get introduced to this concept and

100
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,250
here we are I'm working at Daisy supply

101
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:35,710
in Humboldt County we're sourcing

102
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:38,620
nutrients for other farmers on the

103
00:04:35,709 --> 00:04:40,539
emergence of legalization and with that

104
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:42,340
came a lot of companies wanting to

105
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,110
introduce their new products

106
00:04:42,339 --> 00:04:46,419
everybody had a new product a new

107
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:49,240
solution that was going to recreate

108
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,970
cannabis and one of the most interesting

109
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,600
that I encountered back then was this

110
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:57,490
bacteria roto Pseudomonas palustris so

111
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,910
roto Pseudomonas palustris is a

112
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,579
gram-negative non sulfur purple

113
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:06,370
rod-shaped bacterium found both in

114
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:08,949
aerobic and anaerobic environments so

115
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,610
that means it can survive without oxygen

116
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:14,579
that alone is a pretty exceptional

117
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,160
testament to this bacterial strength and

118
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:20,859
how to use it in cannabis well we wanted

119
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,110
to find out you know the evidence so

120
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,410
there was this product that was being

121
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:28,060
used in the agricultural industry and

122
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:29,980
our customers started to attract to it

123
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,540
they wanted to use this bacterial

124
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,500
inoculant and they were claiming these

125
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:37,870
amazing results this bacteria has

126
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,910
potential for bio remediation it breaks

127
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,939
down waste in polluted environments

128
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,700
that's been proven it can produce

129
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:48,819
hydrogen as a result of nitrogen

130
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:50,979
fixation nitrogen fixation is pretty

131
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:52,930
incredible it can fix nitrogen and

132
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,439
create that nitrogen to make it

133
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:59,918
available to your plant it produces ATP

134
00:05:56,439 --> 00:06:02,740
which the plant uses as energy and it

135
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,529
has the capacity and the capability to

136
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:07,960
fix carbon dioxide as a biomass through

137
00:06:05,529 --> 00:06:11,769
photosynthesis so that was really struck

138
00:06:07,959 --> 00:06:13,930
me as amazing this bacteria you know is

139
00:06:11,769 --> 00:06:15,939
able to absorb parts of the light

140
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,550
spectrum that the plant can't your plant

141
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,560
really only needs is they only able to

142
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,960
absorb that central portion of the light

143
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,019
spectrum right there in the visible

144
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:30,399
light spectrum but bacteria they're able

145
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:32,799
to convert infrared or ultraviolet light

146
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:37,689
and use it as an energy or a food source

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:40,540
so roto Sena Moniz palustris was able to

148
00:06:37,689 --> 00:06:45,069
use that energy infrared and ultraviolet

149
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:48,760
to food their feed their food source and

150
00:06:45,069 --> 00:06:51,279
fix carbon out of carbon dioxide out of

151
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:54,699
the atmosphere and so your plant doesn't

152
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:56,709
have to expend energy to fix carbon wind

153
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,599
roto Pseudomonas palustris is doing it

154
00:06:56,709 --> 00:07:02,829
for you so your plant may use that

155
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:04,870
energy to produce biomass produce

156
00:07:02,829 --> 00:07:07,180
cannabinoids we don't really know so

157
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:11,199
this struck me is really interesting

158
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:13,509
right and as most AG products enter the

159
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:17,740
market there's not a lot of testing so

160
00:07:13,509 --> 00:07:20,079
this AG product this company saw an

161
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:23,019
opportunity in cannabis and they made a

162
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:25,990
cannabis specific product which was a

163
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:29,319
diluted roto Pseudomonas palustris and

164
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:32,620
they had a consortium of bacillus other

165
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:34,779
things and they suggested a dramatic

166
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:36,399
increase in the usage of the product and

167
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,489
that was one of those moments where I

168
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:42,489
froze I said I don't see any evidence

169
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:46,870
why we should be increasing the usage of

170
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,310
this bacteria so drastically just for

171
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,610
cannabis I felt like that was kind of a

172
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:54,430
ploy to use the product more so I wanted

173
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:56,770
to see some studies being done so in

174
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,980
2014 I took a break from the product but

175
00:07:56,769 --> 00:08:01,180
I continued to take an interest in what

176
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:04,120
advancements were being made in cannabis

177
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:07,180
that might help justify use of these

178
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:10,120
products so one of the papers written

179
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,959
that I really enjoyed by max Winston and

180
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:16,030
a number of other authors they published

181
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,129
in Chicago but the studies were done

182
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:20,439
here in California understanding

183
00:08:18,129 --> 00:08:22,629
cultivar specificity and soil

184
00:08:20,439 --> 00:08:26,560
determinants of the cannabis microbiome

185
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:28,839
so the rise of fear what max and his

186
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,110
colleagues were able to establish is

187
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:34,689
that rhizosphere bacteria will colonize

188
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,259
root tissue okay that's a that's a great

189
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:37,150
start

190
00:08:35,259 --> 00:08:39,849
we know that cannabis in the rhizosphere

191
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:42,149
bacteria will actually colonize in the

192
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:45,070
area and also move into the plant tissue

193
00:08:42,149 --> 00:08:48,970
he did a study with Sour Diesel

194
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:50,790
kukuku sh Burmese cultivars Maui Wowi

195
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,259
and white widow

196
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:58,679
and the objective was to understand how

197
00:08:54,259 --> 00:09:00,450
that soil bacterial presence was going

198
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,909
to be distributed into the plant if

199
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:04,670
there was a synergy or capability there

200
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:07,829
and what effect that might have on

201
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:10,019
potency so what he discovered was that

202
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:12,960
the competent composition of the soil

203
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:16,439
and the cultivar specificity determined

204
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,110
the microbiome so what cultivar or clone

205
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:22,110
you might use is going to determine what

206
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:24,750
bacteria the plant allows to come out of

207
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:28,970
the soil and become part of the actual

208
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,970
colonize the actual vascular root tissue

209
00:09:29,059 --> 00:09:33,389
he discovered that cannabinoid

210
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:34,889
concentration in composition was

211
00:09:33,389 --> 00:09:36,720
significantly correlated with the

212
00:09:34,889 --> 00:09:40,019
structure of the under eye so community

213
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,779
so what he found is certain bacterial

214
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:44,579
presence in the soil were also

215
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:47,220
associated with certain cannabinoid

216
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,820
concentrations really interesting stuff

217
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,129
right

218
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:52,379
ok the bacteria in the soil are going to

219
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,779
help us determine what our potencies

220
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:57,200
might be what other terpene or

221
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,939
cannabinoid profiles might be present so

222
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:02,490
the composition of the and erisa

223
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:04,890
communities also suggested root decay so

224
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:07,919
in one of his studies he wasn't able to

225
00:10:04,889 --> 00:10:10,740
get to the end erisa root tissue until

226
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:12,899
eight weeks later weren't sure if how

227
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:16,019
that overall affected some of his

228
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:19,669
results but a really great paper open

229
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:23,460
source really helpful for years later

230
00:10:19,669 --> 00:10:26,370
Mary Ann Scott published in the Canadian

231
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:28,320
Journal of microbiology along with a

232
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:30,950
number of other of her colleagues at

233
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,629
McGill University published this paper

234
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:36,540
endophytes of industrial hemp cannabis

235
00:10:33,629 --> 00:10:40,230
sativa cultivars identification of

236
00:10:36,539 --> 00:10:42,439
cultural bacteria and fungi in leaves

237
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,889
petioles and seeds

238
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:49,620
so with these hemp cultivars Yvonne

239
00:10:45,889 --> 00:10:51,539
crs-1 unka they took the plant tissue

240
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:54,929
from the leaves petioles and seed

241
00:10:51,539 --> 00:10:56,490
embryos and did an analysis they wanted

242
00:10:54,929 --> 00:10:59,789
to see what was there and what was

243
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:02,049
present naturally in this hemp cultivars

244
00:10:59,789 --> 00:11:04,719
natural biker biome

245
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:06,599
and what they discovered it was really

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,800
interesting and also caught my eye

247
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,308
thinking about this roto Pseudomonas

248
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,769
palustris so 44% of the natural

249
00:11:12,308 --> 00:11:18,578
microbiome in the leaves were

250
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:22,659
Pseudomonas and 16% were bacillus in the

251
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:25,888
petioles 39% were Pseudomonas as well as

252
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:28,600
a presence of bacillus bacillus made up

253
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:31,209
18% of the seeds and we actually didn't

254
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,619
see as much Pseudomonas within the seed

255
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:37,028
embryos so for me you know I I like I

256
00:11:35,619 --> 00:11:38,439
said I'm not a scholar I look at this

257
00:11:37,028 --> 00:11:41,198
and I say well there's a tremendous

258
00:11:38,438 --> 00:11:43,568
opportunity you know if naturally the

259
00:11:41,198 --> 00:11:46,208
microbiome already is made up this

260
00:11:43,568 --> 00:11:48,759
Pseudomonas taxa then we probably have a

261
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:52,088
good opportunity that to see that it

262
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:57,639
might uh adhere and be able to colonize

263
00:11:52,089 --> 00:12:00,790
the cannabis root tissue the highest

264
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:02,259
abundance of bacterial strains isolated

265
00:12:00,789 --> 00:12:04,568
from leaves where isolates of

266
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:06,730
Pseudomonas and bacillus respectively

267
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:09,368
that's a quote from Maryanne Scott's

268
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,289
paper and there's a phyllo tree I know

269
00:12:09,369 --> 00:12:13,389
you can't see anything but that does

270
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:17,919
show you know all the different species

271
00:12:13,389 --> 00:12:20,259
and strains that are present there the

272
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,969
most frequently isolated endophytes

273
00:12:20,259 --> 00:12:25,389
belonging to the gram-negative genre

274
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:27,129
Pseudomonas 35% in Penta way a 17

275
00:12:25,389 --> 00:12:29,948
percent and the gram-positive genres

276
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:33,009
stefa locus 16 percent and bacillus 9

277
00:12:29,948 --> 00:12:35,318
percent so again I read this and I'm

278
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:38,048
getting excited I know of a product that

279
00:12:35,318 --> 00:12:40,748
you know needs more research done on it

280
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:45,879
and really we want to see this kind of

281
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:48,999
synergy at our facility so looking at

282
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:50,678
this you know table here we have several

283
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:53,709
bacteria these are the back some of the

284
00:12:50,678 --> 00:12:56,409
bacteria Genesis that were present in

285
00:12:53,708 --> 00:12:59,698
this study and these different

286
00:12:56,409 --> 00:13:03,969
biochemical applications cellulose

287
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:06,008
phosphatase ACN sodaro for production

288
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:09,449
organic acid production we see that

289
00:13:06,009 --> 00:13:12,519
Pseudomonas I can get this to work

290
00:13:09,448 --> 00:13:15,519
has a presence of all of these different

291
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:17,589
biochemical applications so

292
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:22,059
it has a positive association there

293
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:27,610
vassilis like i went to the next screen

294
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:29,939
vassilis was able to be really you know

295
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:32,589
efficient here at this phosphorus

296
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,580
conversion so that was one of the most

297
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:39,040
like powerful clues for me that hey this

298
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,649
might have an effect down stream with

299
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:46,329
you know flower development and flower

300
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:48,700
potency efficiency so in this paper she

301
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:50,528
establishes there's an immense abundance

302
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,570
of Pseudomonas and bacillus in the

303
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:54,519
natural microbiome that makes me feel

304
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:57,660
like this is maybe a good opportunity to

305
00:13:54,519 --> 00:13:59,799
try these different inoculants and also

306
00:13:57,659 --> 00:14:01,778
ethically it feels like i'm not

307
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,278
introducing anything to foreign this is

308
00:14:01,778 --> 00:14:06,070
something that it's already common with

309
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:10,539
in cannabis her study also used only

310
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:13,240
hemp cultivars so as a THC cannabis

311
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:15,699
clone producer i was curious

312
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:20,070
does this work with THC or is this only

313
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:23,230
a CBD you know hemp cultivar application

314
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:25,149
there was another study done in 2018

315
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:26,589
that is not open access so i didn't

316
00:14:25,149 --> 00:14:30,190
share a lot from it there but it also

317
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:32,920
further established that finola hemp was

318
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:35,800
highly receptive to PGP ours in seedling

319
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:39,129
form so in their study they inoculated

320
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:42,069
seedlings found that those bacteria were

321
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:44,379
easily able to colonize colonize the

322
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:47,320
vascular root tissue and establish a

323
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:48,789
presence within the plant the other

324
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,070
thing that they were able to establish

325
00:14:48,789 --> 00:14:54,549
it was that there is a significant

326
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:56,379
cannabinoid increase that the plants

327
00:14:54,549 --> 00:15:00,189
that were inoculated with the bacteria

328
00:14:56,379 --> 00:15:04,269
had a cannabinoid increase Wow I think

329
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:07,450
that is really powerful stuff so our big

330
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:09,730
concept PGP RS can increase the yield

331
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,278
and secondary metabolites of other crops

332
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:15,159
is this same true for medical cannabis

333
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:17,169
cultivars so this was our moment to say

334
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:19,629
okay how can we contribute and how can

335
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:24,669
we make our product better for our

336
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:27,309
farmers down to down the line so we took

337
00:15:24,669 --> 00:15:29,289
one of our clones and we introduced a

338
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:31,149
cannabis root inoculant

339
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,759
we went back and we had the opportunity

340
00:15:31,149 --> 00:15:36,459
now to test this product that so many

341
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,889
years ago hadn't been tested and let's

342
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:44,259
see let's see if the results can match

343
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:46,899
the potential so naturally like I said

344
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:49,569
we saw a tremendous justification for

345
00:15:46,899 --> 00:15:52,629
using Pseudomonas and bacillus roto

346
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,790
Pseudomonas palustris has been

347
00:15:52,629 --> 00:15:57,909
inoculated in grain and demonstrated a

348
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:59,230
9% yield increase now that could be

349
00:15:57,909 --> 00:16:01,600
something that would be really

350
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,490
beneficial to our farmers a 9% yield

351
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:06,420
increase affects your bottom line and

352
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:09,669
that's really powerful bacillus subtilis

353
00:16:06,419 --> 00:16:11,740
bacillus mega terraeum and bacillus lay

354
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:14,019
conformists they're all able to promote

355
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,330
plant Ruth health and stimulate root

356
00:16:14,019 --> 00:16:21,039
hairs cells increase nutrient

357
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:23,500
acquisition so in our experiment we took

358
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:25,929
the products m3 otic plus it was a

359
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,490
product that I said had been built

360
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:29,500
specifically for the cannabis industry

361
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:32,830
and we wanted to see if any of these

362
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:35,289
claims of the productivity and other

363
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:37,270
crops could be applied to cannabis so we

364
00:16:35,289 --> 00:16:39,849
made three inoculum we had a control

365
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:41,769
with no treatment at all we had a one

366
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:44,170
ounce per gallon which was the minimum

367
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:46,659
suggestion on the bottle and then we had

368
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:51,029
a one quarter ounce per gallon

369
00:16:46,659 --> 00:16:53,980
suggestion as well in the finola

370
00:16:51,029 --> 00:16:56,439
experiment we also saw that there was a

371
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:59,379
max point that you can use to much of an

372
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,420
inoculant in which case their results

373
00:16:59,379 --> 00:17:03,730
demonstrated that yield and potency

374
00:17:01,419 --> 00:17:08,769
actually might go down if it's used in

375
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:10,809
excess so there we are at ramblin rose

376
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:12,819
farm as another licensed producer in

377
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:14,379
Humboldt County I don't know why oh it's

378
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,049
up here on this screen you guys can see

379
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,790
the Humboldt County outline that oh

380
00:17:17,049 --> 00:17:20,828
that's where we're located in Humboldt

381
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:23,019
County Northern California ramblin rose

382
00:17:20,828 --> 00:17:26,470
as well as the producers of this

383
00:17:23,019 --> 00:17:28,980
bacteria that's CC with Simba's we're

384
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:31,960
all sitting there pondering the

385
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:34,360
potential of these results all three of

386
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,610
us were blind to the study we only had

387
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:39,639
one person at our facility that knew

388
00:17:36,609 --> 00:17:42,119
which batch was inoculated so we had no

389
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,430
clue which

390
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:49,799
which batch contained the inoculant

391
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:52,080
which ones were the control there's us

392
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,970
taking some of the sampling this was

393
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,549
actually not the official sampling we

394
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,789
did some early sampling tests as well

395
00:17:56,549 --> 00:18:02,190
just to compare the lower and the top of

396
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:06,629
the plant see different kind of potency

397
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,590
results as well so the results were

398
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:10,920
really amazing

399
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:16,259
we saw positive results across the board

400
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:19,830
and just to demonstrate right here lower

401
00:18:16,259 --> 00:18:21,629
twin X got the highest total harvest had

402
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:25,769
the highest trim weight as well as the

403
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:27,990
highest flower weights lower twinsie we

404
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,900
had the lowest total harvest weights and

405
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:35,299
lower twin or lerton y and lower twins

406
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:38,820
II was second with 500,000 375 grams

407
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:42,210
over here is the potency lower twin x

408
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:45,119
overall combined potency THC and THC a

409
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:48,750
was seventeen point nine seven lower

410
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:53,549
twin y fifteen point two seven and lower

411
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:56,640
twinsie fourteen point six and so we

412
00:18:53,549 --> 00:19:00,899
would hope that this would help us clue

413
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:03,440
in that maybe lower twin x was the one

414
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:06,480
that contained the inoculant so this is

415
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:11,039
the overall weight that combines trim

416
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,970
and flower and this is a bar graph of

417
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,950
the potency and so yes we find that

418
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,200
seventeen point nine seven this highest

419
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:21,808
potency was lower twin x this received

420
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:24,690
the highest inoculum floor twin y

421
00:19:21,808 --> 00:19:28,410
fifteen point two seven that received

422
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:30,870
the 1/4 ounce inoculum so the minimum

423
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:33,720
strength inoculant and then this was the

424
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,159
control so really nice cascading graph

425
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,980
there that was really pleasing

426
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,250
especially to the farmer who got an

427
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,200
eighteen point seven five increase in

428
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:45,900
THC and THC a combined versus his

429
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,360
control and found an overall harvest

430
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:51,480
yield increase demonstrated significant

431
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:54,809
nine point nine percent so you can

432
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:55,410
imagine these kind of results scaled the

433
00:19:54,809 --> 00:19:58,259
cross and

434
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,300
tire acre you know if we should get so

435
00:19:58,259 --> 00:20:03,349
lucky is to be able to repeat something

436
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:06,329
like this that might be really powerful

437
00:20:03,349 --> 00:20:08,730
so some of the other things that you

438
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:11,009
know come up in this discussion we still

439
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:13,920
we found an increased yield and we found

440
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:16,619
an increased potency in our test trial

441
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,450
and we don't anticipate that this is

442
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:20,459
gonna be uniform we we're gonna need

443
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,529
lots of other studies to verify this but

444
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,840
there's so many other potentials we

445
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:28,700
found that in the tobacco industry

446
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:31,889
they've been dissing roto Pseudomonas to

447
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:36,620
test its validity as an inoculant

448
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,620
to prevent tmv tobacco mosaic virus

449
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:42,960
right after our paper was published and

450
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:47,419
testing and terpene magazine another

451
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:50,039
paper was printed in 2019 further

452
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:53,720
exemplifying that we need more research

453
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:57,450
on specifically these two bacteria so

454
00:20:53,720 --> 00:21:00,059
dong my Lu excuse me for mispronouncing

455
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:02,190
his name if I did that he wrote this

456
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,899
paper along with his colleagues plant

457
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:06,360
growth promoting rise up bacteria for

458
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,759
cannabis production yield cannabinoid

459
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:11,579
profile and disease resistance and that

460
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:13,769
just immediately left off the table I

461
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,319
read it worried that he'd beat me to all

462
00:21:13,769 --> 00:21:19,170
of my research but he was actually just

463
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:21,419
helping us justify further that research

464
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:24,120
needs to be done specifically on these

465
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:26,789
two so the potential role of PGP ARS

466
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:29,399
focused on two genre Pseudomonas and

467
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:32,220
bacillus in his paper and he predicted

468
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,440
that it will achieve higher yields have

469
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,400
more desirable cannabinoid profiles as

470
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:42,150
well as disease resistance plant growth

471
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:44,430
front is the same paper so biological

472
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:46,400
control in deeds disease resistance

473
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:49,680
associated with PGP ours

474
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,930
powdery mildew in blight control well

475
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,940
these things are virtually unexplored in

476
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:56,880
cannabis production you know these

477
00:21:53,940 --> 00:22:00,529
bacterial inoculants may have very

478
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,390
powerful defense mechanisms against crop

479
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:07,049
crop damage that everyone in this

480
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:09,090
industry is experiencing so you know we

481
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:12,000
see this as just further justification

482
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:14,459
that the small bit of research that we

483
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,250
do we've done needs to go a lot further

484
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:18,960
and it could potentially you know affect

485
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:21,210
more than just our yield and harvest

486
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,180
quality it may have affect the overall

487
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:25,610
health and disease control within the

488
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:30,299
industry as a whole

489
00:22:25,609 --> 00:22:32,429
so it has capabilities that potential

490
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:34,619
you know as a plant pathogen defense

491
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:36,690
roto Pseudomonas palustris has been

492
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:38,939
researched as a plant defense and bio

493
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:42,180
control induction of plant resistance of

494
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:44,759
tobacco music mosaic virus infection so

495
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:48,509
it would be really powerful knowing that

496
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:50,039
this tobacco mosaic virus right now is

497
00:22:48,509 --> 00:22:52,710
causing problems within the cannabis

498
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:55,859
industry be great to see some defense

499
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:59,009
mechanisms against it it could have a

500
00:22:55,859 --> 00:23:00,689
huge environmental impact so similar

501
00:22:59,009 --> 00:23:03,690
crops inoculated have demonstrated

502
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:08,039
higher yield with less water and less

503
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:11,610
fertilizer usage roto Pseudomonas it has

504
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:14,549
the potential to retain moisture so

505
00:23:11,609 --> 00:23:17,219
during those drought periods crops tend

506
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:19,829
to have a lot less stress and a lot less

507
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:22,319
stress effects based on the fact that

508
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:25,740
the bacteria are able to retain the

509
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:28,379
moisture within their own body and as

510
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:31,740
they die they release that moisture back

511
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:34,800
to the plant so it helps mitigate stress

512
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,779
and then of course quality and yield you

513
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,180
know Pseudomonas and bacillus inoculate

514
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:41,819
has potential as an affordable and

515
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:45,600
environmentally friendly application so

516
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:48,720
you know all we had to do in order to

517
00:23:45,599 --> 00:23:52,889
see these results in the field was make

518
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:56,100
a very very small maybe two gallon batch

519
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:57,930
of this inoculant and just submerge the

520
00:23:56,099 --> 00:23:59,639
plants and the root tissue in it we

521
00:23:57,930 --> 00:24:02,610
never went out and inoculated in the

522
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,440
field we never did anything different

523
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:06,750
with any of those crops all we had was

524
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:09,090
the single stage so the farmer didn't

525
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:13,460
have to do anything different and what

526
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:15,990
an amazing you know potential result

527
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:18,360
thank you we really appreciate you guys

528
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:20,539
coming today this is some gelato grown

529
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,539
by

530
00:24:20,589 --> 00:24:25,869
ramblin rose farm they did a wonderful

531
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,370
and beautiful job and if you have any

532
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:30,019
questions you'd like to get ahold of me

533
00:24:27,369 --> 00:24:33,798
there's my information thank you

534
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,798
[Applause]

535
00:24:37,799 --> 00:24:51,190
if anybody has any questions I know in

536
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:53,590
California you don't have to test for

537
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:55,840
total aerobic bacteria but have you

538
00:24:53,589 --> 00:24:57,759
tested to see if this increase in

539
00:24:55,839 --> 00:25:00,909
microbials will artificially inflate

540
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:02,740
total testing no I have it and that's a

541
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:04,930
really good question I've been asking

542
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:07,930
some of the testing companies if they're

543
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:10,539
able to identify between you know plant

544
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:12,789
growth promoting bacteria and you know

545
00:25:10,539 --> 00:25:13,960
potential harmful pathogens and that's

546
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:16,149
not really something that they're doing

547
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:18,579
right now so that that is a really good

548
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:22,390
question and definitely something that

549
00:25:18,579 --> 00:25:26,199
we all need take a look at yeah her

550
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:28,240
point yeah a lot of the testing labs are

551
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,789
doing plating at least where I come from

552
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,650
in Massachusetts and plating is

553
00:25:30,789 --> 00:25:34,359
notorious because I can't tell the

554
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:36,190
difference not only between bacterial

555
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:40,059
strains but even live and dead bacteria

556
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:42,660
mm-hmm so it's caused a big issue so I

557
00:25:40,059 --> 00:25:46,470
think it would behoove you to have

558
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:49,690
really a ready answer for whether

559
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,990
possibly this bacteria could in fact

560
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:54,970
cause a failure and a test to take place

561
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:58,480
because it's an important question but

562
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:03,059
my question is really when you're

563
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:08,920
applying this inoculant do you have any

564
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:11,019
notion of the degradation period of the

565
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:15,279
bacteria in other words like how long

566
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:18,789
after exposure is is the bacteria going

567
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:21,819
to be soluble it's and without being

568
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:23,349
decorated right yeah I I'm not sure it's

569
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:25,899
a really good question you know I know

570
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:28,419
that the product that we use is

571
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:30,430
guarantees a shelf stability for 18

572
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:33,190
months before you open the bottle and

573
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:35,529
then once you open the lid it guarantees

574
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:37,840
another six months where before the

575
00:26:35,529 --> 00:26:40,599
bacteria starts to degrade so this in

576
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:43,329
this case they stabilize it in a liquid

577
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:46,269
and so by having in a liquid they're

578
00:26:43,329 --> 00:26:48,319
able to actually have the community feed

579
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:51,109
and continue to grow

580
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:54,159
it's on the shelf but I think that

581
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:57,019
ultimately we have to take a much more

582
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:58,790
scientific approach to answer some of

583
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,180
those questions all those bacterias need

584
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:05,089
to be individually studied in different

585
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:07,250
combinations of those consortiums need

586
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:09,740
to be analyzed so we can actually try

587
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:12,619
and determine what bacteria are even

588
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,750
contributing and I and I would love to

589
00:27:12,619 --> 00:27:16,609
work with you know any of the

590
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:18,170
intelligent minds in this room and at

591
00:27:16,609 --> 00:27:20,089
this facility to help answer those

592
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:24,470
questions Thanks

593
00:27:20,089 --> 00:27:26,809
yeah thank you let me say I thought it

594
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,940
was an excellent bit of research my

595
00:27:26,809 --> 00:27:32,990
question for you is do you have research

596
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,720
plans continuing forward yeah I don't

597
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:38,329
think we've framed those plans yet you

598
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,160
know we kind of put this together as a

599
00:27:38,329 --> 00:27:42,049
white paper I didn't even really

600
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:44,090
necessarily think that it was gonna be

601
00:27:42,049 --> 00:27:46,849
something that we've even developed into

602
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:49,429
this you know kind of a publication or

603
00:27:46,849 --> 00:27:52,219
this kind of an opportunity and I think

604
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:54,170
that you know we like I said being non

605
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,870
scholars we really want to look to the

606
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:59,090
community to see well what what

607
00:27:56,869 --> 00:28:02,179
weaknesses you know are we presenting

608
00:27:59,089 --> 00:28:03,919
here in our approach and and how can we

609
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,390
make it better so we're open to

610
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:08,630
suggestion okay

611
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:11,570
I'm dr. Roger Kern I am a plant

612
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:13,790
scientist and microbiologist originally

613
00:28:11,569 --> 00:28:16,279
out of UC Davis I'd love to sit down and

614
00:28:13,789 --> 00:28:18,079
just talk with you about where you see

615
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:19,069
things going yeah we really appreciate

616
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:24,889
that thank you

617
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:28,490
look forward to that hi Daniel

618
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:30,830
can you talk to root exudates as far as

619
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,200
a mechanism for stimulating the ribosome

620
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:37,220
to be more productive for the release of

621
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:41,200
nutrients back into the root system I am

622
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:44,420
not qualified I you know I I definitely

623
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,799
enjoy you know all the literature but I

624
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,660
wouldn't say that I'm qualified to

625
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:51,769
actually answer that question

626
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:54,080
thank you yeah thanks thank you

627
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:58,500
everybody really appreciate it

628
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:58,500
[Applause]
