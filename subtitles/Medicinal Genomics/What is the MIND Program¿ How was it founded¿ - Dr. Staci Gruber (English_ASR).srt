2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:14,678
and then took a few years off but now we

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,079
we're excited to have you back um in

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,118
your presentation we'll share data from

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:21,599
several clinical trials that you and

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:24,480
your team are performing as part of the

7
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,800
Mind program so that's probably a good

8
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:30,518
place to start tell us a bit about the

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,120
Mind program why it was founded and how

10
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:35,280
its 10 years of research have led you to

11
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,000
this point sure well first I will say

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,399
this I'm delighted to be heading back to

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,759
Canad this year and yes I was part of

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,840
early early caned meetings and thought

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:47,399
and still think it's um really one of

16
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,719
the best meetings there there is um and

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,439
I think it's a great opportunity to

18
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,239
interact with people from lots of

19
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:58,000
different areas um related to cannabis

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:01:00,159
and cannaboid based um work so the Mind

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,238
program did just celebrate its 10

22
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,478
anniversary which seems odd to me um I

23
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,560
will tell you I spent several decades

24
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:08,879
looking among other things at the impact

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,680
of recreational Cannabis on different

26
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,079
aspects of function so cognitive

27
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,960
performance and clinical outcome

28
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,599
measures of brain structure and function

29
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:17,118
you name it and we had done lots of

30
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:20,319
different studies again looking at the

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,078
impact of recreational cannabis and when

32
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:24,478
Massachusetts was on the precipice of

33
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,158
legalizing medical cannabis I scoured

34
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,039
the literature I thought let me see what

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,600
do we know about the long-term effects

36
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:32,320
of medical cannabis because as you

37
00:01:29,599 --> 00:01:35,478
probably know cannabis was Rel legalized

38
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:37,039
in this country in 1996 in California

39
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:38,000
and despite that interestingly enough

40
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,720
there really was nothing in the

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,560
literature nothing at all about

42
00:01:39,719 --> 00:01:43,840
long-term effects of medical cannabis

43
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,200
use I found some evidence for certain

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,840
types of studies that looked at you know

45
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,920
sort of a a quick and dirty if you will

46
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,880
um assessment of cognition as part of a

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,079
different kind of very short type of

48
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:57,798
study but nothing that was longterm

49
00:01:56,078 --> 00:01:59,919
nothing that followed patients over time

50
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:02,360
and certainly nothing that looked at

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,879
cognition or clinical outcomes as a

52
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:06,478
primary focus and so I launched

53
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:08,598
marijuana investigations for

54
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,680
neuroscientific Discovery or the Mind

55
00:02:08,598 --> 00:02:13,639
program with the singular focus of

56
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,159
looking at the long-term impact of

57
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:18,719
medical cannabis use and at the time I

58
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:21,199
think a number of people were sort of

59
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:23,359
like well you know you can do what you

60
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,639
you can try to look at these folks over

61
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,599
time but these are primarily

62
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:28,679
recreational people who are really just

63
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:30,719
looking for a legal way to use cannabis

64
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,159
and I I first and foremost I would say

65
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:34,400
that that was absolutely positively

66
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:35,639
untrue I knew it then and I can now I

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,680
can really point to you and say

68
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:42,079
absolutely it's it's not true um so it's

69
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,400
been an extremely important um program I

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,879
think it's still the only one like it in

71
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,560
the country and it's home to what we

72
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:49,598
call a number of Firsts we were the

73
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:51,719
first ever to do long-term assessment so

74
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:53,719
we look at patients before they begin

75
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:56,719
using medical cannabis and that's really

76
00:02:53,719 --> 00:02:58,519
important so people have different types

77
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,840
of indications or conditions whether

78
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,879
it's chronic pain anxiety or mood

79
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,519
disruption sleep disruption you name it

80
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,120
but we look at them before they begin

81
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,480
using medical cannabis products then we

82
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,599
follow them over time they use any old

83
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:12,199
products they would like to use and we

84
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:14,318
have those products analyzed by an

85
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:16,560
outside lab so we know quote what's in

86
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:18,000
your wheat um that's because it's not a

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,759
clinical trial and I'm not controlling

88
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,360
what's given to them but then we can of

89
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,000
course look at their exposure to

90
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,440
different cannaboids over time which is

91
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,799
incredibly helpful in the meantime we're

92
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,239
looking at primary outcomes like chronic

93
00:03:27,799 --> 00:03:32,159
pain like mood like sleep and then of

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,680
course measures of cognitive performance

95
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:38,359
and thankfully measures of brain

96
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,519
structure function quality of life Etc

97
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,959
and I think that again some of these

98
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,480
firsts that mind um has has sort of been

99
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:50,360
fortunate enough to to put on the map um

100
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:52,438
should be really

101
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,000
just what I would call the beginning of

102
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,919
the story right this is just the tip of

103
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,598
the iceberg so yes we're the first ever

104
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,318
to look at long-term outcome and

105
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:00,359
cognitive performance and first ever to

106
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:01,719
do IM

107
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,840
first us to do some of these clinical

108
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,799
trials all of which are informed by

109
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,200
these long-term observational studies

110
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,159
they tell us the directions that we need

111
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,000
to focus on patients have always been

112
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,399
our greatest source of information they

113
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,318
lead the way we follow them which is a

114
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,120
little backwards in terms of medicine

115
00:04:15,318 --> 00:04:20,759
right it's not usual but we do it um so

116
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,240
it's been an incredibly rewarding time

117
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,560
um and I think the program is

118
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,879
unbelievably um helpful and now has

119
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,000
really expanded so it's um it's been

120
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,199
it's been a great Journey so far great

121
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,918
so you mentioned there was a lack of

122
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,038
long-term studies how long are we

123
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,159
talking so in terms of the types of

124
00:04:39,038 --> 00:04:42,800
longitudinal studies that we're doing

125
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,919
yeah so if you look at the literature

126
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,759
again we were we were looking at

127
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:49,758
legalization here in Massachusetts in

128
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,720
2012 and there was nothing in literature

129
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,840
our first studies were designed to look

130
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,639
at individuals up to one year and again

131
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:58,519
I had a lot of people say good luck

132
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:00,079
they'll never stay well uh we have the

133
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:01,639
opposite problem which is that once we

134
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:03,680
begin looking at people over time and

135
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:05,800
establish relationships and people come

136
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,478
in and we have these very comprehensive

137
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,520
assessments they're interested in

138
00:05:07,478 --> 00:05:11,959
staying connected so we started off

139
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,839
looking at outcome between Baseline and

140
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:17,319
3 months 6 months 12 months and every

141
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,799
month um our team contacts them and we

142
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:20,719
get an idea of what they're using how

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,560
they're using frequency magnitude all

144
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,960
that stuff but these in-depth

145
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,800
assessments at the Milestone visits then

146
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:28,719
we went out to two years then three

147
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,840
years now we're following people all the

148
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,280
way out to five years which is amazing

149
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:37,279
amazing so that's really

150
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:37,279
lucky excellent

151
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:51,110
