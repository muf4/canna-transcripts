1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:08,300
hi everyone thank you for the people

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,780
that are not on the beach now

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,780
the few of us

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:16,800
um I've been in an argument in my

5
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:20,579
faculty months ago if it's closing

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,339
remarks or just the last one that

7
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,559
non-bandy wants really to hear so I will

8
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:27,000
call it closing remarks

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:28,140
my

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,140
own

11
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,439
you know self-esteem so thank you very

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,679
much to to the people that stay with me

13
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:37,019
here

14
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:39,019
[Music]

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
um

16
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:45,000
let me see how this work like that okay

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,440
so my name is Daddy Mayuri I'm a

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,019
professor of the technique on the

19
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:52,439
technology Institute of Israel as a

20
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,100
disclaimer also owner of Kennesaw which

21
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:59,519
is a company they're doing analytics but

22
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,620
also a lot in the r d and part of the

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,960
results that I will show you here been

24
00:01:01,619 --> 00:01:06,359
done also in cancel

25
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,200
cannabis

26
00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:13,319
I think it's stupid to show this

27
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,659
figure here in the last session of the

28
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:17,699
days and also to say that is a unique

29
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:20,759
plan that harboring unique molecule

30
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,219
called cannabinoids it's affecting the

31
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:24,959
endocannabinoid system in our body but

32
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:28,259
I'm saying that

33
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:30,359
to people that maybe not admire how

34
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,299
complicated the endocannabinoid system

35
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:36,180
or how complicated cannabis is

36
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:38,700
the endocannabinoid system is a system

37
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,740
in our body that every cell in our body

38
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,680
harboring the endocannabinoid system and

39
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:44,780
being affected by endocannabinoids so

40
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,180
there is

41
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,719
220 some different types of cells in our

42
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:55,200
body whether there is a neuron whether

43
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:58,560
are these are a skin cells or liver

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,600
cells they're all harboring receptors

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,939
for the endocannabinoid system can

46
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:04,798
produce endocannabinoids

47
00:02:02,938 --> 00:02:07,939
in the blood samples today we can

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,039
analyze more than 120 different ligands

49
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:13,378
endocannabinoids and there are more than

50
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:15,779
30 receptors that we are looking on them

51
00:02:13,378 --> 00:02:18,000
actually the endocannabinoid system it's

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,180
a communication between two cells one

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,818
cells send the signal to another cell

54
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,000
increase appetite reduce pain increase

55
00:02:23,818 --> 00:02:29,479
heart beating modulating of glucose

56
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,539
modulation or glucose

57
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:35,399
intake and immune cells they're all

58
00:02:33,539 --> 00:02:37,799
being controlled by the endocannabinoid

59
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,860
system we didn't say any word till now

60
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,280
about cannabis it's

61
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,620
system in our body that control and

62
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:50,519
balance

63
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:53,340
doing kind of a homeostasis on almost

64
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,819
all the cells in our body cannabis was

65
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:58,259
just totally unlucky to produce similar

66
00:02:56,818 --> 00:03:02,518
molecules

67
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:05,340
to the molecules that our body producing

68
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,459
more than 10 000 years ago people

69
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,500
started to breed this plant and to

70
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:13,439
increase the amount of these molecules

71
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,598
and create kind of a puppy kind of a

72
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,419
poodle plant it's not a natural plant

73
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:20,518
okay I know that there is people from

74
00:03:18,419 --> 00:03:23,699
Morocco here that told me you need to

75
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:26,400
come in to see the original Plants guys

76
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:28,799
ten thousand years ago people walk with

77
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,900
that breed it there is no Regional it's

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:37,140
all been produced by humans the Cannabis

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:40,799
shouldn't produce more than 0.1 0.2

80
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,979
percent of fetal cannabinoids who is

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,860
here published few years ago about 60

82
00:03:43,979 --> 00:03:48,780
some plants producing phytocannabinoids

83
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,700
the difference between them to cannabis

84
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,680
is the amount of phytocannabinoids

85
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:55,798
cannabis was breathing and Britain

86
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:58,140
Britain and we create a plant that

87
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,319
Harbor a lot of

88
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:04,378
of these molecules in high percentage

89
00:04:01,318 --> 00:04:06,899
people from the 60s can tell you that in

90
00:04:04,378 --> 00:04:09,239
Woodstock it was six percent THC and not

91
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,879
36 percent THC why

92
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,200
we didn't do the breeding right that's

93
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:14,459
all okay

94
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,958
so

95
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:19,978
cannabis

96
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:22,079
it's not the one plant it's a lot of

97
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,478
I will call the chemovars different

98
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,079
variation that harboring different

99
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:31,379
combination of these molecules

100
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:34,939
and in my lab we identified 11 different

101
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,779
families that we can analyze around 166

102
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:39,540
phytocannabinoids and the big question

103
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,179
in these Arena

104
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:44,100
and this is similar to what I talked

105
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:46,978
last year but I will take it for a

106
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,680
different angle soon the big question is

107
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:51,659
how you match the right flower to the

108
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
right indication how you match the right

109
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:56,820
flower to the right bread right if

110
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,900
cannabis or the endocannabins can

111
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:02,879
influence pain sleep appetite immune

112
00:05:00,899 --> 00:05:05,819
glucose

113
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,939
so which combination of molecule which

114
00:05:05,819 --> 00:05:12,060
plant can affect the appetite which one

115
00:05:08,939 --> 00:05:13,680
affecting immune or which one of them

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:16,680
reducing pain

117
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,079
so how we are doing that and I show

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:21,600
these results enough time in Canada so I

119
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,159
will go fast to reach the point that I

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,160
want to talk about it

121
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:30,000
so how we can do that we can screen

122
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,060
on on Cell culture we can take data from

123
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,000
patient we can do many things to Define

124
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:38,038
which cannabis is affecting which

125
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,439
indication so if we're screening we can

126
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:42,599
grow cells on the plate like that we can

127
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,399
grow cells on the plate that have many

128
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Wells we can have equipment that's

129
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:49,439
screening it very fast in the lower

130
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:52,079
plate you can see 96 well played that

131
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,839
have 96 well you can put different types

132
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:56,519
of cannabis different dosing and there

133
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:59,038
is equipment that's screening very fast

134
00:05:56,519 --> 00:06:02,038
I won't go on that it's not important

135
00:05:59,038 --> 00:06:04,019
and these are results from my lab most

136
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,879
of you already saw that result I'm

137
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:08,099
showing that in the last three years so

138
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:11,959
I'm going fast on them this is how

139
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:14,460
cannabis influence leukemia we know that

140
00:06:11,959 --> 00:06:16,560
cannabis affecting the immune cells so

141
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:19,680
how it's affecting the cancer of the

142
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,280
immune cells so alibaster PhD in my lab

143
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,199
take a tll which is a specific types of

144
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:27,179
leukemia screen of them different

145
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,240
chemother of cannabis you see every

146
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,978
color it's a different came over and you

147
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,900
see when the line is lower the mean that

148
00:06:31,978 --> 00:06:35,758
it kill more cells so you see that in

149
00:06:33,899 --> 00:06:37,560
two microgram per ml most of the

150
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:39,900
Cannabis didn't affect the leukemia but

151
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,519
there was one excerpt that was very

152
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,620
efficient killing the leukemia because

153
00:06:41,519 --> 00:06:45,779
leukemia is a given name to many

154
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,180
different diseases we tested different

155
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:50,879
types of leukemias and we saw that in 50

156
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,400
of them these types of cannabis kill the

157
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,259
leukemia very efficiently in 50 percent

158
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:57,899
of them it didn't affect actually the

159
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,660
opposite what I showed 50 did an effect

160
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,818
and 50 is killed very efficiently

161
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:04,680
so we screen this 10 through camera we

162
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,780
did the genomic screening and we find

163
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,840
that every time that there is a specific

164
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:11,758
mutation called Notch one this specific

165
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,859
cannabis killing the cells when every

166
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,900
time that there is no mutation it's not

167
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,538
affecting the cells what I'm trying to

168
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:20,279
show you it's how specific it is

169
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:22,139
cannabis can kill cancer Rick Simpson

170
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:25,198
Oil no

171
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:27,660
one type of cannabis from 200 and some

172
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:29,520
different chemothers that we test was

173
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,740
the only ones that affect this leukemia

174
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,299
from that it's not all the leukemias

175
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,720
it's just leukemia that harboring

176
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,639
specific mutation and this Notch one is

177
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,560
a protein sitting on the membrane field

178
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
the other cells nearing what we call

179
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,478
contact contact inhibition doesn't

180
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,240
important we take we take this specific

181
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:51,899
leukemia we create mice model for

182
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,660
leukemia you can see a city of a mice

183
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,538
with a cancer in his back

184
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:59,460
we're treating these mice with cannabis

185
00:07:57,538 --> 00:08:02,639
with this specific extract you can see

186
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:04,918
the black line on the left it's two more

187
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,819
of with mice that didn't treat with the

188
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:10,918
Cannabis how the tumor are growing

189
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:13,259
exponentially while the gray line is

190
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:15,959
mice that Harbor tumors that treated

191
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:18,120
with this specific cannabis which the

192
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:20,399
the tumors didn't grow on the right side

193
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,620
you can see the tumors before and after

194
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,478
three weeks treatment because this is

195
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:27,660
Leukemia we did the bone marrow into

196
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:30,300
implantation with primary cells from

197
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:33,418
patients we show that we are doubling

198
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,219
the lifespan of of the mice we did five

199
00:08:33,418 --> 00:08:38,098
different mice model and we showed it

200
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,379
now we're asking which molecules from

201
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:43,379
the Cannabis doing this effect these are

202
00:08:40,379 --> 00:08:45,778
all the molecules that these

203
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:48,600
specific extract is harboring we're

204
00:08:45,778 --> 00:08:50,700
taking this extract we fractionated with

205
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,759
taking pieces we said there is 100

206
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,980
molecules that take 25 25 25 and 25

207
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,679
we're going back to the cells on the

208
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,539
mice and you see that the first line the

209
00:08:58,679 --> 00:09:02,219
vehicle didn't kill the cells the whole

210
00:09:00,539 --> 00:09:04,980
extract extract number tell was very

211
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:07,519
efficient killing gases and then four

212
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,839
fraction and just fraction number two

213
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,019
mimic the all extracts so we're already

214
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,880
eliminating 75 of the molecules that we

215
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,639
don't need and we're going back and

216
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,860
forth and what's important here is that

217
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:22,679
in the end we succeed to analyze three

218
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:24,720
molecules just three that if you take

219
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:26,639
them synthetic or purified from the

220
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,680
plant and take the three of them you get

221
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,879
exactly the same action as the whole

222
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:32,458
extract

223
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:34,860
if you take any one of them and this is

224
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:37,500
the boss in the left low every one of

225
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:40,259
them a combination of two of them it's

226
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:44,039
not working as good as the three of them

227
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:46,679
together okay and we did a lot of Cell

228
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,259
Biology and biochemistry and this paper

229
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:51,239
actually published last week we did a

230
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:53,580
lot of work in the end

231
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:56,519
we Define exactly the mechanism of

232
00:09:53,580 --> 00:10:00,000
action these three molecules CBD cbdv

233
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:02,519
and a new cannabinoids we call the 3318

234
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,519
binding two different receptors CB2 and

235
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:07,980
trp1 and doing a full action of many

236
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,100
proteins and with I won't get into that

237
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,320
now that actually blocking in the Golgi

238
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:17,159
the ability of the mutant protein to

239
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,620
reach the membrane a lot of biology with

240
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,439
most of you are not scientists and not

241
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:25,679
Physicians which is not important to you

242
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,180
what I want to say we understand why we

243
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:30,059
need free molecules and we understand

244
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:32,519
what they are doing the cells and why

245
00:10:30,059 --> 00:10:34,079
there is mutation it's killing the cells

246
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:35,879
and when there is no mutations not

247
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:39,000
killing the cells

248
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:41,519
we Bridging the Gap between herbal

249
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,019
medicine between saying this is a plane

250
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,200
that affecting

251
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:48,839
to real modern science and modern

252
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,879
medicine showing these are the molecules

253
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,740
this is the Affinity this is the ability

254
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:55,439
this is what they are doing this why you

255
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,940
need the three of them but pay attention

256
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,740
we need three of them

257
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,079
most of the drugs that have been

258
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,360
approved by the FDA it's single molecule

259
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:05,578
to single Target why because we're

260
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,778
afraid from drug drug interaction and

261
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:10,799
more things

262
00:11:06,778 --> 00:11:13,379
this is kind of Next Level I can show

263
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,179
with different work that sometimes we

264
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:18,838
can isolate single molecules from

265
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,639
Cannabis in that in that slide we see

266
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:23,700
from breast cancer different types of

267
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:27,720
cancer we isolate different type of

268
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:27,720
molecule we call it 3337315b

269
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:32,880
similar a little bit to CBG but you can

270
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:35,278
say that there is three oxygen there and

271
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:38,278
this molecule reduce the activity of the

272
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:42,600
estrogen receptor and for that reason in

273
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:45,059
estrogen receptor in breast cancer a a

274
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:47,639
dependent estrogen receptors it can

275
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:49,859
affect the cells okay

276
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:52,860
again not important the breast cancer

277
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:55,980
and the results the idea in this case

278
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:58,379
it's one molecule it's not THC not CBD

279
00:11:55,980 --> 00:12:00,360
not CBG you can call it minor

280
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:03,659
cannabinoids it won't be minor if it's

281
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:06,300
if your breast cancer patient okay it's

282
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:08,519
a molecule that reduce the estrogen

283
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:10,919
and for that it can affect

284
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:12,480
estrogen but this is now it's one

285
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,519
molecule

286
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,200
so I showed you that cannabis can affect

287
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:20,220
cancer in different way different cancer

288
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:22,320
different cannabis is it always good

289
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,180
so this is a different question on drug

290
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,620
drug interaction what are these

291
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:28,078
molecules we've known we know nothing

292
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:31,320
about this molecule we don't know if

293
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,659
it's safe if it's not safe

294
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:37,019
but we asked few years ago we know that

295
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:38,759
cannabis modulate the immune system we

296
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,560
know that it's good for inflammatory

297
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,838
bowel disease we know that for

298
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:44,879
autoimmune disease patient Israel being

299
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:47,639
treated with cannabis

300
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,278
and I showed you that's affecting T

301
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:53,700
cells in in leukemia

302
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:55,820
one of the best treatment today in

303
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:59,959
cancer or the most

304
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:03,500
Innovative treatment is in immunotherapy

305
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:06,958
immunotherapy is when we are telling or

306
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,759
teaching the immune cells to attack the

307
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,699
cancer cells the cancer doing two things

308
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,659
and I will show a slide in a moment he

309
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,820
changing the micro environment near him

310
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:19,379
and actually changed the immune system

311
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:21,600
to bring

312
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:24,120
cells that are not attacking him

313
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,220
actually quite supporting him he's doing

314
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:29,278
two tricks first of all he presenting

315
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,339
protein said hey himself I'm one of the

316
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:34,078
cells from the body don't attack me

317
00:13:31,339 --> 00:13:36,779
secondly produce specific proteins that

318
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:40,319
exhausting the immune cells to attacking

319
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:42,059
him make the immune cells weaker okay

320
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,240
how can this is the fact that if

321
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:47,399
cannabis reducing so we're giving a

322
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,600
treatment that actually activating the

323
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,539
immune system

324
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,300
but cannabis reduce the immune system

325
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:56,099
activity in inflammatory bowel disease

326
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:57,359
in autoimmune disease I showed you in

327
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,720
the leukemia

328
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,300
so if you look on the literature

329
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,820
okay if you look on the literature there

330
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:07,919
are few Publications that show that

331
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:10,139
patient these are clinical trials

332
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,500
patients that getting immunotherapy and

333
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:16,680
cannabis it's actually improve the

334
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:19,139
activity of the immune therapy this is

335
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:21,539
beautiful but if you look there are

336
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,299
other papers that showing

337
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,578
that if you again clinical trials that

338
00:14:24,299 --> 00:14:30,059
if you give cannabis together with

339
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:32,819
immunotherapy it's reduce the activity

340
00:14:30,059 --> 00:14:34,859
of the immunotherapy my problem with

341
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:37,820
this publication that the same idiot

342
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,820
published all of them

343
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,120
okay

344
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,698
if you

345
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,799
if you sitting far of course I wouldn't

346
00:14:44,698 --> 00:14:48,799
say idiot if it wasn't me okay

347
00:14:49,019 --> 00:14:53,940
we did four clinical trials

348
00:14:51,778 --> 00:14:56,519
with different results but this is fit

349
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,779
to what I believe cannabis is not one

350
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:00,179
plant

351
00:14:57,778 --> 00:15:03,120
there is many varieties and part of the

352
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,458
varieties can do something and part of

353
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:09,899
the varieties can do something else

354
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:12,419
so we ask ourselves okay let's build a a

355
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:15,179
model for that okay let's take mice

356
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:18,599
normal mice and let's take mice without

357
00:15:15,179 --> 00:15:20,939
immune system every scientists know that

358
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,980
we are using mice with no immune system

359
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,980
we call them nude mice because they

360
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,899
don't have a hair at all okay

361
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,820
so we're taking normal mice and nude

362
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:33,120
mice and we're treating them we can we

363
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,980
create them tumors in these mice and

364
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,078
we're treating the normal mice with

365
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:40,019
cannabis and we're looking for strain

366
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:42,359
that reducing the size of the tumor

367
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:45,899
the same one that succeeded here with

368
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,019
treating with mice with no immune system

369
00:15:45,899 --> 00:15:51,419
and now we want to see which extract

370
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:54,740
reduce the sign in normal mice but don't

371
00:15:51,419 --> 00:15:57,240
affecting the size of this tumor

372
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:59,759
without immune system

373
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:02,339
and that will tell us that it happened

374
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:05,819
through the immune system we succeed to

375
00:16:02,339 --> 00:16:07,740
isolate specific extract we learn the

376
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,899
mechanism of action what is doing we

377
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:12,060
succeed to isolate specific molecules

378
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,120
that doing this effect we Define that

379
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:18,179
it's reducing secretion for for the

380
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,399
cancer cell of specific cytokines I

381
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,919
don't I don't want to go deeper to the

382
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,879
result but we saw that these molecules

383
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:29,698
affecting the immune activity of the

384
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,980
cells we Target and we mimic it what we

385
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,379
did with this full excerpt and we see

386
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,220
that the single molecule doing the same

387
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:40,559
effect as the whole extract

388
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,300
then we we know that what the cancer

389
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,159
cell and I explained that few minutes

390
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:46,258
ago what the cancer cell doing is doing

391
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,198
two things first of all he presenting

392
00:16:46,259 --> 00:16:52,740
potent cell himself this is me don't

393
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:55,740
attack me second he produce specific

394
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:57,860
protein that affecting the immune cells

395
00:16:55,740 --> 00:17:01,500
to be weaker actually this spotting

396
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:04,980
breaking down a amino acid that is

397
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,919
essential for the T cells to attack him

398
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,338
we have very good treatments today what

399
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,780
we call the immunotherapy is it blocking

400
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:15,359
ntpdl1 controller whatever you call them

401
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:18,838
that blocking the ability of the cell to

402
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:22,139
say I'm self on this one what we find

403
00:17:18,838 --> 00:17:24,899
out that the Cannabis blocking this part

404
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,000
so now if you're giving cannabis

405
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:30,600
specific cannabis with this specific

406
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,140
molecule together with immunotherapy

407
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:36,058
you get a way better action that the

408
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:37,440
immunotherapy alone on the Cannabis

409
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:39,599
alone

410
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:42,058
but what is the message here

411
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,219
we need to know

412
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,440
it's not enough to say to a cancer

413
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,640
patient that getting immunotherapy take

414
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:50,160
cannabis

415
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:53,580
which type of cannabis what molecules

416
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,580
what is the effect it can be on that

417
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:59,699
side or it can be on that side

418
00:17:56,579 --> 00:18:02,099
cannabis is a complicated plant

419
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,880
but all the plants are complicated

420
00:18:02,099 --> 00:18:08,279
okay I used to say in one of my my talk

421
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,440
previous like seven years ago cannabis

422
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:13,259
is not like a tobacco that have nicotine

423
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:15,960
there is a lot of molecules then I met a

424
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:18,058
guy from Philip Morris that tell me oh

425
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,340
you know cannabis is a simple tobacco

426
00:18:18,058 --> 00:18:22,440
there is more than 1 500 active

427
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:23,519
compounds so stop saying that anymore

428
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
okay

429
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:27,660
all the plants are complicated when

430
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,538
we're going to the grocery store and buy

431
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:32,640
apples we know that the green man called

432
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:35,220
Smith they are very sour the red one

433
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,559
called Macintosh they are sweeter and so

434
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:38,900
on and so on we know that apples are

435
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:42,058
different

436
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,500
Israelis have something very unique to

437
00:18:42,058 --> 00:18:46,440
us we have

438
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:49,140
superpower when we knock on watermelon

439
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,360
we know if it's sweet or no okay every

440
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:53,700
Israeli when you're buying a watermelon

441
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:56,159
if you if you travel in Israel you see

442
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,620
this phenomena I'm serious we're

443
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,298
knocking on the watermelon to know if

444
00:18:58,619 --> 00:19:04,199
it's sweet or not right I have like

445
00:19:00,298 --> 00:19:06,538
three Israelis here that can approve me

446
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:08,700
so every Israeli know that every

447
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:11,759
watermelon is different

448
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,679
but when we're going to herbal medicine

449
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:17,579
we flatten that it doesn't matter if

450
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,580
it's cannabis it's whatever

451
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:22,500
good for the immune system what do you

452
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,178
mean

453
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:26,759
Ginkgo good for that what do you mean

454
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,740
like all of them the same doesn't matter

455
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:32,339
where it's growing we have the same

456
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,160
molecules because it's the same story

457
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:37,619
as cannabis when we're talking about the

458
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,980
today on cytosobic mushroom magic

459
00:19:37,619 --> 00:19:42,899
mushrooms all of them are the same there

460
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:45,480
are more than 20 families hundreds of

461
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:48,120
species many active compounds called

462
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:50,160
tryptamine the same story

463
00:19:48,119 --> 00:19:54,979
and this leading me

464
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,980
to what we called the Entourage effect

465
00:19:55,220 --> 00:20:01,380
is mainly saying in cannabis or other

466
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,419
plants you know there are many compounds

467
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,360
they're doing something complicated

468
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:09,059
but I think in cannabis it's Unique

469
00:20:06,359 --> 00:20:11,159
there are three layers of the Enterprise

470
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:14,879
effect so first of all let's start what

471
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:17,160
is the Entourage effect Ravi mishulam

472
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,919
and and Professor Ben Shabbat published

473
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:23,580
in 1998 a paper

474
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,580
I'm not sure if you rather or not no so

475
00:20:23,579 --> 00:20:27,538
published a paper called an Entourage

476
00:20:26,579 --> 00:20:30,000
effect

477
00:20:27,538 --> 00:20:31,619
after these three words try to read it

478
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,740
it will be difficult to all of you okay

479
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:38,038
inactive endogenous fantasy glycerol

480
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,960
ester enhanced to a hedonic glycerol

481
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:41,940
cannabinoid activity

482
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,000
none of you remember that you remember

483
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:47,900
the Entourage effect actually it wasn't

484
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,419
about cannabis it was about

485
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:54,960
endocannabinoids and it showed the two

486
00:20:50,419 --> 00:20:58,980
endocannabis two linole glycino two

487
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:01,319
parliamentary glycine which not binding

488
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,740
CB1 enhancing

489
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:06,599
other endocrine beans to AG to bind The

490
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,359
receptors it called it the Entourage

491
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:12,240
effect it wasn't about cannabis I think

492
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:14,479
it turned even the one that that took it

493
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,480
no

494
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:22,199
okay so so Ethan here saying that the

495
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:23,819
next year they send another paper that

496
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,240
saying that it's also applying for the

497
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:29,759
plan but the first one was this one okay

498
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:32,940
so what is the Entourage effect

499
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:35,460
so first of all I showed you

500
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,220
for examples in the leukemia that you

501
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,558
need three molecules what the meaning of

502
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:43,140
this three molecule when three molecules

503
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,480
activate on the same

504
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,000
cell different receptors we actually

505
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,679
call it polypham ecology it's when

506
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,140
you're treating a disease by modulation

507
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,000
more than one target you have

508
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:57,240
activity which is more complicated I

509
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,980
showed that in the leukemia example how

510
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,980
three molecules binding different

511
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,558
receptors opening calcium channels I

512
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:06,659
didn't show the mechanism of action but

513
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:07,619
they're doing something synergistic in

514
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,960
the plant

515
00:22:07,619 --> 00:22:11,279
in in the cell but they are affecting

516
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,759
the same plane

517
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:17,639
the same cell and if you think about it

518
00:22:14,759 --> 00:22:18,900
plant are harboring poly pharmacology

519
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,840
Within

520
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:24,600
because if you think about a physician

521
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,000
10 000 years ago five thousand years ago

522
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,099
if you come with a kind of inflammation

523
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,200
you will take a route from your flown

524
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,759
from here

525
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:36,019
you know a stem from here combine them

526
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:37,679
together and kind of creating

527
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:40,019
polyphammacology

528
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:42,480
and and I think poly pharmacology will

529
00:22:40,019 --> 00:22:45,480
go and be bigger and bigger

530
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,279
in in treatment and also I think the FDA

531
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:49,980
will start to approve more and more this

532
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:52,678
is my opinion because we're changing in

533
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,319
the last 20 years our analytical ability

534
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:58,640
to analyze these molecules but more than

535
00:22:55,319 --> 00:23:01,678
that to use computers to understand

536
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,780
networking and Pathways so if you look

537
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,360
about Network or three molecules five

538
00:23:03,779 --> 00:23:07,980
molecules if in the past it was

539
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:10,558
complicated to understand that today

540
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,140
with computer analysis it's going to

541
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:15,418
understand and to see what is the drug

542
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:18,960
drug interaction and modeling and things

543
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,759
that will open that gate but this is for

544
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,400
me the first layer of the Entourage

545
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:25,200
effect few molecules that affecting one

546
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,320
cell

547
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,940
second layer of the Entourage effect is

548
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:33,480
that we have molecules that affecting

549
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:36,419
different cells so I will take for

550
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,240
example IBD inflammatory bowel disease

551
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:42,120
and flamboyant ball disease consists

552
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,140
mainly two types of cells it's the colon

553
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:44,399
cells

554
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:47,400
that being

555
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,759
sometimes somehow harm

556
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,559
mainly probably well bacteria or micro

557
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:55,379
environment whatever but they have been

558
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,500
harmed they secreting specific molecules

559
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:00,960
so-called cytokines calling other types

560
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:03,119
of cell the immune cells to come

561
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,819
and to help them but actually we

562
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:08,759
creating chronic inflammation

563
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:12,538
that cause this disease okay but it's

564
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:15,240
two types of cells to system the colon

565
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,339
cells and the immune cells so in two

566
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,919
different studies two different PhD

567
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,779
students in my lab one of them work on

568
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,780
the common sense and define specific

569
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:27,298
combination of cannabinoids actually two

570
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:30,720
that reduce the ability of the colon

571
00:24:27,298 --> 00:24:32,400
cells to secrete these cytokines to call

572
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,179
the immune cells

573
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:39,360
but in the same extract different

574
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:41,159
student different PhD work work on the

575
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,119
immune cells and show the different

576
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,400
molecules from the same extract actually

577
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:50,639
blocking the ability of the immune cells

578
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:53,700
to migrate towards the colon different

579
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,179
compound different results okay the

580
00:24:53,700 --> 00:25:00,298
first one if if people are here our

581
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:04,019
physician or defenseman reducing

582
00:25:00,298 --> 00:25:06,599
specific protein called stat 3 which is

583
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:09,500
creating the inflammation or the the

584
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:12,538
release of cytokines the second one

585
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:15,119
reducing protein called cxco4 which

586
00:25:12,538 --> 00:25:17,038
actually it's kind of the antenna the

587
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:20,418
this the colon cells secreting the

588
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:23,519
molecules the twitching the the the

589
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:25,860
immune cells binding them and then

590
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:29,158
binding a specific more important called

591
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:31,439
cxcfo which feel now where it's bind if

592
00:25:29,159 --> 00:25:33,120
it's bind here here and here and started

593
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,240
to migrate towards

594
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:39,259
so the Cannabis from one hand

595
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,819
one molecule from this extract reducing

596
00:25:39,259 --> 00:25:44,819
the colon cells to secrete these

597
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:47,099
molecules different molecules blocking

598
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:49,220
the ability of them the cells to feel it

599
00:25:47,099 --> 00:25:50,939
and to migrate and you're getting

600
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:52,919
Entourage effect you're getting

601
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,798
synergies and you're getting powerful

602
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:57,900
reaction that if you take just with

603
00:25:55,798 --> 00:25:59,460
molecules that affecting the colony just

604
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,798
these molecules affecting the immune

605
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:04,860
system you won't get it

606
00:26:01,798 --> 00:26:06,900
and this is a different layer more

607
00:26:04,859 --> 00:26:08,339
complicated for me for the FDA or

608
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:10,919
something like that it will be two

609
00:26:08,339 --> 00:26:13,079
treatment that we need to combine or we

610
00:26:10,919 --> 00:26:15,778
need to use the plane but this is a

611
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:17,879
different layer of the Entourage effect

612
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:21,900
the third layer of the Entourage effect

613
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,919
on third Entourage it's when we are not

614
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:28,740
talking about single indication but we

615
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:30,240
are talking about the quality of life of

616
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:31,679
the patient we're talking about the

617
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,620
whole patient

618
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:38,038
so if we take pain patient we did the

619
00:26:34,619 --> 00:26:40,199
clinical trial 3800 pay patient and we

620
00:26:38,038 --> 00:26:42,839
measure many parameters of the patient

621
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:45,179
even though the patient 50 of the

622
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:48,000
patients said the Cannabis is really

623
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:51,480
help them change their life did a lot

624
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,359
when we measured the pain we saw that it

625
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,599
didn't reduce much of the pain less than

626
00:26:54,359 --> 00:27:00,778
30 percent reduced to point in the the

627
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:03,178
in the pain of the patients but when you

628
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:05,940
started to to check why this patient

629
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,980
they said that it really helped them we

630
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:11,038
saw that it's really also reducing

631
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:14,159
anxiety reduce depression improve sleep

632
00:27:11,038 --> 00:27:16,919
improve appetite and when you measure

633
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,919
quality of life action what we call

634
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:23,820
catastrophism how the patient conceived

635
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,799
his is disease then we saw a huge

636
00:27:23,819 --> 00:27:27,839
Improvement actually the Cannabis

637
00:27:25,798 --> 00:27:30,778
improved the quality of life of the

638
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,158
patient but if you think about that few

639
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,798
molecules

640
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:37,679
affect the pain few molecules affect

641
00:27:34,798 --> 00:27:40,619
appetite few molecules affect anxiety a

642
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,759
few molecules affect sleep and all

643
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:45,119
together

644
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:46,859
the patient improves its quality of life

645
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:50,639
and this is cannabis because it's

646
00:27:46,859 --> 00:27:53,158
affecting so many systems

647
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,259
in all of them is doing moderate to

648
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:57,120
action a little bit on the pain a little

649
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:59,819
bit on the sleep a little bit on the

650
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,099
appetite you're getting something as a

651
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:04,500
whole treatment which is better and you

652
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:06,959
wouldn't get it from single molecules

653
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:09,359
single treatment you need to give peel

654
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,700
for Sleep peel for pain pill for

655
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:14,819
appetite and so on cannabis give

656
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:16,080
something more holistic so if we think

657
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,839
about it

658
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:20,278
cannabis is kind of an orchestra of

659
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:23,399
molecules

660
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:25,619
that working on a system called the

661
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:28,679
endocannabinoid system

662
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:30,239
mimicking things in our body we can

663
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:34,080
narrow it down

664
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:35,220
so I I didn't prepare my talk until two

665
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,558
hours ago

666
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,759
and I prepared because things that I

667
00:28:37,558 --> 00:28:42,240
heard

668
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,519
during this conference there are kind of

669
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,099
division here people that coming from

670
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:49,798
Pharma and looking for let's take single

671
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:52,019
molecules or they and and purify then go

672
00:28:49,798 --> 00:28:53,940
with that and people that believe more

673
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:55,319
in the plant and looking about the

674
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,900
Entourage effect

675
00:28:55,319 --> 00:29:00,298
but actually what I'm trying to show

676
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:02,700
that nobody is wrong here

677
00:29:00,298 --> 00:29:04,440
in few indication if you're looking very

678
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,759
specific you want to treat something

679
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,940
very specific

680
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:10,798
you can isolate a molecule and go farmer

681
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,120
out and there is indication that it

682
00:29:10,798 --> 00:29:14,759
might work

683
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:17,099
if you want to be more complicated more

684
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,859
risky on the business side you can say

685
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:21,719
okay I will take these two molecules

686
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:24,058
that affecting the the colon these two

687
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:27,058
molecules that affecting the immune

688
00:29:24,058 --> 00:29:32,240
cells that will try to combine them to

689
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:34,918
botanic treatment or to be very very a

690
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:38,460
brave and to try to go with this to the

691
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:42,000
FDA congratulations to you okay

692
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,360
but it's still I believe in that okay

693
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,519
and the third one is to say when you

694
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:50,099
want to treat quality of life of the

695
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,898
patient which is the most it's the

696
00:29:50,099 --> 00:29:55,319
majority of our patient

697
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:59,519
you can't run away from the plane you

698
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:02,038
want one you might want a consistently a

699
00:29:59,519 --> 00:30:04,558
product something safe something that

700
00:30:02,038 --> 00:30:07,079
you know what you get but you won't get

701
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:08,700
away from the plan because it's too

702
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,579
complicated and it's doing too many

703
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:13,798
things I think the future

704
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:16,980
will consist

705
00:30:13,798 --> 00:30:21,179
part of these things I think we will see

706
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:23,460
more and more drugs FDA approved single

707
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:25,740
molecules you know three three one five

708
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:28,940
that Daddy write a patent and somebody

709
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:32,460
license it and go with it to reduce a

710
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:33,240
estrogen okay we will see drugs like

711
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,980
that

712
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,460
we will see

713
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:40,200
the whole plant is the medicines for

714
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,778
many years I don't think we can run away

715
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,899
from that it's already there countries

716
00:30:42,778 --> 00:30:48,659
like Israel 150 000

717
00:30:45,898 --> 00:30:50,339
prescription in months for patient one

718
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:52,620
of the most prescribed medicine in

719
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:55,678
Israel but this is the whole plan

720
00:30:52,619 --> 00:31:00,678
and I do believe that we will see a new

721
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:04,980
route A New Path of more complicate

722
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:08,038
drugs that trying to affect not one

723
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:11,220
mechanism not one system but more of

724
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:12,778
them and I think it's you know you need

725
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:15,058
to break a wall you need to be

726
00:31:12,778 --> 00:31:18,380
Innovative you need to do that but I do

727
00:31:15,058 --> 00:31:21,418
believe that there are diseases like ALS

728
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:25,020
Alzheimer's types of cancer that we hit

729
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:27,960
our head to the wall many years and

730
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:31,259
don't succeed to solve them with a

731
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,899
simplified activity and when we will

732
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:37,700
understand the complexity and we try to

733
00:31:33,898 --> 00:31:41,219
do complicated things we might

734
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:44,340
bring a cure to these ones by that I

735
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:46,980
want to say thanks a lot to the amazing

736
00:31:44,339 --> 00:31:49,079
team that working we shrinked that was

737
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,659
before the corona we shrinked a lot from

738
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:53,519
them but these are my students and my

739
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:56,840
work workers are doing the amazing work

740
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,839
that I showed thank you very much

741
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,740
thank you very much Daddy for this

742
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:10,879
wonderful presentation but I have to say

743
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:15,538
that you left me a little bit confused

744
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:18,960
what what do you think what what does

745
00:32:15,538 --> 00:32:22,259
the future hold for cannabis do you see

746
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,579
cannabis being developed to do it from

747
00:32:22,259 --> 00:32:29,220
it to be a pharmaceutical drug or rather

748
00:32:25,579 --> 00:32:33,720
it might just uh or not just but it

749
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:36,778
might stay as a herbal a herbal extract

750
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,298
or product what do you think

751
00:32:36,778 --> 00:32:41,278
so I think it's it's depends of the

752
00:32:39,298 --> 00:32:43,558
indication in my opinion and my father

753
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,380
taught me that if I'm arguing with

754
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:48,778
somebody I'm 50 wrong okay

755
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:50,940
actually we'll say in if you argue with

756
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:54,240
your mother it's 100 wrong so don't

757
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:57,120
argue that was his what he used to say

758
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,099
so it's my opinion and and just my

759
00:32:57,119 --> 00:33:00,479
opinion I believe that in specific

760
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:04,439
indication

761
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:07,620
and mainly save lives indication it will

762
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,860
be more precise more Farm around these

763
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:13,079
molecules for leukemia or whatever I

764
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:15,898
think in in indication which is more

765
00:33:13,079 --> 00:33:18,960
related to Quality of Life much more

766
00:33:15,898 --> 00:33:21,239
wide will stay with the with the plant

767
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,440
for two reasons first of all it's a

768
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:26,519
cheap medicine

769
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:29,038
and and there is a there is a reason uh

770
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:32,339
why you know in the global world I just

771
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:35,700
came from India yesterday I actually fly

772
00:33:32,339 --> 00:33:39,298
from India here I learned that Miami is

773
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:42,240
not on the way from India right or

774
00:33:39,298 --> 00:33:43,619
Israel it's actually between

775
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,538
um

776
00:33:43,619 --> 00:33:47,579
there are countries like India that

777
00:33:45,538 --> 00:33:49,798
cheap medicine is extremely important

778
00:33:47,579 --> 00:33:52,619
and think there is cannabis is a cheap

779
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:55,519
medicine and it stay like that and I

780
00:33:52,619 --> 00:33:58,859
think in the complicated thing in the uh

781
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,659
you know quality of life things that

782
00:33:58,859 --> 00:34:02,939
you're treating many it will stay with

783
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:06,480
the plant I think we need to precise it

784
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:08,820
I need to to know which extract which

785
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,280
plane to use to what but I think it will

786
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,780
stay with the plant

787
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,859
thank you thank you I would just like to

788
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,580
to comment that if it might there might

789
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:26,179
be some difficulties in this approach

790
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:29,299
since once you define the certain

791
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:33,418
substance certain molecule is a drug

792
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:38,220
then it comes to be under regulation

793
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:42,118
which might not support public use for

794
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:44,158
different purposes so just you know so

795
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:46,679
so again you know the Cannabis is very

796
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:49,500
unique because there is regulation each

797
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:51,300
country looks in a different way but I I

798
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,418
just came from India that they have

799
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,660
regulations for plants they have

800
00:34:54,418 --> 00:35:00,539
plants is a medicine okay I forgot how

801
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:03,059
they call it every day or Avida you know

802
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:04,259
isn't

803
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,858
I

804
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:09,540
Veda okay it's specific regulation for

805
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:12,539
plant which we don't have

806
00:35:09,539 --> 00:35:14,579
in the you know in the state or or in in

807
00:35:12,539 --> 00:35:16,679
Israel so it's very depend on the

808
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:18,599
regulation I agree with you there is

809
00:35:16,679 --> 00:35:20,098
problems

810
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,740
one

811
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:25,260
Daddy thank you that overview is so

812
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:27,059
important a question about the so-called

813
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:29,880
minor cannabinoids that you've been

814
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:31,559
testing are they much more potent than

815
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,680
the major cannabinoids you need to

816
00:35:31,559 --> 00:35:36,239
amplify their concentration or dose that

817
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:38,460
you're giving in these models or do you

818
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,199
give them in relatively tiny doses like

819
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,400
they occur in the plant

820
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:47,219
so it's the answer is specific for each

821
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,440
minor cannabinoids that we Define okay

822
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:51,959
there are minor cannabinoids that we

823
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:55,920
found which are extremely potent and

824
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:58,380
more like 3318 in in the leukemia is

825
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:00,960
very similar to CBD when you increase

826
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,358
its amount it's more potent to this from

827
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,760
the CBD so even if you tried it on

828
00:36:03,358 --> 00:36:09,900
epilepsy it's working even better than

829
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,720
the CBD okay and very similar action to

830
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:15,539
the CBD but something else there there

831
00:36:12,719 --> 00:36:18,118
are other Fido cannabinoids that I I

832
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,579
think their potency is lower but they

833
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:22,200
are potent like the minor can you know

834
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:24,119
there are many minor cannabinoids the

835
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,399
minor cannabinoids that we found that

836
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,900
active they were very potent the other

837
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,500
one that I showed there were estrogen

838
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:35,099
because you have three

839
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:38,659
oxygens on on the outside its viable

840
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,640
ability is way higher than the regular

841
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:44,399
phytocannabin then that might be wise

842
00:36:41,639 --> 00:36:47,940
more potent I don't know the result but

843
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,639
yeah they are potent thank you

844
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,260
Bonnie hi Daddy uh thank you for a great

845
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:54,838
lecture as usual

846
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,000
um I have a question going back to the

847
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,480
slide where you showed the cancer cell

848
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:03,239
having two actions one saying I'm self

849
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,900
don't kill me and that you're saying

850
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:09,899
that that's the when the anti uh pd1

851
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,460
comes in that is not is is this new

852
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:13,858
information that you're sharing that

853
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:16,619
with you said a new paper

854
00:37:13,858 --> 00:37:18,960
um that's not where cannabis is causing

855
00:37:16,619 --> 00:37:20,579
an issue it's causing an issue more on

856
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,980
the immune system

857
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,359
in the micro environment yeah the

858
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:30,719
Cannabis is what we found okay the

859
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:33,299
Cannabis these cannabinoid is affecting

860
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:35,219
the cancer cell first of all is reducing

861
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:38,300
the secretion of specific cytokines

862
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:42,358
called csf1 and csf1

863
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:44,519
changing the the cancer cell secrecy is

864
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:46,980
a fund to change the profile of the

865
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:50,960
macrophages arriving the micro

866
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:55,280
environment M2 instead of M1 so actually

867
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:58,199
there are macrophages that coming and

868
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,780
deactivating the T cells changing the

869
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:02,338
profile of that changing the activity of

870
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:05,220
the T cell that one thing the second

871
00:38:02,338 --> 00:38:08,338
it's reducing the the activity of two

872
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:11,578
enzymes ionos and arginas which break

873
00:38:08,338 --> 00:38:14,279
down Arginine which that the way to do

874
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:16,200
what we call immunosuppressive blocking

875
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,480
that blocking the ability of the cancer

876
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,379
cell to immunosuppress the T cells

877
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:21,780
activity

878
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,400
and and so so if we take two months and

879
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:26,400
we did that you take tumors from

880
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,980
patients you grow them in a plate you

881
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,960
treat them with the Cannabis okay and

882
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:33,780
then you taking the supernatant like

883
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,420
they're like you know the what they

884
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:38,519
secreted and put on T cells you see that

885
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:40,200
if you're not doing that it's inhibiting

886
00:38:38,519 --> 00:38:42,659
the T cells activity but if you treat

887
00:38:40,199 --> 00:38:44,539
with cannabis it's one to inhibit the T

888
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,980
cell activity this is like classic

889
00:38:44,539 --> 00:38:49,139
method to test it

890
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:51,300
okay so I have a follow-up question and

891
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:54,659
it's okay if you don't want to answer me

892
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:56,579
just today I got a text message from the

893
00:38:54,659 --> 00:38:57,838
mother of a boy I've already emailed you

894
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:00,320
about once I don't know if you remember

895
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:02,578
as a 10 year old with metastatic

896
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:04,380
osteosarcoma his second cancer is

897
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:07,940
treated for leukemia as a young child

898
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,940
and has a subsequent secondary cancer

899
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:14,338
he was on cannabis in chemotherapy

900
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:15,960
his Physicians decided to switch him to

901
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:18,719
novoma lab

902
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,760
and I discontinued the Cannabis and she

903
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:23,338
texted me today to say is there any way

904
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:25,260
we can add it back he has the most

905
00:39:23,338 --> 00:39:28,199
horrific side effects

906
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:30,000
and so I wrote back I don't know if

907
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,539
there's anything safe but I'll see Dr

908
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,519
Mary and ask him so I I know I'm putting

909
00:39:33,539 --> 00:39:37,679
you on the spot to translate to a cancer

910
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:39,539
patient so it's always difficult for me

911
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:42,358
to answer that the clinical trial that

912
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:45,599
we showed that was reduced the activity

913
00:39:42,358 --> 00:39:48,659
of the immune or the immunotherapy was

914
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:52,079
on Death Drive specific drug and we saw

915
00:39:48,659 --> 00:39:56,338
that in general the success rate reduced

916
00:39:52,079 --> 00:40:00,599
from 40 few percent to 25 so it's really

917
00:39:56,338 --> 00:40:03,539
affecting that but this was high T8 high

918
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,820
THC strained Classic this trend that we

919
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:08,279
used here in this study is high CBG

920
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,760
strain so it's totally different profile

921
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,480
totally different than

922
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,380
I

923
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,960
you know I in Israel I'm working with

924
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,320
the uncle all the head of the oncology

925
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:25,260
department in in the main hospitals and

926
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:27,539
and we had a panel of the old the head

927
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:31,800
of the oncologist and and me about that

928
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:35,699
and the answer was you know there is

929
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,140
risk you know we won't take it so in in

930
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,879
the in the frame that they gave

931
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:40,139
immunotherapy that's stopping the

932
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,940
cannabis

933
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:44,279
I do think

934
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,079
according to our results that the high

935
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,420
CBG strength today that are available

936
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,180
outside

937
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:55,559
are safe enough and I don't see this

938
00:40:51,179 --> 00:40:58,858
reaction from the patient and from the

939
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:01,320
the pre-clinicals that we get we get but

940
00:40:58,858 --> 00:41:03,900
I'm not sure that these strains are

941
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:06,720
effective on the side effects so I don't

942
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:10,380
know if the high CBG strain are really

943
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,539
reducing nausea or pain or that I don't

944
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,900
know the effect on the side effects so

945
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:18,420
it's it's complicated

946
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:21,599
but but in there is risk to to give

947
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:23,760
cannabis with immunotherapy if it's just

948
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:26,160
just cannabis

949
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,760
again it depends on the cannabinoids so

950
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:31,618
right and that's and that's a nice

951
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:33,540
helpful answer because if they're if

952
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:35,160
he's terribly desperate and he's not

953
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:37,739
finding any relief I would probably feel

954
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:40,078
a little more comfortable we can try CBG

955
00:41:37,739 --> 00:41:41,819
so so again the the cannabinoids that

956
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,220
they showed in the immunotherapy work

957
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,280
was CBG it's not the minor kind of

958
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:49,739
business I I don't called my CBG minor

959
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,540
so okay thank you very much just a

960
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:53,338
comment Barney it's it's such a tough

961
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:55,559
question but then you have to weigh the

962
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:57,539
other side is that can this kid complete

963
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:59,219
the course of therapy without the help

964
00:41:57,539 --> 00:42:02,779
of cannabis or are they going to have to

965
00:41:59,219 --> 00:42:02,779
throw in the tell on immunotherapy

966
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:07,139
thank you sir I I just wanted to comment

967
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:10,858
on on a couple things from your previous

968
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:12,659
slide regarding the approach moving

969
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:16,639
forward as far as investigating this

970
00:42:12,659 --> 00:42:20,460
further uh groupers versus Splitters

971
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:22,679
those that tend to want to treat it

972
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:26,519
holistically versus those that want to

973
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:29,159
pinpoint specific parts of the plant uh

974
00:42:26,519 --> 00:42:31,980
I wonder if there's a middle ground uh

975
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:33,659
regarding this and considering that

976
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:37,440
there are different strains just like

977
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:40,078
your Apple slide could it not be more a

978
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,240
way of approaching it in understanding

979
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:46,140
that our categories neuromuscular

980
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:49,500
neurological GI pain inflammation as

981
00:42:46,139 --> 00:42:52,618
specific areas to address rather than

982
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,440
getting specific conditions or illnesses

983
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,200
rather grouping them in in certain

984
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,679
generalities that we can pinpoint and

985
00:42:58,199 --> 00:43:04,078
direct treatment plans for patients do

986
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:05,818
you feel that rather than again

987
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,460
segregating the plan and cutting it up

988
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:11,279
in smaller pieces why not just develop

989
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,059
certain specific medical strains towards

990
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,900
that grouping and see and investigate

991
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:20,699
that very question of Entourage and how

992
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,920
mental health affects all that and how

993
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:25,078
the mental health if improved can

994
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:28,740
improve the physical condition

995
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,318
so I will answer that in two ways first

996
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:33,659
of all it's you know some that the truth

997
00:43:31,318 --> 00:43:35,400
is not the nice there I'm a cell

998
00:43:33,659 --> 00:43:37,618
biologist that's what I'm doing so I'm

999
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,858
interested in what the molecule doing in

1000
00:43:37,619 --> 00:43:44,818
the cell in the end that's why okay I'm

1001
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:47,279
not the Cannabis you know

1002
00:43:44,818 --> 00:43:50,338
regulator or something like that but to

1003
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,619
answer that the technology is there like

1004
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,779
we can analyze the compounds we can say

1005
00:43:52,619 --> 00:43:56,818
this is the profile this is the groups

1006
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:58,140
that doing for that and that the

1007
00:43:56,818 --> 00:44:00,239
technology are for there but the

1008
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:03,900
knowledge is not for there not there yet

1009
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:06,838
so we don't have the knowledge to say in

1010
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:09,539
in all the indication not even in minor

1011
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,099
indications to say this is the profile

1012
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:12,779
that you need for that so this is the

1013
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:14,880
prophet and uh to group that we just

1014
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:17,160
don't have the knowledge yet so you know

1015
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,880
I showed few things that we have results

1016
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:22,739
but in most of the things we don't know

1017
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,980
and you know I'm responsible for for

1018
00:44:22,739 --> 00:44:29,039
courses in Israel for physician or for

1019
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,960
nurses and and for and and people said

1020
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:33,300
yeah education is very important we need

1021
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:34,740
to teach them what I know to teach them

1022
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:36,599
I don't know what to teach them but I'm

1023
00:44:34,739 --> 00:44:39,000
I'm showing the Entourage that I think

1024
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:40,740
the endocannabinoid system there but I

1025
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,960
don't know to tell them what to

1026
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:44,759
prescribe which one is really good for

1027
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,659
that or for that I'm starting to have a

1028
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,359
knowledge

1029
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:51,679
so we don't have this profile a day the

1030
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:55,199
technology is there I must say that

1031
00:44:51,679 --> 00:44:57,239
very few scientists in the world I'm not

1032
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:59,818
talking about companies out there I'm

1033
00:44:57,239 --> 00:45:02,098
talking about even scientists taking the

1034
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:03,599
approach to really go deep and to look

1035
00:45:02,099 --> 00:45:05,780
on the minor cannabinoids and the

1036
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,960
combination you know and I need to

1037
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,060
sitting here and and other a a

1038
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:14,099
scientists doing that but these are I

1039
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:16,078
can count them on one hand so we don't

1040
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,240
have this that we just don't have this

1041
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:21,000
data okay

1042
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:24,799
um and that's reality we don't have the

1043
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:24,800
data to to push it there

1044
00:45:26,818 --> 00:45:30,980
thank you very much and have a good
