1
00:00:05,599 --> 00:00:11,259
they just introduced myself and why I

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:13,820
wanted to discuss this autism epilepsy

3
00:00:11,259 --> 00:00:16,698
combination I'm a pediatric neurologist

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:19,160
I'm an epileptologist that's how I came

5
00:00:16,699 --> 00:00:21,199
into this field of cannabis because it's

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:23,179
almost inescapable if your child

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,670
neurologist especially if you really

8
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:28,160
focus on epilepsy but as dr. Goldstein

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:31,190
too mentioned we were seeing now this

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,320
growing interest in autism and that's

11
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:34,730
it's been growing for some time but it's

12
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,908
almost like Groundhog Day what I

13
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:40,518
experienced going through epilepsy

14
00:00:37,908 --> 00:00:42,399
treatment is now I'm seeing the same

15
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:45,049
thing develop in my patients with autism

16
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,689
meaning that the moms are coming very

17
00:00:45,049 --> 00:00:49,849
motivated very interested in getting off

18
00:00:47,689 --> 00:00:52,670
a lot of the medications that have led

19
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,859
to extreme side effects for many of the

20
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,929
kids that we see and when you think of

21
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:58,999
the different things that we're talking

22
00:00:56,929 --> 00:01:02,030
about here all the various conditions

23
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:04,010
the two big systems that are being

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:07,070
highlighted here are brain and the

25
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:09,350
immune system both are systems that

26
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:11,898
evolve over a life cycle so they're very

27
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:13,669
complex in that sense and there's huge

28
00:01:11,899 --> 00:01:16,939
individual variation within both of

29
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,728
those two systems and so any any

30
00:01:16,938 --> 00:01:24,169
neurologist is gonna have to become

31
00:01:19,728 --> 00:01:25,908
adept at this at this area the I think a

32
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,140
lot of I'll move through these slides

33
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:28,728
pretty quickly because I think this is

34
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,489
pretty well known by now but the latest

35
00:01:28,728 --> 00:01:33,049
rates from the CDC are that autism is

36
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:36,169
something that we've seen about one in

37
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:38,090
59 children now and if you look at the

38
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,420
trend you know when you go from the year

39
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:45,289
2000 to 2014 you're going from numbers

40
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:46,250
and one and one fifty to one and 59 this

41
00:01:45,289 --> 00:01:48,079
is not going anywhere

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,640
and it's it's a major issue and it's

43
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,169
it's actually at the point of crisis

44
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,460
it's probably beyond the point of crisis

45
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:57,469
what I see every day are the kids

46
00:01:55,459 --> 00:01:59,118
when this epidemic really picked up a

47
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:00,858
lot of those kids are no longer kids

48
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,478
they're now adults and they're entering

49
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:04,548
the world where there's nobody to care

50
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:06,140
for them they don't have there are no

51
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:08,450
internal medicine Doc's to care for them

52
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,788
they don't have living situations they

53
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,909
don't have day programs and the big

54
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:15,349
issues that we're seeing the the one at

55
00:02:13,909 --> 00:02:18,229
the very bottom is probably the most

56
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,189
important the aggression so self-injury

57
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,489
or aggression tour

58
00:02:19,189 --> 00:02:24,229
others has been a major major challenge

59
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:26,600
but we have a host of issues that that

60
00:02:24,229 --> 00:02:29,269
we face so common issues include things

61
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,759
like anxiety epilepsy inflammatory bowel

62
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,420
the pans and pandas world all of these

63
00:02:31,759 --> 00:02:37,399
things are big issues pain is a really

64
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:39,379
underreported concern many of the kids I

65
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,629
see have chronic headache chronic

66
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,219
abdominal pain they're not verbal so

67
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,229
it's hard for them to express that and

68
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:49,189
and that too sometimes comes out through

69
00:02:45,229 --> 00:02:52,060
the aggression but I have to first start

70
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:55,039
by going back to it was around 2008 and

71
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:57,020
it was a mom who brought this whole idea

72
00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,250
to me even before epilepsy really took

73
00:02:57,020 --> 00:03:00,380
off

74
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:01,699
and and I have to always credit moms for

75
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:06,519
coming up with all the really good ideas

76
00:03:01,699 --> 00:03:09,439
and all yeah to the moms out there you

77
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,689
the dads are kind of like somewhere

78
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,810
between a coin flip and a magic 8-ball I

79
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:16,159
would say when but you know yes kamam

80
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:18,830
and they're there on the money and they

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,539
know really what the right direction is

82
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,920
in their gut instinct is is something

83
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:24,979
you always have to follow especially in

84
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:28,039
child neurology and so it was a mom who

85
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:30,649
came to me and Marie Marie Lee is an

86
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:32,810
author who came to me with her son she's

87
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:35,420
written editorials to the Washington

88
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:38,539
Post she wrote a beautiful four-part

89
00:03:35,419 --> 00:03:40,849
series for Slate Magazine online

90
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:43,879
magazine regarding her experience using

91
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:46,519
cannabis and her son and what I want to

92
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:47,900
highlight is that this started I forget

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:51,920
the year the the first one I think it

94
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:53,959
was like 2008 2007 2008 at that time it

95
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,869
was incredibly brave for her to bring

96
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:58,610
this forward she I mean there was real

97
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:01,219
fear that child protective would be at

98
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:02,540
her door taking her son away and you

99
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,759
could imagine how that would play out

100
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:07,579
but we you know thankfully it didn't go

101
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:09,919
that way and actually what occurred is

102
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:13,640
he went from a child who's having over

103
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:15,708
300 aggressive episodes per day his

104
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,569
teachers were wearing Taekwondo arm pads

105
00:04:15,709 --> 00:04:20,030
just to protect themselves I mean it was

106
00:04:17,569 --> 00:04:23,540
that bad too

107
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,189
basically having multiple days day after

108
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,300
day with zero aggressions and he went to

109
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:28,129
a school where they would actually keep

110
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:31,038
a clicker and count all the aggressive

111
00:04:28,129 --> 00:04:32,980
episodes and the way she described it

112
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:34,870
two years in was

113
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:36,280
she you know stated and she was very

114
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:39,189
open about the fact that this is not a

115
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,429
cure but it was a success because now

116
00:04:39,189 --> 00:04:45,459
her son who the the most severe symptoms

117
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:48,340
were alleviated and both her her husband

118
00:04:45,459 --> 00:04:50,259
her son could finally as a family heal

119
00:04:48,339 --> 00:04:51,849
together and and instead of living in a

120
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:54,310
house full of screams and destruction

121
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,400
they could actually be people who are

122
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:58,750
happy as a family unit together it

123
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:00,279
affected the whole family and that's an

124
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:03,490
important thing to think about when you

125
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,769
have a child who's going through this no

126
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:09,220
one in that household is functioning and

127
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:10,870
so it's an important issue and I wanted

128
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,430
to just highlight it today dr. Goldstein

129
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:14,920
mentioned it but this is really an

130
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,139
epidemic right now this is a serious

131
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:19,750
serious concern to the families that I

132
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:21,459
see and and I can't see them all because

133
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,930
of the number of phone calls that we get

134
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:25,989
and the referrals we get we just can't

135
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:27,850
keep up there's been a lot of work to

136
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,420
describe the prevalence of aggression

137
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:33,850
and autism and it's really common so

138
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:35,920
almost seventy percent will have behaved

139
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:39,340
aggressively towards caregivers about

140
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,780
50% towards non caregivers you don't see

141
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,189
it as commonly in kids who have

142
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:44,139
cognitive impairment from other causes

143
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,189
it's actually fairly uncommon and kids

144
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,079
with cognitive impairment from other

145
00:05:45,189 --> 00:05:50,230
causes and the reasons for aggression

146
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:53,740
and autism are very different than other

147
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:56,379
kids one thing that it's worth noting I

148
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:58,840
mean there have been many trials to go

149
00:05:56,379 --> 00:06:00,909
through standard pharmaco therapy for

150
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:03,369
autism and aggression 46 placebo

151
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:04,210
controlled trials of those the only two

152
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,410
fda-approved

153
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:09,009
products for aggression or both

154
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:10,240
antipsychotics so it's not you know I

155
00:06:09,009 --> 00:06:11,889
mean this is what we have to deal with

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,300
so if you kind of play it by the book

157
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:14,500
and you go and your child neurologist

158
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,050
and you go based on what we have

159
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,509
available I could put you on one of two

160
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,100
antipsychotics the problem is one is

161
00:06:19,509 --> 00:06:22,959
they don't work well I'm just speaking

162
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,000
from my own experience second is that

163
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:26,680
they they cause a lot of waking so you

164
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,470
just took and I've had many kids like

165
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:31,180
this I take a kid who weighs 130 pounds

166
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:34,330
who's aggressive I just made them weigh

167
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,569
230 pounds and aggressive and you can

168
00:06:34,329 --> 00:06:38,740
see where that where that leads so it's

169
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:40,449
a serious issue plus you have other

170
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,819
things like movement disorders sedation

171
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:44,529
it's it's not easy I even have some kids

172
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:46,180
the the increased appetite on

173
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,568
antipsychotics can be so severe that

174
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,550
some

175
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:50,580
times that itself is a cause of

176
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,439
aggression the kids are so hungry

177
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:57,098
chronically that the food becomes their

178
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,559
trigger and you can imagine again the

179
00:06:57,098 --> 00:07:02,860
families are dealing with massive social

180
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:04,629
isolation we I just met up with someone

181
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:06,699
I knew in high school who's been living

182
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,369
with this you know she hasn't been to a

183
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:12,550
movie in ten years she hasn't been out

184
00:07:09,369 --> 00:07:14,439
to eat you can't get babysitters I mean

185
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:15,990
it's it's really it's something you feel

186
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:19,659
like you're trapped sometimes and one

187
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,978
one mom mentioned in an article that she

188
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:22,808
describes an unbearable level of

189
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:24,968
exhaustion and almost feeling like she's

190
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:29,050
in jail for life you know so obviously

191
00:07:24,968 --> 00:07:32,050
we need to help these families in my own

192
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:33,249
practice one thing I do note this is

193
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,959
something that's much more common in

194
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:36,249
boys than girls autism itself is more

195
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:38,050
common in boys than girls but the

196
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:40,449
aggression in particular is more common

197
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,619
in boys a lot of these boys were that

198
00:07:40,449 --> 00:07:43,180
had the history where they were

199
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:45,219
developing normally up until about

200
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:47,288
eighteen months and then suddenly had a

201
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:49,478
regression of developmental milestones

202
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:52,688
so it's almost like regression begets

203
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,978
aggression so these are kids who what

204
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:55,778
happens is they almost they go through

205
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:58,688
like a second regression in their lives

206
00:07:55,778 --> 00:08:00,368
they get a little testosterone around 12

207
00:07:58,689 --> 00:08:01,539
to 14 they start to go through

208
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:03,939
adolescence and I don't know if

209
00:08:01,538 --> 00:08:05,498
testosterone is the issue here but we're

210
00:08:03,939 --> 00:08:07,209
on UCLA campus and we could probably

211
00:08:05,499 --> 00:08:09,099
walk by the fraternity row here on a

212
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:10,838
Friday night and I think we probably

213
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:14,079
could see the effect of testosterone on

214
00:08:10,838 --> 00:08:15,848
neurotypical males and so it I don't

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,639
think it's good for my kids who are

216
00:08:15,848 --> 00:08:21,848
non-verbal either but it I think it's a

217
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,559
major factor here because it's always an

218
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:25,569
adolescence when this develops and

219
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:26,769
what's one thing that's interesting and

220
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:29,229
this is where we're gonna go with the

221
00:08:26,769 --> 00:08:31,509
autism seizure combination here is that

222
00:08:29,228 --> 00:08:33,068
in kids who have a history of epilepsy

223
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:35,949
sometimes the aggression kind of

224
00:08:33,068 --> 00:08:37,418
precedes it or builds up to it it's

225
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:39,609
think of them both as sort of a hyper

226
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:41,408
excitable state their brain is hyper

227
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,649
excitable and it builds from aggression

228
00:08:41,408 --> 00:08:46,750
into epilepsy sometimes a lot of these

229
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,309
kids didn't have epilepsy when they were

230
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:50,289
younger they develop epilepsy sometimes

231
00:08:48,309 --> 00:08:53,018
as teenagers

232
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:54,578
of course the causes like in all things

233
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:56,980
are multifactorial here though you have

234
00:08:54,578 --> 00:08:58,558
a combination of anxiety OCD pain

235
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,100
syndromes sensor integration

236
00:08:58,558 --> 00:09:02,110
communication

237
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,579
list goes on so for each kid we have to

238
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:07,690
find out what their individual triggers

239
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:09,278
are and one the reason I want to kind of

240
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,410
bring up this epital epilepsy autism

241
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:14,860
connection is we might in the end be

242
00:09:11,409 --> 00:09:16,719
treating the same thing here so we know

243
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,649
that cannabidiol works very well for

244
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,750
epilepsy we you know I think the what

245
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:24,250
we're looking at in autism may really be

246
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,350
dealing with many the same mechanisms

247
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,899
the rates of epilepsy and kids with

248
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,190
autism are very high and the rates of

249
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:31,328
autism in kids with epilepsy were very

250
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,680
high so I mean these two things go

251
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:35,289
together and don't think of them as

252
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:37,269
comorbid they think of it more like when

253
00:09:35,289 --> 00:09:40,269
you have a cold you know you have

254
00:09:37,269 --> 00:09:42,639
sniffles Koff maybe a fever

255
00:09:40,269 --> 00:09:44,169
those aren't comorbid conditions those

256
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,850
are all caused by the same cold right

257
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:47,289
it's it's all just different symptoms

258
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:50,860
are the same thing and that that's more

259
00:09:47,289 --> 00:09:52,929
what the way I'd like to view this and

260
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:55,899
so when you think of the root causes and

261
00:09:52,929 --> 00:09:57,909
there are many some disorders might

262
00:09:55,899 --> 00:09:59,708
relate to neurotransmitters an example

263
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,379
would be fragile X which involves

264
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:05,469
metabotropic glutamate receptor and

265
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:07,000
glorifies some issues might relate to

266
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:09,069
growth factors an example there will be

267
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,990
the mTOR pathway mTOR is a growth

268
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:13,299
regulation pathway it's also important

269
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:14,379
for certain types of tumors and that

270
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:16,479
would include things like tuber

271
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:17,708
sclerosis or neurofibromatosis these are

272
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,688
these are all these conditions I'm

273
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:20,859
mentioning can cause both autism and

274
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:23,019
epilepsy together from the same

275
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,699
underlying cause you have channel APPA

276
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,509
thiis dravet syndrome being a very

277
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:29,769
common one so that's a sodium channel

278
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:31,870
defect that causes seizures at a very

279
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:34,509
young age and also causes very high

280
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,339
rates of autism and you can have

281
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:38,560
immunologic factors an example there an

282
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:41,259
extreme one would be the NMDA receptor

283
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,078
antibodies where antibodies are binding

284
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:46,568
to these excitatory neurotransmitter

285
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,879
receptors and that in turn can cause a

286
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:51,818
whole host of different issues but in

287
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,838
particular seizures making a little more

288
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:55,269
complicated

289
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,069
spike waves on eg might actually play a

290
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,438
direct role in terms of language

291
00:10:57,068 --> 00:11:02,349
regression or autism features and kids

292
00:10:59,438 --> 00:11:04,870
with epilepsy so there is an important

293
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,480
role here for eg eg z' I mean I'm in

294
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:09,100
each ear by trade eg doesn't really do a

295
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,620
lot but this is one area where it

296
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,269
actually helps because for most of us

297
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,549
it's squiggles on a page

298
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:17,370
but for when we look at what we have

299
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:20,500
available now in terms of data for

300
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:22,269
autism there's still not a lot with this

301
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:25,299
is an area that is going to require a

302
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:28,360
lot of growth and it will this will take

303
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:32,199
off the way epilepsy did I guarantee of

304
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:35,409
that so the you know you can look at

305
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,910
various preclinical models for fragile X

306
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:38,679
it's actually a little bit mixed you

307
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,329
could see improvements with either

308
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:42,939
blockade or enhancement of

309
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:44,620
endocannabinoid signaling so the this

310
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:46,000
isn't these are in rat models so these

311
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,529
you know it's hard to know if this

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,419
translates to humans and which one would

313
00:11:47,529 --> 00:11:52,120
translate better I think it's saying

314
00:11:49,419 --> 00:11:56,409
interesting that oxytocin which has been

315
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,000
long touted as potential treatment for

316
00:11:56,409 --> 00:12:00,610
improving aggression and not patients

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,080
with autism brought this whole mechanism

318
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:04,690
probably works through the

319
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:07,180
endocannabinoid system at least in mouse

320
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:09,490
models so that oxytocin may reinforce

321
00:12:07,179 --> 00:12:13,209
you know oxytocin self-will reinforce

322
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,320
social bonding we think of this as it's

323
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:17,050
the hormone that gets released when

324
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:19,240
people breastfeed or when you see a cute

325
00:12:17,049 --> 00:12:22,240
little puppy it gives you that warm

326
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,129
fuzzy feeling and it drives an and amine

327
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,419
mobilization and then the nucleus

328
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,840
accumbens is part of the brain that's

329
00:12:25,419 --> 00:12:31,360
important for motivated behaviors things

330
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:33,940
like addiction are actually related to

331
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,830
that region so so there may be some link

332
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,350
in oxytocin and in dravet syndrome

333
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,690
what's really interesting is in in mouse

334
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,840
models for Dravet if you improve the

335
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:46,120
seizures you actually improve the autism

336
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:50,019
autistic like behaviors as logistic as a

337
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,200
mouse can be but mice to show there are

338
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:55,210
ways to grade social interaction of mice

339
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,390
and so with improvement of seizures

340
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:00,460
comes improvement in development and

341
00:12:57,389 --> 00:13:02,259
that would be huge if you could actually

342
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:04,420
improve the seizures and improve the

343
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,399
core features of autism because many of

344
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:08,860
the seizure treatments we have may

345
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,230
sedate you they may drug you but they're

346
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:13,029
not going to fundamentally improve your

347
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:14,980
social development or your language

348
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:18,189
development so to have that would be a

349
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:20,019
game changer we're really limited on

350
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,340
clinical studies but this is gonna this

351
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:23,769
is where we give a shout-out to the

352
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:26,050
nation of Israel for stepping up on on

353
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:27,399
this in this area because we haven't

354
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:31,389
been able to do these in the

355
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:34,029
so so I have to acknowledge that but we

356
00:13:31,389 --> 00:13:37,149
had a few case reports but more recently

357
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:39,120
coming out of Jerusalem there well

358
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,259
there's an ongoing there is an ongoing

359
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,799
prospective study but this was very

360
00:13:41,259 --> 00:13:47,860
exciting when this got published that

361
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:50,229
looking at looking at a total of sixty

362
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:52,480
patients with autism most most of them

363
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:56,409
are low functioning not very verbal most

364
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,480
mostly boys and they're treated with it

365
00:13:56,409 --> 00:14:00,039
was a 20 to 1 ratio that they were using

366
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,170
so something similar to what we would do

367
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,849
for epilepsy and it just went pretty

368
00:14:02,169 --> 00:14:05,559
high so went up to ten MiG's per kid per

369
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:08,200
day and I don't go that high in my

370
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:09,459
patients most of my patients don't I

371
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,800
don't think to go that high actually

372
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:15,370
often they don't tolerate it at lower

373
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:17,709
doses but but the behavioral behave what

374
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:19,720
they saw as as behavioral outbreaks of

375
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,850
aggression had improved in 61 percent of

376
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:23,860
patients things like anxiety and

377
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,860
communication problems also improved and

378
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,509
a good percentage and you can look at

379
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,070
the frequency of the actual disrupted

380
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,319
behavior so these patients it's not like

381
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,420
the disruptive behaviors fully ended but

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,290
in the patients who were having them the

383
00:14:34,419 --> 00:14:39,579
the frequency per day had dropped and

384
00:14:37,289 --> 00:14:40,689
one thing that was noted is that this is

385
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:42,370
something that was a little bit more

386
00:14:40,690 --> 00:14:44,050
evident in boys and a little more

387
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:47,259
evident in kids who didn't fit a

388
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:49,029
specific genetic syndrome so so for most

389
00:14:47,259 --> 00:14:52,120
kids with autism we still most kids

390
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:53,500
still don't have a known gene despite

391
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,179
the fact that we have very advanced

392
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:58,029
genetic testing these days there were

393
00:14:55,179 --> 00:14:59,589
only our hit rate is only about 25% most

394
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:01,360
kids don't have a known gene or known

395
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,389
syndrome and those were the kids that

396
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:06,009
seemed to respond well it was noted that

397
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:08,980
there were some sleep disturbances

398
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:10,899
irritability loss of appetite but based

399
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:12,940
on this the same Center is going to

400
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:15,370
launch a prospective double-blind

401
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,900
placebo-controlled trial with 120

402
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:18,879
patients so that's very exciting I mean

403
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:21,789
that's the direction we need to go three

404
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:24,549
minutes in my own observation I have

405
00:15:21,789 --> 00:15:26,740
much smaller numbers admittedly but what

406
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:30,459
I could say from what I've seen in about

407
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:32,470
I have a little I have about 200

408
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,009
patients with autism and aggression that

409
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,529
I follow

410
00:15:33,009 --> 00:15:38,110
again I'm an epileptologist but so most

411
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:39,850
of my practice is epilepsy but about

412
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,980
only only about a tenth of my

413
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:45,610
have moved towards cannabis based

414
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:46,750
therapy but of those 24 and I have a

415
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,818
little bit of a higher percentage of

416
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:52,360
girls who've gone towards cannabis space

417
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:54,219
therapy but what we've seen is the

418
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:55,870
epilepsy and those who've had epilepsy

419
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:58,660
I've seen a very high rate of

420
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:01,299
improvement so which is great so of

421
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:06,338
those 24 17 had epilepsy 14 of which saw

422
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:08,198
improvement there and we saw similar

423
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:09,940
improvements in in those patients of the

424
00:16:08,198 --> 00:16:11,769
24 who had aggression is the primary

425
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:13,149
symptom so keep in mind aggression is

426
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:14,850
not the only symptom that patients are

427
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,899
treating sometimes they're treating

428
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:19,420
inflammation they could be treating

429
00:16:16,899 --> 00:16:21,190
abdominal pain or GI symptoms so there

430
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,958
are other reasons they might pursue this

431
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:27,069
but those were aggression was the

432
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:29,198
primary thing for for those individuals

433
00:16:27,068 --> 00:16:31,240
the particularly the non syndromic boys

434
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:34,328
about a 10 out of 13 from my own

435
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:37,360
practice so improvement and of those

436
00:16:34,328 --> 00:16:38,828
kids who had a regression we saw you

437
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,318
know I'm seeing improvement in about 11

438
00:16:38,828 --> 00:16:43,000
out of 13 so it seems to me if you had

439
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:45,938
to pick the patients that you want to

440
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,129
consider this in a typical patient that

441
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:51,188
I think was gonna respond well those who

442
00:16:48,129 --> 00:16:52,688
have epilepsy but the story would be

443
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:54,188
would kind of follow like this it's a

444
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:55,659
child who was developing well up until

445
00:16:54,188 --> 00:16:57,909
about 18 months had a period of

446
00:16:55,659 --> 00:16:59,860
regression and then now sometime between

447
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:01,028
about 12 to 14 years of age is suddenly

448
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,278
having an increase in aggressive

449
00:17:01,028 --> 00:17:04,659
behaviors and then somewhere around that

450
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,369
same time they're developing epilepsy

451
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:10,179
and that's a pretty good patient to

452
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:11,889
consider this is a therapy the one thing

453
00:17:10,179 --> 00:17:13,449
to counsel patients on though this is

454
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,829
not a cure and they're going to continue

455
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:16,179
to have aggressive episodes but this

456
00:17:14,828 --> 00:17:19,480
will be just one extra tool in your

457
00:17:16,179 --> 00:17:21,939
toolbox one minute to help things and

458
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,380
the other thing to note too is that what

459
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:24,640
was done in Jerusalem is different from

460
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,470
what I'm using or what I'm saying

461
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,880
because they're dosing was higher but

462
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,339
the ratio is also different what I

463
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:33,250
generally find is that patients need

464
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,899
ratios when you look at CBD to THC I

465
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,700
think they're doing better when you're

466
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,679
getting into like a five to one or three

467
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,630
to one kind of ratio then that twenty to

468
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:43,240
one ratio but no two kids are the same

469
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:45,520
so I really can't make any broad

470
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,960
assessment this is a little more I think

471
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,789
dr. Goldstein emphasized as well there's

472
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,500
a lot of art in this and you have to you

473
00:17:48,789 --> 00:17:52,599
have to really listen to the feedback

474
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,259
that you're getting and if we look at

475
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:54,459
setting up

476
00:17:53,259 --> 00:17:56,019
your studies we have to acknowledge that

477
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:58,660
there's a lot of heterogeneity within

478
00:17:56,019 --> 00:18:00,160
our patients so we have to look at a lot

479
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,769
of various factors to decide what's the

480
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
right therapy and we have to again think

481
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:06,639
of what are the specific indications

482
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,900
that these patients need help with the

483
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,509
most important thing is our kids need

484
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:12,759
help and the parents are super motivated

485
00:18:10,509 --> 00:18:14,470
they want to get their kids better if if

486
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:17,799
we could set up trials you'll you'll

487
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:19,569
recruit like nobody's business and this

488
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:22,450
is my group at the floating Hospital

489
00:18:19,569 --> 00:18:25,200
we're out of time thank you very much

490
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:25,200
let's hear it for
