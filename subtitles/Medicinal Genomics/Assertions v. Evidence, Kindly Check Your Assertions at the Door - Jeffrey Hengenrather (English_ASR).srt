1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:08,500
good morning and thank you very much for

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,419
the opportunity to be here my name is

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:14,259
Jeff friggin rather I'm a physician in

4
00:00:10,419 --> 00:00:16,660
California I have a private practice in

5
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:21,609
California doing cannabis consulting for

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:25,118
the last 20 years this has been a really

7
00:00:21,609 --> 00:00:27,580
enjoyable change from family or from

8
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,948
general practice and from ER medicine to

9
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:32,979
go into cannabis medicine I take this

10
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:35,260
practice very seriously I've I'm kind of

11
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:37,799
an old-style physician I I request

12
00:00:35,259 --> 00:00:40,659
patient records before I see patients I

13
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:44,519
usually a set up an appointment for

14
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:48,279
about 90 minutes for my initial adult a

15
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,199
consultation two hours for children so

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,268
in California we can see anybody from

17
00:00:50,198 --> 00:00:54,189
you know of any age group with any

18
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:56,229
conditions so I want to know if that's

19
00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:58,149
in the record the problem that they're

20
00:00:56,229 --> 00:01:00,189
coming to me about and and then

21
00:00:58,149 --> 00:01:03,129
basically tailor a treatment plan to

22
00:01:00,189 --> 00:01:05,170
work with them I am president of the

23
00:01:03,128 --> 00:01:07,420
Society of cannabis clinicians this is a

24
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,100
group that started in about 2000 and

25
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:12,700
I'll talk a little bit more about this

26
00:01:09,099 --> 00:01:15,459
as we go along so we all choose our

27
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:17,680
evidence as it meets our needs and there

28
00:01:15,459 --> 00:01:20,109
are ancient sources of information that

29
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
are very interesting they're burial and

30
00:01:20,109 --> 00:01:24,760
tombs that are you know where cannabis

31
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,620
has been used in the past we have

32
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,630
evidence from William o Shaughnessy back

33
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:32,140
in the middle of the nineteenth century

34
00:01:28,629 --> 00:01:36,849
he was spoken of yesterday going from

35
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,129
England to to Calcutta back in 1833 and

36
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:41,019
working there for over a decade

37
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:42,699
learning about cannabis and writing

38
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:48,789
about it and eventually bringing it back

39
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:51,340
to England as a medicine in 1844 some

40
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:53,500
cling to the reefer madness level of

41
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,640
information and you know that's just

42
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,859
something we have to deal with

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,549
doctormick areia the founder of this

44
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:03,730
society of cannabis clinicians wrote a

45
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:08,079
book that wasn't published at ni MH he

46
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:11,950
was there as a as a doctor studying

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,319
cannabis in the 1960s and 70s and when

48
00:02:11,949 --> 00:02:16,718
he was asked to go to California and and

49
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:18,489
spy on the college students smoking

50
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:20,620
cannabis he realized they really were

51
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:23,260
that interested in the medicinal uses of

52
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:25,330
cannabis but his book was about the

53
00:02:23,259 --> 00:02:31,000
English language literature on medical

54
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:33,580
marijuana from 1839 until 1972 of course

55
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,930
we have the LaGuardia reports in 44 and

56
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:40,690
the Schaffer Commission in 72 both these

57
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:43,080
documents exonerated cannabis as being a

58
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:45,849
problem they basically said that

59
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,710
cannabis users are indistinguishable in

60
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,930
our society from those that don't use

61
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:51,820
cannabis and then we have the IND

62
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,460
program that the government was really

63
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,590
forced to get involved when got involved

64
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:58,270
with because patients who weren't

65
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:01,330
getting adequate treatment with

66
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,800
conventional medicines basically sued

67
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:04,750
the federal government and the federal

68
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,969
government was then forced to allow them

69
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,889
to use cannabis as medicine then they

70
00:03:08,969 --> 00:03:13,449
about a year later they forced the

71
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:15,939
government to actually supply them with

72
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:18,159
the cannabis so there's are still a half

73
00:03:15,939 --> 00:03:19,419
dozen or so patients using cannabis from

74
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,479
the federal government there were at

75
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:24,729
least 19 that were using cannabis over

76
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:27,759
the years and then George Bush senior

77
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:29,319
came along and in 1992 closed the

78
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:30,849
program saying there was no scientific

79
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,829
value to marijuana

80
00:03:30,849 --> 00:03:34,180
well it's interesting to note that the

81
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:36,219
feds never looked at any of these

82
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:39,159
patients or their experiences or what it

83
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:41,919
was doing for them that's just the way

84
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:44,710
it is the federal agenda was to keep

85
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:47,469
cannabis down so the feds parental

86
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:49,830
perennial e refused to reschedule

87
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:52,330
cannabis and they continued to put out

88
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:54,969
misinformation to the public and to the

89
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,370
physicians basically scaring people from

90
00:03:54,969 --> 00:04:00,129
the use of cannabis and even as early as

91
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,569
just a month months ago in January we

92
00:04:00,129 --> 00:04:04,659
had an update from the National

93
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:07,269
Academies of Sciences talking about need

94
00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:09,400
for greater research well this is kind

95
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:11,439
of a problem because we can't get the

96
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,980
research that we want certainly not in

97
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:16,810
terms of cannabis as a medicine we can

98
00:04:14,979 --> 00:04:20,409
get it as cannabis as a drug of abuse

99
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:22,810
those research projects are approved and

100
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:25,000
done by NIDA but as far as the medicine

101
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:27,100
it just doesn't happen for the

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,519
physicians doing cannabis work we have

103
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:32,469
our clinical evidence so cannabis as you

104
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:34,478
probably well know is one of the most

105
00:04:32,468 --> 00:04:37,178
studied therapeutically active

106
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:40,269
substances in history far exceeding

107
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:41,649
almost all pharmaceuticals the pubmed

108
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:44,739
literature and the Google Scholar

109
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:49,509
literature is full of tens of thousands

110
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:51,638
of papers on these subjects of course

111
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,199
you already know that the cannabinoid

112
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,079
receptors are in the animal kingdom

113
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,968
accepting insects from Hydra to humans

114
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:03,550
so it's there as a modulating system to

115
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:06,129
keep our bodies in balance you've seen

116
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:08,800
this already today this is the presence

117
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:11,499
of the cb1 receptors in their brain so

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,179
the receptors are their modulating the

119
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,889
way the nervous system works and in the

120
00:05:13,178 --> 00:05:19,388
peripheral nerve endings throughout the

121
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:22,269
body as well as in the immune system

122
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:24,218
also modulating the immune system in the

123
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:26,528
tonsils and the adenoids and the liver

124
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:29,829
and the spleen and the T cells and the B

125
00:05:26,528 --> 00:05:31,379
cells so it's not that the federal

126
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:34,149
government doesn't understand this

127
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:36,069
modulating endocannabinoid activity may

128
00:05:34,149 --> 00:05:38,860
have therapeutic potential in almost all

129
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:41,348
diseases affecting humans including this

130
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,588
laundry list of conditions this came out

131
00:05:41,348 --> 00:05:46,209
of NIH four years ago so they understand

132
00:05:44,588 --> 00:05:48,459
this it's just that they're not thinking

133
00:05:46,209 --> 00:05:51,249
of cannabis as the way to get there

134
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:53,019
they're looking to protect the interests

135
00:05:51,249 --> 00:05:55,528
of the pharmaceutical industries to

136
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:58,449
bring us new generations of medicines

137
00:05:55,528 --> 00:06:01,178
this is just an incomplete but longer

138
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:03,610
list of the pharmacologic effects of

139
00:06:01,178 --> 00:06:06,788
cannabinoids that we saw in part

140
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,379
yesterday and you can scan through them

141
00:06:06,788 --> 00:06:11,110
to see the kinds of things that

142
00:06:08,379 --> 00:06:14,979
cannabinoid activation is known to do in

143
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:18,218
the body but what do we hear from the

144
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:21,088
government their health assertions of

145
00:06:18,218 --> 00:06:23,829
harm in the pulmonary tract possible

146
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:27,428
smoking cannabis causing lung cancers

147
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:31,689
brain injuries addiction psychosis

148
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:34,478
schizophrenia and impairment short-term

149
00:06:31,689 --> 00:06:36,999
memory loss and driving as well as fetal

150
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:39,368
and neonatal harm are all asserted and

151
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:41,079
we continue to get really bathed in this

152
00:06:39,369 --> 00:06:43,509
misinformation that comes from the

153
00:06:41,079 --> 00:06:44,408
government let's start and pick apart a

154
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,090
little bit of this

155
00:06:44,408 --> 00:06:48,039
Donald tashkin

156
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:51,039
professor emeritus of pulmonary medicine

157
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,020
at UCLA and he's worked for NIDA for

158
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:55,990
forty five years in an effort to find

159
00:06:53,019 --> 00:06:58,180
harm in smoking cannabis well he does

160
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,069
show that smoking cannabis causes

161
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:01,900
irritation of the airway some

162
00:07:00,069 --> 00:07:04,329
inflammation some edema and some

163
00:07:01,899 --> 00:07:07,120
increase in mucus production but there

164
00:07:04,329 --> 00:07:09,370
is no evidence of clinically significant

165
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,329
alterations in pulmonary function

166
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:14,290
studies

167
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:17,529
this means no COPD no emphysema even in

168
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:19,870
the heavy cannabis users and going on to

169
00:07:17,529 --> 00:07:22,089
do a large epidemiologic study he showed

170
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,790
that there is no substantive evidence of

171
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:27,939
any increase in the incidence of cancers

172
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,879
of the lung trachea larynx pharynx or

173
00:07:27,939 --> 00:07:33,310
esophagus even in the heavy cannabis

174
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,079
smokers if you pick at his data a bit

175
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:38,740
you'll see that those that are smoking

176
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,259
cannabis and smoking tobacco had a 37%

177
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,199
decrease in the incidence of developing

178
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:46,389
any of these cancers

179
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:51,129
what about marijuana studies at Kaiser

180
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:53,949
Stephen Sydney is a doc epidemiologist

181
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:57,009
in kaisers Oakland a division and he

182
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:59,849
looked at nearly 65,000 patients and

183
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:03,339
divided him into cohorts of non-smokers

184
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,620
marijuana smokers and tobacco smokers

185
00:08:03,339 --> 00:08:07,929
and just looking at the cancers of the

186
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:10,418
lung the tobacco smokers went on to

187
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:13,090
develop 46 cancers over a short period

188
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:15,969
of time the non-smokers had two lung

189
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:17,949
cancers in the marijuana smokers none so

190
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:20,169
getting these cannabinoids into the

191
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:23,189
lungs when we're irritating the lung

192
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:25,538
seems to actually be responsible for

193
00:08:23,189 --> 00:08:28,719
extinguishing these cells and causing

194
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:31,029
them to not become a problem brain

195
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,979
injury we know that short term memory

196
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:36,129
impairment has been observed after heavy

197
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:38,469
chronic recreational cannabis usage but

198
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,899
it virtually disappears after abstinence

199
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:42,400
and more recent studies are similarly

200
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:45,490
encouraging with regards to

201
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,939
reversibility of any cannabis associated

202
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:51,009
cognitive sequelae hippocampal volume

203
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,140
changes are asserted by the government

204
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,970
but the most recent studies there show

205
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:57,389
that there's no significant gray matter

206
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,950
changes observed in cannabis users and

207
00:08:57,389 --> 00:09:02,409
then lower grade point average

208
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:05,620
and IQ and performance differences are

209
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:08,620
asserted in teens using cannabis but

210
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,220
these two are insignificant when

211
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:14,019
controlling for tobacco and alcohol use

212
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,360
the knight of director often quotes they

213
00:09:14,019 --> 00:09:18,579
surmised neurotoxic effect of cannabis

214
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,820
on the developing brain that permanently

215
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,310
lowers IQ this study was reviewed at the

216
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,220
University of Oxford and finds the

217
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:30,959
conclusions premature in light of likely

218
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:33,580
confounding from socioeconomic status

219
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,780
what about addiction we've talked about

220
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:37,840
this a bit already

221
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,769
and it's postulated that and there's an

222
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:42,220
often-quoted

223
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,379
incidence of 9% of ever cannabis users

224
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,690
becoming dependent at some point on

225
00:09:44,379 --> 00:09:49,450
cannabis well we have to temper this a

226
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:51,430
bit with it facts that this is based in

227
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:53,950
part on substance abuse treatment

228
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:55,959
programs and so as these people come

229
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,940
into these programs the majority of them

230
00:09:55,960 --> 00:10:00,220
don't really have a substance abuse

231
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,710
program a problem they're there because

232
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:06,370
it's mandated that they either go to

233
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:10,060
jail or to court or take the substance

234
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:12,700
abuse program so this is more or less a

235
00:10:10,059 --> 00:10:14,259
laughable condition for my thousands of

236
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,210
patients that I've seen over the years

237
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:18,370
they don't have any trouble coming and

238
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:20,080
going from cannabis use they may like

239
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,970
cannabis use and you might say they're

240
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,440
habituated to it but they're not

241
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:25,330
addicted to it and there's no

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,050
significant withdrawal and they can come

243
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:30,810
and go from cannabis use quite easily

244
00:10:28,049 --> 00:10:34,059
what about psychosis and schizophrenia

245
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:35,799
well this is really depending on your

246
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:37,479
viewpoint your perspective if you have a

247
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:40,209
child that's gone on to develop

248
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,970
schizophrenia and he or she may have

249
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:45,310
smoked pot as a teen you may very well

250
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:46,690
feel that this has been responsible for

251
00:10:45,309 --> 00:10:49,899
your teens change

252
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:52,180
well causality is unsupported by the

253
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:54,069
literature if you look at the Keele

254
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:56,289
University study this is the largest

255
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,510
study that I've seen done came out of

256
00:10:56,289 --> 00:11:01,419
England it studied cannabis use in the

257
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:04,539
clinic system in the UK for 10 years

258
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:07,389
from 1996 through 2005 and over that

259
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:09,579
period of time 2.3 percent of the

260
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:12,699
English population came through the

261
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:13,840
clinic system and of those during that

262
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,820
time there was

263
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:19,509
an increase in cannabis use in the

264
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,879
general population by four-fold and in

265
00:11:19,509 --> 00:11:24,730
the 18 and younger population they had

266
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:26,950
an 18 fold increase in the use of

267
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,210
cannabis and when they looked at the

268
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,530
population and the incidence of

269
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:34,420
psychosis and schizophrenia they found

270
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:36,759
that the incidence and prevalence of

271
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:40,149
schizophrenia and psychosis were either

272
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:43,470
stable or declining during this decade

273
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:46,990
when cannabis use was increased so much

274
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:49,450
fetal and neonatal harm again assertions

275
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:51,730
of harm and doctors are quite afraid of

276
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:53,560
its use in can opinion in nursing

277
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:56,019
mothers mothers and in pregnant women

278
00:11:53,559 --> 00:11:57,699
but the evidence isn't there either

279
00:11:56,019 --> 00:12:01,059
maternal marijuana use during pregnancy

280
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,250
is not an independent risk factor for

281
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:06,429
adverse neonatal outcomes after

282
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:08,590
adjusting for confounding factors and in

283
00:12:06,429 --> 00:12:10,449
a study a little ways back marijuana use

284
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:13,060
was relatively common in pregnant women

285
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:15,820
and was not related to adverse pregnancy

286
00:12:13,059 --> 00:12:18,189
outcomes it was the tobacco and tobacco

287
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,950
is still the most commonly abused drug

288
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:23,710
during pregnancy and responsible for

289
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:25,900
adverse pregnancy outcomes probably the

290
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:27,700
most important study is one from Melanie

291
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:31,600
Dreier when she went to Jamaica and

292
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:34,300
studied pot smoking pregnant women she

293
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,879
had 30 women that were heavy pot smokers

294
00:12:34,299 --> 00:12:41,289
and she got thirty others that were

295
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:43,689
there they're a group of non-smoking

296
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:45,069
women that they compared to and she

297
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:47,350
followed these people through their

298
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:49,570
pregnancy their labor delivery and and

299
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:53,290
through the first neonatal month of life

300
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:55,660
and without reading the the fine print

301
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:58,480
basically she said that the kids that

302
00:12:55,659 --> 00:13:00,730
came out of these pregnant pregnancies

303
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,800
from pot smoking moms we're actually

304
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,170
doing better at the end of the first

305
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:07,179
month of life they were more alert they

306
00:13:05,169 --> 00:13:09,699
didn't need as much arousing and they

307
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:11,799
just seemed to be doing well she got

308
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:14,470
this paper published in Pediatrics in

309
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,419
1994 then went back several years later

310
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:19,180
to see how these kids were doing later

311
00:13:16,419 --> 00:13:21,610
on in life and she found again that they

312
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:23,849
were actually doing better than than the

313
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,050
control group she went back to

314
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:27,490
Pediatrics magazine with her evidence

315
00:13:26,049 --> 00:13:30,879
and asked to prep

316
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:32,889
her information they said no this is the

317
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:35,169
earth-mother syndrome they explained

318
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:40,929
it's just that these pot smoking moms

319
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:43,229
were better mothers so what about the

320
00:13:40,929 --> 00:13:43,229
future

321
00:13:46,289 --> 00:13:51,250
cannabis is making a difference and is

322
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:53,769
likely to continue to play a role in the

323
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,330
world of mainstream medicine with or

324
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:58,838
without the federal government's

325
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:01,509
prohibition we know that we have to have

326
00:13:58,839 --> 00:14:03,820
clean medicines available in that to

327
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:05,830
have any product approved as a

328
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:07,510
pharmaceutical it must have proof of

329
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,959
biochemical uniformity and stability

330
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:12,639
along with safety and efficacy as proven

331
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,909
by the randomized clinical organ

332
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,708
controlled trials this is the problem

333
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:19,990
because the federal government does not

334
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:22,179
want to see these studies so they're not

335
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:24,940
done so we don't get the evidence that

336
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:28,958
we're looking for basically you have to

337
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:31,300
have approval by NIDA DEA FDA I think

338
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,250
maybe PHS is off the hook now Public

339
00:14:31,299 --> 00:14:36,189
Health Service but Health and Human

340
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:38,139
Services all have to approve a study

341
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,180
before it can be done in the United

342
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:42,730
States as a randomized controlled study

343
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:44,979
of cannabis so basically the federal

344
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:47,050
bureaucracies and the influence from the

345
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:49,870
pharmaceutical industry and what I would

346
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:54,338
call the drug war industries effectively

347
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:56,799
prohibit cannabis studies but the public

348
00:14:54,339 --> 00:14:59,350
has changed the world here because word

349
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:01,599
of mouth from person to person now has

350
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:04,149
it to where we have changed the laws in

351
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,709
many many of our states the darker green

352
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,289
states are those where we've approved

353
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:10,269
adult use of cannabis the pale green

354
00:15:08,289 --> 00:15:13,389
states are the ones where we have

355
00:15:10,269 --> 00:15:16,059
medical marijuana and not even shown or

356
00:15:13,389 --> 00:15:18,009
17 more states where we've where states

357
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:20,799
have approved the use of cannabinoids

358
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:24,909
that are not psychotropic mainly

359
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,419
speaking of CBD so what about the

360
00:15:24,909 --> 00:15:28,269
evidence

361
00:15:25,419 --> 00:15:29,828
there's valid you know randomized

362
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:32,470
controlled studies that we basically

363
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:36,309
can't get and then we have our clinical

364
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:38,410
observations the founder of the SCC dr.

365
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:40,649
Tod mikuriya years ago said we have a

366
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:43,379
problem with this gold standard stud

367
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:45,360
because we can't we can't use it we're

368
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:49,350
not getting the opportunity to study

369
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,960
cannabis in controlled studies this

370
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:54,300
randomized controlled trials were

371
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:56,250
ushered into medicine in the 40s while

372
00:15:54,299 --> 00:15:58,740
the time modern honored clinical

373
00:15:56,250 --> 00:16:02,009
observations have a have been assigned

374
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:04,980
to anecdotal and really invalid evidence

375
00:16:02,009 --> 00:16:07,590
which I would argue with it is valid

376
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,899
evidence the value of the randomized

377
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:11,910
controlled study depends upon the study

378
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:15,029
design and who's funding the study and

379
00:16:11,909 --> 00:16:17,579
what they intend to show and the value

380
00:16:15,029 --> 00:16:20,039
of the clinical observation hinges to

381
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:23,930
upon the expertise and the reliability

382
00:16:20,039 --> 00:16:26,159
of the observer they both have

383
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,509
opportunity for institutional or

384
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,419
personal bias

385
00:16:27,509 --> 00:16:32,580
you know we had Vioxx some years ago a

386
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:35,939
great anti-inflammatory drug it went

387
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,730
through our CTS but 55,000 people died

388
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:41,190
of cardiac deaths even though it had

389
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,440
gone through the the studies of being

390
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:46,410
able to show that it was supposedly safe

391
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:50,180
and effective so just because it's an

392
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:54,539
RCT doesn't really show that it's safe

393
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:57,179
so the feds continue to refuse medical

394
00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:59,069
cannabis research we this is an

395
00:16:57,179 --> 00:17:02,219
interesting little bit that Kant has

396
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:05,070
come out of the American Academy of

397
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:07,319
Ophthalmology in 1992 basically saying

398
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:09,389
marijuana safety and efficacy or safety

399
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,960
hasn't been demonstrated through the

400
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:15,420
federal regulatory process I would say

401
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:18,690
that it never will get the federal

402
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:20,910
regulatory process so what they had said

403
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,590
was that there is no scientifically

404
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:24,509
verifiable evidence that the use of

405
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:26,279
marijuana is safe and effective in the

406
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:28,559
treatment of glaucoma they had studied

407
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:30,539
it back in the 70s it does lower it to

408
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:33,240
ocular pressure what they never looked

409
00:17:30,539 --> 00:17:35,940
at was the neuro protective qualities of

410
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:38,519
cannabis that are exceptional and for

411
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,460
which the government has patented the

412
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:46,740
use of a patented cannabinoids I should

413
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:49,500
say and then in 1997 the the National

414
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:51,420
Eye Institute in the NIH concluded that

415
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,970
none of the studies demonstrate that

416
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,580
marijuana or marijuana or any of its

417
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,528
component

418
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:59,558
because safely and effectively lower

419
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:02,589
intraocular pressure get this any more

420
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:04,658
than a variety of drugs on the market so

421
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:08,019
they don't want it to be studied they

422
00:18:04,659 --> 00:18:11,350
don't want the competition so cannabis

423
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:13,179
is effective for her glaucoma and I've

424
00:18:11,349 --> 00:18:14,798
been watching it for years in my own

425
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,730
patients with stability in their

426
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:20,319
glaucoma but again this is problematic

427
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:24,038
when it comes to research because we

428
00:18:20,319 --> 00:18:26,288
really can't get it with the embargo on

429
00:18:24,038 --> 00:18:28,839
cannabis clinical studies what the

430
00:18:26,288 --> 00:18:31,419
Society of cannabis clinicians did was

431
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,908
reformed our own journal o'Shaughnessy's

432
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:36,490
was published in 2003 we put out a

433
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:39,070
couple issues a year or an issue a year

434
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,839
since that time and it gave us an

435
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:43,210
opportunity to publish our clinical

436
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:46,298
findings without the requirements of the

437
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:48,970
RCT the IRB and the peer review that

438
00:18:46,298 --> 00:18:52,089
would be required in order to try to get

439
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:54,130
a controlled study and so the journalist

440
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,658
called of Shaughnessy's again named for

441
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:58,240
William o Shaughnessy the English

442
00:18:55,659 --> 00:19:01,480
physician who went to Calcutta in 1933

443
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,069
stayed there over a decade observing and

444
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:06,519
writing about and studying the use of

445
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:09,428
cannabis and he was quite influential as

446
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:15,519
he took this in Furman information back

447
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:19,450
to the English in 1844 here in 1843 his

448
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:21,638
paper led the paper his article on

449
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:24,970
Indian hemp or ganja and how to prepare

450
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:27,069
it so he was preparing cannabis for use

451
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:31,149
as an anticonvulsant and for other

452
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:32,918
medical uses well I know Shaughnessy's

453
00:19:31,148 --> 00:19:35,018
in our first issue we also put up

454
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:37,240
doctormick areas cannabis as a

455
00:19:35,019 --> 00:19:39,159
substitute for alcohol and really

456
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:41,349
throughout our journal every issue we

457
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:43,720
have our clinical studies and we have

458
00:19:41,349 --> 00:19:46,449
our observations that we show which are

459
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,700
very useful for clinicians and for our

460
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:51,819
patients as long as we give it to our

461
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:54,519
patients for free we can get it for a

462
00:19:51,819 --> 00:19:56,950
very low price this is just a case that

463
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:59,230
appears in o'Shaughnessy's this is a

464
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:01,538
baby that came to me 16 months of age

465
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,480
you'll see a large tumor deep in the

466
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:07,089
brain on the left-hand column

467
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,200
we he was advised chemotherapy and

468
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:10,058
radiation therapy

469
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,590
the parents said I'll get back to you

470
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:14,230
and they came to me we started putting

471
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:16,808
the full extract cannabis oil on his

472
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:19,179
pacifier you see three months later the

473
00:20:16,808 --> 00:20:20,950
column shows the tumor fading and in the

474
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:22,840
middle column five months after we

475
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:24,730
started putting the cannabis oil on his

476
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:32,108
pacifier the tumor had virtually

477
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:35,769
disappeared this yes thank you this

478
00:20:32,108 --> 00:20:37,960
kiddo is now in first grade he has gone

479
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:39,999
through some IQ testing to just see how

480
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,829
he's doing he measured it a hundred and

481
00:20:39,999 --> 00:20:44,950
thirty five so no one's worried about

482
00:20:41,829 --> 00:20:46,778
this little guy and then Crohn's disease

483
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,819
this is a subject that I'll briefly

484
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:51,519
review because I really am running out

485
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:54,278
of time my first publication on our

486
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:56,649
pilot study was in 2005 on a dozen

487
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:59,169
patients with Crohn's disease all of the

488
00:20:56,648 --> 00:21:01,178
early docs in the society reported our

489
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:05,230
benefits with using cannabis in Crohn's

490
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,929
disease we went on to study what is Oh

491
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:10,509
put out of Italy for years showing all

492
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:12,489
of these pharmacologic physiologic

493
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:16,538
effects of cannabinoids in the gut on

494
00:21:12,489 --> 00:21:19,389
the cb1 and cb2 sides and then we had we

495
00:21:16,538 --> 00:21:21,339
got 38 patients with Crohn's disease to

496
00:21:19,388 --> 00:21:23,469
come into the study and we asked them

497
00:21:21,339 --> 00:21:24,878
about with and without cannabis what's

498
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,089
your paying your appetite nausea

499
00:21:24,878 --> 00:21:29,888
vomiting fatigue stools per day

500
00:21:27,089 --> 00:21:32,199
depression activity level flare up

501
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:34,839
frequency and severity and what's their

502
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,179
weight and so these columns here each

503
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:40,058
pair of columns represents each

504
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:44,440
patient's response stools per day were

505
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:47,980
down from 5.3 on a mean number of stools

506
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:51,429
per day to 3.7 with smoked cannabis pain

507
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:54,339
was markedly down regulated appetite

508
00:21:51,429 --> 00:21:56,769
markedly up regulated nausea down

509
00:21:54,339 --> 00:21:59,709
regulated you see the p-values over on

510
00:21:56,769 --> 00:22:02,940
the right side as well vomiting markedly

511
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:05,919
down regulated fatigue down regulated

512
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,450
depression significantly down regulated

513
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:09,788
and the psychiatrist that I've seen

514
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:12,788
showed this to say this oughta be

515
00:22:09,788 --> 00:22:15,058
published independently commonly drugs

516
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:17,919
don't work this well for depression

517
00:22:15,058 --> 00:22:19,418
activity level up regulators so in spite

518
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,190
of what you might think about people

519
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:24,020
smoking pot all day they get up and go

520
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,840
when they're using cannabis for Crohn's

521
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:29,480
disease their weights are up about 12%

522
00:22:26,839 --> 00:22:31,129
their flare-up frequency is markedly

523
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,519
down in their flare-up severity

524
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:37,100
similarly is markedly down so in

525
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,079
conclusion the clinical observations and

526
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:41,659
findings are valid evidence of the

527
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:43,849
safety and efficacy of cannabis where do

528
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:46,009
we go from here well with the industry

529
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:47,929
coming along as it is I think it's time

530
00:22:46,009 --> 00:22:49,789
to buy our legislators like the

531
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,990
prohibitionists have been doing for so

532
00:22:49,789 --> 00:22:54,269
long

533
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,269
[Applause]

534
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:00,990
