1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:06,000
well i'm pleased to have this

2
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,758
opportunity to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
talk with you about something a little

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,280
different

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,359
and about the potential impacts of

6
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:14,879
cannabis emissions in the atmosphere

7
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:16,960
which is something we need to understand

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,839
if we're going to have a sustainable

9
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,160
uh

10
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,439
cannabis industry

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,679
and so i'll be going through a little

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,039
background about the plant volatile

13
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:26,399
emissions and their environmental

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
impacts

15
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:31,198
the what we understand right now about

16
00:00:28,399 --> 00:00:33,280
these cannabis emissions including that

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,600
that smell that cannabis smell which is

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,399
something we've figured out in the past

19
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,679
year

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,280
and then finally uh some solutions uh to

21
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:44,159
potential problems with cannabis

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,160
emissions

23
00:00:44,159 --> 00:00:48,479
so plants emit hundreds of different

24
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:50,640
volatile compounds into the atmosphere

25
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:53,919
some of those you're very familiar with

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,759
uh things you smell in your kitchen from

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
plants out in your garden

28
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,198
floral scents are on obvious ones but

29
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,840
there are a lot of other ones as well

30
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,519
too some of those we really can't smell

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
uh very much

32
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,000
so there's a whole range of different

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,320
compounds

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,079
coming from different processes

35
00:01:10,319 --> 00:01:14,158
so one one question is well why are

36
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:15,519
plants emitting all these various

37
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,520
compounds

38
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:20,640
some of them we we know quite well what

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:24,840
the physiological roles are uh what the

40
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,040
ecological roles are an obvious one is a

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,680
pollination right bringing in the birds

42
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,680
and bees and seed dispersers

43
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,560
but also a lot of it's for protection

44
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,520
purposes so these plants uh

45
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,240
have these compounds for for a reason

46
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,920
uh some of these we we know well uh for

47
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,640
defense some some of them we really

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,280
don't understand very well

49
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,079
but there are also the impacts on the

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,920
ambient environment

51
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,399
and

52
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,240
these impacts can include very large

53
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:01,280
impacts on chemistry of the atmosphere

54
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:03,679
greenhouse gases air pollutants

55
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,359
are impacted by these compounds but in a

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,960
clean environment

57
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:10,000
these compounds are emitted into the

58
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,479
environment they get oxidized chewed up

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,120
into carbon dioxide reabsorbed by the

60
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:17,598
atmosphere so they don't have an impact

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,840
so in a clean environment these plant

62
00:02:17,598 --> 00:02:23,439
volatiles don't have an impact on

63
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,479
pollution but it's very different in a

64
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,759
polluted environment and we we study

65
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:32,079
this in a range of different places uh a

66
00:02:29,759 --> 00:02:33,598
really nice place uh where we've we've

67
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,879
worked on this has been in the middle of

68
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,000
the amazon

69
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,079
so very clean pristine area around

70
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,759
just plant emissions

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,560
but then you have the city of manaus

72
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:46,719
about 2 million people

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,640
unregulated emissions so a lot of

74
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:50,959
pollution there

75
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:52,479
and we're able to go and do studies

76
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,479
these are studies

77
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:57,439
uh sponsored by the national science

78
00:02:54,479 --> 00:03:00,079
foundation uh department of energy uh

79
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:03,199
and and brazilian science agencies we

80
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,440
have aircraft uh sampling systems

81
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:07,119
downwind and we could sit there and look

82
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:09,120
at what was going on in the pristine

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,360
environment and then see what happens

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,200
when the manaus plume goes over

85
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,200
and what happens when you get the

86
00:03:13,199 --> 00:03:18,079
polluted environment mixing with these

87
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:20,799
plant volatiles you make a lot of ozone

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,120
a lot of particles these are two major

89
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,280
regional air quality problems and

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,959
they're also very important short-term

91
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,039
climate forcers

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,239
so very large impacts on on the

93
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:33,280
environment from this

94
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,840
um

95
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,158
uh my my colleague will viset is has

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,479
done work looking at on areas like here

97
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,840
in the u.s what are the impacts

98
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:46,000
and uh including uh cannabis cultivation

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
so he did a study looking at the

100
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,158
emission of these plant volatiles that

101
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,079
you get from cannabis cultivation

102
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:52,878
and for the particular location where

103
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,920
it's

104
00:03:52,878 --> 00:03:58,239
has been grown in denver you can get a

105
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,399
significant impact on ozone

106
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,719
denver has an ozone problem it's right

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:06,158
on the edge of being in compliance for

108
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:09,519
ozone so a little bit of a push on ozone

109
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:11,519
is a huge problem uh for denver and and

110
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,200
colorado

111
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,920
and so the way these studies are done is

112
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:18,238
to go in measure what's being emitted

113
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,120
from the plants and then extrapolating

114
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,519
that with a regional air quality model

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,120
where you can

116
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:26,560
run the model without the cannabis

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,800
emissions and then run it with the

118
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
cannabis emissions and you can see the

119
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,160
impact of the cannabis

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,360
and that impact is is up to about a ppb

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
of of ozone

122
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:42,399
and so the take home message here is

123
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:45,519
that there's potential for

124
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:49,120
cannabis growing operations to have uh

125
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,879
impact on on air quality in some regions

126
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,280
not in all regions and again if this

127
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:54,800
were a clean area if this were

128
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,439
pristine

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,120
in the amazon not near manaus there

130
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:01,279
wouldn't be any impact at all of the

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,519
cannabis emissions but when you have it

132
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:05,758
in a dirty area particularly oxides of

133
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:08,079
nitrogen around which which we have a

134
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
lot of uh in our cities

135
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,560
then you can make ozone and and

136
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,560
particles

137
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:18,240
and so this the idea that uh these

138
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,478
volatile missions are important for

139
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,280
global uh the global environment is

140
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,758
something we've known for for decades

141
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,758
and so these these emissions are in all

142
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
the global climate models all the

143
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,240
regional air quality models and we've

144
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,399
kind of worked out you know the uh the

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,160
impact of forest and large-scale

146
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,399
vegetation

147
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,639
more recently though we've realized that

148
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:44,239
there also can be an impact on these

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,240
urban areas like denver like los angeles

150
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,478
and in the past we we kind of ignored

151
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,720
that uh both because it so complicated

152
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,918
to try to do the vegetation in an urban

153
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,840
area

154
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:56,478
but also because there was so much

155
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:59,119
emissions of vocs right

156
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,439
but because uh our regulators have done

157
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,160
such a great job of reducing the voc

158
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:05,279
emissions in our cities we're now at the

159
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,680
point

160
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:09,758
where we think here in los angeles

161
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,120
county the most populous county in the

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,919
u.s

163
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,560
about half of the emissions

164
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,599
of these vault organic compounds which

165
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,680
impact smog ozone and particles about

166
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,479
half of it's coming from plants

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,560
and the

168
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,079
and all these compounds are not equal in

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,839
terms of their impact on ozone and

170
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,839
particles and the ones coming from

171
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,079
plants are actually have more of an

172
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:34,560
impact uh than

173
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,478
those coming from cars and in fact

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
factories so we think it's actually more

175
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:40,959
than half of the impact

176
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,279
well because we've been studying this on

177
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:45,839
the global scales for for a long time

178
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,478
for these large

179
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:50,879
scale impacts we have models we have

180
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:52,959
models that we've developed

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:55,439
and again are in all the climate models

182
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,879
and regional air quality models

183
00:06:55,439 --> 00:07:00,240
and basically look at how much

184
00:06:56,879 --> 00:07:02,319
vegetation there is look at

185
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,918
the weather the heat temperature all the

186
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,919
things that would affect these emissions

187
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,038
and and we we do these studies going

188
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,918
from small scales understanding the

189
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:16,000
biochemistry of what's going on

190
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:17,918
to looking at large scales where we can

191
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,759
see how does it impact

192
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,318
because again these plant

193
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,439
voc on their own don't have an impact

194
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,800
but it's when they impact with

195
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,120
anthropogenic emissions there's a

196
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,520
problem so we do aircraft studies now we

197
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,639
have satellite data and so we can kind

198
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,560
of uh

199
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,400
expand and look at the large scale

200
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,560
impacts

201
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,758
uh again on the on the small scales

202
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,360
where we can use these enclosure

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
measurements and understand for

204
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,199
individual plants what they emit

205
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,319
and what controls it so temperature

206
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:50,800
light uh stress are are important part

207
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:54,080
of the controls so we have these models

208
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,680
and and we we uh using these enclosures

209
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,918
under controlled conditions we can

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,240
figure out what's what's controlling all

211
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:03,279
of these emissions

212
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:05,759
okay so now back to cannabis um we first

213
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,878
started studying this a couple years ago

214
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,919
and uh

215
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,000
one of the

216
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,000
uh interesting things was people didn't

217
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,680
really know what that odor was of the

218
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,680
skunky odor because of course with

219
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,478
cannabis there's this potential for air

220
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,560
quality impacts but also just local odor

221
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,959
impacts right is is an important issue

222
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,959
in a lot of areas

223
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:26,239
talking to people in in the cannabis

224
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:29,519
industry a lot of people thought well

225
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,399
it's this skunky terpene uh mercing was

226
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:34,319
thrown out is is a possibility well

227
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,399
i've got bottles of mercy in my lab i

228
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,479
can smell it it doesn't smell skunky at

229
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,320
all right cannabis yeah some of them may

230
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,000
be a little musty but nothing that

231
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,599
smells like a skunk

232
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
but of course we knew

233
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,800
well the odor of a skunk it's a file

234
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,039
right and there's a lot of different

235
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,359
sulfur compounds that have that kind of

236
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:53,039
odor skunky beer

237
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,800
are our thighs

238
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:56,958
so we kind of keyed in on that and

239
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,039
looking for that and indeed we could see

240
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,039
in these cannabis emissions both looking

241
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,240
at individual plants and looking in

242
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:03,958
facilities

243
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,240
we could see a

244
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:08,000
3-methyl2-butane 1-thial

245
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,720
321-mbt

246
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,360
uh is the key compound the key skunky

247
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
smell uh in cannabis and we could do

248
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,278
that by again isolating the plant

249
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:18,958
looking at the emissions so we know it's

250
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:20,240
really really coming directly from the

251
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,000
plant

252
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,240
and of course we use uh you know

253
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,440
analytical techniques uh

254
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:30,240
td gc top ms to work this out we can

255
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,519
look at the mass spectra compare to nist

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,200
to authentic

257
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,600
samples

258
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,759
i also compared it to a corona beer that

259
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,800
i stuck out in the sun for for a while

260
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:43,120
and um and and we can figure out what

261
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:45,120
what these styles are

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,000
uh also working with our colleagues who

263
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,759
do olfactometry and so olfactometry is

264
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,159
is a technique where you're not using

265
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:54,319
expensive analytical detectors you use

266
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:57,039
the person's nose right so we have these

267
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,800
experts uh who will go through and and

268
00:09:57,039 --> 00:10:01,278
actually have this thing

269
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:03,838
going from the gas chromatograph which

270
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:05,360
which separates the compounds and

271
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,279
individual compounds and it goes to a

272
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,320
person knows and they write down

273
00:10:07,278 --> 00:10:13,039
it's grassy it's piney it's skunky

274
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,879
and so this is key right because

275
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:16,480
we can analytically determine what's in

276
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,159
the sample but you know we need

277
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,519
something connected to a nose and a

278
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:26,639
human brain to say hey this is uh this

279
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:29,039
odor that uh is can be a be a a nuisance

280
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:29,039
issue

281
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,360
so a key part of this approach it was

282
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,600
combining these two right combining our

283
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:43,519
advanced analytical techniques

284
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,519
and uh combining uh human sensory uh

285
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,839
odor panels

286
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,720
and so we worked with with our our uh

287
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,079
colleagues jacik kozil and and uh don

288
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:56,560
wright and combining this into an astm

289
00:10:54,078 --> 00:10:58,639
standard so astm is an organization that

290
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:59,838
develops these standard approaches that

291
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,639
people can use because one of the

292
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,600
problems right now with odor nuisance is

293
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,519
that there aren't standards so

294
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,360
you know in most cases the way agencies

295
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,600
deal with this is

296
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:14,240
somebody complains about it right our

297
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,759
monitoring system is the neighbor's nose

298
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,399
that's kind of what we're relying on

299
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:19,919
right now well the problem with that is

300
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,320
different people are going to respond

301
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,639
differently it's difficult to tell they

302
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,720
might send someone out uh with a nose

303
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:28,559
ranger and and try to breathe but it's

304
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,278
it's a problem right whereas in other

305
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,838
parts of air quality we we have uh

306
00:11:31,278 --> 00:11:36,320
standards based on this much ozone is a

307
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:39,120
problem right we don't have that for for

308
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:42,320
odor until we develop standards where we

309
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:45,519
can actually uh quantitatively say you

310
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
know this is a problem here

311
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,879
there's an additional complication

312
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:53,120
though in in that um

313
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:54,320
the ratios of these odors are are

314
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,440
important

315
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,120
and uh so so one potential possibility

316
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,560
because these files are really difficult

317
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,159
to measure and they're at really low

318
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:04,479
concentrations

319
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,759
so one one possibility you might think

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,159
of is well let's just measure the

321
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,319
terpenes because cannabis is emitting

322
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:12,399
terpenes it's emitting files let's go

323
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,000
measure terpenes if we measure terpenes

324
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,480
well then probably there's a cannabis

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,559
odor but it doesn't work that way it's

326
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,560
the ratios and in fact

327
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,479
the terpenes can actually mask the

328
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,879
cannabis odor so sometimes right near

329
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,360
the source you can't detect that skunky

330
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,399
odor and it's when it goes downwind to

331
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,320
the uh

332
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:31,839
the elementary school a couple blocks

333
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:33,920
away right then

334
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,160
the odor can actually be greater than it

335
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,838
is right at the fence line

336
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,838
so it's it's somewhat complicated there

337
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:46,000
but using these include so

338
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,759
so how can we solve this issue um and

339
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
using these enclosure measurements we

340
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:52,078
can determine for different cannabis

341
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,278
strains what those ratios are and again

342
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,120
we're not just getting the amount of

343
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:57,600
file but the ratio of the file to the

344
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,959
terpenes because those those ratios are

345
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,519
are really important

346
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,239
uh it's it's a challenge these styles

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,639
are

348
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,720
at really low concentrations but we we

349
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,879
have analytical techniques that that can

350
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,959
do that

351
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:12,480
we use again going back to those models

352
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:14,159
that we develop for global climate

353
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,320
models and regional air quality models

354
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:19,278
we use a similar kind of approach so we

355
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,600
take this uh we're calling it the canopy

356
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,679
emission profiler basically we can get

357
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,000
for a facility for a greenhouse or a

358
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,559
field we can determine exactly

359
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,120
quantitatively what the mass emission of

360
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:34,239
files and and terpenes are

361
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:35,519
uh with using these these uh enclosure

362
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,360
measurements

363
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,278
and of course we can look at differences

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,759
in you know juvenile the flowering

365
00:13:39,278 --> 00:13:44,958
obviously are different we need to

366
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,319
consider these different conditions

367
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:48,479
and the solution is well we have

368
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,879
techniques that that can remove

369
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,480
these compounds now one approach might

370
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,240
be well we have these techniques let's

371
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
just throw a bunch of it out there and

372
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,720
and remove everything we can

373
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,480
well well it costs money obviously to

374
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,959
put these out there it takes a lot of

375
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
energy to run these these carbon

376
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:06,719
scrubbers

377
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,839
they have to uh either regenerate or

378
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,079
dispose of the carbon so um it's really

379
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:14,399
important to well to one know the type

380
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,799
of carbon right so that you're

381
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,240
specifically targeting those files and

382
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:20,399
terpenes

383
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,560
but then right sizing it and so i've

384
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,320
been working on on getting well exactly

385
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,638
how much is going out there so we can

386
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,720
get the right amount of removal

387
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,320
technology but not too much

388
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,800
right so we don't have the cost we don't

389
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:36,000
have the uh inner

390
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:38,159
excess energy and sustainability issues

391
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,159
and again for example so we can just

392
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:42,319
quantitatively determine for the size of

393
00:14:40,159 --> 00:14:44,480
a facility for the emission because we

394
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:47,120
know the individual plants what they're

395
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,360
emitting we can determine how many of

396
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:51,519
these molecular filtration systems you

397
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
need

398
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,360
and so so buyers has been working on on

399
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,680
developing improved systems right

400
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,399
and proved in terms of the efficiency

401
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:04,958
right so the power is lower uh uh

402
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,919
improving uh the

403
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,078
uh

404
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:10,399
the effectiveness of the carbon that

405
00:15:08,078 --> 00:15:12,879
that's that's used in there and also the

406
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,120
ability to to reuse this carbon right

407
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:18,000
now typically it's just thrown away into

408
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,320
landfills so we can be able to uh

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
not do that anymore

410
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,000
and then of course third party testing

411
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,919
is is important to validate that we

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,839
really can remove these files we can

413
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,719
remove these terpenes

414
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,480
these these systems are are remarkably

415
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,879
effective

416
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,839
we can also also go beyond that to other

417
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:40,240
issues that are important for

418
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:42,000
cultivation uh getting rid of uh

419
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,198
pathogens

420
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,799
other kinds of things that might be

421
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:47,359
important for indoor air quality for

422
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:50,000
people so aspara is something that's

423
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
recently been

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
added to this system for removing

425
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,959
particles

426
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,160
biological particles and and other

427
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,879
particles

428
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,198
and again using third-party uh testing

429
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,720
uh these are are remarkably effective so

430
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:04,879
we have solutions

431
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,320
uh for for getting rid of these odors

432
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,399
getting rid of these these particles and

433
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,800
our focus is on doing this effectively

434
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:15,120
and including the use of smart systems

435
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:18,000
that would say hey it's time to replace

436
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,839
the carbon in this system um

437
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,519
and and getting real-time data if

438
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:22,720
there's some kind of a leak or an issue

439
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,720
going on

440
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
then you can immediately you know that's

441
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:28,800
going to your phone and saying hey we've

442
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,040
got a problem in in the facility right

443
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:31,039
now

444
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:38,078
so that's

445
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:40,189
what i have and i'd be happy to uh take

446
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:46,088
any questions

447
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:46,089
[Applause]

448
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:52,000
all right good morning thank you uh i

449
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,759
have an outdoor cannabis farm in sonoma

450
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,198
county and i'm surrounded by vineyards

451
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,079
and we are constantly having the

452
00:16:55,198 --> 00:16:59,838
conversation about our terpenes tainting

453
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,239
their grapes and the smell of skunky

454
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,400
smell knowing that that's thyles and

455
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,078
it's organic sulfur vinegar juice sulfur

456
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,240
to prevent powdery mildew is there an

457
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:11,678
argument to be made that our styles are

458
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,679
actually benefiting their grapes

459
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
they could be um yeah

460
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,160
yeah it's been really interesting to me

461
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,720
in kind of getting into this this field

462
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,120
and seeing how the vendors can dump all

463
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,318
kinds of stuff on the vineyards right

464
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:28,159
and they can't cast people can't but but

465
00:17:26,318 --> 00:17:30,079
it's really yeah this terpene drift

466
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,360
issue is really interesting and and i

467
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,199
know they've been focusing a lot on

468
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,798
eucalyptol

469
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,558
as as one and

470
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:39,519
we've done some studies it's a really

471
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,678
minor component um i think it's can be

472
00:17:39,519 --> 00:17:42,798
really rare you know and

473
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,280
in australia if you have a lot of

474
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:47,359
eucalyptus trees going around

475
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,038
it could be an issue but i think it's

476
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:50,639
unlikely with cannabis but again with

477
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,720
this kind of approach well then we can

478
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,880
tell right we can go see exactly what

479
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,120
are the terpenes and then we can model

480
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,760
exactly what's getting deposited on the

481
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:00,879
grapes and calculate that and and figure

482
00:17:59,759 --> 00:18:02,400
out and

483
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
you know i think in most cases you can

484
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,880
clearly show that's that's not a problem

485
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:09,199
thank you

486
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,200
okay

487
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,759
thanks wonderful talk

488
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,839
i had a question it's slightly off topic

489
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,279
but i your expertise sounds like you may

490
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,519
be able to answer this pretty well yeah

491
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:21,678
this talk was kind of off top

492
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,400
conference too maybe but

493
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,320
a number of indoor cannabis grows in in

494
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,679
california are moving more and more

495
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:32,159
towards oxidizing agents as a way to a

496
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:35,038
odor control and be

497
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,679
be effective as a pesticide an

498
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:40,240
alternative to chemical pesticides

499
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:43,360
i was wondering in indoor facilities

500
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:47,279
where they're fairly clean

501
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,639
the use of oxidizers like a

502
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:51,599
number of different oxidizers i could

503
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,200
talk about clo2 gas is one that's

504
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:55,839
starting to be used more

505
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,080
are we putting workers potentially in

506
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:00,000
danger or are we basically creating

507
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:02,079
clean breakdown products when those

508
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,839
oxidizers are mixing with these uh

509
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:05,678
volatiles from the plants

510
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,319
yeah it's really good questioning so in

511
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,160
general when you use oxidizers oxidizers

512
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:12,558
to break down these things and just

513
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,640
because there's so much terpene load in

514
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,240
there and stuff like that including even

515
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:19,120
if you've moved the plants out right a

516
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,038
lot of that stuff is condensed uh into a

517
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:22,798
film on on everything right and that's

518
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,240
part of what they're trying to clean up

519
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,918
you're going to generate all these

520
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,880
aldehydes

521
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,880
in there which can be really toxic

522
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,160
and so i think it's a real issue it's

523
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,360
it's something people really haven't

524
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,038
been looking at

525
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:36,159
very much what's what's getting created

526
00:19:35,038 --> 00:19:37,279
but i think

527
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,279
you know we don't really know but

528
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,918
there's good reason to suspect that that

529
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,519
that can really be a problem

530
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,759
sorry as a follow-up question can you

531
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:48,240
recommend any good uh sensors that we

532
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:50,160
can put in place in these facilities to

533
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,679
monitor for for the aldehydes and other

534
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:55,919
things that might be yeah

535
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,519
fortunately what we have right now there

536
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,919
are really good

537
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:02,000
sensors and they're really expensive

538
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,919
and then there are really cheap sensors

539
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,359
and they're really not very good and

540
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,960
that's kind of the state of the art

541
00:20:05,359 --> 00:20:09,678
right now uh you know we need something

542
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
more in between uh that can be done

543
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,919
but what um so it'd be really and these

544
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,519
are kind of online continuous sensors

545
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,600
which would be nice to have

546
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,839
but uh what can be done is is kind of

547
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:22,480
just grab sampling right so going out

548
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,319
collecting samples and analyzing them

549
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,679
and that's probably right now that's

550
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,359
that's the way to go

551
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,440
you know another interesting thing that

552
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:31,038
that brings up though is that not only

553
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,880
you know people do this for cleaning and

554
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:34,480
you might do that in between your

555
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,240
harvest but other other people are

556
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,558
suggesting you should use some kind of

557
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,480
oxidant for just cleaning the air right

558
00:20:38,558 --> 00:20:42,399
during the normal procedures

559
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,798
and that's definitely going to be

560
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,960
generating a lot of these aldehydes and

561
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,879
things like that and it's just that

562
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,880
really you know people need to be

563
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,440
careful with doing that we had looked

564
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,159
into that uh buyers has looked into that

565
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:58,960
and was you know thinking about that as

566
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,559
a potential thing to use and decided no

567
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,759
there's there's just too many risks

568
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,319
about

569
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:05,839
these products yeah you get rid of that

570
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:07,839
original compound you get rid of the

571
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,319
files but you're going to generate all

572
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:14,519
these these small aldehydes and it's

573
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,519
just not going to be a good thing
