1
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:10,629
good morning welcome to the women's

2
00:00:08,769 --> 00:00:12,699
health and cannabis panel my name is

3
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:14,798
Meredith Burak and I was born an

4
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:18,100
activist and I've been investing in

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,839
cannabis science since 2011 I'm also the

6
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:23,410
vice president of global operations of

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,960
gynecomastia of asana by a group which

8
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:27,490
is an Israeli based research and

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,429
development company focused on women's

10
00:00:27,489 --> 00:00:32,320
health this past week we received our

11
00:00:30,429 --> 00:00:34,179
official license from the Israel

12
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,948
Ministry of Health to conduct

13
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:38,979
cannabinoid based clinical trials

14
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:40,960
clinical research on women's health our

15
00:00:38,979 --> 00:00:42,459
first clinical trial headed up by

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,870
professors Lumiere honish

17
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:48,789
and Moshe hood is on endometriosis we

18
00:00:46,869 --> 00:00:50,530
have a lot of conviction that not only

19
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:52,839
can we deal with the symptoms of this

20
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,899
issue but get at the root of the problem

21
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:58,210
I'm hopeful that guy nakum will identify

22
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:59,320
a solution for this issue and move on to

23
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:01,719
the next challenge for women's

24
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,878
reproductive health this is why all of

25
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,129
us are in here all of us here on stage

26
00:01:03,878 --> 00:01:08,349
this morning to discuss cannabis is

27
00:01:06,129 --> 00:01:10,388
immense untapped healing power for

28
00:01:08,349 --> 00:01:12,669
women's health and we are advancing

29
00:01:10,388 --> 00:01:16,679
knowledge signs and products to ensure

30
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:19,118
women live better and healthier lives I

31
00:01:16,679 --> 00:01:20,709
became interested in cannabis medicines

32
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:23,978
for reasons much like many of you here

33
00:01:20,709 --> 00:01:26,350
because of pain and because of a of the

34
00:01:23,978 --> 00:01:29,259
shortfalls in prescription medicine that

35
00:01:26,349 --> 00:01:31,809
didn't address my needs my entry into

36
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:34,509
the woman's health began when I was 12

37
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,399
years old I had such crippling pain from

38
00:01:34,509 --> 00:01:37,509
my menstrual period that there was times

39
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:40,269
that I actually thought I was gonna

40
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:42,429
going to die of pain my doctor's

41
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:46,239
diagnosis was that I'm just someone who

42
00:01:42,429 --> 00:01:47,649
simply gets bad cramps her she offered

43
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:50,048
me prescription painkillers as a

44
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:52,299
solution my choices were either to

45
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,090
suffer in pain or be inebriated from

46
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:57,029
painkillers either way I wasn't

47
00:01:55,090 --> 00:02:00,969
functioning for a few days each month

48
00:01:57,028 --> 00:02:03,488
but my experience is not uncommon sixty

49
00:02:00,968 --> 00:02:06,038
to ninety three percent of the 3.8

50
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:07,749
billion women worldwide suffer from

51
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,920
painful cramps also known as

52
00:02:07,748 --> 00:02:14,259
dysmenorrhea in the US alone 600 million

53
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,739
working hours or two billion dollars

54
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:19,549
annually are lost because of

55
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,100
incapacitating cramps

56
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:24,530
on average a woman has her period from

57
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:29,299
three to seven days men straights from

58
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:32,990
ages 13 to 51 enduring 456 total periods

59
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:35,510
over 36 years this represents six and a

60
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:37,850
quarter years of her life can you

61
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:41,810
imagine living for more than six years

62
00:02:37,849 --> 00:02:43,400
in constant pain if you were living for

63
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:46,569
more than six years in constant pain

64
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,680
wouldn't you want to address this issue

65
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:51,409
but I would only be introduced to

66
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,599
cannabis medicine another 12 years later

67
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:55,729
in 2009 when my mom was suffering from

68
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:57,919
ovarian cancer one of the deadliest

69
00:02:55,729 --> 00:03:00,889
gynecologic cancers none of the

70
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:02,299
cocktails of Medicine toxins were

71
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,709
working for her and none of the side

72
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,189
effect medicines were working for her

73
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:06,710
either

74
00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:08,389
as many of you understand when it comes

75
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:11,000
to your own health or your loved ones

76
00:03:08,389 --> 00:03:13,099
when the when the traditional Western

77
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,310
medical market doesn't work for you

78
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,960
you look for other options these

79
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:19,159
experience has inspired me to look in

80
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,110
the medicinal into the medicinal

81
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,620
benefits of this historically prevalent

82
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:25,970
plant and to invest in its potential

83
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,709
among the many things I've learned is

84
00:03:25,969 --> 00:03:29,000
that the female reproductive system has

85
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:31,370
the highest concentration of

86
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,560
endocannabinoid receptors after the

87
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,939
brain making women particularly

88
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,689
responsive to the medicinal properties

89
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:40,340
of the plant the earliest references to

90
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,750
the relationship between women's health

91
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:44,539
and cannabis dates back to ancient

92
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:47,659
Mesopotamia we're talking about 2,000

93
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:49,909
BCE currently women's reproductive

94
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:51,859
health accounts for only four percent of

95
00:03:49,909 --> 00:03:53,659
the overall global funding for research

96
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:56,180
and development for health care products

97
00:03:53,659 --> 00:03:58,250
and services the majority of spending on

98
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,860
diseases has a male specific research

99
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:04,000
focus even though 38 percent of women

100
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:07,160
worldwide suffer from a chronic disease

101
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,840
today education and accessibility are

102
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,789
driving rapid growth in the women's

103
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:14,120
global health market yet the field

104
00:04:10,789 --> 00:04:16,668
remains vastly underserved but by 2025

105
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,709
the global women's health market will

106
00:04:16,668 --> 00:04:20,329
rise to over a hundred billion dollars

107
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,990
this is a hundred billion dollar

108
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:25,399
challenge for the cannabis industry

109
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:27,079
women want scientific research and

110
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:29,179
products that actually benefit us and

111
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:32,659
we're willing to pay for it in the US

112
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,288
alone women by 2020 will control 22

113
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,249
trillion

114
00:04:33,288 --> 00:04:39,649
in u.s. wealth and 65% of women who

115
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:42,520
invest are willing to pay for it or want

116
00:04:39,649 --> 00:04:44,959
to invest in causes that matter to them

117
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:49,308
what bigger cause is there than your own

118
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:51,408
health I hope that this is a rallying

119
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:53,088
cry for people in this room for

120
00:04:51,408 --> 00:04:56,118
companies for activists for scientists

121
00:04:53,088 --> 00:04:58,278
to emerge and address this hundred

122
00:04:56,119 --> 00:05:01,249
billion dollar global women's health

123
00:04:58,278 --> 00:05:04,808
challenge so without further ado we're

124
00:05:01,249 --> 00:05:08,479
going to hear from a world leading

00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:09,919
Iraq we have the earliest reference I

171
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,439
know too gynecological treatment with

172
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,720
cannabis what they call Desilu was

173
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:18,019
employed for staying the menses with

174
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,960
mint and saffron in beer and this was a

175
00:07:18,019 --> 00:07:23,990
common mode of administration in

176
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:27,709
medicines at that time also from ancient

177
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:29,810

00:07:27,709 --> 00:07:32,539
ground in honey introduced into her

179
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,990
vagina this is a contraction presumably

180
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:37,910
of the uterus and we'll see

181
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:43,639
substantiation for these claims

182
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:46,460
subsequently a little physical evidence

183
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:51,228
from Palestine in the fourth century

184
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:53,779
this carbonized fragment was found next

185
00:07:51,228 --> 00:07:56,689
to the skeleton of a fourteen-year-old

186
00:07:53,779 --> 00:08:02,418
young woman who died in childbirth and

187
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:04,519
there were THC metabolites in this

188
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:07,189
carbonized fragment and the supposition

189
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:09,228
was that this was burned so that she

190
00:08:07,189 --> 00:08:11,680
could inhale it as an aid to childbirth

191
00:08:09,228 --> 00:08:14,990
which failed in this instance

192
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,139
unfortunately this is a representation

193
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:22,160
con opossum aromatic Ain of what we feel

194
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:24,500
was cannabis in the Bible moving up to

195
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,820
the 19th century fleet what Churchill

196
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,410
wrote some of the most famous works on

197
00:08:27,819 --> 00:08:32,990
obstetrics and gynecology of that era

198
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:35,149
the property of Indian hemp of

199
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,490
restraining uterine hemorrhage has been

200
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:40,338
extensively tried with considerable

201
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:42,379
success and the tincture of the resin is

202
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,740
the most efficacious preparation that

203
00:08:42,379 --> 00:08:48,830
would have been tetrahydrocannabinol

204
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:51,710
predominant of the same era

205

Alexander christeson Indian hemp appears

206
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:55,129
to possess a remarkable power of

207
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:57,949
increasing the force of uterine

208
00:08:55,129 --> 00:09:00,889

Sir John Russel Reynolds was the Royal

214
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:18,528
physician it's often said that Queen

215
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:20,988
Victoria got cannabis since we're not

216
00:09:18,528 --> 00:09:23,928
privy to the Queen's medical records

217
00:09:20,989 --> 00:09:27,439
that's never been substantiated but he

218
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:30,078
was her doctor he said Indian hemp is of

222
00:09:37,428 --> 00:09:43,639
was the longtime editor of the journal

223
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:46,308
American Medical Association and in 1930

224
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:49,039
he said hence a woman in labor may have

225
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:51,048
a more or less painless labor as far as

226
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:53,509
is known a baby born of a mother

227
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:56,358
intoxicated with cannabis will not be

228
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:59,449
abnormal in any way and it is actually

229
00:09:56,359 --> 00:10:03,489
used this way still in Jamaica and many

230
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:07,909
other cultures as an aid to childbirth

231
00:10:03,489 --> 00:10:10,369
this is a survey from 1999 51% of

232
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:12,289
Australian women use cannabis for

233
00:10:10,369 --> 00:10:15,829
treatment of premenstrual syndrome or

234
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:18,259
dysmenorrhea apologies to Kylie Minogue

235
00:10:15,828 --> 00:10:25,368
I really don't know why she was so happy

236
00:10:18,259 --> 00:10:28,159
in this picture some modern figures

237
00:10:25,369 --> 00:10:30,860
there's great and appropriate concern

238
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,409
about drugs and pregnancy the expression

239
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:36,798
is no drug is the best drug in pregnancy

240
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:38,868
however what are the real data well this

241
00:10:36,798 --> 00:10:41,539
is a meta-analysis that was done a

242
00:10:38,869 --> 00:10:43,689
couple of years ago of 31 studies of

243
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:46,788
cannabis use in pregnancy and when

244
00:10:43,688 --> 00:10:49,068
confounders such as as tobacco were

245
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:52,970
excluded there were no significant stink

246
00:10:49,068 --> 00:10:55,868
seen for low birth weight these ratios

247
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,149
generally need to be about a - to be

248
00:10:55,869 --> 00:11:02,778
significant and when you have a 1.16

249
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:05,359
or preterm delivery 1.08 this means

250
00:11:02,778 --> 00:11:09,409
there's no known statistical

251
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:11,538
relationship so basically cannabis use

252
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:14,459
in pregnancy is not an independent risk

253
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:17,100
factor for adverse neonatal outcomes and

254
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:19,740
would add that neither th seen or CBD

255
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:23,700
have been found to have any teratogenic

256
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:27,840
affect meaning birth defects melanie

257
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:29,490
Dreier PhD did a great deal of work in

258
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:31,649
jamaica particularly among the

259
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,990
Rastafarian population which at that

260
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,860
time used a great deal of cannabis but

261
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:38,909
no alcohol and they had good nutrition

262
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,789
their babies

263
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:43,980
not only would cannabis help in

264
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:46,589
pregnancy with nausea but their babies

265
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,259
actually showed advances in their

266
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:54,410
cognitive development over women who did

267
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:57,090
not it was first reported in 1862 that

268
00:11:54,409 --> 00:12:00,419
treatment with cannabis could allay

269
00:11:57,090 --> 00:12:03,210
hyperemesis gravidarum the severus form

270
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:05,969
of morning sickness that often leads to

271
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:09,629
fetal demise even loss of the mother

272
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:13,740
wait Neal in Curie wrote an entry in our

273
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:15,870
book women in cannabis about her success

274
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,850
in using cannabis in pregnancy and this

275
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:23,070
was the beautiful baby that she had

276
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:25,500
subsequently on in 2006 there was a

277
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:28,050
survey done in British Columbia I was an

278
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:31,590
unindicted co-conspirator on this study

279
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:33,629
for political reasons but seventy-nine

280
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:36,139
British Columbia women were surveyed

281
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:40,019
sixty-five percent used it in pregnancy

282
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:42,569
68 percent of them used it for nausea 92

283
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,610
percent found it effective or extremely

284
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:48,750
effective and I would remind you that

285
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:50,550
this is episodic use with no risk to

286
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:53,100
speak of as compared to a situation

287
00:12:50,549 --> 00:12:55,409
where women are routinely hospitalized

288
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,409
with powerful drugs that are largely

289
00:12:55,409 --> 00:13:01,169
ineffectual

290
00:12:57,409 --> 00:13:04,019
this is a study that we did on patients

291
00:13:01,169 --> 00:13:06,839
of receiving cannabis from the federal

292
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:08,759
government in the compassionate use

293
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:12,710
investigational new drug program

294
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:16,200
patients a and D we're women one was

295
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,200
menopausal and one was pre menopausal we

296
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:21,300
looked at their endocrine parameters and

297
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:24,810
found that there were no derangements

298
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:27,729
despite using up to 10 grams a day for

299
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:29,858
many years of cannabis

300
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:32,019
so what are the indications and you see

301
00:13:29,859 --> 00:13:34,778
the list here menstrual irregularity

302
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,899
menorrhagia dysmenorrhea hyperemesis

303
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:40,778
gravidarum at the bottom of the list

304
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:43,418
endometriosis and I just want to end

305
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:45,249
with a summary on endometriosis I have a

306
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:51,428
lot more ammunition but this is a

307
00:13:45,249 --> 00:13:54,389
summary stimulation of G protein I'm

308
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:57,818
sorry GPR r18 an orphan receptor

309
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:59,609
increases cellular migration and that is

310
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:03,118
a key factor in the spread of

311
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:07,540
endometriosis which tends to metastasize

312
00:14:03,119 --> 00:14:10,839
even on to the peritoneum endometrial

313
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:13,678
biopsies reveal reactivity for the trip

314
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:17,410
v1 receptor in women with endometriosis

315
00:14:13,678 --> 00:14:21,899
and chronic pelvic pain and that's a

316
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:24,519
pain receptor cannabidiol stimulates and

317
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:27,249
desensitizes the trip v1 receptor and

318
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:32,379
should decrease neuropathic pain in an

319
00:14:27,249 --> 00:14:34,869
endometriosis cb1 and cb2 receptors were

320
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:36,688
both reduced in endometriosis over

321
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:39,278
controls highly statistically

322
00:14:36,688 --> 00:14:41,428
significant pointing out that this could

323
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,359
be a clinical endocannabinoid deficiency

324
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:48,389
disorder antiproliferative effects

325
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:52,269
reducing growth and pro-apoptotic

326
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:55,659
breaking down endometriosis effects were

327
00:14:52,269 --> 00:15:00,668
noted with drugs that stimulate cb1 and

328
00:14:55,659 --> 00:15:02,828
cb2 both THC and carry off allene should

329
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:05,859
both be effective treatments for that

330
00:15:02,828 --> 00:15:09,428
pain and an ideal treatment getting at

331
00:15:05,859 --> 00:15:13,480
the cause and the symptoms would be TAC

332
00:15:09,428 --> 00:15:16,480
with CBD and cari awfully and I believe

333
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:19,438
that's the last so we'll go on to our

334
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,438
next speaker

335
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:23,678

Wharton I didn't write that I swear

375
00:17:06,439 --> 00:17:10,860
anyhow I'm here today because I'm

376
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:13,588
interested in cannabis and I'm a baby

377
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,359
boomer and so I'm gonna make a departure

378
00:17:13,588 --> 00:17:18,958
from the previous remarks I'm going to

379
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,639
talk more about females and who were

380
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:23,250
actually the patients that are buying

381
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:27,209
the most medical cannabis who are really

382
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:33,359
the baby boomers first line oh I have to

383
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:37,200
make oh I have it sorry I just hit this

384
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:40,439
big green okay I am forced by my legal

385
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,058
counsel to make this disclosure you know

386
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,620
you can't believe anything I'm gonna say

387
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:48,210
I guess that's sort of what I'm going to

388
00:17:43,619 --> 00:17:50,308
say so

389
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:53,509
Columbia Kerr is actually a national

390
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:56,339
company we don't update this slide

391
00:17:53,509 --> 00:17:58,829
constantly because it would be too hard

392
00:17:56,339 --> 00:18:01,589
so I can just tell you the updates this

393
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:03,389
says that we're licensed in 12

394
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:06,959
jurisdictions in the United States

395
00:18:03,390 --> 00:18:08,940
that's now 13 we just got Virginia you

396
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,278
probably wonder why you really haven't

397
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:13,230
heard the name Columbia care-a-lot if

398
00:18:11,278 --> 00:18:14,788
we're in so many states and that's

399
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:18,169
because even though we're vertically

400
00:18:14,788 --> 00:18:20,629
integrated each state was given

401
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:25,440
initially its own name so there's

402
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:29,039
capital care patriot care constitution

403
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,538
care columbia care SWC so all of them

404
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:32,339
even though they belong to the parent

405
00:18:30,538 --> 00:18:33,839
company were given separate names

406
00:18:32,339 --> 00:18:35,908
because we didn't want the government to

407
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:39,298
think we were a cartel well the

408
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:41,190
government now knows and we work with

409
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:43,589
the government very effectively and what

410
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:45,210
we're doing is as every company sort of

411
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,408
comes on board with the formulated

412
00:18:45,210 --> 00:18:48,960
medical products that i'm going to

413
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:51,659
describe they are they then become a

414
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:54,120
columbia care name that we change the

415
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:57,360
name to columbia care officially so we

416
00:18:54,119 --> 00:19:00,388
have about 30 facilities now we have

417
00:18:57,359 --> 00:19:04,408
more than 30,000 individual patient

418
00:19:00,388 --> 00:19:06,329
interactions per month and we see 60

419
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,278
different qualifying conditions in most

420
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:11,220
of our dispensaries we have pharmacists

421
00:19:08,278 --> 00:19:13,259
in New York we have only form DS we make

422
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:16,190
a couple of tons of cured products a

423
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:19,259
year and we now have sent more than

424
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,409
750,000 individual patient interactions

425
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:24,720
and that's why I'm really interested in

426
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:26,278
the company back in 2013 the company

427
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,679
asked me if I would get involved in

428
00:19:26,278 --> 00:19:32,148
making a patient registry so that every

429
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:35,700
patient that came in would have a mini

430
00:19:32,148 --> 00:19:38,579
medical record and patients have been

431
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:40,470
very compliant with that many states we

432
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:42,148
have that information anyhow but other

433
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,429
states we've asked patients and they've

434
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:47,169
given us a lot of information we also

435
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,150
know exactly what they're getting in

436
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:51,850
in their product because we have to

437
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:54,519
track the purchases so at the point of

438
00:19:51,849 --> 00:19:56,769
sale we mark down what they buy and how

439
00:19:54,519 --> 00:19:58,779
often they buy it and we happen to know

440
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:01,869
because we've been doing batch analysis

441
00:19:58,779 --> 00:20:04,059
back to 2013 not only the THC and the

442
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:06,579
CBD amount but the minor cannabinoid

443
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,669
amounts so now we're getting to having

444
00:20:06,579 --> 00:20:11,109
you know close to a million different

445
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:13,029
interactions you know where you can see

446
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:15,669
what people bought what they will buy

447
00:20:13,029 --> 00:20:16,930
next why they change and that's going to

448
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:20,140
become very interesting and I think

449
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,549
helped elucidate a lot of the mysteries

450
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,930
that we have about what minor

451
00:20:21,549 --> 00:20:25,779
cannabinoids are good for what

452
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:28,210
conditions so one of the things that was

453
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:30,789
fascinating to me on the bottom here

454
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:33,130
you'll see our patients are really

455
00:20:30,789 --> 00:20:35,710
boomers okay the average patient in New

456
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:38,410
York is a 40 I'm sorry it's a 58 year

457
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:41,289
old woman the average patient in

458
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:43,630
Massachusetts in Arizona is a 45 year

459
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:46,329
old man so you know we're not seeing the

460
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:47,770
30 year olds who we think of as you know

461
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:52,319
habitual users were really seeing

462
00:20:47,769 --> 00:20:54,700
miracle patients I this because the the

463
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:57,159
qualifying conditions and symptoms are

464
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,660
sort of all over the place but I think

465
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:00,810
the important thing to understand is

466
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:03,880
many of these have at their root an

467
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:05,679
underlying immune dysfunction and I

468
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,960
think we forget about that sometimes you

469
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,640
know we're giving plants to people women

470
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,410
actually have more autoimmune

471
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,660
dysfunction and Men and suffer from

472
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,040
those diseases more often so we really

473
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,170
need to understand the quality of the

474
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,549
pant with the plants that we need to

475
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:20,430
make sure they don't have contaminants

476
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,740
we need to make sure that there's no

477
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:26,200
fungal or bacterial product involved

478
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:29,410
with this so you know we really need to

479
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,819
be very cognizant of the fact that most

480
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,560
of the patients that we're treating

481
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:34,779
particularly the women have some immune

482
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,179
dysfunction this is just to give you an

483
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:40,389
idea of the types of patients that we

484
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:42,519
see in New York New York we have the

485
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,710
largest database so that's why I focus

486
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:47,289
on it a bit but you can see chronic pain

487
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:48,819
neuropathy cancer inflammatory bowel

488
00:21:47,289 --> 00:21:51,309
disease spinal cord and then it goes

489
00:21:48,819 --> 00:21:54,700
down into the smaller pockets very

490
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:56,710
quickly so let's talk about women just

491
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:59,630
looking at all of the data that we can

492
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:01,610
cut when we think about the percent

493
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,850
female multiple sclerosis is the number

494
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:08,419
one use that we see of women using

495
00:22:04,849 --> 00:22:09,889
cannabis the average age is 51 and again

496
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:11,269
if you look at all of these ages you'll

497
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:15,230
see that really we're talking about

498
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:17,450
boomers or early boomers cancer pain is

499
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,970
next chronic pain is their neuropathy

500
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:23,180
and an opioid reduction opioid reduction

501
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:25,730
is actually very interesting we just in

502
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,190
New York have gotten as a qualifying

503
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,950
condition the ability to treat opioid

504
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,900
addiction so this is not a condition

505
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,970
this is opioid addiction and what we're

506
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,340
seeing is actually more women are coming

507
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:39,170
in looking for product in that case than

508
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:42,919
men it's very interesting looking to

509
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:44,269
actually decrease their opioids there

510
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:45,410
are a lot of other differences between

511
00:22:44,269 --> 00:22:47,660
men and women

512
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:50,630
the preferred formulation we find that

513
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:54,620
women not surprisingly don't like really

514
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:57,980
the high THC 30% is high THC but 42

515
00:22:54,619 --> 00:23:00,559
percent 41 42% is a high CBD product so

516
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,339
women for CBD heavy product it may be

517
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:06,200
because they have more inflammation as

518
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:07,759
part of their disease states and it may

519
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:09,529
also be you know some of the minor

520
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:11,180
cannabinoids that we're still analyzing

521
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:13,369
and you know I'll be back to you and

522
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:15,440
that in two years or so the preferred

523
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,839
forms of administration also not

524
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,640
surprising vaporization which is really

525
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,099
very very popular and then is not as

526
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:24,650
popular in women women prefer the

527
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:26,929
sublingual tinctures and they also like

528
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,340
the hard pressed tablets so we see a

529
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:30,320
difference in the types of

530
00:23:28,339 --> 00:23:32,689
administration again I think the women

531
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:36,769
like products that maybe give them an

532
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:40,430
intermediate range of activity it's not

533
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:41,599
so much the the acute effect that you

534
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,070
get with a vape they like the more

535
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:44,859
longer-acting effect again they have

536
00:23:43,069 --> 00:23:47,629
different types of diseases in general

537
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:49,009
so one of the things I just wanted to

538
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,290
point out is you know we have standard

539
00:23:49,009 --> 00:23:53,629
formulations that we've had for a number

540
00:23:51,289 --> 00:23:55,279
of years now but the new things really

541
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,690
are focusing a lot on some of the

542
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:58,910
women's things we've talked about

543
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:01,250
okay suppositories are very important we

544
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:03,320
have pediatric suppositories and adult

545
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:05,869
suppositories to be used directly but we

546
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:07,279
also have vaginal suppositories so you

547
00:24:05,869 --> 00:24:09,319
can see that they're they're shrink

548
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,180
wrapped childproof everything like that

549
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,619
they they're rolled up and put into a

550
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,789
canister and we're going to be launching

551
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:15,500
those very soon

552
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:17,210
in New York and then in all of the other

553
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:19,250
states that were were available and

554
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:22,160
topical lotion as well some people like

555
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:24,079
CBD we believe that a high THC product

556
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:26,000
probably has a lot of utility for pain

557
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,220
as well so we have specially formulated

558
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,380
products and again these can be used for

559
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,299
women who have a lot of eczema who have

560
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,480
some rosacea as we know there are a lot

561
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:37,430
of conditions inflammatory conditions

562
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:40,579
that manifest on the skin so we're very

563
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:42,710
happy that we'll be able to treat women

564
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:44,779
with a lot of these products in the

565
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:46,970
future and again this is you know not

566
00:24:44,779 --> 00:24:48,500
just selling product every patient that

567
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:50,690
we see every patient that we sell

568
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,369
anything to we're tracking them with

569
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,679
their permission to make sure that we

570
00:24:52,369 --> 00:25:05,839
can understand what works for them and

571
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:10,690
what doesn't work for them introduction

572
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:13,819
our next speaker is Professor David

573
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:16,490
nicknamed Eddie Mary he is an assistant

574
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:18,109
professor at the Faculty of biology at

575
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:20,210
the Technion Israel Institute of

576
00:25:18,109 --> 00:25:22,699
Technology a member of the Technion

577
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,769
integrated Cancer Center and the head

578
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,630
investigator for tech neons Laboratory

579
00:25:24,769 --> 00:25:28,639
for cancer biology and cannabinoid based

580
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:31,480
research Mary's lab is one of the

581
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,950
largest cannabinoid based study

582
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:37,339
scientific labs in the world comprised

583
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:38,720
of 45 scientists his lab is regarded as

584
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,789
one of the leading laboratories in the

585
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,069
world that is exceptionally equipped to

586
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:46,000
ask and answer almost any question in

587
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:46,000
the field of medical cannabis

588
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:54,630
thank you very much I'm I think I'm

589
00:25:52,049 --> 00:25:58,109
speaking in many conferences and in

590
00:25:54,630 --> 00:26:00,350
Israel at least twice a week I think I

591
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:03,000
never been in pressure like that after

592
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:05,969
introducing Ethan Rousseau and there

593
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:08,190
wasn't me Rosemarie and I'm thinking

594
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:10,860
women helped I was afraid that Meredith

595
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:13,080
will introduce me he's married 20 years

596
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:18,389
and have and had two girlfriends before

597
00:26:13,079 --> 00:26:25,409
that but this is basically my connection

598
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:29,670
to that I have also two daughters so my

599
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:32,100
lab started as a cancer biology lab when

600
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:35,160
we started three years ago to work on

601
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:37,889
the breast cancer in migration and how

602
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:42,600
it's affecting the ability of cells to

603
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:44,970
migrate and then reading work of

604
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,649
Christine Christine Sanchez that should

605
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,839
be here in the audience and speaking

606
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:52,830
later today

607
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:55,649
we saw that it's also can literally

608
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:57,269
fight the cancer and killed at least in

609
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:59,460
in the plate there is a big difference

610
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:02,940
between killing cells in a play to treat

611
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,069
a person but we saw a connection and

612
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:07,740
then we started to work on breast cancer

613
00:27:05,069 --> 00:27:09,929
and ovarian cancer but in in the five

614
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,000
minutes and I have today I don't want to

615
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:13,769
talk about that first of all because

616
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,109
Christine's speaking later today and

617
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:19,379
then I'm speaking so there will be

618
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:22,319
enough about cancer I want to say that

619
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,510
my lab grew in the last few years to

620
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,879
deal with many many aspects of cannabis

621
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:30,379
I have a know your group in the lab that

622
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:35,580
working on sleep disorders on named

623
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:37,560
Alzheimer on epilepsy have a group that

624
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:40,799
working on autoimmune disease so I have

625
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:43,940
many things and we see that there is a

626
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:47,519
big difference between males and females

627
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:49,710
whether it's mice or whether is people

628
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:51,329
with the questioners and think that we

629
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:53,279
have follow-up there is a huge

630
00:27:51,329 --> 00:27:55,439
difference and when we look on the

631
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,490
endocannabinoid system today my lab have

632
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:00,990
the ability to look on oven in 120

633
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:03,149
endocannabinoid usually people talking

634
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:05,329
about an and amide and to ng but

635
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:08,518
is plenty of endocannabinoids there and

636
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:11,009
also there is many receptors so usually

637
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:14,808
we're talking about cb1 and cb2 but if I

638
00:28:11,009 --> 00:28:18,778
also just gave in an example of GPCR a

639
00:28:14,808 --> 00:28:21,838
18 I think it was so there is a lot at

640
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:23,548
least 30 different receptors and the

641
00:28:21,838 --> 00:28:26,249
difference between male and mew and

642
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:28,558
females on this endocannabinoids are

643
00:28:26,249 --> 00:28:30,868
huge we still don't understand it but

644
00:28:28,558 --> 00:28:35,009
it's huge I want to show a work that we

645
00:28:30,868 --> 00:28:36,658
did with autistic kids we follow up 120

646
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:38,909
autistic kids in Israel that get

647
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:42,028
cannibus autistic kids in Israel that

648
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:45,028
can get cannabis getting high CBD low

649
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:49,499
THC strains we don't want to stone them

650
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:52,950
and also these are very severe autistic

651
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:57,450
kids so these kids very violent usually

652
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:59,598
without even I contact a lot of time

653
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,450
hospitalized because they are violent a

654
00:28:59,598 --> 00:29:04,950
lot of sleep disorders and we saw

655
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:07,288
improvement in many many parameters we

656
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:10,830
saw we checked 32 different parameters

657
00:29:07,288 --> 00:29:13,950
with 82% success in reducing violence

658
00:29:10,829 --> 00:29:16,648
improved sleeping reduce anxiety and

659
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,450
other parameters but when we look on the

660
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:21,928
difference between male and female

661
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:24,359
it was astonished to see that in male

662
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:28,309
it's working perfect but in female it's

663
00:29:24,358 --> 00:29:31,228
almost not working in look we can see

664
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:34,798
habits fifty third percent improvement

665
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:37,169
in male zero in female repetitive

666
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:39,808

667
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:44,759

668
00:29:39,808 --> 00:29:47,038
nine percent in females eye contact 47

669
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:49,739
percent improvement in male zero in in

670
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,440
females so the different are huge and we

671
00:29:49,739 --> 00:29:55,259
don't understand it

672
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,080
okay the opposite so this is another

673
00:29:55,259 --> 00:30:02,308
example from totally different area we

674
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:05,218
are looking here on Alzheimer mice and

675
00:30:02,308 --> 00:30:07,648
we look the green ones are the plaques

676
00:30:05,219 --> 00:30:11,460
that create and cause the Alzheimer and

677
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:14,638
you see that in the control there is a

678
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:15,980
lot of plaques and when we treat with

679
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:19,250
cannabis it

680
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:21,919
in mail we eliminate totally the plaques

681
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:24,500
but in female there is almost no change

682
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:29,059
and you can see here the bars of many

683
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:31,250
others so what I want to say it's I can

684
00:30:29,058 --> 00:30:33,048
bring more and more examples in sleep

685
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:36,640
disorders other things that we are doing

686
00:30:33,048 --> 00:30:39,589
there is huge different between treating

687
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,690
male and female especially with cannabis

688
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:44,629
it's true for many other medicines but

689
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:46,990
in cannabis the difference are huge

690
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,669
especially because of the

691
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,490
endocannabinoid system that express

692
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:54,799
different and at least I don't

693
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,210
understand what is the cause of that and

694
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:58,460
what is the reason and I think there is

695
00:30:56,210 --> 00:31:01,130
a lot of research that need to be done

696
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:03,200
in order to learn how to treat better

697
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:06,140
women's and men's because it's a

698
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:19,039
different type of treatment

699
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:21,049
thank you very much Stephanie karasek

700
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,569
born and raised in the suburbs of

701
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:26,859
Montreal worked as a copywriter in the

702
00:31:23,569 --> 00:31:31,308
corporate world for over 15 years and

703
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:33,798
when she left the corporate world she

704
00:31:31,308 --> 00:31:35,869
decided to she came up the idea for

705
00:31:33,798 --> 00:31:38,900
strain print which she's gonna dive

706
00:31:35,869 --> 00:31:41,239
deeper into she came up with the idea of

707
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:42,769
strain for strain print after her first

708
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:44,870
few months of using medical cannabis

709
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:46,879
when she noticed how little information

710
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:49,548
in scientific validation there was on

711
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,350
various treatments in our spare time

712
00:31:49,548 --> 00:31:54,048
Stephanie enjoys spending time with her

713
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:57,139
family especially her amazing dog Brody

714
00:31:54,048 --> 00:31:58,910
who loves to walk and volunteer as

715
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,130
stephanie weren't the founder of strain

716
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:03,759
print she would be an on-air radio

717
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,760
personality

718
00:32:09,548 --> 00:32:15,379
well first of all I'm incredibly humbled

719
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,419
to be here in this room amongst all of

720
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:20,480
you and on this panel with such an

721
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:23,179
esteemed group of people I'm sorry I'm

722
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,829
incredibly nervous but I'll try and get

723
00:32:23,179 --> 00:32:30,309
through this so why am I here well I'm a

724
00:32:26,829 --> 00:32:34,038
patient first and foremost and I'm also

725
00:32:30,308 --> 00:32:36,259
sort of a serial idea idea person which

726
00:32:34,038 --> 00:32:38,898
is what Meredith was saying I'm always

727
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:41,720
thinking about ways that we can you know

728
00:32:38,898 --> 00:32:46,099
improve things our lives based on

729
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:49,179
different ideas and my introduction to

730
00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:53,028
cannabis came very unexpectedly in 2014

731
00:32:49,179 --> 00:32:54,769
when I was at a very low point in my

732
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:56,720
life I think my life pretty much had

733
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:59,808
been a series of low points up until

734
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,700
that low point since I had lost my

735
00:32:59,808 --> 00:33:06,918
brother in 1978 from leukemia and 35

736
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:11,690
years later I found myself a young mom

737
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:14,899
with two children and I couldn't

738
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,298
function I was paralyzed with fear that

739
00:33:14,898 --> 00:33:19,369
they were going to also die and I went

740
00:33:17,298 --> 00:33:21,619
to see an incredible doctor psychiatrist

741
00:33:19,369 --> 00:33:24,048
who turned me on to the idea of looking

742
00:33:21,619 --> 00:33:26,869
at cannabis because she had seen and

743
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:28,759
read some anecdotal studies on veterans

744
00:33:26,869 --> 00:33:32,178
who were treating their PTSD with

745
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:35,599
cannabis and I was like well okay but

746
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:37,519
she also did mention - it would be more

747
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,548
of an adjunct treatment so that I would

748
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,329
be on a low-dose SSRI as well as trying

749
00:33:40,548 --> 00:33:45,490
cannabis and I'm here to tell you that

750
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:49,099
it changed my life

751
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:52,240
what I started doing was journaling my

752
00:33:49,099 --> 00:33:54,678
experiences with cannabis so I was

753
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:57,288
writing down everything that I was

754
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:58,940
experiencing every time I vaporized so

755
00:33:57,288 --> 00:34:00,859
every time I was trying a different

756
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,470
strain a different dosage different time

757
00:34:00,859 --> 00:34:05,089
of day what was going on and I was

758
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:06,860
chronicling all that and I brought it

759
00:34:05,089 --> 00:34:09,168
back to my physician at my three-month

760
00:34:06,859 --> 00:34:12,889
appointment and I showed in my journal

761
00:34:09,168 --> 00:34:14,960
and his jaw dropped and he he did

762
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:16,970
something that I I heard dr. Sulak

763
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,429
mentioned mentioned yesterday's he asked

764
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,569
me if he could photocopy my journal so

765
00:34:19,429 --> 00:34:21,320
he could show it to some other

766
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:24,559
physicians

767
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:28,580
and some patients of course I said yes

768
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:30,199
please do and further for that I I went

769
00:34:28,579 --> 00:34:32,630
on about a hundred and fifty walks with

770
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:34,329
my dog Brody and I thought there has to

771
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:38,300
be a better idea here there has to be

772
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:40,009
something that I can use make it I think

773
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:42,440
people are inherently lazy and they

774
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:44,750
don't want to document things so I came

775
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,460
up with an idea for an app which is

776
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:50,630
essentially a digital cannabis journal

777
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:53,269
and that's called strain print and at

778
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:55,099
first it is it is meant for a patient's

779
00:34:53,269 --> 00:34:58,309
experience so to be able to capture the

780
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:59,989
the the the treatment as you're

781
00:34:58,309 --> 00:35:03,320
experiencing it in real time

782
00:34:59,989 --> 00:35:05,659
so the app is designed sorry to change I

783
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,650
go sorry I haven't used one of these

784
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:11,690
green button okay got it okay so it is

785
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:14,869
as I said it's a journaling app and it

786
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:17,240
essentially is allowing patients to find

787
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:22,940
out what what works best for them which

788
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:25,119
strains which dosages we are also very

789
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:28,490
fortunate that we're living in Canada

790
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,170
and we have a program called the ACM PR

791
00:35:28,489 --> 00:35:34,189
which is our medical program there and

792
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:36,650
all of the strains that we have our lab

793
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,570
verified and we have a third of those

794
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:40,430
strains have full cannabinoid terpene

795
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,700
breakdowns so when we're collecting this

796
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:46,460
data so first and foremost the patient

797
00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:48,109
is going to be putting in the data into

798
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:50,510
the app it's designed to be very user

799
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:52,940
friendly so we have the patient putting

800
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:54,410
in a very simple setup wizard' they're

801
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,240
gonna fill out which conditions they

802
00:35:54,409 --> 00:35:58,099
suffer from which symptoms they're

803
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,379
treating and it's going to ask a very

804
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,329
simple medical pain scale rating how how

805
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:04,190
bad is your pain now and so what we're

806
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:08,750
going to talk about very briefly is we

807
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:11,090
looked at a sampling of female users who

808
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,960
have tracked at least one session for

809
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:16,370
pelvic pain we have 332 women and PMS

810
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,030
572 women these are these are women who

811
00:36:16,369 --> 00:36:21,739
have indicated their condition as as

812
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,150
being pelvic pain or PMS but they're

813
00:36:21,739 --> 00:36:29,509
also treating for cramps pelvic pain and

814
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:31,280
we also see anxiety in you'll see in a

815
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:34,789
in a further slide comes up very

816
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,739
frequently as well so the this is

817
00:36:34,789 --> 00:36:39,890
as I said it is self-reported and it's

818
00:36:36,739 --> 00:36:41,778
in real-time and we have because most of

819
00:36:39,889 --> 00:36:44,688
the users here are patients here are

820
00:36:41,778 --> 00:36:46,130
Canadian we don't have access to some of

821
00:36:44,688 --> 00:36:47,719
these incredible products that doctor

822
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,160
Massenet was referring to so you're

823
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:51,619
gonna see that the data looks a little

824
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:54,498
bit different but I still think there's

825
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:56,778
something to be gleaned from this we see

826
00:36:54,498 --> 00:36:58,879
that the the women who first of all I do

827
00:36:56,778 --> 00:37:01,188
want to say that we have a fairly even

828
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,979
split of user base 50 percent male 50

829
00:37:01,188 --> 00:37:07,548
percent female but the women are

830
00:37:03,978 --> 00:37:09,498
tracking more so that's an interesting

831
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:12,498
thing so we see here that the women 30

832
00:37:09,498 --> 00:37:15,348
to 39 are more interested in tracking

833
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:19,909
and learning so just a kind of an

834
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:22,239
interesting point we here see try to

835
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:26,108
make the slides look pretty for you guys

836
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:29,269
is that vaporizing is the most common

837
00:37:26,108 --> 00:37:31,639
form of ingestion here in Canada right

838
00:37:29,268 --> 00:37:35,958
now and again this I believe is largely

839
00:37:31,639 --> 00:37:38,179
based on what we have access to so we're

840
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:39,768
gonna see the numbers are probably going

841
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:41,659
to change quite dramatically over the

842
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:44,268
coming months as we as we get more

843
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:45,858
products but oil and then other would be

844
00:37:44,268 --> 00:37:51,129
we have patients that make their own

845
00:37:45,858 --> 00:37:54,188
suppositories and their own topical

846
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:58,189
things as well so that's what other is

847
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:59,958
and we see here that if you look here

848
00:37:58,188 --> 00:38:01,998
the efficacy by the method of ingestion

849
00:37:59,958 --> 00:38:06,168
is that we're seeing that users are

850
00:38:01,998 --> 00:38:08,678
going predominantly for quicker the

851
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:12,018
vaporization is allowing them so quicker

852
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:14,179
relief from their pain whereas I think

853
00:38:12,018 --> 00:38:16,668
they would they would be happier to have

854
00:38:14,179 --> 00:38:19,130
a longer-lasting but we're just we're

855
00:38:16,668 --> 00:38:20,989
still in its embassy there and then I

856
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,130
also wanted to point out here that forty

857
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,108
five percent of these women are

858
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:24,739
reporting that they're also tracking for

859
00:38:24,108 --> 00:38:27,409
anxiety

860
00:38:24,739 --> 00:38:29,059
no big surprise I think you know there's

861
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:31,509
a lot of comorbid conditions and

862
00:38:29,059 --> 00:38:35,659
symptoms that happen because of the pain

863
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:38,449
and these are the strains right now that

864
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:41,239
are coming up as as the highest efficacy

865
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:43,278
now these are just these are just names

866
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:45,499
they're not that meaningful we do have

867
00:38:43,278 --> 00:38:47,358
full cannabinoid inter pain breakdowns

868
00:38:45,498 --> 00:38:48,139
on these strains so we're able to

869
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:51,219
determine that

870
00:38:48,139 --> 00:38:55,059
alpha pi 9 beta carry off Elena's dr.

871
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:58,669
Russo had mentioned limonene and Mersin

872
00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:00,289
seemed to be the common elements in

873
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:04,610
these strains that are giving the most

874
00:39:00,289 --> 00:39:07,639
relief so again it's just in its

875
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:09,349
emphasis we are very very interested in

876
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:11,690
learning more from these patients and

877
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:13,759
hopefully we have a tool right now that

878
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:15,639
is getting better and better and we are

879
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,950
going to allow these patients to

880
00:39:15,639 --> 00:39:21,139
ultimately tell our doctors what's

881
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:25,159
working best for us and help guide and

882
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:36,139
inform medicine that's our goal thank

883
00:39:25,159 --> 00:39:37,879
you very much so I heard the time buzzer

884
00:39:36,139 --> 00:39:40,339
does that mean we have two minutes left

885
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:47,000
for the entire panel yes you have one

886
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:49,160
minute in half well I want to thank Ken

887
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,909
med and the McKiernan Xand Doug Kennedy

888
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:54,469
for allowing us to be here and for

889
00:39:51,909 --> 00:39:56,269
introducing this new session on women's

890
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:58,609
health and cannabis which as I mentioned

891
00:39:56,269 --> 00:40:02,030
impacts about you know could an impact

892
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:04,010
up to 3.8 billion women worldwide so I

893
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,040
really appreciate your support on this

894
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:08,810
and I think given that we only have one

895
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:12,650
minute left

896
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:16,369
I will I will let this gentleman answer

897
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:19,579
ask a question and we have only time for

898
00:40:16,369 --> 00:40:21,289
probably a couple questions go ahead my

899
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:23,659
name is Alan Franklin my local cannabis

900
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:26,269
physician in Santa Monica and the issue

901
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:28,670
I guess primarily for dr. Mesonet and

902
00:40:26,269 --> 00:40:31,190
perhaps dr. Russo it's been my

903
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:33,559
experience by doing some very simple

904
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:37,070
office studies where patients for taking

905
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:39,559
suppositories both THC CBD and different

906
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:41,840
dosing and we measured plasma levels of

907
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:44,719
those cannabinoids which were virtually

908
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:47,090
zero and I know there's a lot of talk

909
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:49,519
about what the absorption is rectally

910
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:52,130
and vaginally and for the most part I'm

911
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:54,440
seeing virtually no absorption which

912
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:57,640
accounts for why these people don't

913
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,639
become psychoactive

914
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:04,309
so I one of the tragedies seriously of

915
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:07,190
the whole cannabis field is that we

916
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:09,530
can't do PK PKS pharmacokinetics it's

917
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,750
looking at blood levels plasma levels

918
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:14,390
over time to see how much actually goes

919
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:16,250
across and you know this is sort of the

920
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:17,659
the thing that you do for every drug

921
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,949
that you're developing you know and

922
00:41:17,659 --> 00:41:21,019
that's so that you know how to dose it

923
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:23,118
and how if it if it should work and if

924
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:24,500
when you should give it again so you

925
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,838
know this has really been been

926
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:31,429
unbelievable that we're not able to do

927
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:33,019
this readily so I I think that this is

928
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:34,818
something that a lot of medicinal

929
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:36,980
chemists and a lot of formulators think

930
00:41:34,818 --> 00:41:38,779
about a lot we need to have products

931
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:40,789
that we know are effective locally we

932
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,349
might not want them to be systemic but

933
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:44,630
we don't have a way to test really for

934
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:46,039
the local effect yet so you know we need

935
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:48,380
to we need to do that we need to

936
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:51,050
standardize things a little more because

937
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:54,019
patients really deserve to be able to

938
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:55,970
take something and know what to expect

939
00:41:54,019 --> 00:41:57,530
and to know when they need to take it

940
00:41:55,969 --> 00:41:59,868
again and know that it's going to be the

941
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:02,359
same the next time they take it so it's

942
00:41:59,869 --> 00:42:05,599
we you know I sympathize we're working

943
00:42:02,358 --> 00:42:07,730
on how to convince the the FDA to let us

944
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:11,260
do that let's have a round of applause

945
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:11,260
for our panel ladies and gentlemen
