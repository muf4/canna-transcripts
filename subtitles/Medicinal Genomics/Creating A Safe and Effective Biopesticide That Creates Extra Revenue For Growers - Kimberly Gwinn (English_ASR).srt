[Music]

2
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:18,839
but could it be something that you know

3
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:20,320
Growers sort of um I mean it' be an

4
00:00:18,839 --> 00:00:23,719
extra Revenue stream for them that they

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,240
could be providing that um that waste

6
00:00:23,719 --> 00:00:29,278
material to to your company or whoever

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:31,598
whoever is going to develop this um turn

8
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:33,600
that into that's the dream yeah the

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,960
dream is to get extra revenue for

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,160
Growers get a safe

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,920
biopesticide uh for

12
00:00:39,159 --> 00:00:45,159
producers and uh you know expand this

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:50,239
because you know if you have something

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:51,959
that is uh naturally broken down by what

15
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:54,599
whatever is in the environment on the

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,520
plant in the soil and that type of thing

17
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,239
that's these natural products are broken

18
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,519
down easily more easily than synthetics

19
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,079
uh and then you so you have something

20
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:05,640
that's environmentally friendly you have

21
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:10,679
something that Growers get an extra

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:13,560
Revenue stream from um and that you know

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,520
and it works so if you have all of those

24
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,439
three things you've got the kind of the

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:21,840
pillars of developing a a a

26
00:01:18,438 --> 00:01:23,959
biopesticide great and so where are we

27
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,478
at in terms of sort of evaluating

28
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,280
whether it works or actually getting to

29
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:30,519
Market so kind of where are you at there

30
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:32,799
well I'm I'm hoping that the interest

31
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:34,519
from cmed will bring people around that

32
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,479
that want to invest in it to be honest

33
00:01:34,519 --> 00:01:41,719
with you uh we would love to see this go

34
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:43,478
into a uh a company and uh develop this

35
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,478
technology so that it could be available

36
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,560
to

37
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:50,718
everyone yeah and so what is sort of

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,159
the how how do you get something like

39
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:57,078
this approved um what are the sort of

40
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:01,159
agencies that dictate that it's a it's

41
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:04,959
EPA and the uh there are are there are

42
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,280
rules for biopesticides for uh

43
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:12,799
developing those that are less stringent

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,439
than um those for synthetics because

45
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,200
most of the those things are natural uh

46
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:20,400
so we would go through the EPA uh we

47
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:22,919
would we would then you know we would

48
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,000
tell them everything that's in ours uh

49
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:28,318
and how it is used and how it's

50
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,318
formulated and then we would uh show

51
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:32,238
them the efficacy because they approve

52
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:35,199
it unless it's going to it's going to

53
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,719
work uh and uh they will do that but

54
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:41,318
they have approved other essential oils

55
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:43,318
like garlic oil uh rosemary oil those

56
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,639
types of things are already approved as

57
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:49,878
biopesticides and some of the same uh

58
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:49,878
Turing are in those as well

59
00:02:54,349 --> 00:03:03,759
