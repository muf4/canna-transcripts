71
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:04,079
this episode's guest is dr deddie miri

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,158
dede runs a lab at the technion israel

73
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,400
institute of technology that

74
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:11,519
investigates the anti-tumor effects of

75
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
cannabinoids more specifically his team

76
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,480
identifies which combination of

77
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,560
cannabinoids can kill cancer cells most

78
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,639
notably his team identified a

79
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
combination of three specific

80
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,679
cannabinoids that kill leukemia cells

81
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,319
and that formulation is currently being

82
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,280
tested in a clinical trial

83
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:33,359
dede is a three-time canmed presenter

84
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,479
most recently he delivered a one-hour

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,799
keynote presentation at canmed 2019

86
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:40,639
where he talks about the work going on

87
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,879
in his lab

88
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,279
i highly recommend watching that in all

89
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:47,518
of dede's presentations not only is the

90
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
information fascinating but daddy has a

91
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,280
very engaging presentation style

92
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,919
if you watch daddy's 2017 presentation

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,318
video you might actually see a cameo

94
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:01,199
from a certain podcast host

95
00:03:58,318 --> 00:04:03,598
at about 30 seconds in

96
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:06,238
anyway daddy and i discussed a number of

97
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:08,560
topics related to his work including the

98
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,920
fact that daddy entered the cannabis

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,000
medicine research space skeptical of its

100
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,839
therapeutic potential and how

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,079
understanding the mechanism of action

102
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,519
for the endocannabinoid system made him

103
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:21,759
a believer

104
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,720
he also talks about how he uses his own

105
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,560
experience being a skeptic to convince

106
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,960
other skeptical physicians and

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,639
non-physicians

108
00:04:28,959 --> 00:04:33,439
he talks about the database that his

109
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,918
team created that tracks all the active

110
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:38,719
compounds in medical cannabis products

111
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:41,279
available in israel as well as which

112
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,280
products are effectively treating the

113
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,679
patient's conditions

114
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:48,159
this unique database allows dede and his

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,319
team to identify which products and

116
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,600
compounds they want to study in more

117
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,680
detail

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,479
we talk about the diversity of cannabis

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,040
chemotypes and the diversity of cancer

120
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:01,120
types and how that combination makes it

121
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,199
nearly impossible for patients to select

122
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,160
the right strain for the right type of

123
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,759
cancer given what we know

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,919
we also talk about whether synthetic

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,160
biology will be used to produce minor

126
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:15,038
cannabinoids at scale

127
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,800
and also the two broad classifications

128
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,560
for cannabis medicine

129
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,199
one for general wellness using whole

130
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,800
plant extracts and another for targeted

131
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,879
treatments using individual compounds

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,879
before we get to my conversation with dr

133
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,918
denny mary i want to thank this

155
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,280
an important contributor to canmed in

156
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,520
the cannabis community for a number of

157
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,559
years now so i'm glad we finally got the

158
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,639
chance to to talk on the podcast

159

so in in preparation for the

160
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,840

161
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,519

the video

166

and in that talk you were very open in

167
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
sharing that you were skeptical when you

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
first started researching medical

169
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
cannabis so i'm curious

170
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:04,079
first what got you started in

171
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,840
researching medical cannabis and second

172
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:09,918
was there a particular moment or a

173
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,918
discovery that made you a believer

174
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,159
so i will start from the first question

175
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,638
i

176
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,520
my background is from plant medicinal

177
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,079
plant biology i did a phd in

178
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:25,038
molecular and genetic plant biology i'm

179
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:26,879
son of agriculture i live in the fields

180
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,360
i was the head of the botanic gardens of

181
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:32,079
tel aviv university and the medicinal

182
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,160
plant a

183
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,279
greenhouse there which is a big

184
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,160
greenhouse and and then i moved

185
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,799
to

186
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,639
my postdoc where i did totally different

187
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,598
their work when i did the

188
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,038
cancer research or you know anti-cancer

189
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,839
properties

190
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:52,079
of different molecules and when i got

191
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:55,878
back to israel and got my own lab i want

192
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:58,878
to create a heterogenic laboratory or

193
00:07:55,879 --> 00:08:01,840
multi-disciplinary laboratory taking my

194
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,960
knowledge from plant to see how

195
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:07,038
it's affecting you know cancer cells

196
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:08,719
and and this is not i'm not a

197
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,959
unfortunately i'm not the one that

198
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,520
invented most of the chemotherapies and

199
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:16,318
the treatments against cancer coming

200
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:19,279
from from plant you know taxol is from

201
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:21,120
paxus bush and the vincrestine

202
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:23,758
vimblastine these are names for the

203
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,800
major chemotherapies are all coming from

204
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:27,280
plants

205
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,520
so i started to to look for plans that i

206
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,878
thought that they have anti-cancer

207
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:33,199
properties

208
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:35,360
and i started to work with a few plants

209
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,278
and one of them was cannabis i saw a

210
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,759
work by manuel guzman and christine

211
00:08:37,278 --> 00:08:41,679
sanchez from spain that show that if you

212
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:44,639
put cannabis on breast cancer or on

213
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,958
glioblastoma every one of them you know

214
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,919
manu guzman work on glioblastoma and

215
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:51,679
christian sanchez on breast cancer show

216
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,159
that if you put the cannabis on them

217
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:56,239
it's a inhibit their ability to migrate

218
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,159
and create metastasis and global

219
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,120
stomachs kill the cells

220
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:04,399
and i started by repeating these

221
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,759
experiments and i was quite

222
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,440
surprised by by the results and quite

223
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:11,120
fast being

224
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
you know it's funny to say that in the

225
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
cannabis

226
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,720
field but become addicted to this plan

227
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:19,278
so

228
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:22,639
it's phenomenal results and now i will

229
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:25,120
answer the second question i started

230
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,039
very skeptical i'm not a user you know

231
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,360
i'm not against it i tried few times i

232
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
didn't like the feeling and

233
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,399
now i have a friend that's saying that i

234
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,000
don't like to do things that i don't

235
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,440
like so

236
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
you know i

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,120
i'm not against i just didn't i don't

238
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,360
like the feeling

239
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,360
and

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,440
and it was kind of a i don't want to say

241
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,639
gimmick because

242
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,399
in dead times in 2014 i it wasn't the

243
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:52,639
hype yet and nobody

244
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,240
it was kind of undercover and the

245
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,159
technique on the institute and working

246
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
they did that really didn't like that

247
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,079
i'm working on that so

248
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,039
but

249
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,800
the first result with were extremely

250
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:08,879
extremely significant and strong

251
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:11,039
in in the first conference that they

252
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:14,480
flied it was in prague

253
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:16,480
you know it was around 90 people

254
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,600
you know it's kind of the founders of

255
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,159
this field you know and they were the

256
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,879
people they just

257
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,838
established chronos and aurora and

258
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:30,078
canopy and kilray you know i remember

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,079
they showed that they are starting to

260
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:34,319
plant in tillery they started to plant

261
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:37,039
like two acres of cannabis and everybody

262
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,160
hold their heads you know like it was

263
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:41,120
like are you crazy something like that

264
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:44,000
yes

265
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,959
and and

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,839
and

267
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,359
i was you know very skeptical i was

268
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,440
sitting there and saying you know

269
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,000
they're for one hand they're showing

270
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,959
that it's make you sleepy for the others

271
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,360
say hey they said it make you alert it's

272
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:02,159
helping diabetes it's helping pain it's

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:05,519
helping maybe epilepsy it's helping

274
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:08,799
psoriasis come on guys like you know

275
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:11,278
be real you're all you know

276
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:13,439
yeah so you're gonna be true

277
00:11:11,278 --> 00:11:14,559
between also understanding how biology

278
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
is working

279
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,879
if it's doing that it won't be able to

280
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,199
do that you know it's the opposite it's

281
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,759
not working

282
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
learning and understanding the

283
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:28,078
endocannabinoid system its role and how

284
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,759
it's operating every cell and how

285
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:33,359
complicated it is

286
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:36,000
explaining why it's reducing pain

287
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,440
affecting sleep reducing increased

288
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
appetite

289
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
affecting the immune system when you

290
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,759
understand the mechanism of action of

291
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,000
the endocannabinoid system then it all

292
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:47,679
makes sense and if you're asking me

293
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,600
what's

294
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:52,879
triggered me or

295
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,879
convinced me about the that everything

296
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,720
that i see or you know a lot of things

297
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,559
that we see is is real

298
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,720
is understanding the mechanism affection

299
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:02,559
of the endocarditis because if you

300
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,959
understand how white is doing that and

301
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,679
how then you believe

302
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:09,199
and and before you asking this the next

303
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:10,879
question you know you give to scientists

304
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,120
to speak you won't stop

305
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,120
so

306
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,480
i'm finding myself give

307
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,120
and i'm not exer exaggerating hundreds

308
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
of talks and a lot of them it's in

309
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,919
hospitals

310
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
and when i'm sitting in front of

311
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,439
the physicians

312
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,958
in the beginning there is the same joke

313
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,880
always did you brought samples

314
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:35,359
everybody's laughing

315
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:38,078
and then and then i'm starting to show

316
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,639
the results and there is always this

317
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:42,319
kind of the stoppingness daddy come on

318
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,839
really you do really think you think

319
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,800
that

320
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:49,680
but when i'm starting to explaining

321
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:51,519
in the highest level of science and that

322
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:54,319
physician can understand

323
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:56,560
why it's working like that which

324
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,720
you know which receptors operate what

325
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,638
which cannabinoid binding what is

326
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,320
happening downstream to that and what is

327
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,320
the mechanism of action

328
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,399
there is always the moment in this talk

329
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,560
and i did hundreds of that and never had

330
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,480
the different

331
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:12,000
something that happened different there

332
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,278
is a moment that they know that i have

333
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,759
them

334
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,120
they got it they understood it's real

335
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:18,639
and from here

336
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,200
it's easy

337
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,120
to collaborate it's easy to start to

338
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,160
engage them to

339
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,799
to prescribe it's easy to engage them

340
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,759
to work and then to give data and and

341
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,919
all and all that there is a logic behind

342
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:37,439
it it's real and

343
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:39,120
for that reason it's easy to explain

344
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,160
that's great and so

345
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,679
what about

346
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:43,278
non-physicians

347
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,599
is there

348
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:47,679
is there something that

349
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,278
when you're speaking with them

350
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:51,439
that you can explain that kind of helps

351
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:55,120
it click if someone who's a

352
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,720
non-clinician is a skeptic

353
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,480
sure again

354
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,040
when you give

355
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,120
something that somebody can connect with

356
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,198
and understand it

357
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,440
then it's become

358
00:14:05,198 --> 00:14:10,958
easier to believe if i will now explain

359
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,120
you one why when you smelling a barbecue

360
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,599
it's increase your appetite and actually

361
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,278
the cannabis is doing exactly the same

362
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,440
he said yeah i know that i'm smelling a

363
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,320
barbecue or you know i'm i'm feeling a

364
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,800
nap

365
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,079
it's increased my appetite or a dish or

366
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:28,319
why i'm eating a dessert after the meal

367
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:31,439
you know when i'm not hungry anymore and

368
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,480
i'm explaining by the evolution what

369
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,160
happened

370
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,079
and why it's happening and why the

371
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:37,759
cannabis just mimic them

372
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:39,278
then you can connect to the teacher i

373
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,519
know that they you know i'm full and

374
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,958
then they bring this you know great

375
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,198
brownies in the

376
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:47,359
restaurant i'm eating that also

377
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:48,159
not make sense you know or things like

378
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,919
that

379
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:52,078
and and and what is the difference

380
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:54,958
between when you

381
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:57,838
you know feel pain why when

382
00:14:54,958 --> 00:15:00,078
our body operates the opioid system we

383
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
have an opioid system in our body

384
00:15:00,078 --> 00:15:04,319
and when it's operate the

385
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:07,279
endocannabinoid system and why now we

386
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,399
can use the cannabis when it's fit to

387
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:12,559
that and you use opioids when it's

388
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,198
not opioid to everything you know right

389
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,439
i i can explain it in in a lot of sense

390
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,919
and and for that reason i think

391
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,399
everybody can connect and and sometimes

392
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,599
it's it's challenging in conferences

393
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,879
that there are physicians scientists you

394
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,360
know

395
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,559
fathers and mothers of a sick child and

396
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,079
a grower

397
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,000
and now you need to

398
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,679
to give the talk that the physician will

399
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,519
admire what you're saying and not say

400
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:39,919
hey this is a lame guy

401
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,959
but also you know the grower and the the

402
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:45,120
father of a child a sick child will

403
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:46,239
understand you too it's it's not an easy

404
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,078
mission but

405
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,480
i must say that i'm enjoying that so

406
00:15:48,078 --> 00:15:53,120
yeah it's a challenge it's certainly a

407
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,278
challenge and again just to plug your

408
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,799
keynote from 2019 i think you do a very

409
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,399
good job of

410
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:00,479
of explaining it for everyone in the

411
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,120
audience so because we do have a diverse

412
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,800
audience at the conference so uh just

413
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,679
another plug for that

414
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,000
i did want to get into talking about

415
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,758
your laboratory because

416
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
i mean at least for me it seems quite

417
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,199
unique

418
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,800
especially comparing it to labs that we

419
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:20,000
have testing labs that we have here in

420
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:23,039
the united united states so is it true

421
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,958
that all cannabis grown in israel goes

422
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:28,319
through your lab

423
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:32,159
yeah i had a i was fortunate to get a

424
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,560
huge amount of money from

425
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:36,559
from a foundation in the state that gave

426
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,078
money for a breakthrough

427
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,599
you know

428
00:16:38,078 --> 00:16:41,758
science

429
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,920
to create the israeli database on

430
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,759
patient and i got

431
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:48,159
five million dollars to create a big

432
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,079
database in academia it's a huge money

433
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:54,958
at least in israel and and what we did

434
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:56,879
um until last year we had just eight

435
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,638
authorized growers that can supply you

436
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,559
know israel

437
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:01,839
in israel we have just medicinal

438
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:03,278
cannabis

439
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,439
medical cannabis we don't have

440
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:07,599
recreation at all and it's under

441
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,839
healthcare from 2007 it's under

442
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,198
healthcare israel is a half social

443
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:13,359
country so

444
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,318
we all have insurance whether it's

445
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,000
dedicated from my salary or the

446
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:20,000
government will pay you if you're not

447
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,919
working you know so we all have

448
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,400
insurance when i'm going to a physician

449
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,799
when i'm going to the hospital i'm not

450
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
paying i already paid you know from my

451
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:29,839
salary

452
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
or the government paid we all been

453
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,319
insured and this is the health care in

454
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,119
new zealand so cannabis

455
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,359
is being prescribed by physician

456
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:42,239
under health care and you get in in

457
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:43,519
pharmacy as a as a prescribed medicine

458
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,440
which is saying

459
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:47,918
that you're paying a fixed price the

460
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,519
government decided which not related to

461
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,080
the amount that you're getting and so on

462
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,918
and so on and it's very simple but it's

463
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:57,599
all under health care so it's very

464
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:58,960
controlled so it's easy every

465
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:01,599
every product

466
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:04,319
need to go through a specific

467
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,798
test in order to be an effective like

468
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:08,960
like every medicine okay so on that

469
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,240
process everything is reaching to my lab

470
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,919
we're examining all the active compounds

471
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,120
and then creating a database with the

472
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,120
pension

473
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:19,678
i can speak about that four or five

474
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:22,000
hours there is something that is saying

475
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,080
in in creating big data garbage in

476
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,319
garbage out and it's a little bit

477
00:18:24,079 --> 00:18:28,798
garbage in because the data that we get

478
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,558
from the patient is very very very

479
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:33,200
problematic in the way

480
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:36,000
being collected and for that reason

481
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:38,558
there are things that we succeed

482
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,279
to recruit from that not in the level

483
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,279
that i i wanted

484
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,319
okay so

485
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:48,240
again comparing that to

486
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:50,079
what we have here in the united states

487
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,679
where multiple different states with

488
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:54,079
multiple different systems some are

489
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,960
medical some are recreational

490
00:18:54,079 --> 00:19:00,079
labs are testing for for some compounds

491
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,919
in one state and not in another um

492
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:03,678
that that's pretty unique that you're

493
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,559
able to put together a database to

494
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:08,480
really start tracking um you know what

495
00:19:06,558 --> 00:19:10,399
types of

496
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,440
what types of cannabis folks are using

497
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,200
for certain conditions and to try to

498
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,600
to actually draw some correlations

499
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,360
between what the active compounds

500
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:20,639
are responsible for the response right

501
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,119
that is the goal

502
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,600
yes so i'm doing kind of a reverse

503
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:27,519
biology first i see what's happened on

504
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,199
the patient then i'm taking it to mice

505
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:31,839
you know it's

506
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,558
it's usually the the opposite so so this

507
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,678
is something that from the beginning

508
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:38,319
was

509
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,880
very unique to me so i started with the

510
00:19:38,319 --> 00:19:42,558
materials that actually patients are

511
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,120
already getting you know when i started

512
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,599
there were 18 000 patients in israel

513
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:49,839
today there are 105

514
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,959
000 so five times more

515
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,959
and and but there was still 18 000

516
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,279
patients that getting these materials i

517
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,360
know it's not toxic but i see that they

518
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,079
killed the cancer cells very efficiently

519
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,719
so

520
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:04,639
when i started usually when you study in

521
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,720
a lab you see something that have a lot

522
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,759
of efficacy and kill the cells

523
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,360
when you will go to mice model and then

524
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:14,240
to humans

525
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:16,479
the first trial and the most

526
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,400
tough one is toxicity

527
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,919
which side effects that you're getting

528
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,840
whether you know it's kill the cancer

529
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:24,720
cell but also kill your liver and your

530
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,720
brain it doesn't help okay there is very

531
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,519
good materials that kill everything you

532
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,079
know

533
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:32,319
you know i'm sure yeah blocking your

534
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:34,240
oxygen will kill the cancer cells you

535
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:36,720
know so but this is not what you're

536
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:38,960
looking but here there was something was

537
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,600
potent is the best chemotherapies that i

538
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,440
have and i know that it's already

539
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,678
patient taking it it's not toxic and

540
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,080
this is extremely unique so on the same

541
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,120
level like i said if i know that this

542
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:50,558
strain

543
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:54,158
causing

544
00:20:50,558 --> 00:20:56,558
67 of the patient to be sleeping to

545
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:59,200
sleep very deep now i can take it to the

546
00:20:56,558 --> 00:21:00,079
lab and starting to examine

547
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,960
which

548
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:05,199
cannabinoids or in which molecules

549
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,600
inside is causing them what is the

550
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,558
mechanism of affection does it cause you

551
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:12,558
to feel sleepy to sleep deep

552
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,839
to be you know which

553
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:17,918
when we're talking about sleep there are

554
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:19,439
different part of the sleep how fast

555
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,080
you're falling asleep

556
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
how deep you you're sleeping you can

557
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,879
fall asleep very fast but wake up every

558
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,440
few minutes right if you're getting this

559
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,720
the rum sleep whether you are it's

560
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:34,480
efficient sleep or not how how

561
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,558
how difficult it is for you to wake up

562
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:39,038
so there is these are being controlled

563
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,279
in different areas of the brain and

564
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:43,038
different types of cannabis affecting

565
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:46,000
different

566
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:48,319
areas or in different part of the sleep

567
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,640
so if you ask just the pension

568
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:53,038
does it help you to sleep you will get

569
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,720
an answer yes or no but you don't know

570
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:56,400
in which part of the sleep it's

571
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
affecting and

572
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,440
and this is taking it to different

573
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
resolution

574
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,080
of questions and answers and fine-tune

575
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,640
which patient should get what

576
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:10,798
okay so we mentioned cancer and i wanted

577
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,400
to get into that because

578
00:22:10,798 --> 00:22:14,558
correct me if i'm wrong but your team

579
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,200
has identified

580
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:19,759
a combination of compounds that are very

581
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,440
efficient at killing very specific types

582
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:25,038
of cancer correct and

583
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,279
i know that's what you presented on in

584
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:29,519
2019 and

585
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,440
have have you been able to identify

586
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,400
other similar formulations or different

587
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,400
ones that can be equally as effective

588
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,960
against other types of cancer

589
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:41,679
yes so i want to take one step backward

590
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,759
and be clear to the audience you know

591
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:46,080
cannabis is not killing cancer and

592
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,679
cannabis is not a treatment to cancer so

593
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,839
you know many people say why to take

594
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,759
chemotherapy i will take cannabis it's

595
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,839
not working that way

596
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,319
cancer is a given name to hundreds of

597
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:59,119
different diseases you know right breast

598
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,359
cancer liver cancer propriety cancer are

599
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:04,479
totally different diseases

600
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:05,519
and what can help on breast cancer can

601
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,200
damage

602
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:09,918
ovarian cancer you know because they

603
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,080
they work differently okay and and the

604
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,320
drug that they're working today on

605
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:17,119
breast cancer let's say tamoxifen is

606
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:19,200
working exactly the opposite on ovarian

607
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:20,959
cancer and people don't understand that

608
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,360
unless your oncologist or something like

609
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,960
that so first of all cancer is the given

610
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,158
name to hundreds of different diseases

611
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:30,798
and in the same type of cancer let's say

612
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:33,600
breast cancer you have hormonal

613
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,960
sensitive hair plus brachii

614
00:23:33,599 --> 00:23:37,199
mutation

615
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:39,840
you have more than 20 different types of

616
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,200
breast cancer so which one cannabis is

617
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:43,599
killing it's

618
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,759
what we call personal medicine and now

619
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,678
we'll go to the cannabis world there are

620
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,960
hundreds and thousands different types

621
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,640
of cannabis

622
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,120
so what is the possibility that you have

623
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,799
a specific types of a breast cancer that

624
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,639
you will take the specific types of

625
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,038
cannabis that really

626
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:03,600
interfere with the pathway of the the

627
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:06,798
cell to to block it and to kill it or to

628
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,278
stop proliferation it's a lottery okay

629
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:10,400
and for that reason without really

630
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,359
knowing

631
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,679
deeply what you're doing it's better

632
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:16,639
sometimes not to do okay

633
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,600
so

634
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,038
what we defined in in my lab and we're

635
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,119
working on

636
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,240
more than 10 different types of cancer

637
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:26,719
but at least

638
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:28,720
in three types of cancer we already

639
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,960
succeeded to understand to screen

640
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,519
hundreds of different

641
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,679
chemo chemoverse of cannabis to describe

642
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,400
one of them or discover one of them that

643
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,480
was very efficient killing the cells

644
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,440
and then for this one

645
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,319
to

646
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,558
er

647
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:46,319
to analyze and to separate and to

648
00:24:44,558 --> 00:24:47,678
understand which molecules which

649
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,480
cannabinoids

650
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,320
is

651
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,558
responsible for the effect i understand

652
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,158
the mechanism of action which receptors

653
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,918
are binding what they are doing in the

654
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,080
cell and why they are keeping these

655
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,960
types of cell with this mutation not the

656
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,359
others

657
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,759
and and we are studying clinical trials

658
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,479
in humans in this indication so

659
00:25:03,759 --> 00:25:09,278
in leukemia specific types of leukemia

660
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,919
in breast cancer and in colon cancer we

661
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:15,119
are having advanced results that we're

662
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,720
already taking to clinical phase

663
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,479
and but this is very specific in

664
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,640
leukemia we're talking about three

665
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,360
molecules in breast cancer it's one

666
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,400
molecule it's a very unique cannabinoid

667
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,639
a little bit similar to cbg but with

668
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,559
different structure into oxygen in the

669
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,880
aromatic

670
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:34,000
so there because there are two oxygens

671
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
there is

672
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,079
less

673
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:40,158
hydrophobic more available whatever it's

674
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:44,240
a unique cannabinoid where the first one

675
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:46,960
to discover and and to analyze it and to

676
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:50,400
understand the structure so what this is

677
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:52,480
what we call minor cannabinoids you know

678
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,880
not always it's minor sometimes they are

679
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,720
stranded in this one they are not minor

680
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,600
we just call them like that because we

681
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,839
don't

682
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:01,599
identify them you know right we don't

683
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:03,599
have standards for them

684
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:05,678
so so yes

685
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:07,439
going to

686
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:10,480
the bottom of your questions

687
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:13,120
in specific types of cancer we already

688
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:15,599
found specific molecules

689
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,558
that affecting these cancer because of

690
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:17,918
their

691
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:19,440
is

692
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,240
special

693
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,400
a phenotype of mutation you know every

694
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,919
cancer have its own

695
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,320
characterism

696
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,919
and so if we define molecules that

697
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,240
affecting these

698
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:34,080
types of cancer now it's very specific

699
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,359
and this one we're starting clinical

700
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:36,798
trials

701
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,199
that's excellent

702
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:40,960
um so going back to the the minor

703
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,120
cannabinoids

704
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
um and you sort of you mentioned that

705
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:46,639
they're considered minor

706
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,798
for one reason because we're not

707
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:51,679
specifically testing for them but are

708
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:53,679
they also in very low concentrations in

709
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,000
in the plant

710
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:59,038
not always so you know first of all i in

711
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,319
my lab we divide them as major medium

712
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:04,000
and minor

713
00:27:00,319 --> 00:27:07,200
so majority states in cbd maybe also cbg

714
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,359
you know we see strains of 20 cbg

715
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:11,440
already so it's not minor

716
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:14,079
and i i just came back from the state

717
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,278
and i saw that in california and in also

718
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,639
new york there are strengths of 20 cbg

719
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:20,640
in israel i'm

720
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,399
familiar with that in in the last few

721
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,759
years so

722
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,398
um

723
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,558
so 20 is not minor for sure

724
00:27:26,398 --> 00:27:32,239
and then there are the the what we call

725
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:35,519
the medium one which is cbc and cbn and

726
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,759
thcv and cbdv so usually you can find

727
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,200
strains with a two three percent of

728
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,200
these

729
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,360
cannabinoids but they already saw

730
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:49,120
strains of 13 14 percent etv and 30 14

731
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:50,558
cbdv so these are kind of medium okay

732
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:52,158
and then there are the minor

733
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:55,119
cannabinoids they are probably

734
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:58,240
degradation of the major in the medium

735
00:27:55,119 --> 00:28:00,639
or or a specific cannabinoid that

736
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:01,599
usually you're not finding them

737
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,000
more than

738
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:06,558
0.5 or something like that in the

739
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,679
flowers and in this we called miner

740
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:11,599
and we found out that sometimes

741
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,038
they are extremely important so

742
00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:15,119
sometimes they are more important than

743
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:17,759
the usual ones and then when you're

744
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:20,398
taking them isolating them or creating

745
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:23,119
strains with high percentage of them

746
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,398
they are very very efficient in specific

747
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,599
indication

748
00:28:24,398 --> 00:28:30,719
and you know this is this is our you

749
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:33,199
know claim of fame so this is what i'm

750
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:36,240
focusing on it doesn't mean the thc and

751
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,919
cbd and cbg are not important

752
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,120
but the rest of the world doing that so

753
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,559
i'm looking on on the special one that

754
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:46,319
that i can see in other notes so this is

755
00:28:44,558 --> 00:28:48,798
this is the reason it's not the theaters

756
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,480
even in cbg are not important and again

757
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,798
when i'm finding

758
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,319
you know amazing results with cbg i will

759
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:59,119
go with that

760
00:28:54,319 --> 00:29:00,639
and but i'm quite upset when it stays

761
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:02,879
and it is the case sometimes that they

762
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:06,399
are involved in sort of the combinations

763
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,600
of course of course of course now

764
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:09,599
now given the fact that some of these

765
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:12,398
minor cannabinoids that are you know in

766
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:14,879
relatively low concentrations could be

767
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,319
very important in these treatments i'm

768
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,640
curious what are your thoughts on

769
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:21,519
synthetic biology like creating some of

770
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,440
these cannabinoids through yeast or

771
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:25,278
things like that as a way to

772
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,240
you know make more of these than the

773
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:30,480
plant is is typically producing

774
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,720
so first of all i don't find an

775
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,960
advantage by

776
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:35,839
[Music]

777
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:38,480
creating the yeasts or creating them

778
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:39,759
synthetically in the lab

779
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,159
so

780
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:44,640
in the plant there is the entourage

781
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,640
effect and something that you're getting

782
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,278
and we can speak about that

783
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,600
later if you want to but but there is

784
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:53,839
a bunch of of cannabinoids going

785
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,398
together if you look on high cbd strain

786
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:58,158
there is a portfolio of cannabinoids and

787
00:29:56,398 --> 00:30:01,359
terpenoids that will go with that if you

788
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,640
look in high thc and when you are

789
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:07,678
you know taking an extract or using a

790
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,960
vipering or viping or smoking cannabis

791
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,960
you're getting

792
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,519
these whole complex

793
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,759
there are there is plus and minus in

794
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,759
there

795
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,240
if you're taking an isolate cannabinoids

796
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,038
or

797
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,399
so i don't find a difference between

798
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:29,278
isolate from yeast or either or make it

799
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:31,439
synthetic isolate and purify that

800
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:34,480
it's quite of the quite the same then

801
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:37,120
you know to ask what is the advantage of

802
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,000
of creating that initial in bacteria on

803
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,319
that

804
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:43,278
but basically i i think that we will

805
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,119
find out in few years from now

806
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:47,519
different types of of medicine that

807
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:49,759
coming out from cannabis

808
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:53,519
one of them is

809
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,359
whole extract when people using for

810
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,079
you know

811
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:58,959
for

812
00:30:56,079 --> 00:31:01,038
not occasional but but for quality of

813
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,440
life improving quality of life and

814
00:31:01,038 --> 00:31:05,359
wellness okay because you're taking the

815
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:08,320
whole extract and it's a little bit help

816
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:11,278
you with sleep with pain with a mood

817
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:12,639
with a you know appetite you're getting

818
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,240
a variety of

819
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,640
of effects

820
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,519
that affecting your quality of life

821
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,880
which

822
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:20,640
each one of them it's a different

823
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,640
combination of molecules that you have

824
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:24,559
in the whole extract and there is a

825
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,720
benefit of that instead of taking five

826
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,079
drugs you're taking cannabis and doing a

827
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:30,079
little bit here a little bit there and

828
00:31:28,079 --> 00:31:31,759
you're getting something

829
00:31:30,079 --> 00:31:34,240
and you're improving your quality of

830
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:36,720
life and and i totally i think that

831
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,440
80 percent or even more of the pension

832
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,360
that getting today cannabis and also in

833
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,759
the recreational you know we can argue

834
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:46,240
if recreation it's not part of

835
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,839
healthcare or part of improv if it's

836
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,359
improving your quality of life if you

837
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,000
are very

838
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,599
angry and and you have anxiety and now

839
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,599
using in the evening and you're smoking

840
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:56,719
cannabis being relaxed

841
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:59,599
does it

842
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,759
does it medicinal or does it react

843
00:31:59,599 --> 00:32:03,839
you know

844
00:32:01,759 --> 00:32:05,759
it's a big question but in general i

845
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,759
think that eight eighty five percent of

846
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:10,000
the user using that

847
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,079
quality of life and wellness

848
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,640
and the other fifteen percent using it

849
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:18,319
is to treat specific indications like

850
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,679
epilepsy or what we spoke now cancer

851
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:23,759
and and maybe other indications and i

852
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:26,159
think for this one we will be much more

853
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:30,398
accurate it will be specific combination

854
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:33,120
of cannabinoids or specific molecules

855
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,678
that might be from the plant but might

856
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:37,239
be also from yeast or synthetic i don't

857
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,960
see if you're already

858
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:43,519
purifying them and using as purified

859
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,079
for my point of view i don't see a big

860
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,079
difference

861
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:50,480
no and that's such an important point is

862
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,720
is kind of talking about the two

863
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,798
different ways you can use cannabis one

864
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,720
for general wellness and one for you

865
00:32:54,798 --> 00:32:58,879
know treating very specific conditions

866
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,038
that you're looking for um with your

867
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,159
team so i think sometimes in the

868
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:04,079
industry

869
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,960
kind of becomes an either or is it you

870
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,038
know is big pharma going to come in and

871
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,278
sort of take over cannabis or should it

872
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,119
stay um

873
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:14,960
you know kind of like it is now with

874
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:16,879
whole plant extracts and you know the

875
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:18,319
benefits of the entourage effect and it

876
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,278
sounds like there's really a space for

877
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:21,439
both

878
00:33:19,278 --> 00:33:23,519
i i think i think there is facebook for

879
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
both and we need both so so you know

880
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,079
when you have a child with leukemia and

881
00:33:25,839 --> 00:33:29,599
you have a six with tl and you have six

882
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:30,960
months to live

883
00:33:29,599 --> 00:33:32,639
i don't think that

884
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,240
either of us want to play games with

885
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,000
that okay you need to give them the

886
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,960
treatment the most obvious treatment

887
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,398
that you can give to save his life and

888
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,880
and if

889
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:44,479
and i don't care and i don't i care for

890
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120
the child i don't care about the

891
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,599
industry in that point okay

892
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:51,678
save the child and i think if you have

893
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:54,079
accurate molecule that you know exactly

894
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:56,000
the the dosage and how to give it that

895
00:33:54,079 --> 00:33:58,398
you need to go the direction

896
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,319
and you know i have four kids and then

897
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:03,278
also a lot of friends i don't think that

898
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:05,839
any of us will play now with a you know

899
00:34:03,278 --> 00:34:07,759
herbal plant so let's see an entourage

900
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,199
if again i don't know what there is you

901
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,559
know we'll go

902
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:12,480
with the physician

903
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,320
on the other hand

904
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,960
when you want to treat something that is

905
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,519
more general you have now

906
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,639
suffered from ptsd which is problem with

907
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:23,679
anxiety

908
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,800
and the problem of sleep and mood

909
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,320
and other things that

910
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,200
cannabis give

911
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,639
a treatment with is more complete

912
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:37,519
and and you don't need now to to kill a

913
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,159
cell you don't need to to to stop

914
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:41,759
something very accurate you need

915
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,679
something more general you know what i

916
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,520
will i will give you a different example

917
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,240
as i like to that

918
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,480
i started to see in israel more and more

919
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:53,358
you know ordinary people

920
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:55,440
my parents are 85 years old

921
00:34:53,358 --> 00:34:58,159
and they are already you know suffering

922
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:00,639
from what older people are suffering a

923
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:03,279
little bit pains more even than a little

924
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,960
bit okay they don't fall asleep

925
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,760
very well

926
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:09,519
they know what the meaning of 85 you

927
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,119
know they're probably even when you're

928
00:35:09,519 --> 00:35:14,239
singing them until 120 it's not a lot

929
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:18,559
so

930
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:20,719
you know it's a mood and

931
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,239
my mother don't have too much appetite

932
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,919
anymore

933
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:26,559
and

934
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,599
now she's taking cannabis high cbd

935
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,759
strain

936
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,320
she's sleeping better she's eating

937
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,960
better she's feeling better

938
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,800
she is have less pains

939
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:38,960
nothing critical it's not like taking

940
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,320
opioids that the pain is disappearing

941
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,320
but you reduce

942
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,720
two levels down

943
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,640
and you improve all the quality of life

944
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:50,879
so instead of taking a meals of pills

945
00:35:48,639 --> 00:35:52,400
that every one of them also create a

946
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,760
different damage and then you're taking

947
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
a pill for that damage and then you're

948
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:57,359
taking deal

949
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,598
she's taking few drops of cannabis and

950
00:35:57,358 --> 00:36:01,199
this is really helping and i don't think

951
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,760
that in that term

952
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,279
we will be isolate cannabinoids or

953
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,839
molecules because you're talking about

954
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,359
variety of things that happened there

955
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:10,880
but now

956
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,199
six days ago

957
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,358
some girls entered to my lab she's a

958
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,279
friend of a colleague said this next

959
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:19,838
slab to me and said daddy you must help

960
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,119
her she came she's suffering from

961
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,279
insomnia

962
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,280
she had a treatment of cancer from

963
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,240
chemotherapy in this schemata because

964
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:31,280
her insomnia in the last five years she

965
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:32,959
can't sleep more than 15 minutes

966
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,480
okay

967
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,960
pretty woman lovely woman everything

968
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,920
she's a professor whatever she can't

969
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,480
sleep the she don't have she just want

970
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:46,960
she just asking one thing

971
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:49,519
help me to sleep now it's not pain no no

972
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,838
no no it's one thing help me to sleep

973
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:53,440
so now i want to come with the big

974
00:36:51,838 --> 00:36:55,679
cannons

975
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,119
whether from cannabis or not to help

976
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,399
heroin sleep i don't need the old

977
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:01,680
variety

978
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,200
what is the best molecule so the best

979
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,039
combination

980
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:07,279
that will cause her to fall asleep and

981
00:37:05,039 --> 00:37:09,679
not wake up for four hours

982
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:13,200
and if i can create it

983
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:15,199
i prefer to create it in in in if i need

984
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,279
two molecules from this strain and one

985
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,118
molecules from that trend maybe a

986
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,560
molecule from

987
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,640
algae i don't care maybe it's

988
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:25,440
combination from one place i want to

989
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:26,400
help her and i think that we will find

990
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,480
out

991
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,559
more and more complicated medicine this

992
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,000
is a different you know a branch that

993
00:37:30,559 --> 00:37:34,159
i'm opening here

994
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,119
of things to help this kind of patient

995
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,838
which is

996
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,400
treating very accurate in cannabis they

997
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:41,838
can be give the best in example is

998
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,480
epilepsy

999
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:47,119
you know kids with epilepsy 80 seizures

1000
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:48,000
a day don't have life you know they

1001
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,280
can't

1002
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,838
operate

1003
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,280
if you just stop the the the

1004
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:56,799
the seizures

1005
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,200
now they're coming back to normal life

1006
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,920
so it might be one compound maybe it's

1007
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:04,239
the cbd like gw head or something like

1008
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,000
that if you're blocking that that's it

1009
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:07,759
you don't need

1010
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,679
the whole package

1011
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,000
so i think that you will find that we

1012
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,879
will find out in few years

1013
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,800
that the pharma company really

1014
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,720
swallowing this kind of thing when it's

1015
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,800
one compound two compounds for a

1016
00:38:18,719 --> 00:38:22,639
specific indication

1017
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,039
but the majority

1018
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,078
will stay with the whole plant

1019
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,679
yeah

1020
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:30,079
no and that's such a it's such an

1021
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:31,598
interesting approach too is you know you

1022
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:33,200
have a condition you start treating it

1023
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,680
with cannabis and it's sort of this like

1024
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:38,239
shotgun approach right you're you're

1025
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:40,000
getting a lot of different compounds

1026
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:41,838
and if you find a strain that works for

1027
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,400
you then you can really start to kind of

1028
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,559
narrow it down right okay what compounds

1029
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,639
are in this strain and can we start

1030
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:51,358
isolating it down and narrowing it down

1031
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,879
to just a select few and you know and

1032
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:55,519
it's great that you guys can do that in

1033
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,320
israel with with your database and again

1034
00:38:55,519 --> 00:38:58,079
i i

1035
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:00,800
i come back to the united states i mean

1036
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,200
we have 3.6 million medical cannabis

1037
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,359
users here in the united states i

1038
00:39:03,199 --> 00:39:09,199
imagine if if you could get your hands

1039
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:11,358
on on that data how much how much more

1040
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:13,679
could we learn about you know what

1041
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:15,598
cannabis can be used to treat other

1042
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:18,239
conditions

1043
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,400
so so the problem is the other side when

1044
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,358
somebody say cannabis today you know

1045
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,838
this has helped me to

1046
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,639
to treat the

1047
00:39:25,838 --> 00:39:31,119
parkinson's disease what do you mean i

1048
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,159
took cannabis it's it's meaningless to

1049
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:35,280
me

1050
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:38,480
so somebody's calling me from

1051
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,519
you know from boston a few weeks ago

1052
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:42,400
you know

1053
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:45,039
with connection he he found out that

1054
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,920
they asked me to speak with him said

1055
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:48,880
look

1056
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,200
i used i tried many types of cannabis

1057
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,960
and now i find one that really helps my

1058
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:54,559
father with parkinson

1059
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,480
it's meanless to me

1060
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:58,078
who cares what the name of this cannabis

1061
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
i don't know what are the cannabinoids i

1062
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,320
know do the dosage i want to reach

1063
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,318
unless i will get it here and and

1064
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,400
examine it and start to work with it i

1065
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:08,480
can do that but i can't get it here

1066
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,800
right from boston unless i'm going with

1067
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,039
the suitcase and you know

1068
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,440
and become criminal so i think the

1069
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,159
regulation is still blocking that

1070
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,000
right the database that and i did it in

1071
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:22,838
the past from canada and from the state

1072
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,679
the database that i'm getting is almost

1073
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:27,279
meaningless and you know we publish i

1074
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:28,239
will give you an example we published a

1075
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,079
paper

1076
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:32,479
a few weeks ago i think it's four weeks

1077
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:34,880
ago about the difference of

1078
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
sex

1079
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,838
you know gender sorry not sex okay

1080
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:42,879
and we know from our database

1081
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,960
that

1082
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:48,640
women's have way more side effects

1083
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,599
they're saying that they have more side

1084
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:51,598
effects

1085
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,119
and also they are using sometimes

1086
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,880
different strains there are strains of

1087
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,318
just male using the strains of just

1088
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,960
women using

1089
00:40:56,318 --> 00:41:00,880
and we thought that this the reason

1090
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,639
there is more side effect is whether

1091
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,640
they're using a different strains that

1092
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:05,519
have more side effects

1093
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,920
or

1094
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:09,679
it's something related hormonally you

1095
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,200
know to estrogen progesterone

1096
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,719
testosterone whatever that are

1097
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,559
difference between

1098
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,559
and because

1099
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,719
we have the ability today to check the

1100
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,960
endocannabinoid system very deeply we

1101
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:22,519
can look on 38 different receptors and

1102
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,559
150

1103
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:26,400
endocannabinoids in the blood samples

1104
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,639
and also can analyze all the

1105
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:31,920
cannabinoids what they're getting we did

1106
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:34,239
a clinical trial on 200 patients

1107
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:36,480
around it was a little bit less than 200

1108
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:38,799
it was around 160 it was something like

1109
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,679
90 males and 70 winners

1110
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,560
and

1111
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:44,480
first of all this was a pain patient

1112
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:46,799
neuropathic pain patients so first of

1113
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
all we look how many patients using

1114
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
cannabis we took neuropathic pension

1115
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,440
that using cannabis said that it's

1116
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:55,679
helped them this was a criteria okay

1117
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:57,358
and then we started to to check

1118
00:41:55,679 --> 00:42:00,000
how much it's helped them we find out

1119
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:02,000
that women and men describe that it's

1120
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,159
the same on the effect of reducing

1121
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,480
neuropathic pain okay

1122
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,879
and then we ask okay what about the

1123
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,079
negative side effects that you have

1124
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,400
and women had a way more

1125
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,480
than men's almost men's almost didn't

1126
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
have side effects and then

1127
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,440
you're asking the woman

1128
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,559
okay

1129
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,639
how

1130
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:24,559
you saying that these strengths cause

1131
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:27,759
you dizziness okay

1132
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:30,719
how much how many times in

1133
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,400
in a month you feel dizziness so first

1134
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,919
of all she said what does the uh are you

1135
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,079
asking do you have a negative effect

1136
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,159
yeah this could strain cause me

1137
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,160
dizziness dizziness it's writing

1138
00:42:38,159 --> 00:42:42,838
terminology you know when your head is

1139
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,399
turning right

1140
00:42:42,838 --> 00:42:45,599
so

1141
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,280
so you are

1142
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,440
she said yes i have i'm suffering from

1143
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:53,760
this side effect it's it's happened a

1144
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,838
lot you said okay how many times amounts

1145
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,319
you feel business you said

1146
00:42:55,838 --> 00:43:00,000
four times a month okay now you're going

1147
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:01,599
to the males that using the same

1148
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,519
strength said

1149
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:05,280
does it help you for pain yes it reduce

1150
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:06,880
pain do you have a negative side effect

1151
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:08,640
no i don't have negative side effect i

1152
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,559
really like the strain

1153
00:43:08,639 --> 00:43:12,719
do you have dizziness you ever done

1154
00:43:10,559 --> 00:43:15,039
feeling this yes a little bit how many

1155
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,118
times a month four times a month the

1156
00:43:15,039 --> 00:43:18,880
number is the same number yeah and this

1157
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:21,200
is the problem of the the data if you're

1158
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,358
not getting deep and you don't ask the

1159
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:24,960
right question you're getting wrong

1160
00:43:23,358 --> 00:43:26,719
answers

1161
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,039
and that's what we find out in the

1162
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:30,719
database sometimes if you're not going

1163
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:31,440
deeper you're getting different answers

1164
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,318
so

1165
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,720
these

1166
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,239
actually work show that there is no

1167
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,399
difference in the side effect it's

1168
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:40,078
exactly the same the same strains

1169
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,880
causing the same side effects in women

1170
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,599
and men's lifting what we checked

1171
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,200
but if you don't ask it in the right way

1172
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:48,559
you are falling

1173
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,000
and failing

1174
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,400
okay so

1175
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,318
so this is part of this

1176
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,559
so i want to come back just for a second

1177
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,800
what you said about

1178
00:43:56,559 --> 00:44:01,039
having this ability from the database

1179
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,240
the doctor-based giver you give you just

1180
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,960
in a hint

1181
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:07,838
or a clue where to start looking

1182
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,880
but from there in the last six years we

1183
00:44:07,838 --> 00:44:12,000
develop

1184
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,240
abilities to do extractions in many

1185
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,679
different types of extraction butane co2

1186
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:19,279
super critical you know a press whatever

1187
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,159
to learn what are the differences and

1188
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,240
then to analyze all the active compounds

1189
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,000
all the cannabinoids flavinoids

1190
00:44:24,239 --> 00:44:27,919
supernovas and it's different machine

1191
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,559
different abilities okay

1192
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:33,119
then we develop method to screen

1193
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,440
on many different

1194
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:38,318
indications or diseases

1195
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,440
usually a scientist is focusing on on

1196
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:41,679
one thing

1197
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,318
you know my supervisor for my phd said

1198
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:45,919
that a an expert is somebody that know

1199
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,279
everything about nothing

1200
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,480
so usually you are expert for a you know

1201
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,800
specific types of cells in the heart

1202
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:57,199
and and this is how labs usually look at

1203
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,960
the academia because of the cannabis

1204
00:44:57,199 --> 00:45:01,199
because of the variety

1205
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:03,760
my lab started to do cancer but then

1206
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:06,639
said okay it's also working on epilepsy

1207
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,560
let's let's have you know a mice model

1208
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:10,719
for epilepsy and for alzheimer's sleep

1209
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:14,559
disorder multiple sclerosis screen

1210
00:45:10,719 --> 00:45:16,399
disorders a autoimmune disease

1211
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,559
and in the end i said just a moment in

1212
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,720
order to look on medicinal plants you

1213
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:22,799
know now there is also a hype

1214
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,358
on a a

1215
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:26,960
psychedelic mushroom or whatever

1216
00:45:25,358 --> 00:45:28,400
so i thought about that you know four

1217
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,960
years ago i said this is not just

1218
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,400
cannabis this is medicinal plant

1219
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,480
so we create

1220
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:40,559
in 20 models for diseases that we can

1221
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,039
screen very fast so i'm doing extraction

1222
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:46,318
analyze the active compounds screen it

1223
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,960
on 20 different diseases every types of

1224
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:51,039
cannabis or mushrooms or whatever

1225
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,639
see where i see the effect where i see

1226
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,679
something unique

1227
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,679
that no

1228
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:57,440
other plant or no other strands is doing

1229
00:45:55,679 --> 00:46:00,639
when i've defined it

1230
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,240
i know to separate to analyze the active

1231
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,039
component these are different machines

1232
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,439
okay that can separate it and analyze

1233
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,880
separate and define which molecules with

1234
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:10,639
what are the combination of the

1235
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,519
molecules they're doing this effect

1236
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:15,838
whether this is one three seven i can i

1237
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:16,800
can narrow it down very efficiently

1238
00:46:15,838 --> 00:46:19,199
today

1239
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:21,599
after i narrow it down i can ask okay

1240
00:46:19,199 --> 00:46:22,960
why and what these molecules are doing

1241
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,960
to the cells and to the mice and

1242
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,480
whatever okay which receptors are

1243
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,800
binding what they are doing so

1244
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,358
understanding the mechanism of action

1245
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,359
and when i have all these circles now

1246
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,519
i'm ready to convince the physician to

1247
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:38,318
do a clinical trials i have the

1248
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,639
molecules i understand i can go to a

1249
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:42,400
clinical trials with the whole extract

1250
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:44,799
which i know that i have the right

1251
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,000
combination inside and this is

1252
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,880
medical cannabis i can go on the farm

1253
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,519
away

1254
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,519
purified compounds fda

1255
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:56,318
and usually i'm doing that parallel

1256
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:59,280
there is advantage to both of them so if

1257
00:46:56,318 --> 00:47:01,199
i'm if i'm closing what i achieved or

1258
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:02,599
what that we have

1259
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:05,759
i have in my lab

1260
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:07,838
38 people to death 38 scientists and i

1261
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,079
have a company called kennesaw they have

1262
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,358
around 45 scientists there so all

1263
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,720
together we're around 80 90 scientists

1264
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:15,838
that can take

1265
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:17,598
a plant

1266
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:19,599
whether it's cannabis or other plants

1267
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,720
we're working with algae mushrooms and

1268
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:23,359
cannabis

1269
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:25,358
and to go all the route analyzing all

1270
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,279
the active components we call it

1271
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:29,119
metabolomics first of all doing

1272
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,200
extraction different way

1273
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:34,960
analyze the active compound define the

1274
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,799
effect on on on cells or mice

1275
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,559
understand the mechanism of action doing

1276
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,960
preclinical in mice and take it to

1277
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:44,079
clinical and this is

1278
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,159
i i think it's a it's open a huge window

1279
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,039
to a different approach of medicinal

1280
00:47:46,159 --> 00:47:52,480
plants that are more complicated

1281
00:47:49,039 --> 00:47:54,639
than single molecule single and you know

1282
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:57,280
target

1283
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:59,118
absolutely fascinating um i do want to

1284
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,440
be mindful of your time daddy and i

1285
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:03,039
thank you again for taking the time um

1286
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,960
but before i let you go i want to give

1287
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,480
you an opportunity to

1288
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,519
share any

1289
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:10,960
um any websites any social media

1290
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,318
anything that you want to get out there

1291
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:14,559
to share with the audience so that they

1292
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,599
can stay in touch with you or stay up

1293
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:18,559
on the work that you're doing

1294
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:20,400
so

1295
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:23,040
you know i'm a scientist i'm professor

1296
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,599
in the university there is site for the

1297
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,599
lab put my name and you find it at the

1298
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,039
technion i have a

1299
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:33,359
company called canaso and council have

1300
00:48:31,039 --> 00:48:35,199
the lab there is a synergism between

1301
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:37,519
what we are doing in the lab and cancel

1302
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:40,399
actually where one big group

1303
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:42,400
that they doing rnd and trying to

1304
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,960
understand

1305
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,920
which compound and how these components

1306
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:51,280
which plant and how they are working and

1307
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:53,440
to define the things that can help

1308
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:56,079
us to live better

1309
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,920
and to you know smile

1310
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:00,318
i have two goals first of all when we're

1311
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:03,200
coming to work me and my workers that we

1312
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:05,599
will come with a smile and second when

1313
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:09,679
patients are getting to hospitals or

1314
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:12,480
sick we'll smile more so this is two

1315
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:14,879
two projects work together and then

1316
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,318
meanwhile it's working very well so

1317
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,599
yeah no that sounds like a great

1318
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:19,679
approach

1319
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:23,440
thanks again for the time daddy um i

1320
00:49:19,679 --> 00:49:26,639
hope to see you out at canmed um in 2022

1321
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,400
and and many more to come

1322
00:49:26,639 --> 00:49:30,558
thank you very much for having me it's

1323
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:32,480
always a pleasure i

1324
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,119
you know i'm i'm waiting

1325
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,440
and that

1326
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,000
these conferences will open again you

1327
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,760
know i just came back from after a year

1328
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,358
and a half that i didn't fly i came back

1329
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:46,480
from a touring in

1330
00:49:43,358 --> 00:49:49,920
in new york so the skies is open

1331
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,800
life is coming back i hope to normal and

1332
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:56,000
i hope to see you face to face soon

1333
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:03,519
all right looking forward to it okay bye

1334

[Music]

1335
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,159
i hope you enjoyed my conversation with

1336
00:50:05,519 --> 00:50:09,599
dr daddy mary please check out the links

1337
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:11,920
in the show description to learn more

1338
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,318
about the topics we discussed and thanks
