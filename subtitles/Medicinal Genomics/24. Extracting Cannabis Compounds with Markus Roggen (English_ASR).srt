on this episode i had the pleasure of

55
00:02:00,718 --> 00:02:06,399
discussing the chemistry of cannabis

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,759
with dr marcus rogen in his various

57
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,399
roles and positions

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,560
marcus oversaw multiple teams that are

59
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,120
focused on the whole processing flow

60
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,920
of cannabis production from harvest and

61
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
drying

62
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:20,559
through processing and extraction all

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,200
the way to the formulation in quality

64
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,840
control

65
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:24,719
analytics the topics we discussed

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,400
include

67
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:28,400
the number of compounds that have been

68
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,560
identified in the cannabis plant

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,800
and whether there are more to be found

70
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,640
the complexity of cannabis compared to

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,200
other plants and herbs

72
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:38,079
the challenges with the entourage effect

73
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,159
could there be

74
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,560
invisible compounds that are responsible

75
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,479
for certain therapeutic effects

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,759
how different storage conditions and

77
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:48,639
extraction techniques

78
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,598
will yield different chemical compounds

79
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:53,598
and why the term

80
00:02:49,598 --> 00:02:55,598
whole plant extract is a misnomer

81
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:57,839
but before we get to that conversation i

82
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,399
do want to thank this episode's sponsor

with dr marcus rogan

112
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,959
good afternoon marcus thanks for joining

113
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,798
us

114
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
uh good afternoon thank you for having

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,879
me all right i'm excited to talk with

116
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,520
you today because i know that your

117
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:28,560
your area of expertise is extraction and

118
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,758
we haven't had an

119
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,519
extraction expert on the podcast yet so

120
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
i'm excited to talk with you about that

121
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,240
but because you are our first

122
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,520
extraction expert i was hoping we could

123
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,759
start with the basics

124
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:46,000
so could you explain the general concept

125
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
of extracting compounds from cannabis

126
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:51,519
sure yeah it's nice uh to be called an

127
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
extraction expert so

128
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,839
i'm a chemist by background actually an

129
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:57,120
organic chemist so i learned how to make

130
00:04:55,839 --> 00:05:00,319
molecules

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,360
and then in the cannabis industry i

132
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:05,360
found my niche in extraction

133
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,800
i hope that we can speak about some of

134
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,879
the other topics

135
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,639
that we're working on as well but so

136
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:13,600
extraction

137
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,879
um extraction in the cannabis industry

138
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,919
comes from the desire

139
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,918
of of making

140
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,560
or turning good part of cannabis and

141
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
good is a discussion we can have in a

142
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,478
moment

143
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,960
into other products than just joints

144
00:05:30,478 --> 00:05:34,959
so then comes the question how do you

145
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:38,000
remove the cannabinoids

146
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,399
the the good part so to say from the

147
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,560
rest of the material of the plant that

148
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:43,758
you don't want like cell walls

149
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,478
chlorophyll

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,759
fats and waxes as they like to be called

151
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:51,439
fiber

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
and you can do that in various

153
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:54,639
or there might be various forms to do

154
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:57,679
that

155
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,759
um and extraction is the common and most

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,199
efficient way to do so

157
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,479
so extraction in the chemical sense

158
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,840
means you are dissolving

159
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:13,279
compounds of interest in your

160
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:16,399
solvent or in a liquid

161
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:19,439
and remove them from

162
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:24,079
the matrix or the undesirable aspect

163
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,839
of your material so

164
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:27,839
it might also help to think about what

165
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,198
extraction is not

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:34,239
and keeping ice water hash

167
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,600
and razon press is not an extraction

168
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,879
because that is a mechanical

169
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,520
manipulation

170
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,879
either by pressure or mechanical

171
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:44,318
agitation

172
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,759
um you're not using a solvent to pull

173
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,800
out the cannabinoids

174
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,000
so extraction would therefore be co2

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,560
extraction

176
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:56,399
butane uh or alcohol extraction

177
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,560
okay and so what are the benefits of

178
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,879
using a solvent

179
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,160
versus doing sort of those mechanical

180
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,639
operations like you had

181
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,680
just mentioned yeah so in a mechanical

182
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,038
operation

183
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,199
uh you have very little selectivity or

184
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,478
specificity of what you're doing

185
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,000
you are just hoping that

186
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:20,240
you can break off the compounds you like

187
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,759
and leave behind what you don't like and

188
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,879
then somehow all

189
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,000
separate them through a filter

190
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:32,000
uh and it work that works quite

191
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,839
nicely with with cannabis because most

192
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,839
of the cannabinoids are in trichomes and

193
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:37,598
they are smaller than the leaves so you

194
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,719
could filter them off

195
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,759
but in if you use a solvent

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,720
for extraction you can choose your

197
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:47,520
solvent specifically to do the job you

198
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,360
want

199
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,120
you pick a solvent that dissolves your

200
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,720
compound of interest but does not

201
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
dissolve the rest

202
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,319
so there isn't water extraction of

203
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,079
cannabis because cannabinoids do not

204
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,240
dissolve in water

205
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:04,399
so one picked another solvent and there

206
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,439
comes butane

207
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:09,758
a very a polar solvent aliphatic solvent

208
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,399
that is very good in

209
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
dissolving terpenes and pretty good and

210
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:16,638
extract

211
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:19,439
in dissolving cannabinoids but not good

212
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,319
or not at all compatible in dissolving

213
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:23,360
water

214
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:27,840
or other very polar compounds

215
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:31,038
in the cannabis plant and then ethanol

216
00:08:27,839 --> 00:08:32,478
again very very good and dissolving

217
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:34,958
cannabinoids

218
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,158
good and dissolving terpenes but because

219
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,559
it is a polar solvent

220
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:40,240
can also dissolve other compounds that

221
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:43,278
might not be desirable

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,240
like sugar for example sugars can

223
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,240
dissolve in ethanol

224
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,639
and then co2 is a more varied solvent

225
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,159
where you can

226
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:57,439
try to play with conditions to

227
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,759
change its solvent capabilities

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,959
to fine-tune for different compounds but

229
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:03,039
basically

230
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:05,278
extraction allows you to pick a solvent

231
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:08,719
and pick extraction conditions

232
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:12,240
to to target your compounds of interest

233
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:14,879
and leave behind what you don't want

234
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,000
okay so it sounds like different

235
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,000
solvents are

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,399
are good for different parts of the

237
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,320
plant so how do you go about really

238
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,839
being selective of which one did you use

239
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,120
is it a bit of a trade-off game

240
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,720
in terms of which solvent you use yes it

241
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,919
is always the trade-off game

242
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:35,680
um so far

243
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,519
and it's getting better in the last few

244
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:40,239
years but but i've been now

245
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,200
in the cannabis industry for a few years

246
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,560
um

247
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,519
i think i started in 2014 uh which makes

248
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,479
me ancient

249
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,039
in in in this industry although there

250
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,240
were

251
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:55,759
a lot of grades before me

252
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,759
and they're still around so

253
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,639
in the cannabis industry what often

254
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:05,039
happened was

255
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,240
you picked a solvent and then you built

256
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:09,199
your

257
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,200
your operation around it that was either

258
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,720
because of beliefs

259
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,560
um public interest or

260
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,639
um regulations

261
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:23,039
i got my start in extraction and a

262
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,120
company that was in an area

263
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:26,078
where the only solvent allowed was co2

264
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,440
so

265
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:32,879
i became an expert in co2 extraction

266
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:37,120
not because co2 was what i picked

267
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:40,799
initially it was just forced up on me

268
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,240
and uh so you can also say oh butane is

269
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:46,319
the one that gives you the best

270
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,360
flavor so people pick butane

271
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,879
but a better approach which as i said

272
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,720
is slowly now taking over the industry

273
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,278
one should consider the inputs and the

274
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,040
outputs so for outputs is what do you

275
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:00,320
what is the product you desire to make

276
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,759
if you are making

277
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,760
a cbd isolate

278
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:10,719
you just need the highest recovery

279
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:11,200
of cbd and the fastest right you don't

280
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,360
think

281
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,278
about further precision because you will

282
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,879
purify afterwards anyway so

283
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:21,360
just through a lot of material

284
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:22,958
if you're thinking about vape cartridges

285
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,600
you're not thinking okay how do i

286
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:26,559
how do i customize my solvent system to

287
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,440
make the product

288
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:31,759
that i want and then there are also

289
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,600
inhalables adaptable products

290
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:38,240
which have other product requirements

291
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
or ingredients for edibles but then on

292
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
the other hand

293
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:44,000
you also have the inputs so what

294
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,399
materials do you have do you only have

295
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
20 kilos of cannabis flower from an

296
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:50,078
indoor grower every month that you have

297
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,519
to go through

298
00:11:50,078 --> 00:11:55,838
or do you have 200 acres

299
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:57,278
of hemp that you have there where you

300
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:59,760
have one harvest

301
00:11:57,278 --> 00:12:02,000
in all in autumn and you have to run

302
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:04,559
through that very quickly

303
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,639
uh so all these aspects you have to

304
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,078
balance to find the best

305
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:12,240
system for extraction so i'm curious

306
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,919
with that with that ladder example if

307
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,200
you did have sort of this

308
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:20,799
one large batch um you know

309
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:23,040
one large harvest would the strategy be

310
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:24,159
to you know pick one method and go

311
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,439
through it all or could you have

312
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:28,159
multiple different methods

313
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,600
that kind of target different compounds

314
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,480
within that harvest and then you can

315
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,759
kind of

316
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,680
join them together after the fact so

317
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:38,639
do you mean splitting the the harvest

318
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:42,159
into three product streams or going

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,000
uh through three

320
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:45,439
consecutive extractions with three

321
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,159
different solvents

322
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,160
for all of the material i was more

323
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,399
thinking to split it up so like say

324
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,159
okay okay yeah so splitting up so

325
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,360
splitting up might actually be a

326
00:12:54,159 --> 00:13:02,639
good idea um because you have to balance

327
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,039
um speed precision and echo and

328
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,399
just business economics because if you

329
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:10,000
build an extraction

330
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,679
facility that can handle all of the

331
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,440
harvest

332
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:18,319
within a month you have a facility that

333
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,760
doesn't do anything for 11 months

334
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,839
so that's a very very expensive

335
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,838
facility that doesn't do much work

336
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,600
uh so you don't actually want to have

337
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,919
the opportunity or

338
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,720
if you could build a full assembly very

339
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,719
very cheap that can handle that size

340
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,320
then that might be an option so if you

341
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,680
take a really really big bucket of

342
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,079
ethanol

343
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,399
you could extract the whole harvest in

344
00:13:42,078 --> 00:13:47,838
one dip

345
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,679
and a bucket isn't that expensive

346
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,680
does that make sense so yes maybe you

347
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:53,679
split it so you would have something

348
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:55,759
uh that goes through your materia uh

349
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,479
some of your material very quickly

350
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:59,519
uh like ethanol uh you could have

351
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:04,320
something

352
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,799
that handles non-dried material

353
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,560
well so that you can do fresh harvested

354
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,799
and directly do the extraction without

355
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:12,638
having to invest in drying capacity

356
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:14,479
which would be a butane or a hydrocarbon

357
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:17,839
extraction system

358
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,120
and then you could consider of having a

359
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,800
co2

360
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,039
setup which would

361
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,078
target to get through its allotted

362
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:28,559
material

363
00:14:26,078 --> 00:14:29,120
over the course of a whole year so that

364
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:32,719
you're

365
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,440
very expensive instrumentation of co2 um

366
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,360
doesn't need to be so large that no one

367
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,040
can finance that anymore

368
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
but that would allow you to have

369
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,039
constant uh

370
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,559
production of material uh to a certain

371
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:46,639
level of precision

372
00:14:44,559 --> 00:14:48,799
uh so yes it would be a very interesting

373
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,680
setup and uh i would like to help with

374
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:52,639
that

375
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:53,198
but there comes something else into that

376
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
um

377
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,198
the question of drying and preservation

378
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,839
of

379
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:01,519
cannabis or hemp material for extended

380
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:05,040
time

381
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:06,959
and so that's where my my general

382
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,759
research interest

383
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:11,599
didn't stop just that extraction as a

384
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,000
chemist i was thinking what

385
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,639
else is chemistry related in cannabis

386
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,919
that is

387
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,600
attached or influenced by

388
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:23,439
extraction and so we have been doing

389
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,440
research into drying and curing

390
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
and storage of cannabis uh with

391
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,680
different

392
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:32,799
drying or freezing methods

393
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,599
uh storage under various gases to

394
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:37,758
to affect terpenes and cannabinoids uh

395
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,040
consistency over time

396
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:42,000
uh so that they are either quickly

397
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:45,278
handled

398
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,159
or safely stored for extended time

399
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:50,240
so that they could then uh go into the

400
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:52,159
stream of co2 extraction half a year

401
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,360
after harvest

402
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:57,600
wow that's interesting so

403
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,720
i mean it sounds like there's there's a

404
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,440
lot of different methods to do

405
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,800
extraction

406
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,800
and then of course there's a lot of

407
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,599
different compounds in the cannabis

408
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,758
plant

409
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,360
is it possible to really get a full

410
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,320
spectrum

411
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,360
extraction or tincture or is that sort

412
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,360
of a misnomer

413
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:21,359
i would i would say it is um

414
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,159
i mentioned i termed this i just said

415
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,560
good

416
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,719
something good um and we can discuss

417
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,679
about good so we also have to discuss

418
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,560
about the question

419
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,278
what is full spectrum if full spectrum

420
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,919
means

421
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:35,600
everything of the cannabis plant you

422
00:16:33,919 --> 00:16:37,278
can't use an extract because by

423
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,959
definition you left something behind

424
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:40,320
right there's no chlorophyll that there

425
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:42,638
aren't any leaves

426
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,920
there are no cell walls so it can't be

427
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:49,198
full spectrum because that is gone

428
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:51,360
so do you now define full spectrum as

429
00:16:49,198 --> 00:16:52,719
all of the cannabinoids and all of the

430
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,560
terpenes

431
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
but what a because you test for those

432
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,518
but you don't test for all cannabinoids

433
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,560
and all terpenes

434
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,560
and what about flavonoids and sugars and

435
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:04,078
carotenes and we know that those are

436
00:17:02,559 --> 00:17:08,000
around and they might have

437
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:10,879
some value flavor or medical or both

438
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
so how do you defel for a de fine full

439
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,600
spectrum

440
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:18,559
or is full spectrum just as

441
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,119
the opposite of isolated so full

442
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:23,199
spectrum

443
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:25,279
is not cbd isolate although

444
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,038
when you want to separate yourself from

445
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:31,038
a full spectrum from anything isolated

446
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:33,200
one of the most common method to isolate

447
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:36,720
is distillation

448
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:40,240
so how can you have a full spectrum ice

449
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,038
distillate i'm not kidding you can

450
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,000
buy full spectrum distillates on the

451
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,798
market

452
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,880
that's an oxymoron it doesn't make any

453
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:50,480
sense to me

454
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
so i pitched the question back to you

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:56,000
what is full spectrum

456
00:17:53,119 --> 00:17:57,439
well i mean i i guess i can't define

457
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,960
that but i know that

458
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,558
at least the reason why people are

459
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,000
interested in full spectrum

460
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:03,839
is this whole idea of the entourage

461
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,759
effect right that there are

462
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:07,839
multiple compounds within the cannabis

463
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:10,160
plant that are

464
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,959
in some combination contributing to this

465
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,600
medicinal

466
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,279
effect that so many people benefit from

467
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,719
so

468
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,798
i think that's the reason why people are

469
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,000
so interested in full spectrum

470
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,319
um but what does that involve i think

471
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
that

472
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,839
i'm gonna throw that back to you and

473
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
because i know that you've done a lot of

474
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,639
work

475
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,720
in cataloging the various compounds that

476
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,919
are within cannabis so

477
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,919
what what do we know so far sure

478
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,919
okay so that that's a multi-step assay

479
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,919
it's a it's an entourage answer right

480
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,160
multiple aspects work together to give

481
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,480
the fuller picture

482
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:49,519
so first i'm a chemist and not a

483
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:52,079
medical or biological bioli biology

484
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:55,839
practitioner so i don't actually know

485
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:58,399
what molecules do with the human body

486
00:18:55,839 --> 00:19:01,119
i just ensure that those molecules are

487
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,120
there or not

488
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:08,399
but i then don't know what the effect is

489
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:10,558
so yes i understand the the public

490
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,679
perception of entourage means

491
00:19:10,558 --> 00:19:17,599
there are multiple compounds uh

492
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,240
that act either together

493
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:22,079
or independently on various systems and

494
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,880
then these com

495
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:28,000
over all activity in the body leads to

496
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
the desired effect

497
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,960
and that might be true but another

498
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:35,599
explanation i could have for entourage

499
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:39,519
effect

500
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:42,079
is similar to the full spectrum

501
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,639
something works we just don't know which

502
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,240
one and it might be a minor cannabinoid

503
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,679
that no one tests for

504
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:52,558
and it's just super active

505
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,600
that we only see thc in it as the main

506
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:55,519
ingredient

507
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:57,759
but this low concentration other

508
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,639
cannabinoid actually does all the work

509
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,038
and work by uh professor mary who you

510
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,960
had on the show

511
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:10,400
does point to that interpretation

512
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,240
in its spec particular area

513
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
so it's either multiple compounds do

514
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,519
multiple things or it is one compound

515
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:16,720
that no one tests for the but that does

516
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:19,599
all the work

517
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,159
um and i'm not saying which one is right

518
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:22,719
i

519
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,080
leave that to the experts in the field

520
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,839
although if you want to find that one

521
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:26,720
that does all the work uh i might be

522
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,079
able to help right

523
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:32,000
we can recognize we can find stuff um

524
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,279
then the next question is which

525
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,079
compounds are there

526
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:37,359
and uh that then comes to another

527
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,558
interest

528
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:44,079
that came out of of our research

529
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:48,558
uh push that we wanted to

530
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:52,158
somehow catalog and have a centralized

531
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:54,558
verified trustable source

532
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:57,840
that gives all the cannab all the

533
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:57,839
compounds that are in cannabis

534
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:04,879
if you start googling information

535
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:08,559
for uh cannabinoids you often

536
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,000
fall onto websites like reddit leafly

537
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:15,599
uh wikipedia and

538
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,319
those information are all

539
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:20,079
that is first you can't really find all

540
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:23,359
the information you want and

541
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:27,199
some of or many of the information is is

542
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,639
wrongly repeated um one of the things i

543
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,360
see a lot

544
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,080
is the melting the boiling point of thc

545
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:36,798
being 155 degrees

546
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,519
which is correct based on the primary

547
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:40,000
literature

548
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,798
where that was characterized the problem

549
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,599
is in the car

550
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:44,960
and in the primary literature i think it

551
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,918
was paper by michelin

552
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,720
it actually says it's 155 to 157 degrees

553
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,640
celsius

554
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,200
at reduced pressure they did the

555
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,840
distillation on the vacuum

556
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:56,798
so if you only give the temperature and

557
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:58,959
not the pressure

558
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:00,720
everyone assumes that at room room

559
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,640
pressure and you wonder why it never

560
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,360
boils because if you would translate

561
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,840
that into

562
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:08,240
room pressure conditions it would be a

563
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,399
burning point of 425 degrees

564
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,319
and i'm even wondering if at that point

565
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:16,080
thc just decomposes and

566
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:20,000
just like dies

567
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:23,038
so by having

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,880
incomplete and imprecise and often wrong

569
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:25,359
information interdispersed through the

570
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,000
web

571
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:29,119
we thought it would be useful to try to

572
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
build a database

573
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:32,798
that tracks all compounds that are known

574
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,360
to the cannabis plant

575
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:37,038
and have them in one database we started

576
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,319
that in-house so that we could

577
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:42,000
just do our research better

578
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:44,079
but later we thought it might be of

579
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,159
interest to other people outside of our

580
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:50,000
company and so we

581
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:52,240
built a website for it that

582
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,079
then allows everyone to search through

583
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,400
and so we

584
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:57,918
the database is incomplete there are

585
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,960
always new compounds found

586
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,880
and not all physical and chemical

587
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,840
aspects of the compounds are known

588
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
because they might have

589
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:08,480
only been identified in small quantities

590
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,640
so that no one really measured that

591
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
but we're trying to add to that with

592
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
literature that we find

593
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
with research from collaborators and our

594
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,960
own research so over time this database

595
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,279
will just grow

596
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,159
and i think the next upgrade we are

597
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,158
planning

598
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:24,000
so we initially had all the compounds we

599
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,000
had them in categories like cannabinoids

600
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,798
and terpenes and flavonoids and so on

601
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,480
and then we added a physical com

602
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:32,798
physical aspects we could find melting

603
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,079
point boiling point viscosity

604
00:23:32,798 --> 00:23:38,440
uh density and so on and so forth

605
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:40,960
and now we are looking at adding

606
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:42,000
spectroscopical data so what is the

607
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
right lc

608
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,558
or gc method to look for the compounds

609
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,120
at what time would they elude

610
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,079
how does an nmr and ir spectra look of

611
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,839
those compounds

612
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,439
so that and then either allows you to

613
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:54,879
build your own methods to look for the

614
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,840
compounds or to

615
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,520
to interpret the spectra you're looking

616
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:02,399
at right now

617
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:03,599
so we're slowly bringing that out and um

618
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,159
it's kind of a

619
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:07,839
project i had in my mind for a long time

620
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,000
um and i just

621
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,879
hope now that other people see the value

622
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,599
in it

623
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,720
um and i'm learning new things like

624
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:18,158
databases

625
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,558
and user

626
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,080
user interactions with websites like

627
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:23,119
things that as a chemist i never had to

628
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:25,278
think about now i

629
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,119
know i play with that well that's one of

630
00:24:25,278 --> 00:24:27,839
the the perks of being in the cannabis

631
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,079
industry

632
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:31,278
you get to wear many hats and take on a

633
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,158
lot of things you never thought you'd

634
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:37,359
get into

635
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:40,640
uh i know that yes i study chemistry to

636
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:41,439
not have to go into a law career that my

637
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,640
father

638
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,320
uh wished for me my father's a lawyer

639
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,840
so i studied chemistry it's like pattern

640
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,278
lawyer i was like no no i'm not doing

641
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,639
that so i want to be a chemist

642
00:24:49,278 --> 00:24:54,480
and i end up in canada uh cannabis and

643
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
one of the main things i have to deal

644
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:00,558
with is regulations and rules and

645
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,080
uh and and the law um my company is in

646
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,000
canada because

647
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:07,278
in canada it's federally legal and i'm

648
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,480
allowed to do research

649
00:25:07,278 --> 00:25:11,519
by a federal agency and i can do it in

650
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,919
collaboration

651
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:15,359
with a federally funded university

652
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,159
because

653
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:18,558
which cannabis company can afford an nmr

654
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,240
so

655
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,759
we're doing it with the university so

656
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,798
that we have access to those

657
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:28,319
instrumentation and uh

658
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:31,519
yeah i have to deal with law now uh

659
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,678
and a very very excited puppy uh

660
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:35,278
that is just coming back from a walk so

661
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,240
uh please excuse the

662
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:39,440
the tip tipping feet uh noise in the

663
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,480
background

664
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,000
of course um so i i wanted to

665
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,519
come back to that cannabis compound

666
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,599
database i mean that seems like

667
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,720
a tremendous resource for the community

668
00:25:47,599 --> 00:25:52,240
so how many

669
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:56,000
how many compounds are we up to uh

670
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,880
we are above 750 i think i hope that

671
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,038
a update soon will bring us over the 800

672
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,799
compounds

673
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:07,359
we have over 200 terpenes uh

674
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:10,400
we are around 80 cannabinoids i know

675
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:14,079
there are over 140 already known but

676
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:17,120
often they are just just a

677
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:18,639
letter combination and

678
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:20,479
they don't even have a physical

679
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,759
description so if i can't really draw

680
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,079
the compound we haven't

681
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:26,798
added them yet so we were slowly trying

682
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,599
to bring those in as well

683
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,319
flavonoids we have a few we also track

684
00:26:29,599 --> 00:26:32,158
sugars

685
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:33,839
that are known to the cannabis plant and

686
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:37,120
should be of interest to track

687
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:38,240
um we have even some proteins and

688
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,678
minerals in there that

689
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:44,960
might actually be of interest for some

690
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,278
practitioner in the industry so over 800

691
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,880
compounds how does that compare to

692
00:26:47,278 --> 00:26:50,880
other herbs or plants

693
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:55,519
yeah um actually if a few years back at

694
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:57,359
the canals conference i saw a

695
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,119
very good description of about the

696
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,038
complicate or like a visual

697
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,399
description or about the complexity of

698
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:05,839
the cannabis plant versus

699
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,440
other agricultural plants and it was a

700
00:27:05,839 --> 00:27:10,480
mass spectrum

701
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,519
uh trace of uh

702
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,720
of a cannabis extract versus i think it

703
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:18,319
was a rosemary

704
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,319
extract and

705
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,798
it was basically a forest the extract of

706
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,159
cannabis was just a forest there's

707
00:27:22,798 --> 00:27:28,158
so many compounds uh that

708
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,440
i fully understand that people go with

709
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,679
uh they like

710
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,080
uh the term full spectrum because

711
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:36,880
defining this spectrum is

712
00:27:34,079 --> 00:27:36,879
so difficult

713
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,319
if you have a cannabis plant that has

714
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:44,879
well we have 80 and

715
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:46,839
in our database but there are over 140

716
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:50,480
cannabinoids known

717
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:51,759
uh and all of them are potentially

718
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,440
medically active

719
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:59,119
or biologically active um that just

720
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:02,000
blows most other plants out of uh

721
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:04,479
out of the water we actually talking

722
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,640
about plants there are also other

723
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,919
organisms that are of medical interest

724
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:12,320
like mushrooms

725
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,559
um our company recently uh got a

726
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:16,720
a license to research psilocybin

727
00:28:14,558 --> 00:28:20,000
mushroom compounds and

728
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:21,759
there are less tryptamines one has to

729
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,880
deal with than cannabinoids

730
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:26,240
so even compared to mushrooms it's much

731
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,760
easier

732
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,679
oh mushrooms are much easier than

733
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:32,158
cannabis right

734
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,519
no and this whole idea of that you know

735
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,200
there are these

736
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:36,879
many different cannabinoids in trace

737
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,558
amounts and they still

738
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,559
will may have a medicinal benefit

739
00:28:40,558 --> 00:28:43,918
is very true i mean we've seen it time

740
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:46,079
and time again where people have

741
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,000
presented at canmed

742
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:52,158
of using thc in much lower doses

743
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,679
in getting a better medicinal effect so

744
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,720
one would stand to reason that there

745
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,440
could be other

746
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,319
cannabinoids in the plant that we're not

747
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,880
testing for

748
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,158
that are in small amounts but you know

749
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,360
really pack a punch

750
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:09,520
so that's interesting i

751
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:11,119
i i do actually in my time

752
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:12,960
in california when i work for a

753
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,278
vertically graded cannabis

754
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,360
company and i headed the extraction

755
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:21,440
formulation aspect

756
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:25,599
we also had a dispensary on site

757
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:28,798
and we had a we had a mother

758
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:33,119
coming by for an a male

759
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:36,240
adult patient um he was suffering from

760
00:29:33,119 --> 00:29:40,158
adult onset epilepsy

761
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,880
and she was looking for a treatment as

762
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,840
the

763
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:44,880
the common uh classic medical solution

764
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:48,158
hadn't helped

765
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,039
so she wanted to try cannabis and uh

766
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,278
she after some discussion with her so

767
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,480
again i'm not a medical doctor like

768
00:29:53,278 --> 00:29:57,759
i i could guard what i understand and

769
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,319
guide her towards

770
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:05,679
medical help but eventually

771
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:09,359
the mother took home for the patient

772
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:11,919
a tincture of thc cbd one to one

773
00:30:09,359 --> 00:30:12,639
no wait it was a three to one cbd thc

774
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,559
tincture

775
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:19,600
i think yeah and she took that home

776
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:23,119
and the patient uh

777
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,398
got immediate relief um it went down

778
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,599
from

779
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:29,519
nine seizures a day to zero for the next

780
00:30:27,599 --> 00:30:32,959
two months

781
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,000
and after two months the the tincture is

782
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,000
running out

783
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,200
the mother comes back and buys more of

784
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,599
this three to one cbd thc tincture

785
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,480
and starting the new tincture

786
00:30:43,599 --> 00:30:47,678
the patient starts to show epileptic

787
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,880
seizures again

788
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,798
they're back she uses the rest of the

789
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,840
first tincture

790
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:56,639
and they're gone again it's a three to

791
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:00,319
one

792
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:03,038
cbd thc tincture and we tested both

793
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:04,960
again on the same day we send it off to

794
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:06,158
a testing map and we got the test back

795
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,240
it was

796
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:12,399
uh cbd thc three to one as it should be

797
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,079
there was the same amount of thc acid in

798
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:17,199
there there was the same amount of

799
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:20,558
cbd acid nothing in there

800
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,120
um cbn both nothing

801
00:31:20,558 --> 00:31:24,158
uh cbc more or less the same

802
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:27,038
concentration

803
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,240
between the two and basically the test

804
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,879
results were

805
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,880
very effectively identical of what we

806
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,000
could see

807
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:38,480
uh because unbeknown to anyone else in

808
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,398
the company except the formulation team

809
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,519
uh we make these tinctures uh with cbd

810
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,719
isolate

811
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:50,079
plus thc extract from

812
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,079
our co2 machine

813
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:58,240
and we used to use

814
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:59,039
diamond og for the thc part of that

815
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,200
tincture

816
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,038
and at some point that oil had run out

817
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,679
so we switched to the next cultivar

818
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,879
which was

819
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:08,880
a sour diesel or girl scout cookie

820
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,960
but we formulated to the exact same

821
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:18,079
concentrations of cbd and thc

822
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,038
so by that it doesn't matter

823
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,439
and in both cases you could call our see

824
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,319
a

825
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,278
thc extract from the co2 machine full

826
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,678
spectrum

827
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:29,119
so we have a full spectrum they're

828
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,960
different full spectrums but they're

829
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,278
full spectrum extracts

830
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,880
with the same amount of thc and cvd in

831
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,839
there and the patient

832
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:42,240
ex shows completely different effects

833
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,918
and to our test results they are

834
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,120
identical

835
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,080
so yeah there's something else

836
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:50,879
that that is of importance but we don't

837
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:54,079
know

838
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,278
and and this this this annoyed the hell

839
00:32:54,079 --> 00:32:58,639
out of me

840
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:59,679
because i have full control over the

841
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,720
extraction

842
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:06,240
i full control over the

843
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,440
uh the formulation i have control over

844
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,640
the testing lab

845
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,200
or that i send it to a testing lab

846
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:15,600
but i don't actually have any control i

847
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,200
don't know what i'm doing

848
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:20,480
and and this like question like what

849
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,759
else is in there

850
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:27,440
how do you affect that um

851
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:30,240
that just neg it was just

852
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:31,120
so annoying that i had to leave sunny

853
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,798
california

854
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:34,798
and move to rainy vancouver

855
00:33:35,759 --> 00:33:40,158
yeah i can imagine that would be

856
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,558
frustrating and i have to imagine that

857
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,240
it must be quite the task to even try to

858
00:33:42,558 --> 00:33:45,599
begin to tease that out

859
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,679
given the fact that i mean you've

860
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:50,319
identified over 800 compounds

861
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:51,440
in the plant how do you even begin to

862
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:54,240
start

863
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
um trying to determine which compounds

864
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,519
are doing what in

865
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,278
in what combination too that adds a

866
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,079
whole another layer

867
00:33:59,278 --> 00:34:03,200
yeah so it is definitely something i

868
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:06,480
can't solve

869
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,878
right um and that is that is the best

870
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,918
advertisement tech line on a podcast i

871
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,480
can't do it

872
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,440
uh you need a community like a canmed

873
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,079
community yes

874
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:17,760
yes the point is that it has to be a

875
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:19,760
collaborative effort

876
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:21,119
um actually one of the founding

877
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,399
principles of

878
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:28,000
our company is fundamental collaboration

879
00:34:24,398 --> 00:34:30,638
and yes i'm a chemist and i've now have

880
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:33,838
my expertise in extraction

881
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,720
but we work with university research

882
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,559
groups

883
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,838
that are focused on computational

884
00:34:36,559 --> 00:34:43,358
chemistry

885
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:44,480
on metabolomics so analytical chemistry

886
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,878
we have collaborations with

887
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:51,358
pharmacologists formulation science the

888
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:54,398
school of pharmacy so that

889
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:56,398
if we just go through this example

890
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:58,078
we have the skills to do full

891
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:01,279
metabolomic workup to

892
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,839
figure out like every minute mass that

893
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,839
comes out

894
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,400
then one can figure out from the mass

895
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,680
and the breakdown of those

896
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,200
ions what the structure could be compare

897
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,239
that to databases

898
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:18,319
hence our database

899
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,159
we have the access to nmr to actually

900
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,160
identify the compounds if it's something

901
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:25,039
new if we isolate it

902
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:26,078
we have computational teams that we have

903
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:28,719
working models

904
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,000
to dock cannabinoids and terpenes to

905
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,480
various receptors

906
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,280
and predict their binding affinity which

907
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,679
would give an indication of how

908
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,320
strong or not strong there might be a

909
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:42,159
medical effect

910
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
then we have pharmacologists with which

911
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,358
we can work on like

912
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:50,719
thinking about some some actual in

913
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:52,319
vitro studies in vivos sorry in vivo

914
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,078
studies

915
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,000
and and then we have the school of

916
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:58,000
pharmacy right there we might have

917
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,440
access to mass models or at least like

918
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,719
skin permeability

919
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,960
pigskin to just see how this

920
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,239
actually absorbs for the formulation

921
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,960
aspect

922
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:09,439
these are all things that only work in a

923
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,039
team

924
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:16,320
only work in a collaborative effort

925
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,279
excellent um so yeah it sounds like you

926
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:20,559
have a lot

927
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:21,119
going on there at your company um talk a

928
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:22,880
bit more we

929
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,720
we talked about the compound database we

930
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,119
talked about extraction what else

931
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:29,679
in psilocybin testing as well what what

932
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,519
else are you guys working on

933
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:33,039
yeah so before you get into society

934
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:36,320
which is now the new cannabis

935
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,639
thing uh yeah um

936
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,720
there's the whole stocks uh public

937
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:41,358
market story and craziness about this

938
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,639
part

939
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:46,239
which i leave to to the experts

940
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:48,400
for everyone on podcast i'm doing air

941
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:51,598
quotes

942
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:55,039
uh for a moment let's stay with cannabis

943
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,039
so the question of

944
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,159
that you post like how do we find these

945
00:36:57,039 --> 00:36:59,759
compounds that

946
00:36:58,159 --> 00:37:01,358
are important but currently not looked

947
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:03,839
for it

948
00:37:01,358 --> 00:37:06,078
it's probably impossible to do this on a

949
00:37:03,838 --> 00:37:09,119
single extract and a single case

950
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:13,119
uh patient case um

951
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,240
we have to find new solutions

952
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:19,760
to or modern solutions uh

953
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,959
to those medical problems and it will

954
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,000
involve a lot of data

955
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,838
population size data sets we cannot do

956
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:29,280
it on one or two cannabis plants we have

957
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:32,000
to look at

958
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,960
dozens hundreds of thousands uh of

959
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,239
cannabis plants

960
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:39,039
to to to spot the difference

961
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:40,159
by exclusion and comparison to other

962
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,358
plants

963
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:45,358
so um we can't just take one plant

964
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:48,559
isolate every single compound and then

965
00:37:45,358 --> 00:37:51,279
try it on every single uh in vitro

966
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,358
study one can think of like that's just

967
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,359
not doable from the effort so

968
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:56,639
um data analytics becomes something and

969
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,838
actually this this topic of data

970
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,480
analytics we

971
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:01,199
we also embrace in other fields of our

972
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,880
research and

973
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:06,239
extraction research so coming back to

974
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,240
the start of this call

975
00:38:07,039 --> 00:38:12,880
i i'm considered an extraction expert

976
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:14,960
because i remember that early 2017 i got

977
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,200
on stage and i explained to the cannabis

978
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:19,920
industry what a design of experiment is

979
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:23,519
and how to optimize the co2 extraction

980
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,400
with six experiments yes and

981
00:38:23,519 --> 00:38:29,039
that worked and at the time in the

982
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:31,680
industry that was something new

983
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:33,759
by now i've moved past that because six

984
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,759
experiments optimize something but the

985
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,760
imprecision is large

986
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:40,800
and the factors you can look at are

987
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:44,960
small temperature and pressure

988
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:48,160
but water content in the plant mill size

989
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,320
machine flow rate all those influence

990
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:53,759
extraction as well cannabinoid content

991
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,800
so now we're looking at dozens of inputs

992
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,119
dozens of factors and we're looking at

993
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,359
dozens of optimization

994
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:07,358
targets high terpene pure cannabinoids

995
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,639
fast all those and that's not doable

996
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:10,960
with experimentation

997
00:39:08,639 --> 00:39:11,838
or targeted experimentation anymore so

998
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:14,720
we actually

999
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,358
doing a big data approach to extraction

1000
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,078
we work with our customers and clients

1001
00:39:17,358 --> 00:39:20,880
uh on taking in their old data sets so

1002
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,720
now we have

1003
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,240
thousands and thousands of extraction

1004
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:26,239
runs and we can use

1005
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,279
now more advanced statistics that are

1006
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:30,479
beyond me as a poor organic chemist and

1007
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,480
i have my

1008
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,159
data scientists and mathematicians on

1009
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:37,199
that

1010
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:40,719
to to really tease out effects

1011
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,679
um that are then better understandable

1012
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:48,719
and controllable

1013
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:51,759
so yeah now we are extraction experts

1014
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:52,319
uh and like a big data approach uh has

1015
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,320
been

1016
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:59,039
very fruitful so far it's a complicated

1017
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,680
question in cannabis because not only is

1018
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:01,679
the

1019
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:03,759
the system difficult but also the input

1020
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,598
data is imprecise

1021
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,359
um everyone who worked in cannabis

1022
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,960
industry and has seen people writing

1023
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:10,960
stuff down on paper understands that

1024
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,240
problem

1025
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,599
so i think this data approach or the

1026
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:20,239
modern technologies uh that

1027
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:21,760
are used in other fields translate

1028
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:23,439
should translate well into the cannabis

1029
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,960
industry because we don't have historic

1030
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,480
baggage of how we have done

1031
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:32,639
stuff before because there wasn't

1032
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,960
a legal industry before right

1033
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:36,000
yeah so that that's one of the benefits

1034
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:38,318
but

1035
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,079
we also don't have that history to to

1036
00:40:38,318 --> 00:40:43,679
fall back on either you know we're we're

1037
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,680
pioneers we have to build that all

1038
00:40:43,838 --> 00:40:48,000
right right and i said there's no

1039
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:51,439
baggage because there was no no

1040
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:55,119
legal industry but there was a

1041
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,960
illegal or underground uh industry of

1042
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,318
cannabis and that brings its own

1043
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,599
historic baggage

1044
00:40:58,318 --> 00:41:04,239
um some of it is helpful and some of it

1045
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,240
is not helpful

1046
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,119
and one has to deal with that so

1047
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,039
therefore we move to a completely new

1048
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:13,920
organism that has all its own

1049
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,480
restrictions and illegalities uh

1050
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,639
psilocybin mushrooms

1051
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,039
[Music]

1052
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,679
right yeah just just when cannabis was

1053
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:22,239
sort of

1054
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:23,039
entering the mainstream okay you had to

1055
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:25,759
go yes

1056
00:41:23,039 --> 00:41:27,679
yes when it became too boring uh i

1057
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,880
thought i'd do something else

1058
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:33,519
yes it's very simple rock of you uh

1059
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,160
yeah no i do no i don't think punk rock

1060
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,480
does that

1061
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:40,559
it's more like uh euro techno right

1062
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,318
well i know punk rock is very uh

1063
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:43,199
anti-mainstream you want to keep it

1064
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:46,000
underground

1065
00:41:43,199 --> 00:41:48,159
i was more thinking of what the what the

1066
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,679
audience would partake in while

1067
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,399
listening to that music

1068
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:53,919
oh yeah well i mean i when i think

1069
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,720
psilocybin i think uh

1070
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:58,240
the grateful dead and fish and uh all

1071
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:01,519
that sort of stuff

1072
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:04,078
okay but okay i have to admit

1073
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,639
i have to admit so i and i think that is

1074
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,760
by now

1075
00:42:04,639 --> 00:42:10,480
known um i have no idea of cannabis as a

1076
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,560
perk

1077
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,240
as a consumer so i didn't know how

1078
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,318
cannabis smelled when i started

1079
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,559
in the industry i i thought you smoked

1080
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:22,719
the leaves like i had no clue

1081
00:42:18,559 --> 00:42:25,759
and i take all this knowledge

1082
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:27,759
into the mushroom space i again have no

1083
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,520
idea about

1084
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,520
any any consumer effects

1085
00:42:31,519 --> 00:42:35,280
and i just have to catch up and

1086
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,719
understand

1087
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:42,160
so mushrooms are

1088
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:46,399
well i'm in the lucky situation that

1089
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:49,759
canada has already its

1090
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,240
solid legal framework work for cannabis

1091
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,280
which allows us to do our research and

1092
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:55,679
they have also

1093
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,359
now established a legal framework for

1094
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,639
psilocybin research

1095
00:42:57,358 --> 00:43:03,358
it's somewhat behind in time

1096
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,039
and more restrictive in its regulations

1097
00:43:03,358 --> 00:43:08,318
so i can do

1098
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:12,000
far less with mushrooms right now

1099
00:43:08,318 --> 00:43:15,358
that i can do with cannabis one example

1100
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,679
is uh when you are in these

1101
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:18,639
this space of restricted compounds and

1102
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:22,399
and

1103
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:25,838
uh organisms you have to buy them from a

1104
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:28,480
uh licensed producer

1105
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,318
and in cannabis as everyone knows

1106
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,400
there's way too much cannabis right now

1107
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:34,159
on the market in canada so for me

1108
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,838
getting anything from my research is not

1109
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,719
an issue

1110
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:38,719
psilocybin

1111
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:45,759
they are maybe single digit

1112
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,679
number of producers that actually grow

1113
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,640
silver cyber mushrooms that you can

1114
00:43:47,679 --> 00:43:52,078
legally buy

1115
00:43:48,639 --> 00:43:53,920
for research purposes um so it gets way

1116
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,359
more difficult

1117
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,519
actually luminos is a licensed dealer

1118
00:43:57,358 --> 00:44:01,039
that's that's the license you get for

1119
00:43:59,519 --> 00:44:02,880
psilocybin mushrooms

1120
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,519
they are based in british columbia so

1121
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:07,440
they're based around the corner

1122
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:09,358
although around the corner of the

1123
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,039
library of ubc is where you find your

1124
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:14,719
psilocybin mushrooms but

1125
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:17,759
those i can't use for research

1126
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:21,919
different type of research

1127
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,839
yes in closing marcus i want to give you

1128
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,480
the opportunity to

1129
00:44:23,838 --> 00:44:28,078
plug any websites social media or

1130
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:29,760
anything that you want to

1131
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,519
get across to the audience to learn more

1132
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:33,359
about the work that you're doing and or

1133
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:36,559
to connect with you

1134
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,279
all right thank you yes as we as i said

1135
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:39,358
we

1136
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:40,800
we set up a research laboratory here in

1137
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:44,078
vancouver canada

1138
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,400
uh to help the cannabis industry uh

1139
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,880
in canada but also internationally

1140
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:51,358
because data is free to travel across

1141
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:54,160
borders

1142
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:56,239
but also now in the psilocybin space our

1143
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,598
company is called complex biotech

1144
00:44:56,239 --> 00:45:00,078
discovery ventures

1145
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:01,920
ltd which is a mouthful but the acronym

1146
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:07,920
is cbdv

1147
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:10,960
and the website is cbdvvl.com

1148
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,039
cbd v was taken already and

1149
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,639
the lcd needed to go somewhere in the

1150
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:18,800
name so it's cbdvl.com

1151
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,078
that's you can that's where you can find

1152
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,200
all our research

1153
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,960
our uh projects we do

1154
00:45:23,199 --> 00:45:29,358
how we can help uh various customers

1155
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,679
uh in the cannabis and now in the

1156
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:34,078
psilocybin space

1157
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,239
and also where you can find our compound

1158
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,519
database

1159
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,318
