1
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:08,320
all right good afternoon and thank you

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,719
for joining us here today

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
i want to take a moment though to thank

4
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:14,239
canmed

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,199
for and their entire team for putting

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,920
this

7
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:19,278
conference on and also

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,199
the time for our panelists that they're

9
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,039
spending with us today

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,359
i'm the moderator today my name is

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,720
michael stromaitis

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:31,519
my friends call me big mike and uh

13
00:00:28,719 --> 00:00:33,600
i'm the ceo and founder of advanced

14
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,000
nutrients we manufacture

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,800
a complete cannabis

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,079
growing system consisting of fertilizers

17
00:00:38,799 --> 00:00:42,640
and additives

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,719
that optimize every stage of the plants

19
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,759
growth from seed to some essence

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,480
all right

21
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,799
so today's panel is going to be about

22
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,078
the role that nutrients play in yield

23
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:56,238
cannabinoid output and plant vigor

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,679
now before we get started i'd like the

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:01:02,640
panelists to introduce themselves

26
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:05,438
so i'm cal ravi i'm a phd in molecular

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,000
biology and i worked on plant nutrition

28
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,719
for more than 15 years specifically

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,760
focusing on ira metal nutrition iron on

30
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:15,519
copper specifically

31
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,719
my name is inia fear

32
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,959
i am the chief science officer at

33
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,759
canadasave been in the cannabis industry

34
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:23,118
since about 2013

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,920
or so

36
00:01:23,118 --> 00:01:27,759
i've been a while i've been instrumental

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,079
in setting up a couple labs across the

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,280
state um currently at canasave uh

39
00:01:32,078 --> 00:01:35,599
pretty much

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
was a growth leader in the space in

41
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,919
california

42
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:40,640
so we've been able to do that

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,399
successfully also co-owner of a

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,960
consulting company

45
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,159
but i'll stop there

46
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,078
hello i am allison justice and i am a

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,759
plant scientist

48
00:01:50,078 --> 00:01:54,639
you'll probably hear it my accent but

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,438
i'm from south carolina

50
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,759
after graduation at clemson university i

51
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,438
went out to san diego

52
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,879
first time i've been back in quite a

53
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:04,718
while

54
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:07,118
in socal that is

55
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:09,439
but i worked for a

56
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:12,479
vertically integrated company

57
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,719
in san diego where we grew indoors

58
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:16,000
outdoors greenhouse

59
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:18,239
but currently

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
and for the last four years i am back in

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,280
south carolina where i have a hemp

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
company that's vertically integrated and

63
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,759
also a

64
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:31,359
a research company that we can get into

65
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,878
more later hope mentioned earlier

66
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,080
i really want to talk about the research

67
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:36,639
company um

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,879
so in the meantime hope jones

69
00:02:36,639 --> 00:02:42,238
i got my phd at the university of

70
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:46,560
arizona plant sciences was my minor for

71
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,560
my phd was my major as an undergraduate

72
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:51,919
my phd work was actually in molecular

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,799
cellular biology and i was

74
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:57,518
doing cancer research and

75
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,439
i also worked at nasa researching how to

76
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
grow plants in space

77
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:04,079
and so and then i took a period of time

78
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,640
off from the hard sciences for a while

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
until the cannabis industry came calling

80
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,878
and then now i'm back full circle

81
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:12,158
actually which is very very cool um

82
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:13,759
because i

83
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:16,079
this is where i'm the happiest is where

84
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,519
i actually get to work with people and

85
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,760
work with plants so i get both of my

86
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,560
my two favorites but it's really about

87
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:24,878
um

88
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
to me i see it as as a as a playground

89
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,318
for us

90
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:29,919
and i cannot do it without the knowledge

91
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,598
of the people like you big mike and

92
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,479
other like my partners i work with

93
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:36,399
because i did not come from the industry

94
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:40,079
from the black market days and there's

95
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,200
so much to understand about this plant

96
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,719
that

97
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:44,798
um it's one of the reasons actually why

98
00:03:42,719 --> 00:03:47,039
i come to conferences all the time is is

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,799
to help me be better at what i do by

100
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,639
learning about the

101
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,319
about these strains and these genetics i

102
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:55,279
mean it's just

103
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,598
it's been a long road for you guys

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,400
been a long road for a lot of us

105
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,199
uh the first question i got for for the

106
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,719
for the

107
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:05,199
panelists are what are some of the

108
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:07,280
commonly held misconceptions

109
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:09,438
that you found out about cannabis in

110
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
your research this is this is a a great

111
00:04:09,438 --> 00:04:12,959
topic so what misconceptions about

112
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,438
cannabis and your research that you

113
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,199
found

114
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,879
so i mean

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,639
i don't know if it's a misconception but

116
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:23,680
it's at least a mislabeling when we talk

117
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,478
about micronutrients usually people

118
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:28,800
think they're not essential or you know

119
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,959
not as essential as nitrate phosphate

120
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,040
and in fact they're as essential as any

121
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:34,399
of the neutrinos they're characterized

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,439
as micronutrients because they

123
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,599
accumulate only at a certain level a few

124
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:42,478
ppm in the plant tissue

125
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,199
but they are more than essential and if

126
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:49,680
if i can take iron as an example because

127
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,680
i worked a lot on this nutrient

128
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:58,560
you know iron is utilized in directly or

129
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,879
indirectly any reaction in the plant the

130
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,800
two main reactions involving iron that

131
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:04,159
are critical are respiration on

132
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,840
photosynthesis

133
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,039
these two processes

134
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:12,239
are just the energy plant in a in a cell

135
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,599
and without this basically there is no

136
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,560
development

137
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,639
and just to capture one molecule of

138
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,038
light one quantum of light and to

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,800
transform it into

140
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:26,478
molecules that is useful for the plant

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,240
the photosystem which is a complex that

142
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,879
capture this light and transform it in

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,879
chemical energy require more than 20

144
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,560
atoms of iron

145
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:39,120
and any missing iron atom in this

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
complex will completely disrupt the

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,918
light energy

148
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,079
capture

149
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:46,000
for the respiration the same if you if

150
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:48,478
the plant doesn't have enough iron the

151
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,399
respiration will be compromised and the

152
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:53,680
plant development will be

153
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,599
dramatically affected so

154
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
i think one of the misconception is that

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:01,120
micronutrients are not as important as

156
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,918
macronutrients but micronutrients have a

157
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,000
macro function and actually iron is a

158
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,560
very example for that because life could

159
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,199
not have evolved without iron iron is

160
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,560
utilizing all the organisms nature

161
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
doesn't have any

162
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,199
hasn't found any ways to supplement iron

163
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,519
there are a few tiny examples where

164
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,520
copper or other metals could replace

165
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,799
iron in one protein

166
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,079
but life

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,879
is sustained

168
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:30,719
based on iron biochemistry so it's it's

169
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:32,240
more than a critical nutrient

170
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,280
that's great

171
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,079
you know i'm really here on the

172
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:38,000
analytical side you know you have this

173
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,159
great wealth of knowledge experts that

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,478
are sitting here more in um

175
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,199
growth but one of the ones that i've

176
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:46,079
heard is the correlation between

177
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,720
uh

178
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:50,959
your cultivar or your your strain color

179
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,280
with the potency and i don't think this

180
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:55,758
really comes from the seasoned growers i

181
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:58,239
think this is more of a layman's uh

182
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
general public i think in perhaps you

183
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,478
know when you get those vibrant purples

184
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,639
hues all those colors that generally

185
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,279
it's higher potency and of course being

186
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,598
in the analytical lab i get to you know

187
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,119
usually prove them wrong all the time

188
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:12,240
as a matter of fact i've been seeing the

189
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,199
reverse

190
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
um

191
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,079
i have a couple hypotheses about that

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
but i've sort of been talking to some

193
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,598
folks and really

194
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:21,680
why

195
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:24,079
what's the case around you know certain

196
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
colors uh when you have your

197
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:28,639
your harvested plant having certain

198
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,478
colors and having lower potency

199
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,280
initially my hypothesis was that it has

200
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:35,680
to do with sort of uh the ability to

201
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:37,279
you're driving uh your potency while

202
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,038
you're driving the plant to produce more

203
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:40,000
anthocyanins usually responsible for the

204
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:40,959
colors you know there's some other

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,879
things that could be responsible for

206
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:47,198
that flavonoids and whatnot um but

207
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,599
chances are you're pushing the plant to

208
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,120
focus on another part of its uh its

209
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
energy and something else rather than

210
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:55,759
making high potency uh thc or increasing

211
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
trichome size or whatnot

212
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:58,960
so i get to hear this a lot and

213
00:07:57,279 --> 00:08:01,519
generally when we get that in the lab

214
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:04,799
you see that the lower

215
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,478
potency ones are also colorful

216
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,079
and i think allison here will be able to

217
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,318
tell you a little bit more later about

218
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,918
you know why that may be the case but

219
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,639
it's just an interesting misconception

220
00:08:11,918 --> 00:08:14,639
that i hear out there

221
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:20,399
okay so i i would say my biggest

222
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,280
surprise uh being in the cannabis

223
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,560
industry is the application of

224
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:27,359
phosphorus

225
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,598
and so you know going back to to grad

226
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,280
school reading by the book yes

227
00:08:29,598 --> 00:08:32,559
phosphorus is needed for flower

228
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,799
production

229
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,679
uh but if you're thinking of other crops

230
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,879
that

231
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,239
um other plants you know of course they

232
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:42,719
need phosphorus it's one of the

233
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,278
essential nutrients but

234
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,640
you know thinking back in grad school we

235
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:49,759
applied

236
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,120
eight ten percent with uh i'm sorry

237
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:54,080
parts per million

238
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:57,039
with 20 parts per million being kind of

239
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:58,720
that that top leveled out you know

240
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:03,278
that's the extreme

241
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,200
well when i got to san diego 2016 um you

242
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:09,360
know the the company i was working with

243
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:11,040
they already had a a cannabis nutrient

244
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,039
company that they were using

245
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,919
not not yours

246
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:15,069
um

247
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,120
we'll change that

248
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:18,720
[Laughter]

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,600
and so

250
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,399
you know the the the label seemed vague

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,720
and

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,399
me being used to actually taking

253
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,560
individual salts and making my own

254
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,320
fertilizers i i thought okay well i have

255
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,000
to figure out what's in here see what

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,480
see what's very different

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
and they were applying

258
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:40,560
100 you know up to 200 parts per million

259
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,880
phosphorus and flour which is just

260
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,719
mind-boggling um

261
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,200
because you know if you think of field

262
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,720
crops what's our biggest pollutant well

263
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,120
it's phosphorus

264
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,519
um and so even though you know the

265
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,639
mindset and cannabis is be be efficient

266
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,839
be uh sustainable um there's actually a

267
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,278
lot of pollution happening um you know

268
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,560
that extra phosphorus that you're

269
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:07,360
applying is going right down the drain

270
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:11,119
brian whipker at nc state has done some

271
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,278
great work and nutrition is for him but

272
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,759
you know i've got to play on both sides

273
00:10:13,278 --> 00:10:17,600
and it's all the same

274
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:19,759
but he's got some excellent papers out

275
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,360
there showing you know well if you get

276
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:24,879
over 15 parts per million phosphorus

277
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,639
you're not doing any good you know

278
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:29,600
you're not getting more yield you're not

279
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,278
getting more potency

280
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,120
you're just wasting money and polluting

281
00:10:31,278 --> 00:10:35,919
the planet

282
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,959
so you know i guess my takeaway is you

283
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,879
know a lot of the the misconceptions of

284
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:42,719
well yes phosphorus is needed for

285
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,879
flowering let's pump the phosphorus in

286
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,720
there that's it's kind of backwards

287
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:48,720
because as you know there's lockout

288
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,120
there's all sorts of other problems you

289
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,720
start applying more phosphorous well

290
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,799
you're going to block the uptake of

291
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,879
certain things specifically zinc and

292
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:57,838
what is that causing as a problem down

293
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,278
the road

294
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,839
so

295
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:05,039
know your nutrients yeah

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:06,640
yeah for me as far as misconception i

297
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,559
was shocked

298
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,199
one of the first presentations i gave

299
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:13,199
about six years ago i was talking about

300
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,040
virus and i showed a picture

301
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
because i walked into it at the grow

302
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,278
that

303
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,439
i was running and i was walking down and

304
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,439
so when i'm giving this talk the thing

305
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,279
that shocked me was

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,600
nobody believed that cannabis could get

307
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:30,000
virus

308
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,320
and so um

309
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,879
and still to this day i might hear that

310
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,040
occasionally but it shocked me

311
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,759
and and what was actually even more

312
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:44,159
concerning was with our own staff um

313
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:46,240
when i found it walking down the row of

314
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:48,879
in this particular facility the moms

315
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,799
were in the middle it was one large bay

316
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,919
in a greenhouse and so the moms were in

317
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,000
the middle

318
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:56,000
the clones were on each side of the mom

319
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,879
and then the veg plants and the teens

320
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,879
and early veg were over off to the side

321
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:02,799
and i'm walking down the rows and i just

322
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:05,278
was stopped

323
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:07,599
and i said to to the guys i said well

324
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:10,480
what do you think is happening here

325
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,959
and they said cow mag

326
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:15,039
and i get that answer a lot oh it's a

327
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:17,599
cal mag problem and you know what it

328
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,120
could be like it could be but then

329
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,000
that's when we engaged some of our

330
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,519
troubleshooting mental checklist okay so

331
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,839
if it's cal mag um the other answer i

332
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
got from the other uh

333
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,399
kid that was there and he was in charge

334
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,360
of watering he's like oh it's a ph issue

335
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,200
and i said it it could be

336
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,919
but do you measure your inputs and

337
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:42,240
outputs mental troubleshooting checklist

338
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:43,439
question number one

339
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
do you

340
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,600
if it's if it is a certain nutrient

341
00:12:46,078 --> 00:12:51,439
deficiency or toxicity or

342
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,440
cation competition

343
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,440
and all the plants in this row were in

344
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,639
this room are being watered and fed the

345
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,480
same would you expect only to see it

346
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,919
randomly in these three plants and

347
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,600
different rows

348
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:05,919
but they're close together

349
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,920
those kinds of misconceptions and

350
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:10,319
everybody goes right to the nutrients in

351
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:12,719
their responses

352
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,639
when it came to disease that i think

353
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,120
that's one of the reasons

354
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,240
again this is my two cents in theory

355
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,639
that the disease status is so bad

356
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,959
because we're so good as an industry at

357
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:27,120
sharing everything or wanting to have

358
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,518
everything that is just killer and

359
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,679
killing it at the cups but we don't

360
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,278
quite understand our nutrients and then

361
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,199
the troubleshooting behind that that

362
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:37,278
things get away from us

363
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,199
and then now it's a problem that

364
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:40,958
we have to deal with at a national or

365
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:42,319
international level from a disease

366
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,439
status

367
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
you know

368
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
perhaps

369
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,199
oh i was just going to add to that

370
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:50,000
that's a great point real life

371
00:13:47,198 --> 00:13:51,439
experience is uh we had a client

372
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,480
bring his plan to the lab you know it

373
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,600
was sick and they thought it was

374
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,920
nutrients so obviously we run hlvd and

375
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,360
and some other beat curly top viral

376
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:00,719
viroid on it

377
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,519
sort of having a little experience

378
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,360
around that and um sure enough it was

379
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,639
you know hiv did i was infecting his

380
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,839
plants i mean it was

381
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,919
pretty bad

382
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,160
even on the dried cured flower generally

383
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,240
which you don't test for we did and it

384
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,439
was evident that it was there and it

385
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:20,799
really wasn't a nutrient situation so

386
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:23,279
go right to the newts and also uh

387
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:25,799
hope did a really great paper for us on

388
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:28,838
hlv and you can find it at

389
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:31,359
advancednutrients.com forward slash

390
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,480
hlv carl i have a follow-up question for

391
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,199
you about iron what forms of iron

392
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,440
uh

393
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,838
can translocate and which forms of iron

394
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,560
cannot in the plant

395
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:47,120
okay yes iron exists in two forms the

396
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:48,479
ferric iron which is oxidized iron fa

397
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
three plus

398
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,440
and in a radius form which is called

399
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,958
ferrous iron two two plus

400
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,120
and i think

401
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:58,399
this is basically the source of its use

402
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
in biology

403
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,240
because once you have a protein that

404
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,320
bind iron this protein now have the

405
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,079
capacity to take an electron

406
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,240
from another molecule and to transfer it

407
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:10,159
to another molecule by changing its

408
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,320
balance between iron two and iron three

409
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,240
so iron lose an electron to give it to a

410
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,760
molecule and this is how all the

411
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,039
oxidation

412
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:21,278
reaction works in in living organisms

413
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,559
that's why it's so important in fact

414
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,879
and uh

415
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:27,439
so it also exists in the soil in these

416
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,679
two forms iron two and iron free much

417
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,959
more as iron free because iron is easily

418
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:32,879
oxidized

419
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:35,039
by oxygen so

420
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,039
there is plenty of iron on on the earth

421
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,799
crust it's very very abundant but

422
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,799
unfortunately it's all oxidized because

423
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,000
of oxygen from here so it's like

424
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,399
basically rust and this is this is very

425
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,759
unavailable to plants

426
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,039
the plants like cannabis because there

427
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,480
are different type of strategies

428
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:53,838
depending on the plant but plants like

429
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,079
cannabis used to take it up as iron 2.

430
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,399
so it has to be in its reduced form

431
00:15:56,078 --> 00:16:00,879
which is basically very poorly available

432
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:03,360
in soil there is a very low amount of

433
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,000
ferrous iron so the plant have developed

434
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,039
some system in order to acidify

435
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,198
the root area in order to basically

436
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:13,439
transform this ion free into iron two

437
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,439
making it soluble and then a very

438
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:18,079
specific transporter

439
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,959
a kind of channel on the root cells can

440
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:24,319
take up specifically this iron too

441
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:26,479
now cannabis is also a secondary system

442
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,720
that can take up iron free but iron

443
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,519
three needs to be chelated to different

444
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,240
molecules organic molecules and as a

445
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:36,959
complex iron free plus organic molecules

446
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,879
these can be taken up by the roots by a

447
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:42,399
different transporter

448
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:45,039
and then in one it gets inside the plant

449
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:47,278
iron is so reactive by changing

450
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:49,278
electron of taking electrons from other

451
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:51,439
molecules it's actually a very dangerous

452
00:16:49,278 --> 00:16:54,399
element to deal with so it has always to

453
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:56,320
be chelated into the cells in order to

454
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,679
be less reactive

455
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,079
so it is true it is basically

456
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,919
transforming across the plant and

457
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,198
translocated to the chute

458
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:07,519
in the form of iron-free

459
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,519
citrate iron-free iron-free

460
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,838
nicosagonamine which are all organic

461
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,160
compounds that allow to transport the

462
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,119
iron-free into a soluble

463
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,480
form

464
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,159
to the different parts of the plant and

465
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,919
to prevent its reactivity it's

466
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,038
uncontrolled reactivity with other

467
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,720
molecules

468
00:17:21,038 --> 00:17:26,959
and when it gets to the chute if this

469
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,318
iron needs to get to the chute to work

470
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,798
in photosynthesis

471
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,480
once it's it's in place in the protein

472
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,319
then it's more it's safer and it will

473
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,720
work on in that context and it's not as

474
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:39,759
reactive but transporting iron from the

475
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,519
roots to the sync part is a very very

476
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:44,798
challenging

477
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,960
trip for hyrum and for the cells

478
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:49,200
right also i'd like to add about

479
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,960
phosphorus phosphorus carries a lot of

480
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,720
heavy metals so not only are you

481
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,759
polluting the planet throwing your money

482
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,360
away you're also

483
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:01,000
you know not thinking about the best

484
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:01,000
interest of your patients

485
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,000
what are some of the differences that

486
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:13,558
you found in the different cultivars

487
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,558
that you've worked with

488
00:18:14,798 --> 00:18:18,960
you know i can go as far as analytically

489
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,480
really the differences have been uh

490
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:24,160
their affinity speaking of metals their

491
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,079
affinity for metals um we found that

492
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:29,120
depending on your cultivar

493
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:31,279
you can feed a whole you know grow with

494
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,079
different cultivars the same nutrients

495
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,240
over time same environment but at the

496
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,399
end end up with different residues of

497
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,919
those levels uh residues of those

498
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,480
compounds

499
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,160
in the finished product um

500
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,160
took a while to sort of figure out why

501
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,080
this is but really it's simple it is

502
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,519
cultivar dependent as we know this plant

503
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:51,759
is a you know everybody knows to buy

504
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:54,000
accumulator right so generally holds on

505
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,720
to these things however

506
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,519
i guess a rate at which they also

507
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,519
release is different and due to the just

508
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:03,839
general vascular nature of the plan and

509
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:05,440
and whatnot i'm sure you guys are aware

510
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,519
we found that um

511
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
even through flushing

512
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:12,000
you cannot get rid of them at the same

513
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:13,439
rate through your different cultivars

514
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you know we've seen in situations

515
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,880
something like cadmium for instance a

516
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
certain

517
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,080
grower

518
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,000
feeds the same nutrients everything's

519
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,399
equal generally

520
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,400
and then somehow one particular cultivar

521
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,400
ends up failing all the time for cadmium

522
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,759
and you know scratching our head why is

523
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,240
that why is that

524
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:34,400
you know there's really no clear reason

525
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,558
apart from the fact that it just holds

526
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,840
on to that a little bit differently i'm

527
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,519
sure there's much more that can be done

528
00:19:37,839 --> 00:19:41,519
to find that out but that's what uh i've

529
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:43,200
really noticed that has anyone tissue

530
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,558
cultured it to see

531
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,960
yeah i think they're getting that done

532
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,558
now after we've gone through exactly why

533
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,640
that really is you know at the lab we

534
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:52,639
can only offer so much analytical help

535
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,080
and yeah we'll help you figure that out

536
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,840
but you're gonna have to go through

537
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:58,240
tissue culture yeah get more information

538
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:59,918
i look forward to that data

539
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,960
actually it's very interesting because

540
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:06,080
cadmium usually accumulates when iron is

541
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,558
deprived in the media right because when

542
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,319
when the plant feels

543
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:12,399
a lack of iron

544
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,240
the plant the genetic programming of a

545
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
plant is changing in order to sanitize

546
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,240
much more of a transporter to get this

547
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,679
iron you know so the roots are expanding

548
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,839
and then there are a lot of transporters

549
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
to be able to capture any atom of iron

550
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,319
available

551
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:26,240
but if there is no iron you know the

552
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:28,000
roots are still seeking for it making a

553
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:30,240
lot of transporters and unfortunately

554
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,359
the transporter is not specific enough

555
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
so when you have a lot of iron

556
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,359
transporter in the root system but no

557
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,000
iron to be captured it will take up

558
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:41,599
cameo so one of the main effects of iron

559
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:44,798
deficiency is often a cambium toxicity

560
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:46,480
because the system is sucking calmium so

561
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:48,558
if you have cadmium contaminant in your

562
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,079
soil in your substrate then obviously if

563
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,038
you have imbalance of iron you will have

564
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:52,879
canyon

565
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:54,480
loading into the plant so

566
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,640
this is something to investigate because

567
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,798
perhaps it's related to that yeah i'm

568
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
happy to get that yeah

569
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,960
so even we're learning up here

570
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,960
i

571
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:08,000
i guess for me the the most evident uh

572
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:10,879
nutrient deficiencies i've been able to

573
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,679
see between cultivars

574
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,200
you know

575
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,440
very evident

576
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,759
very quantifiable is

577
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,080
nitrogen and magnesium

578
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:22,640
you know we have hundreds of different

579
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,678
phenotypes in our greenhouses and you

580
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:27,520
know we we feed them uh one recipe you

581
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,600
know it works for

582
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:32,240
the majority of them

583
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,199
but there's a couple varieties that you

584
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,319
know

585
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,400
it will very evidently show it's still

586
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,480
hungry

587
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
and it's got the classic signs of course

588
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,798
of nitrogen

589
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,240
and others with magnesium and so you

590
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:48,079
know for us

591
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,159
to make life easy because we want life

592
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:52,960
easy as growers you know we'll take

593
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,240
those specific varieties and just do a

594
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,000
top dress

595
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,798
so it gives it that little bit extra

596
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,880
boost but as far as the whole greenhouse

597
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,839
you know we're able to just have you

598
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,200
know our certain stock tanks of um just

599
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:09,279
a very easy one fade

600
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,960
you have a

601
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:12,960
with your work on calcium could you talk

602
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:15,200
about that foliar feeding the different

603
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:17,038
types of calcium and when to apply it

604
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,759
absolutely so

605
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,440
calcium is one that that we feed every

606
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,599
single week

607
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,558
you know the amount that we feed it

608
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:25,839
seems

609
00:22:24,558 --> 00:22:28,079
crazy

610
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:29,839
seems like it could be toxic

611
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,839
but a lot of that work comes back from

612
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,720
research that

613
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,558
my old major professor has done on

614
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,919
certain things like petunias and

615
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:40,720
geraniums

616
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,240
and what he's been able to show is you

617
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
know with a certain

618
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,400
uh foliar application of calcium you

619
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,038
know what we're doing is building cells

620
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,440
building a plant that's tough and so

621
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,240
whether that's um

622
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,519
you know the infection of fungi whether

623
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,960
that's

624
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:58,158
insects

625
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,519
you know what we're doing is building

626
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,640
those cell walls and so you know calcium

627
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:07,440
in many forms if applied foliarly thank

628
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,240
goodness it's not toxic

629
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,798
and so what we've shown in petunias and

630
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:15,120
and what we're seeing now in cannabis is

631
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:19,440
that you can apply rates every single

632
00:23:15,119 --> 00:23:20,639
week of 500 parts per million which is a

633
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,600
lot

634
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,679
if you think of what you might apply uh

635
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:29,279
through the roots you know it's

636
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,880
50. uh so significantly less

637
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:32,480
you're not going to get toxicity you're

638
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,840
just going to get uptake and really

639
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:38,079
build that plant's natural

640
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:40,399
defenses but the one thing that is

641
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:43,359
extremely important to understand is

642
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,360
that calcium is not just calcium it's

643
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:46,558
attached to something else

644
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,959
and so

645
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:50,639
the common forms are calcium nitrate and

646
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,919
so nitrate

647
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,600
nitrogen and calcium chloride

648
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:58,400
basically what you put down when it's

649
00:23:55,599 --> 00:23:59,439
snowing to to make you not slip

650
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
um

651
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:03,278
but you know it's getting more and more

652
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:05,439
popular for people to talk about crop

653
00:24:03,278 --> 00:24:07,038
steering you know it's it's a huge thing

654
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,120
that people have known for forever and

655
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,200
tomatoes you know certain nutrients

656
00:24:09,119 --> 00:24:13,038
certain things will make a plant steer

657
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,960
more vegetative and certain ones will

658
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:19,278
make them steer reproductive and so

659
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,278
you know i guess the takeaway here is if

660
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:24,240
you're growing a vegetative plant and

661
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:27,278
whether this is in propagation or

662
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,278
as mother stock

663
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:31,199
you know you you want to apply calcium

664
00:24:29,839 --> 00:24:33,599
nitrate

665
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,000
this encourages that vegetative growth

666
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:37,119
this applies nitrogen that maybe you're

667
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,599
lacking

668
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,599
from bottom feeding

669
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,038
but that is the form you want to apply

670
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:45,278
if we think about when switching to

671
00:24:43,038 --> 00:24:48,079
flour if you continue with that calcium

672
00:24:45,278 --> 00:24:49,440
nitrate for their application your buds

673
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:52,158
will be funky

674
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:55,919
they'll they'll stretch out the plants

675
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:59,039
thinking i i'm trying to flower but you

676
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,559
know this nutrition regime is making me

677
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:02,158
think that

678
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:04,000
i'm wanting to stay in the vegetative

679
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,919
state so

680
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,159
the takeaway here is you know go from

681
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:10,960
calcium nitrate into flowering where

682
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,360
you're at calcium chloride same thing

683
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,400
you know up to 500 parts per million

684
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,599
calcium

685
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,600
and

686
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,359
so far it works very well

687
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:21,359
i have a question about that so when

688
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:23,599
it's going in a flower and you see those

689
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,639
colas starting to stretch is that a

690
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,959
similar

691
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:30,159
to the monkey tailing which we know is

692
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,000
more of a light stress signal so how how

693
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,400
how different is this from that that's

694
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,400
pretty cool

695
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,679
so

696
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,480
i've always called it foxtail stealing

697
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,200
that

698
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,960
i like monkey though

699
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,000
in my experience what i've seen with

700
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:48,960
that is it's it's kind of just the the

701
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,759
tip of the flower that's making this you

702
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,919
know weird curl and elongation

703
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:56,640
whereas when we see when we apply

704
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:58,960
calcium nitrate the whole flower is just

705
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,038
kind of exciting i got you yeah yeah and

706
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,240
uh even though

707
00:26:01,038 --> 00:26:05,599
in our research we see a higher yield

708
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,679
that's great if you're just going for

709
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,959
extraction but if you're going for

710
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,798
aesthetic

711
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,640
you're not going to sell that it's very

712
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,480
ugly

713
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,200
so i think it's a little bit different

714
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,038
but

715
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,919
same concept which is a whole other

716
00:26:17,038 --> 00:26:22,798
rabbit whole week it jumped down

717
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,759
specifically the crc is cannabis

718
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:28,240
research coalition is going through um

719
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:29,679
lighting work and you know what we're

720
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,519
seeing

721
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,720
everybody knows the two-week stretch you

722
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:36,879
flip to short days and there's a stretch

723
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,480
what we're seeing is that that stretch

724
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
is based off of

725
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:43,519
um

726
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
cultivar dependent but also based off of

727
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,119
um

728
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,038
how many hours is your short day

729
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:51,278
if you have if you switched

730
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:53,919
directly from you know 18 or 24 into

731
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:56,000
eight hours it doesn't expand as much it

732
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
doesn't stretch as much if you go

733
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,720
straight to 12 hours

734
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:00,959
um

735
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,798
you know you're you're going an extra

736
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
third of the plant

737
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,000
so

738
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,000
you know still tons to figure out but

739
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,839
that's that's kind of what we're seeing

740
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,440
on that that's dramatic like from a

741
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:14,879
yield perspective too wouldn't it

742
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,880
absolutely absolutely

743
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:21,278
all right one of the things a common

744
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:24,398
theme i've heard here i've hear

745
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,359
growers say fertilizer is fertilizer

746
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:31,359
and actually it's not the inputs and the

747
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:33,599
forms of those inputs edta dbta or eddha

748
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:35,359
let's say for iron matters how the plant

749
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:37,918
is going to uptake it and use it calcium

750
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:40,158
nitrate versus calcium chloride and

751
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:41,520
flowering so would you agree with that

752
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,278
yeah

753
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:45,440
something interesting is now with the

754
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:47,038
knowledge we have about regarding you

755
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,080
know our genes are used in these

756
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,839
different nutritional status you know we

757
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,119
know for instance during iron deficiency

758
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:54,240
what genes

759
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:56,158
are on

760
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,679
in order to sanitize protein to take

761
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,760
more iron so i think with all these

762
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,440
transcriptomic analyses we can have a

763
00:27:59,759 --> 00:28:03,440
diagnostic basically on the nutrient

764
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
status of our plants for calcium for

765
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,159
iron for any for nitrate for any

766
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,159
nutrients so now we have the access not

767
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,640
only to look at the plant or look

768
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,880
at the final yield we can basically in

769
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,120
real time pretty much a couple of hours

770
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,960
know exactly what the status is in

771
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:21,278
different developmental stage in order

772
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,679
to optimize basically the whole

773
00:28:21,278 --> 00:28:25,679
nutrient program during the world

774
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:27,679
development of a plant so i think now we

775
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,440
have very powerful tools to improve our

776
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,480
formulations and

777
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,080
you're talking about looking at the

778
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:37,278
molecular level yeah right

779
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,359
all right next question so what

780
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:44,278
in research or anything that's developed

781
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:44,278
in cannabis get you guys really excited

782
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,679
uh

783
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,398
i i'm excited about the capabilities

784
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,558
that we have

785
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,879
today to

786
00:28:54,558 --> 00:28:59,278
to transfer some known mutations that

787
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,760
could potentially make a cultivar much

788
00:28:59,278 --> 00:29:03,759
more nutrient efficient

789
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,919
just by taking mutations that are known

790
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,599
in different plants or in a specific

791
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:08,480
cultivar that you don't have access to

792
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,000
or

793
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,759
you you like this attribute but you

794
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,599
don't like all the other attributes so

795
00:29:11,759 --> 00:29:16,240
to be able to take that specific gene

796
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:18,000
variant and to copy it in your in your

797
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,159
own cultivar of interest that you want

798
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,839
to improve and using genome editing

799
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
which is a brand new technique to make

800
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:24,720
some

801
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,639
genetic modification without being

802
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:28,240
called a gmo

803
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,919
is a very powerful technique that is

804
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,960
opening a lot of avenues in order to

805
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,240
develop

806
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,640
elite varieties that will use

807
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,640
nutrients in a much more efficient way

808
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:42,398
that's great

809
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,600
um analytically

810
00:29:42,398 --> 00:29:47,519
i'm really excited to move away from thc

811
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,278
um and then

812
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:51,119
thank you

813
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:54,960
um yeah don't take that the wrong way

814
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:57,759
but the focus on thc is a huge issue

815
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:59,679
right the plant provides so much i mean

816
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:01,519
a viewer in the medical practicum or any

817
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,080
of these talks you keep hearing about

818
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:06,558
whole plant medicine and how all these

819
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:09,678
other components of the plant help

820
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:11,839
whether in just um

821
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:14,720
passage into the bloodstream and whatnot

822
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:14,720
but i'm excited to

823
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
refocus

824
00:30:16,558 --> 00:30:21,119
i'm really actually right now i'm

825
00:30:18,079 --> 00:30:22,798
focusing on flavonoids um i mean there's

826
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:24,398
much more to be learned about flavonoids

827
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:26,398
but in the nature circle industry

828
00:30:24,398 --> 00:30:28,319
flavonoids have been known i mean you

829
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,879
can buy vitamins that are strictly

830
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:32,079
flavonoids um they're anti-inflammatory

831
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,000
responses

832
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:36,000
or activity and whatnot

833
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,079
there's so much more and there's plenty

834
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
of them in the cannabis plants including

835
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:43,038
you know cannabis specific ones like

836
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:45,440
canned flavon um so that's something i'm

837
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:46,319
really doing a lot of work on currently

838
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,519
to

839
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:51,519
learn more and we know that nutrients

840
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,599
and environments have an effect on those

841
00:30:51,519 --> 00:30:55,839
compounds as well so

842
00:30:53,599 --> 00:30:59,599
as much as you know nutrients have a

843
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,599
huge impact on your thc output

844
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,599
and the rest of the environment

845
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:05,839
so along with the other components that

846
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,079
are medically useful as well

847
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,000
and i think we really overlooked that

848
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:11,359
what i've found is that those flavonoids

849
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,919
actually differ quite a bit from

850
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:16,879
cultivar to cultivar so

851
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,360
from seeing canned flavon at high

852
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,840
residues in in in some high thc

853
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:24,558
components uh separation between the a

854
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,639
and b form and you know 17 other

855
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,720
flavonoids that i've seen so far

856
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,640
is really interesting and i'm excited

857
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,720
for the industry to at some point

858
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,559
hopefully in the near future start to

859
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,720
refocus on the whole plant medicine

860
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:38,720
rather than just um you know high thc

861
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,759
so for me it's uh it's photoperiodic

862
00:31:42,398 --> 00:31:46,479
response

863
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,038
um and so you know now being in south

864
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,159
carolina i'm outdoors

865
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:54,558
and it's not as easy as 18 hours 12

866
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,080
hours i have to understand at my

867
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,240
latitude

868
00:31:56,079 --> 00:32:00,398
when will these flower when will these

869
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,000
plants initiate flower when will they

870
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,239
finish when do i have to get my

871
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,640
regulatory tests where i don't get

872
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,919
charged for a federal

873
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,840
crime for one percent thc

874
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:13,679
um you know i have to understand this

875
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:14,720
backwards and forwards

876
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,038
and so

877
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,079
you know what i'm seeing with with the

878
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,798
varieties i i deal with is that

879
00:32:20,079 --> 00:32:25,119
you know maybe not all autoflowers are

880
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,359
actually truly

881
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,359
um

882
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,119
not photosensitive

883
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:33,038
you know what i'm seeing is well if you

884
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:35,439
take that autoflower and you put it at

885
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:37,839
18 19 20 hours

886
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,159
it's gonna stay vegetative and so that

887
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:44,000
means it's not truly an autoflower

888
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:46,480
well with a plant like that

889
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,398
it's special and if we understand the

890
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,360
photo period and we understand how to

891
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,918
work that plant it's special

892
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:56,798
so just for example say you know you

893
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,919
have a plant you take clones from it

894
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,759
you keep it vegetative you plant

895
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,679
you plant it in your greenhouse you

896
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:06,240
can't afford light depth you don't want

897
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,559
to pull black cloth because it's

898
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,200
terribly annoying and you raise the

899
00:33:08,558 --> 00:33:13,918
humidity and all sorts of other problems

900
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,840
well instead you grow a

901
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,278
i'm coining this term i don't know

902
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,879
semi-auto

903
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,200
um

904
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,840
where it is

905
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:26,558
it it is photoperiodic but very

906
00:33:23,839 --> 00:33:27,678
different than than what you know

907
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:29,839
we're used to

908
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,360
um so instead you know you're able to

909
00:33:29,839 --> 00:33:34,000
take clones from this plant because you

910
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,479
kept the mom at 18 hours

911
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:39,038
you plant a greenhouse full of it all

912
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,360
you have to do is put up

913
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:42,798
you know very inexpensive led string

914
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:45,439
lights

915
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:48,000
all year round because nowhere in the us

916
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,159
gets over 18 hours of light

917
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,398
you keep those plants vegetative you get

918
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,480
them as big as you want you turn those

919
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:56,798
plants off and they flower year round

920
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,120
back to back to back

921
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:00,240
and so it's just you know understanding

922
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,359
how

923
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:05,599
light affects those different varieties

924
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,078
i think we can really take advantage of

925
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,480
that really save you know for the grower

926
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,320
save time save effort

927
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:14,320
and do what we need to do but easier

928
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,679
it's hard to follow

929
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,838
so for me i think one of the pleasures

930
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,720
has been seeing more and more scientists

931
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:28,078
enter

932
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:30,158
this industry and working with

933
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,320
the people who provided this industry to

934
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:34,398
us right so we're all here

935
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,879
because of everybody before us and

936
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,319
there's nothing more amusing to me

937
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,398
to see

938
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:43,280
somebody who's been in the industry

939
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,039
growing for 30 years start talking

940
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:47,040
already like talking like a scientist

941
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:49,039
but not getting the credit starting to

942
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:50,480
get more credit and and still talk in

943
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:52,398
the talk and then more scientists

944
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,398
talking like bros

945
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,039
it's actually been

946
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:59,199
it's been wild because i it's this

947
00:34:57,039 --> 00:35:00,960
merging of these worlds that should have

948
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:04,078
always been together

949
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,240
that we now are able to start doing the

950
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:08,079
research that we have

951
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:11,039
should have been doing for decades and

952
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,880
decades and we can start understanding

953
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,279
regional differences

954
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,160
in in our genetics which is something

955
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:20,320
that has been very hard

956
00:35:18,159 --> 00:35:24,159
i know with doing hemp production and

957
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,320
selling clones or seeds nationwide

958
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:29,679
how is any one company going to have all

959
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,680
that data to be able to speak to you in

960
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:34,078
washington versus somebody or even

961
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:35,598
really truly understand the genetics

962
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:37,839
and have the confidence behind the

963
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,240
genetics to talk about that so those are

964
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,639
the things that actually has been nice

965
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,639
to see

966
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,720
well what gets me excited about the

967
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,838
future of cannabis

968
00:35:46,719 --> 00:35:53,039
is mirroring three technologies together

969
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,279
and and that is number one genetics

970
00:35:53,039 --> 00:35:57,279
then the growing environment and the

971
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,599
fertigation program

972
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:02,000
there is technologies out there with

973
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,920
crop steering uh that are

974
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,920
more and more coming out all the time

975
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,240
that will actually give the grower

976
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:10,559
god-like control in an indoor

977
00:36:08,239 --> 00:36:13,358
environment over the plant and that

978
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:15,599
keeps me up at night and gets me excited

979
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:18,400
uh because once you put those three

980
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,680
together you can truly optimize that

981
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,960
plant to its true genetic potential

982
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,719
okay

983
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,000
yeah sure i want to add one more that i

984
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,439
just

985
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,079
because justin and i were talking about

986
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,280
this earlier before our panel and

987
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:35,599
i think probably what motivates us as a

988
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
business and i am kind of speaking for

989
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,359
you here but you said it too so i'm

990
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,720
making sure to dish out the credit but

991
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,319
it's something that has always been a

992
00:36:40,719 --> 00:36:44,319
part of my model

993
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,480
and do currently with everybody but we

994
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,039
don't talk about it enough and that's

995
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,199
actually working with breeders so as as

996
00:36:49,039 --> 00:36:53,199
a tissue culture company

997
00:36:53,358 --> 00:36:57,920
yes we can get into the idea of doing

998
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,159
that biotech kind of breeding and the

999
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,519
hybridization and stuff

1000
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,399
okay i'm gonna

1001
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:05,519
we'll do that but why would i not

1002
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:07,358
why would i

1003
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:09,199
waste all my time only doing that and

1004
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:11,199
not actually working with these breeders

1005
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:13,118
that have these amazing strains and why

1006
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:14,078
would you want to work with us

1007
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,519
and so

1008
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,760
you know my argument for that is because

1009
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,280
when you put your brand out it needs to

1010
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,599
be represent

1011
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,680
your brand and that plant or that

1012
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,880
cultivar and its best

1013
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:30,480
possibilities its full genetic potential

1014
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:32,400
and right now when people are buying

1015
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,639
clones from nurseries and their disease

1016
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,800
does that representing your brand well i

1017
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:38,799
mean why not work with groups like us

1018
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,720
where we can actually it's your brand

1019
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,839
it's just we're producing those clean

1020
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:45,838
stock plants for your brand through your

1021
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:47,920
brand and we do everything through

1022
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:50,799
licensing royalties mtas everything

1023
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,760
should be on the table and and be an

1024
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,720
option

1025
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,599
and and that to me is going to be the

1026
00:37:54,719 --> 00:38:00,239
most exciting next two years for me

1027
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,640
personally going into a new lab in in

1028
00:38:00,239 --> 00:38:04,399
arizona being able to do that because

1029
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,319
no one group is going to have all the

1030
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:08,720
flavors of the rainbow

1031
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,000
you know there's so many

1032
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,519
so many good

1033
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,280
strains out there and breeders who are

1034
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:15,358
not getting recognized because they may

1035
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,680
not be the big you know

1036
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:20,000
10 seed packet going for a grand but dan

1037
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,440
well should be um and so we can get more

1038
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,679
of that vegetative material out with

1039
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,519
working like with our groups i agree

1040
00:38:23,679 --> 00:38:28,078
there's there's kind of a conflict

1041
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,400
between let's call the legacy growers

1042
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,119
and what's happening now in the

1043
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,639
marketplace and a lot of them aren't

1044
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,200
coming out of the woodwork and they

1045
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:39,358
absolutely should they have absolutely

1046
00:38:37,199 --> 00:38:42,559
just killer strains some of these things

1047
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:44,239
giving 42 thc who knows what minor

1048
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:45,199
cannabinoids they could have in there

1049
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,199
and you're right there should be

1050
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,838
licensing deals between companies and

1051
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,319
and growers and they shouldn't be

1052
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:53,599
weary and afraid of as they call them

1053
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,838
the suits

1054
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,359
yeah i do think that there's not been

1055
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:01,599
any favors done by previous you know

1056
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,440
mistakes out in the industry and so the

1057
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,960
best that we can do is just say look

1058
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,639
this is something that we can do we can

1059
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
do it right we can be transparent we can

1060
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:09,838
do things

1061
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,160
but damn get out there get your brand in

1062
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:13,920
the market and let's let's represent it

1063
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:15,759
in the best possible way and it's a

1064
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:18,400
win-win for everybody

1065
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:20,720
yeah and it's it's doing you justice to

1066
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,720
your work it's not trying to be stolen

1067
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:24,000
from you so thank you for pointing that

1068
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:24,959
out absolutely

1069
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,280
so

1070
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,838
what grower specific advice do you have

1071
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,839
for the audience

1072
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,359
grower specific advice for the audience

1073
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,359
i mean i would i mean if we talk about

1074
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,960
nutrition on

1075
00:39:37,358 --> 00:39:40,880
the nutrient formulation you are using

1076
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,559
either you are using a commercial

1077
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,480
formulation and you just have to follow

1078
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:46,960
the label if you start playing with

1079
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,480
nutrient it's very difficult i would

1080
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,320
warn you that you know as soon as you

1081
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,559
change one

1082
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:54,880
one nutrient quantity perhaps in order

1083
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:57,358
to find the optimal dosage for high run

1084
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,280
let's say in one with one basic

1085
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:02,000
formulation you identify

1086
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,240
you know android micromolar to be the

1087
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,838
optimal concentration of iron if you

1088
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:07,838
start then to change nitrate and

1089
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:10,000
phosphate in the original

1090
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:11,519
formulation it will now the optimal

1091
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,199
amount of iron will be completely

1092
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:14,800
different because all the nutrients or

1093
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:17,439
most of the nutrients are interacting

1094
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,599
together and we don't actually today

1095
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:22,000
understand exactly how they interact

1096
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,039
together so trying to trick you know

1097
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:27,599
formulation on your own is a very

1098
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,318
careful approach and i would definitely

1099
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,880
advise you to not do that or just

1100
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:34,800
to do it scientifically with

1101
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,880
the proper approach but not just you

1102
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,039
know gamble on your crop by just

1103
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:41,680
changing one nutrient because you know

1104
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:44,400
just 1.5

1105
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,159
i more iron as you should you kill your

1106
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
plants so

1107
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:50,719
trying to optimize nutrient formulation

1108
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:52,559
is a professional job i would say and

1109
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:54,799
you have to have the capability

1110
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,559
and many experiments

1111
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,079
if you do it in your basement then

1112
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:59,358
obviously you might have backed your

1113
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,800
prices so

1114
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,679
this would be my advice don't play with

1115
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,400
nutrients as you

1116
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:08,318
you wish yeah going off of that it's

1117
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:10,720
really great in the laboratory we

1118
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:12,719
generally have growers who want analysis

1119
00:41:10,719 --> 00:41:13,679
of their nutrients

1120
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,639
either

1121
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:18,559
what they've pre-mixed or what

1122
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:21,358
the soil around the plant

1123
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:23,838
or the runoff and and a lot of times we

1124
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:24,559
end up missing sort of the whole picture

1125
00:41:23,838 --> 00:41:26,078
so

1126
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:27,679
you want to do sort of a mass balance

1127
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:30,800
right you want to okay what was your

1128
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,399
input what's left around the plant

1129
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,560
what's in the vascular powder plant

1130
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,160
maybe you take a root and we analyze

1131
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:37,920
that and then

1132
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:39,118
what's being flushed out take a sample

1133
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,680
of that and analyze that and sort of see

1134
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,039
that mass balance i mean um also making

1135
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,399
sure that your lab is even testing for

1136
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:46,719
the right analyze like you say you know

1137
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:48,480
the iron the various iron oxides and

1138
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,838
what not making sure you're testing for

1139
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,480
the right analyte you can't just test

1140
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,480
iron it's like which iron

1141
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,519
and then you need all that information

1142
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,760
in order to make an informed decision

1143
00:41:57,519 --> 00:42:01,039
as he was saying to change a certain

1144
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,560
nutrient right if you don't have the

1145
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:04,480
full picture you go ahead and change

1146
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:08,078
something that perhaps could be very

1147
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,159
detrimental to your plan you know

1148
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,560
it helps you especially when flushing as

1149
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:15,519
well right whether you're using a

1150
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:17,920
pre-mix or you're doing your own

1151
00:42:15,519 --> 00:42:18,719
ratios you need to know and get that

1152
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,200
whole

1153
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:23,358
picture so make sure that when you do

1154
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:25,439
ask your lab for nutrient analysis that

1155
00:42:23,358 --> 00:42:27,358
you're taking it from several different

1156
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,200
areas to get a whole picture and do like

1157
00:42:27,358 --> 00:42:31,838
a mass balance that way you can make a

1158
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:31,838
better informed decision

1159
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:41,760
i'd say i i appreciate these guys

1160
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,760
so 2016 which is and is not a long time

1161
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,960
ago

1162
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:47,599
you know i

1163
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,960
i'm growing plants legally

1164
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,838
and

1165
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,960
i want to take tissue analysis

1166
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:54,960
and

1167
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,240
you know i spend days and hours on the

1168
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,639
phone trying to find someone to take it

1169
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:03,679
and give me data and no cannabis is

1170
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:05,838
legal no cannabis is illegal

1171
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:08,239
and so what do i do well i dry it and i

1172
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:11,639
grind it up and i send it off and say

1173
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,639
that it's tomato

1174
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:16,159
that's all i could do

1175
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:18,240
and so they send me results back and i'm

1176
00:43:16,159 --> 00:43:20,159
like all right this is great well

1177
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:22,719
you know usually when you get a report

1178
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,598
back they compare it to something

1179
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:26,480
um and so they can compare it to tomato

1180
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:28,640
well

1181
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:29,920
sure it's it's a great starting point

1182
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,598
but

1183
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,039
there are some differences i mean

1184
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,000
they're going to need something a little

1185
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:37,119
different

1186
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,920
and so you know for for years all i had

1187
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,599
to go off of well is this plant looks

1188
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,039
good

1189
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,160
what does that mean

1190
00:43:43,039 --> 00:43:46,318
um

1191
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:48,000
i want my nutrients to match this well

1192
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:51,039
then you get into well there's a million

1193
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,119
different varieties and

1194
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:55,039
so it's tough

1195
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:58,000
but i guess my point is

1196
00:43:55,039 --> 00:44:00,000
you know i'm very grateful for

1197
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,519
him being involved has done a lot you

1198
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,920
know there's universities getting

1199
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:05,039
involved that are testing thousands of

1200
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,680
plants

1201
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,679
and they're able to give you that bell

1202
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:11,759
curve of well this is deficient this is

1203
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,358
toxic this is the range you want to be

1204
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,599
in it might not be perfect for your

1205
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:16,639
variety but it's at least a range we can

1206
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,559
work with

1207
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:21,199
and so not to brag on him again but

1208
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,199
brian whipker at nc state

1209
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,480
i think just a month or two ago has put

1210
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:29,279
out new standards of of what we should

1211
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,079
you know at least a rough range where we

1212
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:34,640
should attempt to be in and so you know

1213
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:37,200
having analytical testing you know all

1214
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:41,039
over the place now is amazing and so i

1215
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:44,318
guess my advice would be use it use it

1216
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:47,039
hey so i'm i'm in the same boat um

1217
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:49,279
and and having previously been cso for

1218
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:51,119
analytical lab

1219
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,480
you know first of all and i'm going to

1220
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,720
explain why but dump your ipa stop using

1221
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,960
ipa within your cultivation facility and

1222
00:44:56,719 --> 00:45:00,559
i'll explain why in a second

1223
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,838
and then second of all get to know your

1224
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:04,719
lab

1225
00:45:01,838 --> 00:45:06,960
get to know your lab i mean i had this

1226
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,199
guy francis call every morning and he's

1227
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,880
a chef over in arizona and he literally

1228
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,519
has turned himself into an analytical

1229
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,720
chemist and because at 10 a.m aaron who

1230
00:45:13,519 --> 00:45:15,920
was running the lab you'd be like that's

1231
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:17,199
francis

1232
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,039
and he would stop and he would take the

1233
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,879
phone because francis would ask

1234
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:22,639
questions nobody's gonna this stuff

1235
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:25,200
isn't intuitive for anybody and

1236
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:28,239
especially when you're trying to dial in

1237
00:45:25,199 --> 00:45:30,960
you want to be able to make

1238
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:33,519
a phone call and talk with your lab and

1239
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:36,480
so now that we can be open in the out in

1240
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,159
the open about what we are testing um i

1241
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,599
think it's important to know your lab

1242
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,199
and one of the things that i learned by

1243
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,880
knowing my lab

1244
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:45,199
is the substrates i've been having

1245
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:48,559
trouble with substrates soilless peat

1246
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:51,118
core and um you know it's it's a

1247
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:52,719
variation and if it's going to be that

1248
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,960
what the starter charge is going to be

1249
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:56,318
which i mean the whole thing is really

1250
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,720
important especially for a tissue

1251
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,480
culture company because i use a diluted

1252
00:45:58,719 --> 00:46:05,519
nutrient solution

1253
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:06,639
on my um hardening plants and so if i am

1254
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:09,519
you know

1255
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,159
subculture or transplanting my cultures

1256
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:15,039
into a substrate that has

1257
00:46:12,159 --> 00:46:16,159
terrible quality control or

1258
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,639
has

1259
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:21,679
aspergillus is the biggest problem that

1260
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:24,559
i have seen um aspergillus is that

1261
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:27,279
organism that emit um that has the af

1262
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:28,960
that produces the aflatoxins that we

1263
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,160
have to test for from a compliant

1264
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:33,199
perspective

1265
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:35,759
so my advice is to test your substrates

1266
00:46:33,199 --> 00:46:37,919
know your substrates know your labs i

1267
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,760
would have never known that the

1268
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,838
companies were having problems until i

1269
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,599
spent like 20 minutes in the lab when i

1270
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,400
was dropping samples off

1271
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:47,920
and i happened to mention in passing and

1272
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,680
they said we've been noticing the same

1273
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,680
thing our farmers and the growers over

1274
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,598
in yuma are saying the same thing so

1275
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:55,759
they actually called up the vendor and

1276
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:57,680
or some of their vendors and was asking

1277
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,800
and it was the cannabis industry that's

1278
00:46:57,679 --> 00:47:00,239
putting

1279
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,680
you know at the time this was probably

1280
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,479
about four years ago was putting a

1281
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:06,639
stress on the supply chain and they were

1282
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,800
having the source from different areas

1283
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,799
and they didn't have time to keep up

1284
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,960
with everything i would have never known

1285
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,318
some of that behind the curtain aspect

1286
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,880
if i wouldn't have known my lab and

1287
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:19,920
talked with my lab so then does

1288
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:21,838
aspergillus will ipa kill aspergillus

1289
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:24,720
well um

1290
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:27,039
will ipa kill virus when you're in your

1291
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:29,439
grow

1292
00:47:27,039 --> 00:47:31,199
no it does not

1293
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,400
it does not

1294
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,879
so by putting your tools into

1295
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,720
ipa you're doing nothing to mitigate the

1296
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:39,760
spread of your

1297
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:42,078
viral

1298
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,760
loads much less you're doing very little

1299
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:45,680
to kill really what's

1300
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,599
plaguing and and aspergillus is a

1301
00:47:45,679 --> 00:47:50,318
problem because i would i would

1302
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,240
pasteurize my substrates then i went

1303
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:55,358
straight on to sterilization of my

1304
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,519
substrates well the reason why i totally

1305
00:47:55,358 --> 00:47:59,199
understand now

1306
00:47:57,519 --> 00:48:02,079
in a different way than i did before the

1307
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,399
reason why we test for aflatoxins most

1308
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:06,880
of the states is because aspergillus can

1309
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:09,119
survive high heat

1310
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
it can survive a lot of chemicals if

1311
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,000
you're not actually breaking that

1312
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:15,759
cellular wall you're not killing that

1313
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:18,480
microorganism and it will survive

1314
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,440
sterilization so when it survives

1315
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:23,838
sterilization and then it you moisten it

1316
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,480
and in my lab i put it in a bend with

1317
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:28,799
with a lid over it well now there's no

1318
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,199
competition

1319
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:32,720
oh aspergillus is i mean you could see

1320
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:35,039
it through the bends so test your

1321
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:37,759
substrate snow your labs

1322
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:40,079
you're seeing that in cocoa and peat yep

1323
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:42,160
both okay yeah yeah it's

1324
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:42,960
it's terrible

1325
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:45,039
so

1326
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:48,720
if you're failing consistently for

1327
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:49,679
aflotoxin look at your substrates

1328
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:51,838
so

1329
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:54,480
i want to make growers aware that there

1330
00:48:51,838 --> 00:48:57,119
is a shift between macro

1331
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,838
micro and secondary nutrients between

1332
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:02,000
the growth and the flowering phase and

1333
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:06,239
it's quite dramatic and it will affect

1334
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,239
your yields if you do not get it correct

1335
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,039
what else

1336
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,159
all right let's uh open it up for

1337
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:13,920
questions

1338
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:18,639
we're doing a q a we have a few minutes

1339
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:18,639
left are there any questions good timing

1340
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,440
yeah the thank you to uh to the

1341
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:26,800
panelists for a really fascinating

1342
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,639
discussion

1343
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:30,400
so question to the panel

1344
00:49:28,639 --> 00:49:33,118
what approaches are you seeing

1345
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,240
if any that use beneficial bacteria or

1346
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:36,800
fungi

1347
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:38,719
to influence plant nutrient uptake and

1348
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,079
bioavailability

1349
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:43,318
and that's to the panel and to you as

1350
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:43,318
well mike

1351
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,800
you understand the question

1352
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:52,559
just where i heard you right uh what

1353
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:54,960
what bios are used to help with nutrient

1354
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,440
uptake so anything using uh

1355
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:00,720
bacteria or fungi to affect how the

1356
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:04,000
plant takes up nutrients or

1357
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:06,480
so in my experience um you know we do a

1358
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,559
bit of contract research for you know

1359
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:12,240
large-scale hemp production

1360
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:13,920
and and help you know the prices are so

1361
00:50:12,239 --> 00:50:17,759
we have to be very careful about what

1362
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,079
our inputs are um and so uh two specific

1363
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,200
companies uh new leaf which is a

1364
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:26,480
bacteria and uh pro-mix which is a

1365
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:29,118
mycorrhizae uh what we did with them

1366
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,920
this past season was you know it you

1367
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:32,000
couldn't

1368
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,240
you cannot take these products and apply

1369
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,800
them to 20 acres at a time

1370
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:38,479
you know you every week it's impossible

1371
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,400
you would make no money

1372
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:42,639
um but what

1373
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,760
does make sense is taking your clones

1374
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:47,118
and doing a significant drench prior to

1375
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,680
planting

1376
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,000
um and so it's a one-time application

1377
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:54,399
and you know we we went through the

1378
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,880
steps you know elemental analysis

1379
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:59,680
yield potency

1380
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,240
um and so what we saw with these two

1381
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:04,639
specific products you know there's many

1382
00:51:02,239 --> 00:51:07,039
others out there but with these two

1383
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,960
and it was consistent with the two

1384
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:10,719
is that it did not increase potency it

1385
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,639
did not increase yield

1386
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:15,118
but being in the southeast where it's

1387
00:51:12,639 --> 00:51:17,279
hot and crazy humid

1388
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,559
um and it doesn't get cold enough to

1389
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:20,720
kill most of the

1390
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,960
pathogens off in the native soil you

1391
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:26,159
know we have terrible pathogen problem

1392
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,599
pressure and so but what it did do

1393
00:51:26,159 --> 00:51:31,199
is it significantly reduced disease

1394
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,760
pressure

1395
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:36,480
and so for us that was a huge win it

1396
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:38,240
wasn't just well you took up nutrients x

1397
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,599
amount more

1398
00:51:38,239 --> 00:51:41,598
it was

1399
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:43,200
you basically saved the life of this

1400
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:45,280
plant

1401
00:51:43,199 --> 00:51:49,118
so that was kind of the takeaway we

1402
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,839
learned in actuality it did increase a

1403
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:53,119
few minor nutrients but that didn't

1404
00:51:51,838 --> 00:51:55,679
equate to

1405
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,800
what the farmer wants being money you

1406
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:58,799
know yield potency

1407
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,280
thank you

1408
00:52:01,358 --> 00:52:05,838
if i may add one more thing to that just

1409
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,800
as you use that be certain depending on

1410
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,639
your state or your regulations that it

1411
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,160
may lead to a microbial failure if

1412
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:13,838
they're looking for total aerobic

1413
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,719
organisms and whatnot in california it

1414
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:16,558
wouldn't because they're looking

1415
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,199
specifically for pathogens

1416
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,519
such as aspergillus and e.coli so just

1417
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:24,399
be aware that it doesn't get onto your

1418
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:24,400
final end product

1419
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,199
uh thank you

1420
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:31,119
i i want to commend you for

1421
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,279
acknowledging the role of legacy

1422
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:35,039
breeders and the importance of

1423
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,519
integrating them into the

1424
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:39,519
into the industry and to that end since

1425
00:52:37,519 --> 00:52:42,159
we have a fairly big audience here i

1426
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:44,239
just want to announce that tomorrow

1427
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,719
last thing in the small room right

1428
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,679
before you go off and party for cinco de

1429
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,519
mayo

1430
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:51,679
the impacts of legalization on the

1431
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:54,079
cannabis legacy and the need for

1432
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,519
solutions to create a healthier industry

1433
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,280
so i hope

1434
00:52:55,519 --> 00:53:00,159
some people will attend that

1435
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:02,880
it's really important and i just want

1436
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:05,118
also put in a shameless plug for

1437
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,800
my company breeders best i work with

1438
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,400
ethan russo and rob clark and we're

1439
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,640
doing exactly what you talked about

1440
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:12,639
bringing in genetics from legacy

1441
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:14,558
breeders that have been doing this for

1442
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:15,679
decades and trying to find markets for

1443
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,760
them so

1444
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:20,318
look us up give us a call we want to put

1445
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,800
some genetics out there

1446
00:53:20,318 --> 00:53:25,440
good pledge man

1447
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,119
so is there a preferred ph to the foliar

1448
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,880
application that you were talking about

1449
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,358
with the uh

1450
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:31,358
cal mag

1451
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,519
you know i

1452
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:39,680
i would imagine there are extremes that

1453
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:41,519
would be detrimental to that

1454
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:44,159
but in my experience

1455
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,440
in the in the broad range of

1456
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:48,078
acceptable

1457
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,079
there's been no difference

1458
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:52,240
i'm going to rely on you on that

1459
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:56,559
question at the extremes of

1460
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:58,399
foliar nutrition and ph and ph

1461
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:00,240
yeah obviously i will confirm that the

1462
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,880
two extremes are bad then after

1463
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,799
obviously for metals you prefer rather

1464
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,039
acidic quite acidic which is not good

1465
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,839
for over micronutrients like nitrate i

1466
00:54:07,039 --> 00:54:10,719
guess

1467
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:13,279
so it's a thin balance between you know

1468
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:14,879
having a good equilibrium for uptake of

1469
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:16,640
all the nutrients

1470
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,200
rather than optimizing

1471
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:20,799
you know for one but basically you will

1472
00:54:19,199 --> 00:54:23,598
deprive your plant of nitrate if you

1473
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,119
optimize only for metal so

1474
00:54:23,599 --> 00:54:29,200
so i think plants have evolved you know

1475
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:31,440
to grow in the kind of soil ph's and

1476
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:33,519
obviously very some genetic diversity

1477
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,318
depending on the type of soil plants

1478
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:38,880
have been able to evolve within a narrow

1479
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,599
window but i think obviously in the

1480
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,119
extreme you know below four higher than

1481
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:45,280
hey perhaps it's more difficult for

1482
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,119
cannabis to to grow

1483
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:49,599
and with the

1484
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:52,640
with the observation of the semi-autos

1485
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:55,039
would this be a symptom of the ruderalis

1486
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,159
autoflower blending in with photoperiod

1487
00:54:55,039 --> 00:54:59,838
plants reducing the effect of the actual

1488
00:54:58,159 --> 00:55:02,879
production of the hormone based on

1489
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:05,199
overshadowing or is this technically a

1490
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,240
attribute that is coming out as its

1491
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,239
individual statement

1492
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,920
it's a hard one

1493
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,719
um

1494
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:18,960
you know the varieties i've worked with

1495
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:21,759
you know it wasn't an intentional cross

1496
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:24,318
of ruder alice and a photoperiodic

1497
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,319
variety

1498
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:32,640
that's a genetics question

1499
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:34,960
that's not necessarily my

1500
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:37,838
speciality so i'm not sure i would

1501
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:40,159
imagine so but um

1502
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:42,798
i'm unsure in our personal garden we've

1503
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:45,598
actually been able to extend um based on

1504
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:47,679
light intensity with autoflowers uh

1505
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:49,680
after a conversation realizing that the

1506
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:51,919
root oralist started out as an under

1507
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,239
crop so basically as its competitors

1508
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,559
grew taller the overshadowing would

1509
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:58,639
hormonally trigger blooming and that's

1510
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:00,720
just one of the reasons i was asking if

1511
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:02,719
it's a cross between the two and

1512
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:04,399
attributes because i know a lot of us in

1513
00:56:02,719 --> 00:56:06,639
the breeding culture

1514
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,798
have taken the original land races that

1515
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,598
breed and elongated sectional timings

1516
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:12,480
such as the indica is going 10 to 15

1517
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:16,079
weeks

1518
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,559
and sativa is going 15 to 21 weeks or 25

1519
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:21,760
in some regions and basically shortening

1520
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:24,319
those by breeding in root oralist plants

1521
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:26,000
i'm just interested to basically see if

1522
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:27,358
that's a linkage in the instability

1523
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:29,760
we're seeing with hermaphroditic

1524
00:56:27,358 --> 00:56:32,000
tendencies laid in bloom or if that's

1525
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:34,000
something that's just promoting based on

1526
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,639
our current practices and being away

1527
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,639
from nature

1528
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,119
so i didn't hear every word it was a

1529
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,240
little bit hard it's a little bit hard

1530
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:44,798
to hear

1531
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:47,039
basically oh i'm sorry basically what

1532
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:50,480
i'm asking is are we creating

1533
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,519
instability by breeding in these two far

1534
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,838
reaches

1535
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:55,358
uh and are we seeing that as an

1536
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:57,599
attribute to the hermaphroditic

1537
00:56:55,358 --> 00:57:00,239
tendencies in some plants that occur

1538
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:00,240
late in bloom

1539
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:06,640
uh i i have not been able to correlate

1540
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:09,358
hermaphrodism with

1541
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,558
i guess photoperiodic response

1542
00:57:09,358 --> 00:57:12,558
um

1543
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:14,319
you know i think we're hybridizing just

1544
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:17,280
about everything whether it's

1545
00:57:14,318 --> 00:57:19,519
photoperiodic response purple color

1546
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:22,559
you know what whatever it may be

1547
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:26,719
um and i think it's gonna it it really

1548
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:28,640
goes back to um you know homogenizing

1549
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:31,759
your your genetic line

1550
00:57:28,639 --> 00:57:33,759
um because sure one one cross of very

1551
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:36,319
extremes you're gonna get a lot of

1552
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:39,599
different types of children um but

1553
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:41,838
picking that one you like and then um

1554
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:44,318
you know

1555
00:57:41,838 --> 00:57:46,078
breeding to to support those

1556
00:57:44,318 --> 00:57:47,519
genetic traits you're looking for i

1557
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:48,960
think that's what's gonna you know

1558
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:51,358
stabilize it

1559
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:53,440
um until then it's gonna

1560
00:57:51,358 --> 00:57:55,039
kind of be a up in the air of of what

1561
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:57,280
you're getting

1562
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:59,599
does that answer it i appreciate it

1563
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,599
thank you

1564
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:03,679
hi guys

1565
00:58:01,679 --> 00:58:06,480
my name is ali i'm with cannabis talk

1566
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:10,480
101. this question is primarily for mike

1567
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:12,798
and uh any but i'd love to hear from all

1568
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,798
of you

1569
00:58:13,039 --> 00:58:20,480
how important is standardizing nutrients

1570
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:22,720
to getting standardized medicine and do

1571
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:25,519
you think there'll ever be a day that we

1572
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,679
will be able to get such consistency

1573
00:58:25,519 --> 00:58:30,079
that we're almost at par with

1574
00:58:27,679 --> 00:58:31,199
pharmaceuticals

1575
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,559
yes

1576
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,239
we've tested

1577
00:58:32,559 --> 00:58:36,400
directly every competitor out there

1578
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:39,358
we've looked at the cannabinoid profiles

1579
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,519
and you can manipulate cannabinoids by

1580
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,598
macros secondaries and micro

1581
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:45,440
micronutrients and i talked earlier

1582
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:47,680
about marrying genetics and crop

1583
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:49,440
steering and fertigation that will give

1584
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:50,719
you what you're looking for as well as

1585
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,639
you know lighting and environmental

1586
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,959
controls and all the sensors will be

1587
00:58:52,639 --> 00:58:59,039
involved you'll be able to steer that

1588
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,440
plant in many different directions and

1589
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,519
there's quite a bit of research that has

1590
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:04,798
to be done we're just cracking the tip

1591
00:59:03,519 --> 00:59:07,039
of the iceberg

1592
00:59:04,798 --> 00:59:09,119
when we think about canvas and all of

1593
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:10,719
the different effects that would be the

1594
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:13,920
possibilities when you look at the

1595
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:13,919
cannabinoid profiles

1596
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,400
yeah it's really important you know i

1597
00:59:16,639 --> 00:59:20,879
was once in a production environment

1598
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:22,798
um somebody was pressing rosin

1599
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,400
and um

1600
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:26,239
there were a bunch of new techs there

1601
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:28,079
that he had to teach how to you know

1602
00:59:26,239 --> 00:59:30,318
press the rosin out and and do that

1603
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:32,000
whole process and

1604
00:59:30,318 --> 00:59:34,239
he was really good at what he did but he

1605
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,599
said that he couldn't really teach that

1606
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:37,519
because

1607
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,079
you know the temperature you have to

1608
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,639
feel it you have to feel the pressure

1609
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,880
that you press at you had to it's like

1610
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:46,318
okay i understand that but that's not

1611
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,599
how it should be it has to be

1612
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,039
standardized you have to be able to set

1613
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,960
a certain temperature you have to be

1614
00:59:49,039 --> 00:59:54,480
able to set a certain psi of pressure um

1615
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,920
you know these are what sops are

1616
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,920
necessary for

1617
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,200
i think as we get uh

1618
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,119
legalization or federally regulated

1619
01:00:01,199 --> 01:00:06,078
things have to be a lot more

1620
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:07,280
standardized you couldn't just i get it

1621
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:08,480
with the master growers they've been

1622
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,079
doing it for years and they know what

1623
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:12,960
they're doing but now the great

1624
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:14,960
challenge is to get that written down in

1625
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:17,760
a strict direct manner i mean that's

1626
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:18,720
essentially what i do so when i'm

1627
01:00:17,760 --> 01:00:21,040
you know

1628
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:22,480
creating a lab or setting up a lab i

1629
01:00:21,039 --> 01:00:24,000
couldn't just

1630
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,920
put everything there and expect to do it

1631
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,358
all myself otherwise why hire people i'd

1632
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,798
have to run all the essays i couldn't

1633
01:00:27,358 --> 01:00:31,279
even sit here right i have to create

1634
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,119
sops for people to follow and it has to

1635
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:34,720
be standardized so that has to be the

1636
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:36,079
same thing that we have to head towards

1637
01:00:34,719 --> 01:00:38,159
in this industry

1638
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,160
if you're willing to or if you're going

1639
01:00:38,159 --> 01:00:42,960
to be able to produce

1640
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:46,000
consistent medicine with consistent thc

1641
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,240
levels uh other constituents flavonoids

1642
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,760
whatever it that growing process has to

1643
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,439
be standardized now i get it there's

1644
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,359
always situations where there's disease

1645
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,519
and whatnot um that could throw a wrench

1646
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,719
into things but think about you know

1647
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:58,880
shoot the

1648
01:00:56,719 --> 01:01:00,879
corn we eat right it's a very

1649
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,240
standardized process of growing that

1650
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,079
they're not just shooting at the hip

1651
01:01:02,239 --> 01:01:06,719
about it so it's going to be very

1652
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,318
important i i agree it's going to be

1653
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:11,118
really important one of the things that

1654
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:12,558
i think saves our ass when it comes to

1655
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,798
competing with the pharmaceutical

1656
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,640
industry is the entourage effect

1657
01:01:14,798 --> 01:01:18,719
and so if we're going to do something

1658
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:21,920
that is plant-based

1659
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:24,798
and we want to mimic anything like what

1660
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,720
we have within those trichomes you can't

1661
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:30,159
do it by

1662
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:32,639
only synthetics right and so there's so

1663
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:35,358
much more research to do so

1664
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:37,759
we do stand a chance in the industry in

1665
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:40,239
my mind to be able to compete with

1666
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:43,280
anybody if we're willing to put the

1667
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:46,159
investment and training behind

1668
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:48,319
proper facilities and hvac is one of

1669
01:01:46,159 --> 01:01:50,558
them it's the biggest mistake that i've

1670
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:52,960
seen in almost every facility that i go

1671
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:55,119
in is just

1672
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:56,639
a crappy job of hvac or dealing with

1673
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,920
what they have

1674
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:03,118
then it comes down to tracking the data

1675
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:05,200
and we need a baseline of genetics

1676
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:08,240
so one of the problems that i see with

1677
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:10,798
so much of even the current literature

1678
01:02:08,239 --> 01:02:14,078
that we're dealing with is until until

1679
01:02:10,798 --> 01:02:17,358
we have markers and we know a strain is

1680
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:18,880
what it says it is

1681
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:21,679
we have no

1682
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:24,318
baseline as an industry now we have

1683
01:02:21,679 --> 01:02:26,318
years of anecdotal evidence when you

1684
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:28,480
work with your plants regardless of what

1685
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:29,920
its name is you know its growing habit

1686
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:32,798
how do you replicate that on a

1687
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:35,519
commercial scale and then to be a

1688
01:02:32,798 --> 01:02:37,280
commercial scale every commercial scale

1689
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,199
industry deals with

1690
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:42,960
new genetics coming in on a regular

1691
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:45,598
basis we are so tied to our genetics i

1692
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:48,159
have clients that will not

1693
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:50,400
will not get rid of a diseased plant

1694
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:53,759
because it's the last one that they have

1695
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:56,160
and it's irreplaceable

1696
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:58,640
that is terrible way to go about

1697
01:02:56,159 --> 01:03:00,558
business we but we care about our

1698
01:02:58,639 --> 01:03:01,759
genetics like they're our children and

1699
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,440
our pets

1700
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:06,400
and that's okay but then we need to

1701
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,720
learn to maintain them so we have

1702
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:11,039
healthy plants and children right so

1703
01:03:08,719 --> 01:03:13,598
there's nothing wrong with our way we

1704
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:16,720
just need to meld some of additional

1705
01:03:13,599 --> 01:03:18,480
ways and finances into how to do that on

1706
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:20,639
a commercial scale we can compete with

1707
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,480
everybody

1708
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,920
all right good question all right

1709
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:25,838
well we've come to the end i want to

1710
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,519
thank our panelists today and our

1711
01:03:25,838 --> 01:03:31,000
audience as well

1712
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:31,000
thank you very much

1713
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,760
