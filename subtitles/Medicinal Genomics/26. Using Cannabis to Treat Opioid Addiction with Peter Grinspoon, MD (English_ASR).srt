from both the perspective of a clinician

treating the disorder

67

and as someone who is in recovery from

opioid addiction

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,640
we spoke a lot about how cannabis can be

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,760
used to treat addiction in our

71
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:48,799
conversation

72
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:50,479
as well as why dr grinspoon believes all

73
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,879
primary care providers should be

74
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,039
knowledgeable about medical cannabis

75
00:02:52,878 --> 00:02:57,439

00:02:55,039 --> 00:02:58,479
alternative to medications used to treat

00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,840
chronic pain

78
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,959
and insomnia how years of anti-cannabis

79
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,800
propaganda

80
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,158
has tainted the medical cannabis

81
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,400
conversation

82
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:09,679
why both sides of the cannabis issue

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,640
need to behave better

84
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:14,879
when discussing the benefits and risks

85
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:16,559
the five ways cannabis can help with the

86
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:18,719
opioid crisis

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,120
how prescription drug usage tends to

88
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:23,598
drop in legal cannabis states

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,719
whether cannabis itself is addictive and

90
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,399
more

91

peter grinspoon

137
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:15,038
good afternoon peter thanks for joining

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,639
us thanks for having me

139
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:18,319
all right i'm excited to talk with you

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,918
today about how

141
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,918
you incorporate cannabis into your

142
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,519
primary care practice particularly when

143
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:25,599
it comes to treating addiction because i

144
00:05:23,519 --> 00:05:27,439
know you have a lot of experience there

145
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,600
so maybe a good place to start is to

146
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,199
have you describe the types of patients

147
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,120
and conditions you treat

148
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,919
and then we can get more specifically

149
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,840
into cannabis and addiction

150
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:41,918
absolutely um i incorporate cannabis in

151
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,839
my primary care practice

152
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:45,758
and then i have a a private practice

153
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:48,799
that i on the side where i

154
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,560
do consultations and certifications um

155
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,800
i think it would be great if all primary

156
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,478
care doctors is certified and advised

157
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
people on medical cannabis

158
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,560
that's sort of my vision for the future

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,840
where you know all

160
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,839
doctors are conversant and comfortable

161
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,439
discussing cannabis with patients they

162
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:06,478
all know about the endocannabinoid

163
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:08,800
system

164
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,478
and they all can can give their patients

165
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,919
good and helpful advice

166
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,839
unfortunately we're not quite there yet

167
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:15,839
because of the 80 years

168
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:18,159
of drug war mentality and the fact that

169
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,239
the endocannabinoid system hasn't been

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,360
really taught much at all in medical

171
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,560
schools

172
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
um the irony is that medical cannabis

173
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,918
makes my life

174
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,519
as a primary care doctor much easier

175
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:32,000
because it offers me

176
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:33,599
tools that i wouldn't otherwise have

177
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,680
some of the most difficult things to

178
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,199
treat as a primary care doctor are

179
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,759
chronic pain um and insomnia

180
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,319
and the alternatives for these are often

181
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,240
much more dangerous than cannabis

182
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,439
so i would say two of the most common

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,759
things i treat

184
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:51,279
in my primary care clinic are insomnia

185
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
and chronic pain

186
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:54,638
for insomnia i'd be using ambien or

187
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,319
sedative

188
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,720
or amyl triptyline some kind of

189
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,280
tricyclic and those can affect your

190
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
memory

191
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:03,679
they have side effects they make you

192
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,598
groggy and you compare that with a

193
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,120
maybe a drop or two of tincture of

194
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:10,000
cannabis tincture and

195
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,439
the person has a slight euphoria and

196
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
gently falls to sleep and they're not

197
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,839
groggy the next day

198
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,478
i mean it's sort of a no-brainer to try

199
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,000
cannabis

200
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,079
and it's much less habit-forming

201
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,918
obviously than the benzodiazepines like

202
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,079
valium or clonapin

203
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:27,359
and then for chronic pain what are your

204
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:30,159
options nobody wants to be on opiates

205
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,598
tylenol doesn't do anything and then the

206
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,000
non-steroidals i see

207
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,839
so many patients with their kidneys

208
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,918
dying in their 50s

209
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:40,159
60s and 70s you know if they haven't

210
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:43,120
died of a heart attack or an ulcer first

211
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,080
just from using chronic aleve naperson

212
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,680
ibuprofen

213
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:50,240
advil cannabis is can be a much

214
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,280
safer and healthier alternative as

215
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,360
americans get

216
00:07:51,279 --> 00:07:55,758
bigger poorlier and more arthritic in

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:58,800
their knees and hips and backs

218
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,759
so chronic pain and insomnia are two

219
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,520
examples

220
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
of things that not only do i treat

221
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:06,399
frequently in my primary care practice

222
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,199
with cannabis but i think that cannabis

223
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:09,439
would help

224
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,478
primary care doctors across the board if

225
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:12,719
they incorporate

226
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:15,360
it as a tool it would make their lives a

227
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,360
lot easier

228
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:19,598
yeah agreed and i think we all share

229
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,000
your vision or your goal

230
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:26,399
of educating primary care physicians and

231
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
helping them understand the benefits of

232
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,478
using cannabis

233
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,879
do you see that trend starting do you

234
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,718
see

235
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,000
more primary care physicians or even

236
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,640
physicians in general

237
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,200
opening up to the idea of using cannabis

238
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:38,838
and

239
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,879
learning more about the endocannabinoid

240
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,640
system absolutely

241
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:44,480
first of all among younger doctors

242
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:45,759
they're very and doctors in training are

243
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,480
sort of outraged

244
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:49,039
that is not being taught and they are

245
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
very

246
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,958
much more educated about the war on

247
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
drugs and the social history

248
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,639
and a lot of the younger doctors are

249
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:57,359
like i can't believe you guys aren't

250
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:59,679
teaching this

251
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,360
the endocannabinoid system is sort of

252
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,039
the control system for all the other

253
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,159
neurotransmitter systems why would you

254
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,039
leave this

255
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,600
out of the medical school curriculum but

256
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,240
also

257
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,278
in general doctors are becoming so much

258
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,159
more accepting of cannabis as the

259
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,360
feedback from patients of positive

260
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:20,480
clinical

261
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,000
outcomes reaches them you know um i

262
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,159
can't say that doctors are taking the

263
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,600
lead with few exceptions doctors have

264
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,039
sort of been on the wrong side of the

265
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,759
whole cannabis debate

266
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:31,278
but to their credit doctors are they're

267
00:09:29,759 --> 00:09:32,879
following the patients but they're

268
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,799
they're starting to listen to them

269
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:36,240
and i think generally doctors are

270
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,519
getting on board

271
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,240
but they doctors generally have a

272
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,959
a pretty big task in terms of not only

273
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,519
learning

274
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:47,359
how to incorporate medical cannabis into

275
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,879
their practice but they have to sort of

276
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,039
unlearn some of the nonsense that

277
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,600
they've been taught about cannabis along

278
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:54,639
the way

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,839
so if you think about having to unlearn

280
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,958
stigma unlearn nonsense and then learn a

281
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,640
whole new

282
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,319
treatment modality you know it is a

283
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:03,439
pretty tall order i mean it's it's

284
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,360
doable and

285
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,920
doctors have an obligation to do it

286
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,800
because they've been getting it wrong

287
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,919
thus far and it's a really uh critical

288
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,719
way to help patients

289
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:15,519
navigate a whole host of medical issues

290
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
but it is

291
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,200
you know it is going to take some time

292
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,160
it doesn't happen overnight

293
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,000
yeah one of the things you mentioned was

294
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:25,600
following the patients and that a lot

295
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,320
oftentimes patients will come to their

296
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,320
doctors

297
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,760
interested in cannabis do you find that

298
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,720
a lot in your practice or

299
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,919
are you suggesting it to your patients

300
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,519
well it's interesting you know it

301
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:37,439
becomes a little bit self-selecting

302
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
because once you get known as

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,880
a physician that's sort of interested

304
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
and advocates for cannabis

305
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,278
people do sort of seek you out for that

306
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,200
and then you know my colleagues refer

307
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,200
patients to me for cannabis so on the

308
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,278
one hand quite a few patients

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,040
come to me for that but on the other

310
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:55,439
hand you know just for my

311
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:56,319
routine primary care patients that

312
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,000
really don't know

313
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,399
anything about me aside from the fact

314
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,039
that i'm their doctor i will definitely

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,679
bring it up

316
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,439
uh a perfect example of a patient that i

317
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:08,559
might bring it up to is

318
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:11,040
the patient with moderate chronic pain

319
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:12,000
whose kidney function is starting to go

320
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:14,319
after being on

321
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,679
non-steroidals for several decades this

322
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,600
might be a patient that i've

323
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,519
adopted inherited you know doctors

324
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,200
retire they leave you inherit a patient

325
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:23,200
from someone else

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,040
if it had been my patient all along they

327
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,160
wouldn't have been on non-steroidals all

328
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,679
along and their kidneys wouldn't have

329
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:29,039
been dying in the first place

330
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,439
because i would have had them on medical

331
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:33,039
cannabis but if i adopt a patient whose

332
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,720
kidneys are slowly dying

333
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:36,240
because of the non-steroidals that will

334
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,639
be someone that i will say

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,919
hey you can control your chronic pain

336
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,159
with medical cannabis

337
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,759
we could use low doses you probably

338
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,360
won't have very much of the high

339
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:48,159
at all if you don't want to because we

340
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,839
could use cbd or we could use low dosage

341
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:51,360
or we could use topicals and so forth we

342
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,120
could experiment with different

343
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,079
modalities different doses different

344
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,560
strains

345
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,479
and um we could really make a go at

346
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,719
protecting your kidneys and

347
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,039
you know most people are open to trying

348
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,759
this uh you know if they're elderly

349
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:08,480
if they're conservative uh they might

350
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,879
have too much stigma still internalized

351
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,519
from the 80 years of drug war propaganda

352
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,838
but

353
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,360
more and more people are are open to it

354
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,079
uh some people are very enthusiastic

355
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
about it

356
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,679
and more and more people are open to

357
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,000
trying it and then you know when you try

358
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,479
it

359
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
it's not a success for everybody for

360
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,920
some people it doesn't help their pain

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,759
for some people they have side effects

362
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:29,599
like anxiety or they just don't like how

363
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:33,120
it feels but i would say

364
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,120
for for most people it helps them

365
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:39,120
absolutely and of course we're talking

366
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,959
about using cannabis to treat

367
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,959
chronic pain and another drug that's

368
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,719
commonly used to treat chronic pain is

369
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,719
opioids which kind of brings us to this

370
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:52,320
whole idea of addiction so

371
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,000
um how can cannabis be used to to treat

372
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,720
opioid addiction

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,240
well there i view it as there are five

374
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,839
ways in which cannabis can help with the

375
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,639
opiate crisis

376
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,959
four of which i support and one of which

377
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
i

378
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:07,278
i don't support yet because it's not

379
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,320
evidence-based cannabis can be used

380
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:12,720
instead of opiates to treat chronic pain

381
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,079
for new patients so you fewer patients

382
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,000
that are on opiates

383
00:13:14,078 --> 00:13:18,319
that could potentially get addicted to

384
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,159
them you could take patients that are

385
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
on opiates because we over prescribed

386
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:22,799
opiates for the last 20 years and we

387
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,199
have a ton of people on

388
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:27,199
opiates that don't need to be in opiates

389
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:29,839
and we could offer to transition them

390
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,600
from opiates to cannabis and again get

391
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,120
them off of opiates now this has to be

392
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,200
done voluntarily i don't believe in

393
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,639
forcing anybody off opiates if they're

394
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,519
on opiates

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:42,240
the third way is if you add cannabis to

396
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:45,198
opiates the dose of opiates can often

397
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,399
be 20 of what it was you could lower the

398
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,639
dose by 80

399
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,399
because cannabis and opiates work on

400
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,079
very similar receptors

401
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,600
so and a lot of the mischief you get in

402
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:54,559
with opiates in terms of addiction

403
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,959
dependence uh

404
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,759
overdose is dose related so if you can

405
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,679
get someone

406
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:01,679
from like 100 milligrams to 20

407
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,359
milligrams of morphine equivalent that's

408
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:05,519
a great thing

409
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
and the fourth way is that cannabis can

410
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,078
be really helpful

411
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,519
and there's some studies that show this

412
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:10,399
and i can tell you this from personal

413
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,839
experience

414
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:14,159
because i'm in recovery from opiate

415
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,839
addiction cannabis is probably the most

416
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:16,799
effective medication for opiate

417
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,360
withdrawal

418
00:14:16,799 --> 00:14:21,120
symptoms when you're getting off opiates

419
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,519
or transitioning onto

420
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,360
buprenorphine you know suboxone cannabis

421
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
can be really helpful so there are four

422
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
ways

423
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,879
in which cannabis is extremely helpful

424
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,759
in getting people off their opiates for

425
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:33,838
chronic pain

426
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:35,679
cutting down their dose for chronic pain

427
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,800
or helping them transition off street

428
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:38,479
drugs

429
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,399
the fifth way which i can't quite

430
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:43,920
recommend yet is

431
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,120
can we use cannabis as a drug like

432
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:48,399
buprenorphine

433
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,720
suboxone or methadone as a replacement

434
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,240
for opiates in terms of medication

435
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,120
assisted treatment

436
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,079
now i know of thousands of patients that

437
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,759
have

438
00:14:56,078 --> 00:14:59,120
vouched that they've used cannabis to

439
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:00,958
get off opiates

440
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,519
and have used cannabis as a replacement

441
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,278
for heroin and i truly believe that in

442
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,799
the future this may be the case that

443
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:08,720
you're not just gonna have

444
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:10,078
buprenorphine methadone you're gonna

445
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,879
have buprenorphine methadone and

446
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,679
cannabis

447
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,720
to get people off of opiates however at

448
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,958
the moment

449
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,759
the data is that buprenorphine and

450
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,759
methadone

451
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:22,159
have been shown to reduce overdoses and

452
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:23,679
death by 50 to 80 percent

453
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:25,679
and we haven't shown that yet with

454
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,278
cannabis so i feel uncomfortable

455
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,039
recommending cannabis

456
00:15:27,278 --> 00:15:31,679
for this because it just hasn't been

457
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,919
shown yet to reduce overdose and death

458
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,758
now say you're my patient and you have a

459
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:36,639
migraine and i treat you with medical

460
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,560
cannabis

461
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,000
and it doesn't work the worst case

462
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,399
scenario is you get

463
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,078
a migraine we try something else but if

464
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,958
i treat you for opiate addiction and it

465
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,000
doesn't worse

466
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,119
work you overdose and you can die that's

467
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,958
a really big deal

468
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,480
so i think for that particular

469
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:53,439
indication you have to stick with the

470
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,959
data

471
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,800
just because the consequences of

472
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,719
overdosing are so dire

473
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:01,120
it desperately needs to be studied and i

474
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,120
think again in the future we probably

475
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,240
will be using cannabis as a medication

476
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,440
assisted treatment

477
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:09,600
for opiate opiate use disorder but for

478
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,040
right now i stick with buprenorphine

479
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
and methadone and i do prescribe

480
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:14,399
buprenorphine to my patients

481
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,000
that are addicted to opiates we're not

482
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,240
allowed to prescribe methadone

483
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,519
in clinic we are for chronic pain but

484
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,560
not for addiction it's really

485
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,560
an old-fashioned law so

486
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:26,799
what is sort of the course of treatment

487
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,838
if you know i'm addicted to opioids and

488
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:30,319
i come with you

489
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:32,320
i come to you sort of what's your what's

490
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,879
your plan of action

491
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,399
well um we have a great team at mgh uh

492
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,799
we have a fantastic team

493
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,159
and we do a just an unbelievable job

494
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,559
with opiate addiction

495
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,360
we have a recovery coach we have an

496
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:46,000
addiction

497
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,680
psychiatrist we have a social worker

498
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,679
that links everybody together

499
00:16:47,679 --> 00:16:52,719
we have the primary care doctors all of

500
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:55,120
them prescribe suboxone or buprenorphine

501
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,600
um if you're sick we have a great

502
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,519
addiction console team in the hospital

503
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,120
and we have a bridge clinic that bridges

504
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:03,120
people from the inpatient to the

505
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,838
outpatient so no one gets lost

506
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:07,279
in the cracks and every single one of

507
00:17:05,838 --> 00:17:10,480
our er doctors

508
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:12,480
is uh certified to prescribe suboxone

509
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,959
so no matter where you come in my

510
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,318
hospital you get hooked up with suboxone

511
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,880
and you get hooked up with a primary

512
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,759
care doctor to follow up with you

513
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,360
and you get hooked up um with a recovery

514
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:23,679
coach someone who's not going to judge

515
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,479
you

516
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,360
who's in recovery who's going to connect

517
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,798
with you

518
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,678
if you're a complicated case you get

519
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:33,038
hooked up with a addiction

520
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,640
who could also help with the you know

521
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,759
people who are addicted also very

522
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
frequently have

523
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,679
untreated anxiety and depression so

524
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:42,160
someone who can help

525
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,840
disentangle that or childhood trauma

526
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,798
help you with that so we have a very

527
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,480
coherent

528
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:51,038
and comprehensive addiction

529
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,759
addiction team in my hospital what i can

530
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,759
add

531
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:55,038
is i can add medical cannabis to

532
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:56,798
patients which

533
00:17:55,038 --> 00:17:58,400
in some studies has been shown to

534
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:00,319
increase retention

535
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,440
in buprenorphine programs but it

536
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,439
certainly can help

537
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,120
with the chronic pain the anxiety and

538
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,759
the insomnia as well

539
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,639
uh that's not technically an official

540
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,480
quote-unquote

541
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,679
part of our addiction team because it's

542
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,200
controversial

543
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,919
um addiction uh physicians are

544
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,679
there's a continuum among how accepting

545
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,320
doctors are of cannabis

546
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
and addiction uh physicians and

547
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:25,038
psychiatrists in general tend to be less

548
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,440
accepting

549
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,119
than doctors in general whereas

550
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,480
oncologists for example tend to be

551
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:31,839
extremely accepting

552
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,919
because the oncologists see that all

553
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:35,678
their patients benefit um it's very

554
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,320
complicated and a whole other discussion

555
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,720
why

556
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:40,000
addiction uh psychiatrists are are sort

557
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,000
of against cannabis

558
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,759
you could come up with a very cynical

559
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,759
explanation or you could come up with a

560
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:48,960
less cynical explanation but

561
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:50,960
so it's um but they tend to be uh

562
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,960
a little bit less supportive of it but

563
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,240
um the team that i work with the teams

564
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,519
that i work with at mgh are very

565
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:57,200
supportive of it and we've just had a

566
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,960
lot of success

567
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,240
that's great to hear so it sounds like

568
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,919
cannabis is

569
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
sort of a supplemental drug in this

570
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,520
this whole program that you guys have

571
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,440
put together

572
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:11,200
yeah it's supplemental people are

573
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,360
accepting of it um

574
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
you know but again i would have to say

575
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,759
that in my hospital

576
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,600
you know just like everywhere it depends

577
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,558
who you talk to if you talk to certain

578
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:23,199
doctors

579
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,079
cannabis is a helpful wellness tool and

580
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,720
if you talk to other

581
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:28,159
doctors it's like the devil's lettuce we

582
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,279
have a split just like you have

583
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,279
everywhere else

584
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:32,480
so you're talking to me and i'm a

585
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:34,639
supporter of it

586
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:36,000
um you there are other doctors in my

587
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,720
hospital that you could talk to that

588
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
would

589
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,400
completely disagree with what i just

590
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,640
said over the last five minutes

591
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,440
so it's not like all doctors have this

592
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,240
monolithic

593
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,558
acceptance of it there's a wide variety

594
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,558
of

595
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,759
of opinions some of which is very

596
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:51,839
negative so

597
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:54,558
it we do have a long way to go towards

598
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,918
universal acceptance

599
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:57,839
yeah and how do we break through there

600
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
is it just we need to we need more data

601
00:19:57,839 --> 00:20:01,839
we need more clinical trials

602
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,839
well we're getting there we need more

603
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:05,519
data we need more clinical trials we

604
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,519
need more time

605
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,679
acceptance is heading in the right

606
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:11,359
direction across the board with patients

607
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,280
with doctors with nurses

608
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,519
with healthcare professionals across all

609
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:19,038
age groups as we legalize

610
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:21,119
the sky doesn't fall as people get more

611
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:23,038
clinical experience with it it gets less

612
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,599
stigmatized as people

613
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:26,319
see relatives that benefit from medical

614
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,798
cannabis

615
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,678
and they use it and they don't become a

616
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:31,839
motivational

617
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,440
and irresponsible and they don't just

618
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,038
sit in the sofa and eat doritos all day

619
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,360
they actually go on with their lives

620
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:38,960
they actually um you know their lives

621
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:40,479
can actually be enhanced

622
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,759
if they're not suffering from insomnia

623
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,519
and chronic pain they actually can be

624
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:45,519
more active and more engaged

625
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,519
so i think with time this is just

626
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,079
getting better but we also need people

627
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,960
to like

628
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:53,119
counter uh the propaganda there's still

629
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,798
a lot of propaganda out there like

630
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,239
uh just yesterday there was a very

631
00:20:54,798 --> 00:20:56,879
disappointing piece in the new york

632
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,640
times

633
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
that was based on a very disappointing

634
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,679
book that was sort of dressed up to look

635
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,600
like a medical

636
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,360
textbook which i've actually been

637
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,798
reading and tweeting and making fun of

638
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,399
for the last three weeks

639
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,000
and it just calls itself an

640
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,080
evidence-based approach

641
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,679
but it and again it's dressed up for

642
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:14,240
doctors and it looks like a textbook but

643
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,559
it just

644
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,240
cherry picks on the evidence that's

645
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:19,759
against cannabis i guess it is an

646
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,440
evidence-based approach but

647
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:23,038
it's not really a balanced

648
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,038
evidence-based approach if you just take

649
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,640
all the evidence against cannabis

650
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:28,960
and put it in the book and ignore all

651
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,520
the evidence in favor of cannabis

652
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,319
so we really do need people to be

653
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:34,319
vigilant

654
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:35,519
to look at the studies um some of the

655
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:37,359
studies

656
00:21:35,519 --> 00:21:39,038
about cannabis are really helpful and

657
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:40,959
really valid and people that are

658
00:21:39,038 --> 00:21:42,640
pro-cannabis need to accept

659
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,000
the valid studies that show negative

660
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,759
things about cannabis

661
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,839
just like people who are anti-cannabis

662
00:21:45,759 --> 00:21:48,640
need to accept the valid studies that

663
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:50,399
show things

664
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,400
about the medical benefits of cannabis

665
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,720
both sides need to behave better

666
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
but some of the studies are still these

667
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
propaganda

668
00:21:55,599 --> 00:22:00,240
attack studies so you need to you know

669
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,880
they're just trying to show harm

670
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,839
for no re you know just as as part of

671
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,159
like a social

672
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,199
statement not as part of advancing our

673
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,600
science base

674
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,600
so we just need you know neutral

675
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,359
skeptical people to look at the studies

676
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:15,119
to contextualize them

677
00:22:13,359 --> 00:22:17,199
if they're helpful to say this is

678
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,119
helpful all right we shouldn't use it

679
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,558
i'm just making this up during pregnancy

680
00:22:19,119 --> 00:22:21,759
and other people to look at the studies

681
00:22:20,558 --> 00:22:24,240
and say all right look

682
00:22:21,759 --> 00:22:26,000
teen use hasn't gone up 50 times in

683
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,079
colorado since they legalized

684
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,279
it this is bs so we need to really

685
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,839
evaluate the literature

686
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:33,359
objectively we need to educate people

687
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:35,519
accept the harms

688
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:37,119
we need to i think not have

689
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,960
self-inflicted injuries

690
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:41,439
i think there's no reason to make

691
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,798
cannabis into gummy bears that pets

692
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,640
and little kids are going to eat that's

693
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,519
just a self-inflicted injury and is

694
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,360
dangerous

695
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,879
if cannabis is medicine make it look and

696
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:50,719
taste like medicine

697
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,320
i know a lot of people get got upset

698
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,798
when i wrote a blog about this but

699
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,759
i really firmly believe it so but i

700
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:58,400
think with time

701
00:22:55,759 --> 00:23:00,400
and with like people being responsible

702
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:04,480
and with good information out there

703
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,480
um this is all gonna fall into place

704
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,919
yeah i think that's a a great point to

705
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,000
say that

706
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,000
you know we do need to be accepting of

707
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,720
the harms of cannabis because they do

708
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,038
exist

709
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,000
um and that's and that's okay as long as

710
00:23:17,038 --> 00:23:21,679
we know what they are

711
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,200
and can can act responsibly but i think

712
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,519
you know especially being in this

713
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,840
industry people get kind of wrapped up

714
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:28,319
and

715
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:29,918
and kind of presented as this panacea

716
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:32,158
and with no downsides but

717
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,480
that's that's not always the case right

718
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,520
and it's particularly difficult because

719
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,319
the government spent 80 years like

720
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:42,240
only funding studies about harm and a

721
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:46,399
lot of the studies were just bs

722
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,319
you know give a monkey like 80 000 times

723
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,000
you know the amount of cannabis i'm

724
00:23:48,319 --> 00:23:52,079
exaggerating a little bit that a human

725
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,599
would take and then the monkeys you know

726
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,119
unconscious for four days and they'll be

727
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:56,798
like cannabis makes you

728
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,639
unconscious you know they just do these

729
00:23:56,798 --> 00:24:01,440
ridiculous studies so

730
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,720
people don't trust the anti-cannabis

731
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,278
literature because

732
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,798
it's really was abused by the government

733
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:09,679
and it was misused

734
00:24:06,798 --> 00:24:11,278
or parroted sort of unreflectively by

735
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:13,440
the medical establishment

736
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:14,798
so there's a lot of distrust and i think

737
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,120
the medical establishment

738
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:18,079
and the scientific establishment needs

739
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,839
to regain

740
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:21,918
the trust it would be great if they

741
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,278
acknowledged

742
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,600
their role in it i think that would

743
00:24:23,278 --> 00:24:27,599
really help to to regain trust

744
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,798
but the problem is that none of the

745
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,959
pro-cannabis people

746
00:24:28,798 --> 00:24:32,480
trust with good reason any of the

747
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,240
anti-cannabis studies

748
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,440
but that leads to another problem is

749
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,120
that some of these studies that are

750
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,720
coming out are really good

751
00:24:37,119 --> 00:24:41,278
and you can't just ignore these good

752
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,319
studies but i understand the distrust

753
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:48,240
so we've got a complicated situation

754
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:49,439
absolutely and one of the things that

755
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
you mentioned before

756
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,880
is that when cannabis is legalized in

757
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,120
these states that the sky doesn't fall

758
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,320
but one of the things that does fall and

759
00:24:57,119 --> 00:25:00,798
that i know you've written about

760
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:02,960
before is opioid prescriptions and

761
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,720
opioid overdoses so there definitely is

762
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
something going on there with cannabis

763
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,319
and

764
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:12,159
in opioids yeah well in colorado

765
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:14,960
medicare d prescriptions across the

766
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,720
board fell wow not just for opiates and

767
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,640
i think that you know people

768
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,079
were just taking a puff instead of

769
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,759
waiting to see their doctor and getting

770
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:22,960
a muscle relaxant

771
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,119
instead of trying to get a prescription

772
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,798
for viagra they take a puff

773
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:27,839
instead of getting an opiate they just

774
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:29,759
take apart i think people were

775
00:25:27,839 --> 00:25:31,199
self-medicating with cannabis instead of

776
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,599
trying to get an ambient prescription

777
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,558
from their doctor or benzodiazepine

778
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:36,319
they'd like

779
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:37,759
take it puff off their vaporizer i think

780
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:38,960
people were self-treating and i think

781
00:25:37,759 --> 00:25:40,960
that they

782
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,079
were realizing that you cannabis does so

783
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,679
many different things and the

784
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,319
endocannabinoid system

785
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,759
is involved in so many different aspects

786
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,599
of our body that

787
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:51,278
it really does have a lot of different

788
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:52,480
effects and if you know how to use it

789
00:25:51,278 --> 00:25:55,679
you can treat

790
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:57,120
many things that these different

791
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:01,200
pharmaceutical

792
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:03,278
agents that do one thing can treat

793
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,880
you know which is why i think initially

794
00:26:03,278 --> 00:26:05,599
at least the pharmaceutical companies

795
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,240
donated

796
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:09,278
so much money to the anti-side of the

797
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,400
cannabis

798
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,200
referendums and with opiate um with

799
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,640
opiates

800
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,360
one study showed that the opiate

801
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:19,440
overdoses dropped but then another study

802
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:20,719
re-evaluated it later and it's

803
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,080
questionable whether the opiate

804
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,480
overdoses

805
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:26,000
dropped yet i'm sure that they will be

806
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,960
dropping because so many people are

807
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,759
using cannabis

808
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,798
instead of opiates but it might be just

809
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,679
too early to

810
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:35,359
show that um but certainly the opiate

811
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,080
prescriptions are dropping that's been

812
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:39,119
shown

813
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,918
in so many studies and it follows that

814
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,678
if the opiate

815
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,080
people are using cannabis instead of

816
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,480
opiates it's hard to imagine that the

817
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:48,720
opiate overdoses won't be dropping

818
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,240
and then finally at least three states

819
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,400
these exchange programs where you could

820
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,000
exchange your opiates for cannabis

821
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,600
so i mean it's how do you it's hard to

822
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,240
overdose on opiates if you're using

823
00:26:55,599 --> 00:26:59,519
cannabis

824
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:02,880
it's like you know apples and oranges

825
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:03,839
so um i i honestly think it's going to

826
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,120
be

827
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,599
extremely valuable in helping us work

828
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:09,519
through

829
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,759
the opiate crisis of course the opiate

830
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,240
crisis has gotten much worse

831
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,319
in the very short term because of the

832
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,079
covid pandemic so sort of all bets are

833
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,079
off and it's going to be impossible

834
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:22,398
to sort of evaluate what's contributed

835
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,759
to what last year this year and probably

836
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:25,119
the next year because

837
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:26,640
everything's out of whack you can't

838
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,000
really compare this year to anything and

839
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,000
the overdoses

840
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,519
are up so it's going to be really hard

841
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,359
to like sort of analyze

842
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,158
what what happened to what and what role

843
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:36,158
cannabis played

844
00:27:36,798 --> 00:27:40,639
yeah that's a great point and one of the

845
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:43,038
things that you mentioned too was

846
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,840
it's not just opioids that people are

847
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,519
substituting

848
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:47,038
with cannabis it's it's other

849
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:48,558
medications as well and

850
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:51,038
and you're right the endocannabinoid

851
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,440
system is involved in so many different

852
00:27:51,038 --> 00:27:54,398
body systems it's almost like why not

853
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,320
try cannabis

854
00:27:54,398 --> 00:27:58,319
responsibly and see if it helps

855
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,038
right and these days it's such a pain to

856
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:05,359
like see your doctor

857
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,919
and go to the pharmacy and get a

858
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:11,759
prescription and pay a co-payment

859
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,960
and um you know these drugs have

860
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:18,558
side effects like ambien

861
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,919
you know people driving ambien and don't

862
00:28:18,558 --> 00:28:21,599
remember they were driving something

863
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,880
like ten percent of traffic accidents

864
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,439
have ambien in them

865
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,440
or they wake up and they're like who ate

866
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,759
all the food in the refrigerator and

867
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,519
left all the wrappers in the table and

868
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:32,879
it turns out it was like them

869
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:34,319
and they don't remember it because they

870
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,799
were an ambient and they were in this

871
00:28:34,319 --> 00:28:38,960
weird dissociative state like

872
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,038
an ambient might even affect your

873
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
dementia risk like

874
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,278
it's hard to argue the cannabis for an

875
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:47,038
adult is not a thousand times safer than

876
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:49,919
ambient for example

877
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:51,119
so not only is it more convenient in the

878
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,000
legal state but it's

879
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:56,000
probably a lot safer i mean the

880
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,079
opponents of cannabis go on and on and

881
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,960
on about the harms and the risks

882
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:01,359
and there are harms and risks

883
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,278
unquestionably

884
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:04,879
but you've got to compare it to what

885
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:06,558
else we'd be using

886
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,080
you can't just talk about the harms and

887
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:09,918
the risks in

888
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,079
a vacuum you've got to talk about the

889
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:14,559
relative harms and risks

890
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,439
and you know melatonin is good for sleep

891
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,240
and that seems pretty

892
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,440
risk-free but melatonin doesn't work for

893
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,200
that many people

894
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,480
but then once you move beyond melatonin

895
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,840
to the ambience

896
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,519
the tricyclics which can give you

897
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,678
arrhythmias the benzodiazepines like

898
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,038
valium which are so addictive or ambien

899
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,640
which we just talked about

900
00:29:31,038 --> 00:29:36,158
it's really hard to make an argument

901
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,159
that those are safer than cannabis

902
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,558
yeah we've if we've talked a lot about

903
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:44,639
using cannabis

904
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:47,839
for opioid addiction but can it be used

905
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:50,399
for other addictions as well

906
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:52,000
well i think cbd is going to have a huge

907
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,199
role in addiction

908
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,558
there is pre-clinical research and

909
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,840
some clinical research um the cbd can

910
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:04,000
help with cravings

911
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,000
cue induced cravings um

912
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,158
they studied it in animals for cocaine

913
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,240
addiction for methamphetamine

914
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,480
addiction there's been some preliminary

915
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,480
research actually for cannabis addiction

916
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,519
and then for there's been human studies

917
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,720
for tobacco

918
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:19,599
addiction and some for um opiate

919
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,120
addiction

920
00:30:19,599 --> 00:30:24,959
and cbd really um shows a lot of

921
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:27,519
potential there's a lot of studying

922
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,519
that we still have to do but cbd

923
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,798
preliminarily seems like it has a lot of

924
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:32,639
potential to help

925
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:34,079
people with the cravings and the

926
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,440
rumination

927
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:40,079
and the urges to continue using um

928
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,038
so i think cbd is going to have a a huge

929
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:44,639
role

930
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:48,079
and then um for cannabis in general

931
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,880
um i think for withdrawal symptoms i

932
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:52,319
mean for

933
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,480
many drugs when you withdraw you have

934
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,480
anxiety you have insomnia and you have

935
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,679
this general feeling of ill ease and

936
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,360
discomfort

937
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:01,440
and i think cannabis is going to prove

938
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:04,719
to be very helpful for the withdrawal

939
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:06,399
symptoms so you know with opiates uh

940
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
it co-works on some of the same

941
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:10,079
receptors so i think it's particularly

942
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,120
helpful for opiate

943
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:14,240
uh withdrawal but i think in general um

944
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,479
you know you're withdrawing from

945
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,720
nicotine you feel grumpy

946
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,000
you feel irritable a cannabis can be

947
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,440
very helpful for that kind of thing so i

948
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,319
think cannabis is going to be helpful

949
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,640
but i think

950
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:26,000
on a kind of neurochemical level cbd is

951
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,559
going to target the addiction very

952
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,558
specifically

953
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,038
so that's interesting so if i'm

954
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,558
understanding correctly it's almost like

955
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:39,038
cannabis is used more to quell the

956
00:31:36,558 --> 00:31:40,960
unpleasant trees of withdrawals and less

957
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,879
as sort of a replacement

958
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:48,319
for the drug itself is that

959
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
accurate right yes but with opiates it

960
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,158
might turn out to be

961
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:52,798
enough of a replacement we'll have to

962
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:56,000
see

963
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,319
because so many people say that it works

964
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,319
it just hasn't been shown yet officially

965
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:02,079
to reduce overdoses and deaths

966
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,359
so i don't feel comfortable like using

967
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:05,839
it in that manner

968
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:08,959
sure you know something that's serious

969
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:12,000
you have to go with the evidence

970
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,480
absolutely and do we understand

971
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,038
sort of which cannabinoids or compounds

972
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,038
within

973
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,200
cannabis are are really kind of doing

974
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:22,480
the heavy lifting here is it's is it thc

975
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,480
cbd a combination

976
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,880
well um you mean for the for the opiate

977
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,918
yes

978
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:35,600
replacement um well i think certainly

979
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,600
thc is a big part of it because

980
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,360
that um what we

981
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:43,519
the short answer is we we don't know yet

982
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,359
the medium answer is that thc plays a

983
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:46,960
role in cbd plays a role

984
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:48,479
um because of all the different

985
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,960
receptors that they hit and there's some

986
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:53,839
overlap with the opiate receptors

987
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:54,720
and cbd is really complicated in how it

988
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:56,639
works

989
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,399
and there's a bunch of theories about

990
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,640
how it can potentially help with

991
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,000
addiction but they're not quite sure

992
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,399
how it works yet because cbd affects

993
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,919
like

994
00:33:04,398 --> 00:33:07,839
a ton of receptors and i don't think

995
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,480
they're quite sure how it affects

996
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:11,678
addiction

997
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:13,839
um i'm not quite sure how to um

998
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,960
how to explain how cbd would in

999
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:16,240
particular

1000
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,759
affect addiction i've read a bunch of

1001
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,278
articles on it but it's very complex

1002
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:24,319
sure okay and so winding down here we

1003
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:25,599
talked earlier about

1004
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:28,240
sort of acknowledging some of the

1005
00:33:25,599 --> 00:33:29,038
downsides of cannabis so i wanted to ask

1006
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,919
you

1007
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,480
um is cannabis addiction a real thing or

1008
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,080
at least

1009
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:38,399
dependence yes absolutely

1010
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:39,359
people can get very dependent on

1011
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,319
cannabis

1012
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,278
people can overuse it people can have a

1013
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,000
hard time

1014
00:33:43,278 --> 00:33:47,038
getting off it and it can be very

1015
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,200
difficult

1016
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,359
once per a person has been using

1017
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,880
cannabis

1018
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,119
for a long time to know whether it's

1019
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:58,399
help cannabis is helping them sleep

1020
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:59,759
or whether not using cannabis is keeping

1021
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:02,558
them awake because they you know if they

1022
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,640
don't use it they can't sleep

1023
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:07,119
so it could be a fine line between

1024
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,679
cannabis is treating their insomnia

1025
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,519
or not using cannabis is causing their

1026
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:13,838
insomnia it could be a very fine line

1027
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,280
you can get physical dependence

1028
00:34:13,838 --> 00:34:18,239
and you could definitely have withdrawal

1029
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,480
symptoms and you know they could be

1030
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,759
they're not anything like opiate

1031
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,039
withdrawal symptoms like

1032
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,359
you're not like feeling like you're

1033
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:25,679
gonna die you know as i like to say no

1034
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:28,000
one

1035
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,519
robs pharmacies no one's like breaking

1036
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,239
into dispensaries because they're that

1037
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:32,878
sick

1038
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,078
from a cannabis withdrawal whereas you

1039
00:34:32,878 --> 00:34:35,440
know people do

1040
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,280
i'm not trying to stigmatize any

1041
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:38,800
addiction but you know people get so

1042
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,519
sick with opioid withdrawal they do like

1043
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,960
the

1044
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:44,480
craziest things to get drugs um but

1045
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,480
at the same time you know if you use

1046
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,719
cannabis every day your receptors

1047
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,079
down regulate because you're always

1048
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,480
bombarding them

1049
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:54,800
with external cannabinoids and so

1050
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,800
they're fewer and farther between

1051
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
so then if you stop using it your

1052
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,240
natural endocannabinoids

1053
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:04,480
have many fewer receptors to work on

1054
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,319
and so you have a relative

1055
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,679
endocannabinoid deficiency

1056
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
and you have withdrawal you have

1057
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:13,118
grumpiness insomnia

1058
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,240
lack of appetite irritability

1059
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,358
um probably pain sensitivity so

1060
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:22,319
people do have withdrawal and

1061
00:35:19,358 --> 00:35:22,880
uh they do have tolerance obviously

1062
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,599
people

1063
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,079
you know use more as they go along so

1064
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,320
people

1065
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,880
can definitely get dependent and the way

1066
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,119
i view addiction is

1067
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,640
continued use despite negative

1068
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,440
consequences

1069
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:39,199
and we all know people that should stop

1070
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,240
smoking for one reason or another and

1071
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:41,838
just can't

1072
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:43,439
like they have a drug test coming up for

1073
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,000
work but they can't do it

1074
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,639
or i have a patient who i'm pretty sure

1075
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,960
has

1076
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:50,879
cannabis hyperemesis syndrome he ends up

1077
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,480
in the emergency room

1078
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,039
every month barfing and having to stay

1079
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,519
overnight and i'm like can you

1080
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:58,239
let's just stop smoking for three months

1081
00:35:57,519 --> 00:36:00,320
if you

1082
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,358
still end up in the emergency room every

1083
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,480
night then it's

1084
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:05,920
cyclic vomiting syndrome if you stop

1085
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,679
vomiting and don't end up in the

1086
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,200
emergency room then by definition it's

1087
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:12,000
cannabis hyperemesis

1088
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,480
it goes away if you stop the cannabis

1089
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,280
that's

1090
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,920
literally the only way to distinguish

1091
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,839
between

1092
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,159
cyclic vomiting syndrome and cannabis

1093
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:22,559
hyperemesis is to take the cannabis

1094
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:23,440
away and my patient's having a really

1095
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:26,159
hard time doing that

1096
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,639
and i would call that continued use

1097
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:28,319
despite

1098
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,879
negative consequences i would call that

1099
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,880
an addiction

1100
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:34,240
yeah i certainly would yeah and you

1101
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,358
mentioned

1102
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:40,879
cannabis hyper hyperemesis is that the

1103
00:36:37,358 --> 00:36:42,960
frequent pronunciation and this

1104
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:46,240
means barfing a lot it's just how

1105
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,240
doctors used latin words

1106
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,440
yeah i first became aware of that

1107
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:51,039
condition

1108
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,440
at the last canmed event where we

1109
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:55,199
actually had a panel about it

1110
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,200
and um that was that was really

1111
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,879
fascinating and i think it's a it's a

1112
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,559
conditional not a lot of people know

1113
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,760
about um i don't know if you want to

1114
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,759
speak a bit more to that

1115
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,960
oh sure well it was under diagnosed

1116
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,880
because when it was

1117
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,159
cannabis was illegal no one would

1118
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,880
mention that they're using cannabis

1119
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:12,239
because they didn't want to have their

1120
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,079
kids taken away

1121
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:15,759
now it's over diagnosed because it's

1122
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:17,760
like a trendy diagnosis that all the

1123
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,200
emergency room doctors are making

1124
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,599
any time that people come in vomiting

1125
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,118
and

1126
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,280
cannabis is anywhere on their list or

1127
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,480
they mention cannabis using

1128
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:31,519
but in reality it's a fairly rare but

1129
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,400
real and significant condition where

1130
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:36,239
it's thought that cannabis um suppresses

1131
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,039
nausea for example with chemotherapy

1132
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:39,358
patients

1133
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,599
but if you use a lot of it over a long

1134
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:43,920
period of time and this is the theory

1135
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,440
you can overstimulate the receptor

1136
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,240
probably the trpv

1137
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,519
receptor and then you have a paradoxical

1138
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:52,239
reaction and it causes

1139
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:53,039
uncontrolled vomiting and it's really

1140
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,000
uncomfortable

1141
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:57,599
it's not responsive to your traditional

1142
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,320
medications for vomiting

1143
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,240
ironically it's sometimes responsible

1144
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,838
it's responsive to like a

1145
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,519
hot shower or hot bath um or held all

1146
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:09,838
that antipsychotic that

1147
00:38:07,519 --> 00:38:10,639
is just awful uh can make it go away as

1148
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,759
well

1149
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,358
but it's very hard to distinguish from

1150
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,160
something called cyclic vomiting

1151
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:18,639
syndrome

1152
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,159
which is just vomiting for no reason

1153
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:22,159
every once in a while

1154
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:24,319
and the only way to distinguish it again

1155
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:26,239
is to take away the cannabis for like

1156
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,519
a couple months and see if the vomiting

1157
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:28,959
goes away

1158
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:31,119
so that's actually a really good test to

1159
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,639
see if someone's dependent on cannabis

1160
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:35,440
if they could stop or not

1161
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:35,920
because you know if your doctor who for

1162
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,320
example

1163
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,920
is very pro-cannabis doctor says you

1164
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,240
have to stop for three months

1165
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:43,680
there's no stigma there's no shame

1166
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,479
there's just we want to see if you're

1167
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,480
vomiting

1168
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,400
is because of cannabis and you can't

1169
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,159
stop that would be an example of someone

1170
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,160
who has a real problem with cannabis

1171
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:55,279
i would definitely agree um like i said

1172
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,358
we

1173
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,800
had a few people on the panel who had

1174
00:38:57,358 --> 00:39:00,960
actually experienced

1175
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,400
the symptoms and describe them on that

1176
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,159
panel and um

1177
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,880
yeah if if stopping cannabis couldn't

1178
00:39:06,159 --> 00:39:09,279
prevent

1179
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,480
some of the things that were described

1180
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,160
then i would definitely call that an

1181
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,719
addiction because it sounded pretty

1182
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:16,319
awful to to go through that

1183
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,319
yeah no i've seen it twice the person

1184

1186
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,118
nothing to do

1187
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,519

so miserable

1191
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,599

like to end the conversation so

and you know every medicine i prescribe

1196
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,400
has potential harms

like there's no medication that i

1198

prescribe as a primary care doctor that

1199
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:54,800
that might not have a bad reaction
