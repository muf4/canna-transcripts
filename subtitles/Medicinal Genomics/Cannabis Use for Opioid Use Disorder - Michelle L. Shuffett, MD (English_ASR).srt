00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,160
hi everyone my name is michelle shuffett

2
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:09,678
and i'm here today on behalf of columbia

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,160
care to talk with you

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,960
a little bit about medical cannabis and

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:16,480
opioids and before i get started i

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,118
actually wanted to just share

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,320
a few stories with you i was

8
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,480
talking with a really good friend of

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,480
mine earlier this week

10
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,118
my business coach and good friend

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,118
karen eldad and we were talking about

12
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:30,960
this topic and

13
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:33,359
and i said to her first of all you know

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,640
i might be a wee bit nervous because

15
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,960
it's the first time i've been in front

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,320
of people in two years so it's kind of

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,558
exciting i don't know if you guys are

18
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,840
excited about it but i i'm nervous and

19
00:00:40,558 --> 00:00:43,039
excited so

20
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,840
bear with me

21
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,159
and

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,800
secondly i asked her

23
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:51,038
do you still think the opioid epidemic

24
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:52,159
is actually a hot topic

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
and

26
00:00:52,159 --> 00:00:56,640
some chuckles right um

27
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,280
and she she laughed as well and she's

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,920
like of course it's a hot topic she's

29
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,719
like you see it in the news every single

30
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
day

31
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,280
whether it's political banter

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,799
updates on lawsuits

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
and overdoses

34
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,960
and as a matter of fact when i woke up

35
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:15,599
this morning and turned on the the tv in

36
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:18,478
the hotel room the very first news story

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:21,118
i saw was about three people

38
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,400
overdosing in a hotel in downtown l.a

39
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:23,599
last night

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,439
and

41
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:26,879
it hasn't changed like it's still a

42
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:29,118
problem

43
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,039
we went on to have a more amusing

44
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:32,719
conversation and i won't torture you

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,360
with with all of it but we we also

46
00:01:32,719 --> 00:01:37,200
talked about uh tv shows

47
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,359
things like breaking bad probably

48
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,560
wouldn't have been quite as interesting

49
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:43,359
without the opioid epidemic fueling it

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,519
and

51
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,519
more recently

52
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:49,118
i think dopesick is actually a great

53
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:50,560
example i don't know how many of you

54
00:01:49,118 --> 00:01:53,280
seen dope sick

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,159
beautiful beautiful show beautiful show

56
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,879
and and i think what dopesick did

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,479
is it humanized the opioid epidemic in

58
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,039
such a beautiful way

59
00:02:00,478 --> 00:02:04,640
from so many different perspectives

60
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,040
whether it was the physician who

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,360
ultimately became the patient or the

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
people in the rural communities and

63
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,319
you know for me personally

64
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
the opioid epidemic was humanized by my

65
00:02:14,318 --> 00:02:17,919
father

66
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:19,119
so i i grew up in a very small town in

67
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:21,919
kentucky

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:24,640
and my father was the local country doc

69
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,759
the family practitioner if you will

70
00:02:24,639 --> 00:02:27,598
and

71
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,000
as he started to see

72
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,919
what these drugs were doing to the rural

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,439
communities around us

74
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,399
he got really interested in trying to

75
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,000
help and he'd always had an interest in

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,360
in addiction medicine and that sort of

77
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,479
thing anyway

78
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,160
so he went through additional

79
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:43,119
certifications he got some other

80
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,799
training

81
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,239
and he ultimately opened one of the

82
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
first suboxone clinics in the area and

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,759
really helped a lot of folks with this

84
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
problem and

85
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:56,239
you know he he made a difference and

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,560
i know he made a difference because at

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,800
his funeral in 2011

88
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,959
there were several of those recovered

89
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
addicts that came you know and they came

90
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,039
to pay their respects they came to say

91
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:09,040
thank you one last time

92
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:10,639
and i i don't share that story because

93
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,959
it's a sad story i share that story

94
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,199
because i think it's very inspiring you

95
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,878
know we we can make a difference and

96
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,878
that's the reason we're all willing to

97
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:21,280
take time out of our busy lives and come

98
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:22,719
to meetings like this is because we we

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,360
truly want to

100
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:27,759
change things and elevate the industry

101
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,920
and try to help help with this

102
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,598
particular problem

103
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,878
so with that we will

104
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,359
jump right in

105
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:37,039
to the lovely hot topic the opioid

106
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
epidemic and

107
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,158
you know these these numbers are from

108
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,680
2020 publications and

109
00:03:42,158 --> 00:03:46,798
i think it's um

110
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,040
it hasn't really changed since

111
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,000
the last time i talked about this on

112
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:54,400
stage in probably 2018 you know we had

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,239
almost 2 million folks misusing

114
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,200
prescription products

115
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,759
for the first time and over 10 million

116
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:03,679
misusing them on a regular basis

117
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:05,039
and the death rate has has only gotten

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,200
higher

119
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:08,400
over 70 000 people died from a drug

120
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,280
overdose

121
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,360
in 2019 according to this data set and

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,878
when you look at the breakdown

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,439
it's not heroin

124
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:19,759
it's not the the street drugs that folks

125
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:21,680
used to die from it's it's the synthetic

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,000
opioids it's the things that are being

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,600
prescribed to these patients

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,279
and quite frankly it's it's very

129
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,240
expensive

130
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,918
this call out is from the cdc

131
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,918
and they talk a lot about the economic

132
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,918
burden it's almost

133
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:37,519
80 billion dollars

134
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,839
billion with a b

135
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:42,000
and that's total health care costs so

136
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,679
that's loss of productivity that's also

137
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,560
direct healthcare

138
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,079
needs and things of that nature so

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,839
when you think about all these things

140
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:51,519
and you think about everything we've

141
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,359
learned over the years what else can we

142
00:04:51,519 --> 00:04:55,680
do to make an impact

143
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,120
what other things can can come into play

144
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,400
here and

145
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,560
i think um

146
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:02,879
we really need to start thinking about

147
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,000
the problem in a very different way

148
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:08,079
and i happen to be a fan of adam grant

149
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,839
so i'm going to use his uh his favorite

150
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:12,319
phrase we we need to we need to think

151
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,719
again about this and really be open to

152
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,959
different solutions and strategies

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,280
and i think cannabis

154
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:20,638
gives us a great opportunity to think

155
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:22,959
again

156
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,360
and one of the first folks that uh open

157
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:26,638
the door to these possibilities was back

158
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,000
hoover

159
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,400
and he was

160
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,959
an associate professor at montefiore

161
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,959
and he and his colleagues were hearing

162
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,359
anecdotally speaking that a lot of the

163
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,079
patients were substituting

164
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,160
their opioid prescriptions with cannabis

165
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,879
when they were able to get it

166
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,400
so they put together a research project

167
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:47,759
and they started to

168
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:49,679
to look at that

169
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,120
and what they found is a really

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,478
interesting trend

171
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,840
they found that

172
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:59,279
between 1999 and 2010

173
00:05:55,839 --> 00:06:03,198
in states that had medical cannabis laws

174
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:06,318
the overdose mortality rate from opioids

175
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,199
was about 25 percent lower

176
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,039
and he even went on to predict that

177
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
medical cannabis would ultimately fall

178
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,360
into the category of alternatives for

179
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,120
treating chronic pain so that folks can

180
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,080
either lower their dose or they can have

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,280
a different option besides opioids and

182
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:26,800
this paper was published in jama in 2014

183
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:29,599
if we move on

184
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,280
nasm provided even more evidence the

185
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
national academies of sciences

186
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,959
engineering and medicine

187
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,038
and their report on the health effects

188
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:38,959
of cannabis and cannabinoids came out in

189
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:41,599
january of 2017

190
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,758
and i haven't looked recently i don't

191
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,680
think it's been updated but if if anyone

192
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,199
knows shout out

193
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,360
but it's a beautiful it's a beautiful

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,759
collection and they determined that

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,000
there are three areas where there's

196
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,560
conclusive or substantial evidence that

197
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,478
cannabis and cannabinoids are effective

198
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,759
and chronic pain in adults was one of

199
00:06:58,478 --> 00:07:02,959
those

200
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,598
so this they based this on about 30

201
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:07,359
randomized control trials about 2500

202
00:07:05,598 --> 00:07:09,759
patients and these were all very small

203
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,400
trials small studies

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,080
but in totality they decided that it was

205
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:15,679
a conclusive effect

206
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,399
and and i've seen a lot of people talk

207
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,079
about this um this set of three as it

208
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:22,478
should be changed to three plus one now

209
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,000
because we have epidiolex which several

210
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:27,120
folks have talked about

211
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,120
over the past few days

212
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:31,359
but ultimately um

213
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:33,199
in a good way by cooper's prediction

214
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,800
actually came true

215
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,160
and in the new england journal of

216
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,319
medicine in 2017 volco and collins

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
added cannabinoids to the treatment of

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,479
chronic pain as a short-term strategy

219
00:07:42,478 --> 00:07:46,478
and also as an intermediate strategy

220
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,840
and since that time and before that time

221
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,800
there's been more and more and more

222
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,519
studies

223
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
i can't begin to highlight all of them i

224
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,719
just wanted to share a few of the key

225
00:07:56,959 --> 00:08:00,799
ones to set up the story because what

226
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,800
we're going to talk about today

227
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
is real world evidence

228
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,520
and that real world evidence comes from

229
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:10,318
the columbia care impact database

230
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:12,719
and impact stands for integrating

231
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,000
marijuana program analytics and current

232
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,879
treatment

233
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,478
and this database came about because of

234
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,199
new york state laws

235
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:23,279
and many states have these same laws but

236
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,160
seed to sale you have to track where the

237
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:28,799
product is going from the moment that it

238
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,560
comes into existence

239
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,158
and you also had the advantage of having

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,080
a lot of information from the patient

241
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:36,479
registration process

242
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,399
so you had to in new york for example

243
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,519
have a qualifying condition

244
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,679
but also an associated or complicating

245
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,679
condition or symptom and most states

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,958
have some variation or iteration of all

247
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:48,559
of these and

248
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,319
what i have listed here are some of the

249
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:52,239
more common ones that are that are

250
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,800
common across states not just not just

251
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,879
relevant to new york

252
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,359
and all these things came together and

253
00:08:56,879 --> 00:09:01,679
in 2013 columbiacare looked at it and

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,000
decided okay let's let's organize all

255
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:05,679
this information and let's put together

256
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
what's essentially

257
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,838
an individual emr for each of the

258
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,759
patients or customers because they do

259
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,399
pay for medical cannabis

260
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,838
and we'll talk about that a little bit

261
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,600
and they were able to put together a

262
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,440
database that contained information on

263
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,600
patient demographics

264
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,600
the conditions the associated conditions

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,278
and symptoms that we talked about

266
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
and the types of products that were

267
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:28,720
purchased so they would understand how

268
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,720
much thc

269
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,639
how much cbd in some states they could

270
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,519
even understand terpenes things of that

271
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:35,679
nature

272
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,839
and then also route of administration

273
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:39,199
were they taking inhaled products oral

274
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
products

275
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:43,759
that sort of thing

276
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,000
the pdmp which

277
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:47,120
might be a bit of a tedious thing for

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,278
some folks

279
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,759
actually comes to be a very very large

280
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:53,278
positive in this case because the pdmp

281
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,080
requires

282
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:57,759
logging of cannabis but also other

283
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,759
controlled substances so they had

284
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:02,399
information on narcotics benzos

285
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:04,159
barbiturates things like lyrica which i

286
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:06,480
think is an interesting one to have in

287
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,879
there but all those things together when

288
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,399
you when you want to do an analysis

289
00:10:08,879 --> 00:10:12,159
you can really start to understand

290
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
what's the most effective

291
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:15,919
product for a certain condition you can

292
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,920
understand a little bit about what

293
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:19,599
product formulation might work the best

294
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:20,958
and a lot of information about dose

295
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,959
ranges

296
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:24,479
and i think the key here and this is

297
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:27,039
something that that bonnie mentioned

298
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,519
during during her presentation is

299
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:32,399
all of these patients are customers they

300
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:35,519
have to actually purchase the cannabis

301
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,360
so understanding that repeat purchases

302
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,600
could be a good surrogate for efficacy

303
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,159
was a really important thing in this in

304
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,159
this case

305
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:46,399
so at this point the the database is

306
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:48,399
quite robust

307
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
and i won't walk through all the numbers

308
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,120
here but

309
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,880
what we're going to do today is is look

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,959
at some of the information associated

311
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,958
with chronic pain and also with

312
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,359
neuropathy and

313
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,679
a good deal of neuropathy involves pain

314
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,278
so it's a it's a really nice

315
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:07,599
nice way to look at two things that are

316
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:10,958
similar but but very different as well

317
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,519
so the first pilot study is neuropathy

318
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:16,078
and what happened is the pharmacists in

319
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:19,360
the dispensaries started to notice that

320
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:21,679
there were a lot of opioid usage

321
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,879
in the peripheral neuropathy patients

322
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:25,199
so they started to look at that

323
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:27,039
relationship and they recruited folks

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,959
ages 18 to 80

325
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,879
who were using opioid products when they

326
00:11:28,958 --> 00:11:32,319
started their medical cannabis

327
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,039
and looked at them over the course of

328
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,200
time and this was a nine-month period

329
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,319
and they found that 62 percent of

330
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,399
patients

331
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,800
were able to stabilize reduce or

332
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,720
eliminate their opioids

333
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:46,799
and that was based on mmes and

334
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,879
calculating the totals over the course

335
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:49,679
of the the time period

336
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:51,120
and

337
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:53,919
the decrease

338
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,078
in in its entirety was a bit different

339
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:59,199
depending on whether the patient was a

340
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,679
new start or a continuing patient so if

341
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
the patient was a new start identified

342
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:06,159
and followed prospectively the decrease

343
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,919
was about 22 percent

344
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,000
if it was someone that was already on

345
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:12,719
the products when they started the study

346
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,919
the decrease was was only about 13.8

347
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:16,480
percent

348
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:17,919
and i think that makes sense logically

349
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,759
because if you have someone who's

350
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:22,159
already on a product they they don't

351
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:24,240
have as much room to change so their

352
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:25,759
their ability to have a delta is reduced

353
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,079
just simply by the fact they've been on

354
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:30,078
it for a while already

355
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:31,679
and as a counterpoint

356
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:35,120
it's it's important to note that about

357
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:37,439
28 actually increased their opioid usage

358
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,519
during that time

359
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,360
they they tried to understand perhaps

360
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,120
what was going on there and a lot of

361
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,680
those patients who did increase their

362
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,679
opioid usage were patients undergoing

363
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,319
cancer treatment and they had cancer

364
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:52,638
treatment related neuropathies so

365
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,240
that that leads you to to believe that

366
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,879
perhaps they were having extremely

367
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,879
severe pain

368
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,839
so this breaks it down in more detail

369
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:07,199
for you and what you'll see on the

370
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,120
y-axis is the total milligrams dispensed

371
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,920
over the time period and it's broken

372
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,000
down into the the three quarters here

373
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,559
and the dark blue bars represent the

374
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,278
total milligrams of thc while the

375
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:21,278
lighter blue are the mmes

376
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:24,159
and as a reminder the

377
00:13:21,278 --> 00:13:26,320
the mmes went down by 21.9 percent in

378
00:13:24,159 --> 00:13:28,879
this particular group and if you look at

379
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,560
the slope of the line sort of that dash

380
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:33,519
dark blue line towards the bottom of the

381
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,359
slide you'll see that the thc didn't

382
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,759
particularly change

383
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,759
and that was probably maybe the most

384
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:41,120
exciting thing about it because when

385
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:42,799
they started to do this they were

386
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,120
incredibly worried that all people were

387
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,120
doing is substituting one problem for

388
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,639
another and they found out that wasn't

389
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,159
the case which is really fantastic

390
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,480
these data were pretty

391
00:13:52,159 --> 00:13:56,078
exciting to a group of researchers in

392
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,920
new york and

393
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,479
researchers from the new york

394
00:13:57,919 --> 00:14:02,399
psychiatric institute and and npi i

395
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,480
think is typically called

396
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,360
they verified that data they used it to

397
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,680
apply for a nida grant successfully and

398
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,919
they're still doing some analysis of a

399
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,919
much more expanded data set right now

400
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:20,399
um this i don't i'll be honest i don't

401
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,039
know a ton about but

402
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,720
i read it yesterday it popped up in a

403
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:25,599
medscape article

404
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,920
and

405
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,079
real world evidence is catching on

406
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,919
some of you may have been at jeff chen's

407
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:35,039
presentation earlier today talking about

408
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:36,879
real world evidence and cbd

409
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,399
this is additional real world evidence

410
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:42,799
on cannabis and it came out of the

411
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,399
american academy of orthopedic surgeons

412
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,599
meeting which happened in

413
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,720
march

414
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,079
and they looked at chronic back pain and

415
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,160
osteoarthritis and they found that those

416
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,958
with chronic back pain

417
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,439
had

418
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:57,359
a significant reduction in mmes when

419
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,839
they started medical cannabis

420
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,680
and they used the pdmp as well and it

421
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
was a pretty long study period about 18

422
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,039
months

423
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:08,000
and more than one-third of the patients

424
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:10,000
stopped taking their opioids altogether

425
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
and in the oa group

426
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,399
very similar results it looks to be a

427
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,079
shorter study period and and again i

428
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,120
haven't been able to find the original

429
00:15:16,078 --> 00:15:19,198
pieces

430
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,240
i made the slide on the plane on the way

431
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:24,399
here as a matter of fact

432
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,240
but again about a third of the

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,919
the patients stopped using their opioids

434
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,000
so i think it's really interesting and i

435
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:34,000
think folks are placing a lot more value

436
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
on what's happening in in the real world

437
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,480
so what other lessons can we learn from

438
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,800
impact

439
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,800
how to use medical cannabis for pain you

440
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,799
know i think eloise went through

441
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,519
really great insights there and i won't

442
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:49,838
spend too much time time on this but

443
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,000
when you think about it all pain is not

444
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,759
created equal and you know that some

445
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,679
pain might respond better to a higher

446
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:57,839
cbd product while other

447
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:00,159
other pain elements might respond better

448
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,759
to a higher thc product

449
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:04,399
and if we skip over to the far right

450
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,759
hand side of the slide the higher cbd

451
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,958
products tend to do better for

452
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:12,000
neuropathic pain and inflammation

453
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:14,078
whereas the higher thc products respond

454
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,320
better to the types of pain

455
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,319
that typically require opioids

456
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,959
the actual drug delivery type matters a

457
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,360
lot as well and what the pharmacists

458
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:30,078
have found in looking at these patients

459
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,399
using medical cannabis for pain is most

460
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,479
folks use more than one delivery type

461
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,559
and if you think about it it makes makes

462
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:38,480
perfect sense and we can use the sort of

463
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:40,638
illustrated pk on the right-hand side

464
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,959
there to help us understand that

465
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,320
so the the dark blue line represents uh

466
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,159
inhalation

467
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,759
so the peak goes up really quickly it's

468
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:50,159
rapid onset

469
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,879
lasts for a little bit maybe maybe two

470
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,958
hours comes down just as quickly so

471
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:56,720
that's really nice for breakthrough pain

472
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,078
so you're going about your your daily

473
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,079
life

474
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,159
you have bouts of pain but you don't

475
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:04,078
want to have any sort of negative impact

476
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:07,439
related to an adverse event you want to

477
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:09,918
click on quick off and keep going

478
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,720
whereas oral products the gray line on

479
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,520
that pk chart have a much

480
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:17,759
a much softer slope a softer rise

481
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,078
they last a good bit longer anywhere

482
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,000
from six to ten hours and then they they

483
00:17:20,078 --> 00:17:23,678
go off slowly as well

484
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,119
and that's really important when you

485
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,280
think about things like being able to

486
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,959
sleep through the night if you have pain

487
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:31,279
that prevents you from sleeping you you

488
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,519
want something that lasts a bit longer

489
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,079
and then sublingual falls more or less

490
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:37,279
right in the middle of those two

491
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:41,599
i'm not going to particularly talk about

492
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:43,119
transdermal there's a lot of i think

493
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:44,959
there's not as much understanding there

494
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:47,759
of exactly how that works whether it's

495
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:49,519
just about the actual physical

496
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:51,519
application of the product causing some

497
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,000
pain relief versus being penetration

498
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:55,679
things like that but i think there's uh

499
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,279
there's folks here much more qualified

500
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,360
to talk about that than than i would be

501
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:04,480
um and now we'll go into the details of

502
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:06,319
that chronic pain versus neuropathy

503
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,440
so these are some of the chronic pain

504
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,678
patients

505
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,840
and to be included in this analysis you

506
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,519
had to have at least three purchases so

507
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,199
typically about three months worth of

508
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,038
use of the product

509
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,679
and the chronic pain patients on average

510
00:18:17,038 --> 00:18:22,319
were about 53 years old more or less an

511
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,280
equal balance male female

512
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,439
and the most common prescribed ratio

513
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:29,359
was a high thc product

514
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,120
and i use the word prescribed even

515
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,199
though the technical word is is

516
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:34,959
recommended because they would come into

517
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,880
the pharmacy and have this

518
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,960
recommendation this prescription if you

519
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,720
will but they didn't necessarily have to

520
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,360
buy those products the pharmacist had

521
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,519
the leeway to change it in most cases

522
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:48,000
and the most common product purchase

523
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,839
aligned in this particular instance so

524
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:54,400
55 were choosing the high thc products

525
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:56,558
and when you look at the per milligram

526
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:59,120
daily dose

527
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:01,918
you see that it's not tremendously high

528
00:18:59,119 --> 00:19:04,959
even when you compare the first

529
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,480
invoice versus the most recent invoice

530
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
and we use the word invoice when we're

531
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,919
talking about it because again it's a

532
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,679
purchase and you're looking at what was

533
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,280
on that invoice that gets recorded in

534
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,519
the pdmp

535
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,079
and the the two horizontal lines

536
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:19,519
recommend reflect the mean

537
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:21,918
and what you see

538
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,400
is the mean value for the first

539
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,600
is 24.5 milligrams

540
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,160
and for the most recent was 35.

541
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:32,159
now if we switch to neuropathy

542
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,840
we're going to see some differences in

543
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
this information

544
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:38,558
so the average age for the neuropathy

545
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,960
patients was a bit older and they tended

546
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:44,160
to be more men than women

547
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,400
same most common prescribed ratio that

548
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:48,080
higher thc product

549
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,360
but when you look at the actual

550
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:52,000
purchases

551
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:54,000
you see some differences here so it's

552
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,599
it's not equally a third or third but

553
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,279
it's it's pretty close to that so

554
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,839
patients were using different product

555
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:02,319
types when they had neuropathy

556
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:03,359
and when you look at the actual mean

557
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,519
dose

558
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:06,879
it's a lower thc dose

559
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:08,639
and if we think back to that chart i

560
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,440
showed earlier that makes perfect sense

561
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,360
because of the way neuropathy causes

562
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:18,080
pain the higher cbd less thc is required

563
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:21,839
so it it aligned with just

564
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:21,839
common practice and common thinking

565
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
so i'm going to close with a little bit

566
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,918
on adverse events and what we've learned

567
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,439
from the impact database there

568
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,759
and we know

569
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,000
that they vary based on product ratio

570
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:36,158
the route of administration and previous

571
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,119
experience with thc

572
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,200
and you can see a laundry list of aes

573
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,719
that have been reported everything from

574
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,440
sleepiness to

575
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,759
increased appetite dizziness paranoia

576
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:50,159
nausea vomiting all of the things that

577
00:20:47,759 --> 00:20:52,079
we're all very familiar with

578
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,240
and i think the most important thing in

579
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:56,319
the thing that that i always talk about

580
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,400
when i talk to patients is that you have

581
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,678
to manage their expectations

582
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
if someone

583
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,200
is

584
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,400
aware that they might feel sleepy it's

585
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,080
less scary

586
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,400
it makes them feel more comfortable when

587
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:10,558
they actually have that experience

588
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,880
and it's also important to understand

589
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,960
that one person's side effect

590
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,039
is another person's benefit

591
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:20,000
if i'm having trouble sleeping sleeping

592
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:22,079
i want a product that makes me sleepy if

593
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,558
if i'm not and i'm trying to get through

594
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:26,079
my work day i don't want to be sleepy so

595
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,558
really talking to your patients and

596
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:30,399
really having very open conversations is

597
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:33,200
always super important to manage those

598
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,200
expectations

599
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:38,879
we did do an analysis of the data at

600
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:41,280
columbia care specifically to geriatrics

601
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,120
and this was actually um presented the

602
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,558
la the last time i presented it can mad

603
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:46,158
in 2019

604
00:21:44,558 --> 00:21:48,720
we presented the full data set on

605
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,320
geriatric patients but the the portion i

606
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,000
wanted to call out here was just related

607
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:54,720
to the aes

608
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,720
and the self-reported aes were similar

609
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:00,240
regardless of whether the patients were

610
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,558
70 plus or less than 45 which was this

611
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,200
particular analysis

612
00:22:02,558 --> 00:22:08,158
increased appetite was the most common

613
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,679
in both age groups at about 25 percent

614
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,240
and the most important thing and i think

615
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,919
eloise hit on this a few times in her

616
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,679
presentation

617
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,799
there weren't a lot of issues with with

618
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:21,600
disorientation or confusion it was 6.3

619
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:23,359
percent of those 70 plus who reported

620
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:25,038
that at any time

621
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:27,199
and usually it was with the first dose

622
00:22:25,038 --> 00:22:27,919
only so it wasn't a long lasting effect

623
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,360
and

624
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,679
i think one of the most important things

625
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:34,319
about that is is it means it can be used

626
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:36,159
safely you can titrate up safely in

627
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,158
these patients and you can see some of

628
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,360
the average doses there as well and if

629
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:41,120
if anyone's interested in this

630
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:43,359
particular data set i can i can share

631
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:44,798
the abstract with you

632
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:49,199
or you can look back i think in the

633
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:49,200
canmed archives and and see it as well

634
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,600
so in conclusion when we talk about

635
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,440
cannabis and pain

636
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:57,439
you know all pain is not created equal

637
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,679
it doesn't share a common etiology and

638
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,120
it doesn't have a common solution and we

639
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,559
need to think about it differently and

640
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:04,239
think again about how we're taking care

641
00:23:02,558 --> 00:23:06,879
of these patients

642
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:09,200
and i think real world evidence from

643
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
registry data such as impact can really

644
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,120
help us understand what's what's

645
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,480
happening how people are using it in a

646
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:16,239
practical way

647
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,240
and because we have we know that they

648
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:21,839
have to purchase the product it's a

649
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,319
really good surrogate about efficacy

650
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:25,678
adverse events vary based on ratio route

651
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:27,200
of administration and previous

652
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,960
experience and

653
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,960
you know last but not least more work is

654
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,440
needed to understand all these best

655
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
practices

656
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,558
jeff earlier

657
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,080
was trying to quote someone saying that

658
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:39,599
every time you do one study you need

659
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:40,960
four more

660
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:42,558
i don't know who said that either but i

661
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:46,240
can quote you jeff since you said it

662
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:51,240
earlier but it's very true so uh

663
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,240
thank you all for your time today
