my guest today is Dr Sherman homm

45
00:02:04,739 --> 00:02:09,959
Sherman is the director of Regulatory

46
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,359
Affairs at medicinal genomics where he

47
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,819
provides recommendations to regulatory

48
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,920
officials that are tasked with drafting

49
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:19,439
or modifying microbial testing

50
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,719
regulations for cannabis hemp and

51
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:24,359
psychedelic mushrooms to ensure Safe

00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,419
products for patients and consumers

53
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,000
before medicinal genomics Sherman worked

54
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,280
for the New Jersey Department of Health

55
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,680
while there he led teams that started

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:37,620
the Cannabis Testing laboratory the

57
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,200
Cannabis microbial testing unit and he

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:43,860
created the all states medical cannabis

59
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:46,859
program required testing compendium

60
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:49,680
at kammed 23 Sherman will share the

61
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:52,140
latest updates to his compendium to

62
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,260
elucidate the present microbial testing

63
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:59,818
landscape and identify a consensus set

64
00:02:55,259 --> 00:03:02,878
of tests to lower public health risk

65
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:04,859
during our conversation we discussed How

66
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,439
concerned cannabis consumers should be

67
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,780
about microbial contamination how

68
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,000
microbial regulations differ from state

69
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,640
to state or jurisdiction to jurisdiction

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,818
how growers in certain jurisdictions

71
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,098
struggle to meet microbial regulations

72
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:23,039
the difference between presence absence

73
00:03:20,098 --> 00:03:25,378
tests and total count microbial tests

74
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:26,939
and the difference between plating and

75
00:03:25,378 --> 00:03:29,280

76
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,620

95
00:04:26,579 --> 00:04:30,779
good morning Sherman thanks so much for

96
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,019
joining us on the podcast

97
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:36,539
good morning Ben glad to be here and I'd

98
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:37,978
like to express my appreciation for this

99
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:41,699
opportunity

100
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:46,199
to share my knowledge concerning

101
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:48,419
various cannabis regulatory issues

102
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:50,939
right and let's specifically let's talk

103
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:53,399
about microbial testing as some

104
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,139
listeners may know that microbial

105
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:56,939
testing is a topic that's near and dear

106
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:00,240
to our hearts here at medicinal genomics

107
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:02,339
our Flagship product line pathoseek is

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,720
used by many of the top cannabis labs to

109
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:06,359
test products for microbial

110
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:09,240
contamination but although we're well

111
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,939
well versed in the micro world I know

112
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,220
that not all of our listeners are so

113
00:05:11,939 --> 00:05:16,560
Sherman I was hoping we could start off

114
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:19,800
with the basics so first and foremost

115
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,259
How concerned should consumers be of

116
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,759
microbial contamination in cannabis

117
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:26,400
products

118
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,860
well in my mind cannabis consumers

119
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,659
should be concerned about microbial

120
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:33,538
contamination

121
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:34,680
some consumers are patients with

122
00:05:33,538 --> 00:05:36,599
illnesses

123
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,699
some of these patients are

124
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,280
immunocompromised

125
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:44,879
and what I've done is I've collected

126
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:47,698
over 25 clinical case studies from the

127
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:50,779
medical literature of people becoming

128
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:54,900
infected with microbial pathogens

129
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:58,258
affiliated with cannabis use

130
00:05:54,899 --> 00:06:01,620
there is even one clinical case study of

131
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:04,560
an imminental competent person using

132
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:06,899
cannabis that got valley fever which is

133
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,379
caused by a fungus called cryptococcus

134
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:11,459
and can can this illness can be quite

135
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:15,060
severe

136
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:17,159
these cases may be just the tip of the

137
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,519
iceberg

138
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:23,580
so valley fever and cryptococcus I mean

139
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:26,279
I I have to admit that's new to me

140
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:29,279
um so cryptococcus what is that is that

141
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:30,599
a bacteria a fungus and and how are Labs

142
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,519
testing for that

143
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,900
or are they I guess is a good question

144
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:41,279
well that is the thing uh cryptococcus

145
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:43,918
is a fungus that's found in the soil

146
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:47,099
initially found in the soils of the

147
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:52,258
United States and the southwest and and

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:54,439
it spread uh in actually in windstorms

149
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:57,900
and so

150
00:06:54,439 --> 00:07:00,079
cannabis cultivation sites that either

151
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:03,000
grow outdoors or even

152
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:06,839
these fungal spores can get inside

153
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:11,459
indoor grows through the HVAC system

154
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:14,159
in in and be in the Cannabis flowers and

155
00:07:11,459 --> 00:07:16,500
at this time there are no states that

156
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,220
require a testing

157
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:24,779
for cryptococcus but I'd like to talk

158
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:27,180
later concerning the expansion of the

159
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:30,598
microbial testing rules of specific

160
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,160
pathogens from now into the future

161
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:36,300
excellent

162
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:38,580
okay and so now what is or what are the

163
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,180
most dangerous microbial pathogens that

164
00:07:38,579 --> 00:07:45,379
can be found in cannabis

165
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:49,139
the most dangerous microbial pathogens

166
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:51,060
that are required for testing presently

167
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:54,598
are the

168
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:57,139
as a four aspergillus species they are

169
00:07:54,598 --> 00:08:00,779
specifically epigulous flavus

170
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:03,598
aspergillus fulminatus aspergillus Niger

171
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:05,598
and aspergillus terius

172
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:08,939
another

173
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,918
pathogen our bacteria and these are the

174
00:08:08,939 --> 00:08:14,639
salmonella species

175
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,038
practically all salmonella species are

176
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,740
pathogenic I believe the literature

177
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:22,378
shows there are only two that are not

178
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:25,439
I would also include the Chica toxin

179
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,680
producing E coli the most pathogenic of

180
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:31,399
the six pathotypes

181
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:36,180
due to as a check

182
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:36,179
for sanitary uh

183
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:46,799
purposes or detection of unsanitary uh

184
00:08:43,259 --> 00:08:49,139
practices in cultivation sites or

185
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,620
processing sites or

186
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:54,240
product manufacturing sites and I also

187
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,240
continue to monitor the medical

188
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,399
literature for other pathogens that have

189
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,000
been affiliated with cannabis use as

190
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,759
possible candidates in the future

191
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,278
okay and so I was wanting to ask you a

192
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:10,080
little bit more about aspergillus so

193
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:12,299
when you're saying you were reviewing

194
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:16,379
the the clinical cases how many of those

195
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:19,278
involved aspergillus contamination well

196
00:09:16,379 --> 00:09:19,278
a vast majority

197
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,640
well over a couple of dozen

198
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:31,458
and and these are respiratory illnesses

199
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:35,039
the prevalent one being aspergillosis

200
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:36,838
which can cause severe illnesses and a

201
00:09:35,039 --> 00:09:41,099
couple of the clinical case studies

202
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:43,800
indicated death to the patient so it can

203
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,920
be quite dangerous I've actually found

204
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:48,120
two

205
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,939
epidemiological studies that showed

206
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,639
salmonella outbreaks affiliated with

207
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:56,640
cannabis

208
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:59,039
okay and going back to aspergillus again

209
00:09:56,639 --> 00:10:01,740
sorry but I think it's important to

210
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:04,019
clarify that

211
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:07,620
is it am I correct am I understanding

212
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:10,500
that the the risk is really in inhaled

213
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,379
products for aspergillus that is correct

214
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:17,000
that is correct because aspergillus

215
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:20,220
uh these aspergillus

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,299
microorganisms produce these spores that

217
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:28,459
are readily emitted into the air

218
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:32,759
and and so one could be simply handling

219
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:35,458
cannabis flowers to make uh uh you know

220
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:40,580
to make a joint for example can be

221
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:44,099
inhaling these spores and also I have

222
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:48,300
a study a research study that shows that

223
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:50,040
under certain conditions of vaporization

224
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:52,859
temperatures

225
00:10:50,039 --> 00:10:58,139
like a volcano for example which is a

226
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:00,419
device for inhaling a cannabis flower

227
00:10:58,139 --> 00:11:02,899
um the spores actually survive those

228
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,899
temperatures

229
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,120
wow yeah and I hadn't I hadn't thought

230
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:12,480
of it I guess until now that you know

231
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:14,100
aspergillus is really a concern for the

232
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,200
processors as well or those who are

233
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,899
working in a cultivation facility if you

234
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,480
if they were handling trimming

235
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:23,278
um any flour that were contaminated they

236
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:27,480
could be breathing it in that's right

237
00:11:23,278 --> 00:11:30,379
and some of the workers were diligently

238
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:34,620
supporting this industry

239
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:37,799
may be patients themselves that have

240
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:40,139
right you know and there are imminental

241
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:43,199
compromised people that don't consume

242
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:45,059
cannabis that work in these uh cannabis

243
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,339
uh sites

244
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:50,458
yeah and that might be another important

245
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:53,399
thing to point out as well

246
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:55,859
um the risk of developing aspergillosis

247
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,839
it's is it only amongst

248
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,539
immunocompromised people or is it just

249
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,459
much much more likely that it would

250
00:12:00,539 --> 00:12:04,278
develop in those folks I think it would

251
00:12:02,458 --> 00:12:06,838
be much more likely

252
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:08,778
first of all I'd like to qualify I'm not

253
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:11,160
a clinician

254
00:12:08,778 --> 00:12:14,059
but as far as I've read in the

255
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:17,480
literature the persons that are

256
00:12:14,059 --> 00:12:22,679
immunocompromised are more likely to

257
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:25,079
get this respiratory infection

258
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:28,019
okay all right so let's move on a little

259
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:30,299
bit to the regulatory landscape can you

260
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,519
describe the regulatory landscape when

261
00:12:30,299 --> 00:12:34,740
it comes to microbial testing on

262
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:37,980
cannabis well I'm going to focus just on

263
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:42,659
the United States and to date there are

264
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:45,860
37 States Washington DC and one major

265
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:45,860
U.S territory

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:52,559
and these jurisdictions have adopted

267
00:12:49,078 --> 00:12:54,359
Believe It or Not 41 sets of microbial

268
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,899
testing rules

269
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:01,220
there are 22 different required

270
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:01,220
microbial tests

271
00:13:01,799 --> 00:13:07,979
from all the different jurisdictions 10

272
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,459
are what's called total count tests such

273
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:15,539
as total aerobic bacteria or total yeast

274
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:19,979
in molds and 12 are specific pathogen

275
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:21,539
tests in which earlier I I named five of

276
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:24,240
them

277
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:28,439
all right so we have 37 States

278
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:30,659
Washington DC and one territory and 41

279
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,620
sets of microbial testing rules is this

280
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:37,679
does this um cover both medical and

281
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:41,659
adult use is that why there's so many uh

282
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:44,699
yeah a very astute fast calculator

283
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:47,399
person can see that there actually are

284
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:50,100
39 jurisdictions but once that's micro

285
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,200
wheel testing rooms that's because two

286
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:56,100
states

287
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,860
Arizona and New York have separate

288
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:02,879
microbial testing rules

289
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:04,740
but um for the medical and the adult use

290
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:07,860
programs

291
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:09,180
okay yeah I was I was trying to do the

292
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,560
math quick I didn't think that was

293
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:13,319
adding up

294
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:15,838
um now I would never ask you to speak

295
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,079
for The Regulators but why do you think

296
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,740
that there is really apparently little

297
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:26,479
to no consensus when it comes to the the

298
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:26,480
regulations from state to state

299
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:32,519
the lack of consensus I believe

300
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,240
can be viewed from a more historical

301
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,240
viewpoint

302
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:42,958
I became the project manager to lead a a

303
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:45,240
group of chemists to start the first

304
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:48,179
Cannabis Testing Lab in the state of New

305
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,799
Jersey under the auspices of the New

306
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,799
Jersey Department of Health public

307
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:54,899
health and Environmental Laboratories

308
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:57,059
and subsequently I was involved in this

309
00:14:54,899 --> 00:15:00,179
Association of Public Health

310
00:14:57,059 --> 00:15:03,539
Laboratories cannabis community of

311
00:15:00,179 --> 00:15:05,179
practice these were government officials

312
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:11,939
from different

313
00:15:05,179 --> 00:15:15,659
departments some who were tasked to

314
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,000
draft the testing rules for their

315
00:15:15,659 --> 00:15:20,578
cannabis program

316
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
and there were a few few subject matter

317
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:26,578
experts

318
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,740
concerning testing rules and I heard the

319
00:15:26,578 --> 00:15:32,958
pain in their voices

320
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:37,680
I knew as little as they did

321
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:41,458
in what occurred is what I caught

322
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:43,620
is is what I well I feel that there's

323
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:45,958
different factors that were involved in

324
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:48,299
how this lack of consensus occurred

325
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,179
first the lack of

326
00:15:48,299 --> 00:15:54,979
subject matter experts in Cannabis

327
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:58,198
Testing rules being an emerging industry

328
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,000
then the the time pressure of

329
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:04,679
implementation

330
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,679
of the Cannabis program

331
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:09,979
caused what I call cut and paste

332
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,559
syndrome

333
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:16,620
whereby the

334
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:20,518
regulatory officials simply looked at

335
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:22,278
another or a few other states

336
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:26,399
uh

337
00:16:22,278 --> 00:16:29,698
microbial testing rules and simply

338
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,698
picked theirs without sufficient

339
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:34,559
scientific due diligence

340
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:37,919
okay

341
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:39,719
and now just how wide we've talked about

342
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,159
all the all the different sets of

343
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,740
microbial requirements that are out

344
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:45,778
there out there how widely do these

345
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:48,539
regulations differ from jurisdiction to

346
00:16:45,778 --> 00:16:51,659
jurisdiction right that that's a very

347
00:16:48,539 --> 00:16:54,778
good question the regulations differ

348
00:16:51,659 --> 00:16:57,299
widely in several ways

349
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:59,519
one would be the number of required

350
00:16:57,299 --> 00:17:03,240
microbial tests

351
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,699
where I have observed a range of one

352
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,019
tests to ten tests

353
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:13,439
also for each of the tests each test

354
00:17:10,019 --> 00:17:16,199
type you might say the action levels

355
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:20,160
let's take the example of total yeast

356
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:25,860
and mold the Action level can vary

357
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:29,580
up to 1 000 fold difference

358
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:32,339
between between one state and another

359
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:37,740
I'm sorry a hundred fold

360
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:42,298
and then also the test combinations

361
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:44,460
so for example a vast majority of the

362
00:17:42,298 --> 00:17:47,359
microbial testing rules for plant

363
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,279
material amongst all the jurisdictions

364
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:51,538
are unique

365
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:53,099
wow

366
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:55,140
I have to imagine if you were a

367
00:17:53,099 --> 00:17:57,298
multi-state operator if you were a

368
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,520
cultivator operating in

369
00:17:57,298 --> 00:18:02,759
several different states that would be

370
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,099
difficult to you know standardize your

371
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,079
procedures or anything to to be able to

372
00:18:05,099 --> 00:18:10,019
meet all these different requirements

373
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:12,298
well it is a challenge and one must have

374
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:15,359
an excellent

375
00:18:12,298 --> 00:18:18,179
Chief compliance officer to examine the

376
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:21,779
regulations for

377
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:25,380
the microbial testing regulations in

378
00:18:21,779 --> 00:18:30,720
each state understand them

379
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:33,200
very very well note the differences in

380
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,819
and recommend the

381
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,298
modifications to one standard operating

382
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:41,700
procedures if if needed one cannot just

383
00:18:39,298 --> 00:18:44,279
do a cookie cutter

384
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,200
tight process and just carry it from

385
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,480
state to state

386
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,919
absolutely yeah they need to they need

387
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,120
to know the differences in the state

388
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:55,740
regulations and quick plug for

389
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:58,558
medicinalgenomics.com where we have a

390
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:00,359
tool that Sherman was very instrumental

391
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:03,178
in putting the information together on

392
00:19:00,359 --> 00:19:05,219
this but we have an interactive tool on

393
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:07,919
our website that shows the microbial

394
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:09,360
regulations for all the different states

395
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,100
um so if folks are interested in

396
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,259
checking that out I'll put a link in the

397
00:19:11,099 --> 00:19:15,599
show description but it's that's a great

398
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:18,119
tool to kind of really get a sense for

399
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,619
all these different regulations and and

400
00:19:18,119 --> 00:19:22,500
what they mean

401
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:25,379
but I'm curious now we've talked about

402
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:28,700
how the regulations are are very varied

403
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:31,799
from state to state how does microbial

404
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,179
compare to other

405
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:35,339
um

406
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:37,140
other compliance tests like pesticides

407
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,319
heavy metals and potency

408
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:43,440
um is it a similar problem there or is

409
00:19:40,319 --> 00:19:44,579
microbial sort of unique in that sense

410
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,679
okay

411
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:49,439
I gave that

412
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:53,160
off the top of my head I can say that

413
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,960
the similarity or diversity of required

414
00:19:53,160 --> 00:20:00,380
tests for these other chemical classes

415
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,480
depends on which one we're talking about

416
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:06,799
so you've got the cannabinoids you got

417
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,900
the metals and mycotoxin

418
00:20:06,798 --> 00:20:10,619
testing shows similarity amongst the

419
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,400
states

420
00:20:10,619 --> 00:20:16,979
for the cannabinoids many states require

421
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:21,620
quantification of four

422
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:24,538
which is the thca THC

423
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:27,178
cbda and CBD

424
00:20:24,538 --> 00:20:29,819
for Metals many states require what

425
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:34,620
everyone calls the big four arsenic

426
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:36,899
cadmium lead and Mercury for mycotoxins

427
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:40,619
Most states require

428
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:43,259
a family of aflatoxins and a specific

429
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:48,379
okra toxin a

430
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:52,379
on the other hand in 2019 I counted over

431
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:55,260
500 unique pesticides that were required

432
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:59,940
by at least one jurisdiction

433
00:20:55,259 --> 00:21:03,298
some states had very short lists

434
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:06,259
of pesticides in other states had very

435
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:06,259
long lists

436
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:14,160
yeah so what we have is

437
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:16,259
similarity as well as diversity

438
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,860
interesting yeah wow

439
00:21:16,259 --> 00:21:21,179
lots to navigate with all these tests

440
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:23,219
um but going back to microbial

441
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,419
specifically

442
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,100
um I think you had touched on this

443
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:28,140
before when you were talking about the

444
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:30,298
diversity of the different mic uh

445
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:32,280
regulations that are out there but I was

446
00:21:30,298 --> 00:21:34,558
hoping if you could describe the

447
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:38,158
difference between what we refer to as

448
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:39,298
total count tests and specific pathogen

449
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,700
tests

450
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:44,879
well the obvious difference between a

451
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:46,798
total count test and a specific count

452
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,360
pathogen tests

453
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:54,000
is that the total count tests simply

454
00:21:50,359 --> 00:21:57,779
counts the number of cells per gram or

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:00,779
per milliliter of cannabis sample while

456
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:02,940
the specific pathogen test detects the

457
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:06,418
presence or absence

458
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:08,159
of the human pathogen that can cause

459
00:22:06,419 --> 00:22:10,140
illness

460
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:12,059
right so

461
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,120
these total count tests there is an

462
00:22:12,058 --> 00:22:17,579
allowable limit you can have X amount of

463
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:19,319
this family whereas the pathogen is we

464
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:21,240
don't want any of that in the in the

465
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:24,480
product at all

466
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,640
and now what are sort of the the pros

467
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,400
and cons benefits and drawbacks of each

468
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,640
of these types of tests well I want to

469
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:36,538
start with the total count tests

470
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:39,840
an example is total yeast in molds

471
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:43,819
what I see is the primary drawback

472
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,918
for a total count test is that a result

473
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:49,918
expressed as colony forming units that

474
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:52,380
exceeds the Action level carries a

475
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,659
financial consequence

476
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,760
the damaging result

477
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:59,780
that the

478
00:22:56,759 --> 00:23:01,400
cultivator or processor or product

479
00:22:59,779 --> 00:23:08,279
manufacturing

480
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:11,460
a factor receives does not provide this

481
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:13,859
the submitting organization any

482
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:16,500
information that any of the yeast or

483
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:18,240
molds counted in the sample were human

484
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,779
pathogens

485
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,259
so if a jurisdiction is dead set on

486
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:28,399
keeping a total count test I would

487
00:23:24,259 --> 00:23:31,319
recommend that a second test be required

488
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:35,038
that looks for the presence of specific

489
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:37,619
bacterial or fungal pathogens that may

490
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,259
hurt or cause illness in human beings

491
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:44,158
now on the other hand for specific

492
00:23:40,259 --> 00:23:47,038
pathogen tests the primary benefit is

493
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:50,039
that one detects a bacterium or a mole

494
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,379
that that might cause

495
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:54,240
a patient or consumer to get sick or

496
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:58,559
even die

497
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,079
on the other hand the drawback or what's

498
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:03,899
missing is there are probably other

499
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:07,379
pathogens besides the 12 that are

500
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:10,259
required presently

501
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:13,260
and that is why I constantly monitor the

502
00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:17,640
medical literature for other candidate

503
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:18,720
pathogens to possibly consider testing

504
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,980
for

505
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,779
right

506
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,720
an example of that could be one that we

507
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:25,700
brought up earlier right cryptococcus

508
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,620
um

509
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:31,080
but as you pointed out the total count

510
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:31,918
tests aren't necessarily going to

511
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:33,839
protect

512
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:36,538
uh people from that because if your

513
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:39,658
State's allowing you know ten thousand

514
00:24:36,538 --> 00:24:41,940
cfus of total yeast and mold

515
00:24:39,659 --> 00:24:43,559
and isn't looking specifically for

516
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,779
cryptococcus I mean that could be

517
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:48,058
included in that number it's below the

518
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:51,240
threshold that's getting out there but

519
00:24:48,058 --> 00:24:57,019
you know potentially could be harmful

520
00:24:51,240 --> 00:25:01,220
that that is that is correct in when I

521
00:24:57,019 --> 00:25:06,298
entered the Cannabis microbial testing

522
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:08,940
space as a a traditional as well as

523
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:11,038
molecular microbiologists with five

524
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:14,820
Decades of experience

525
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:19,558
and I observe these required total count

526
00:25:14,819 --> 00:25:22,200
tests I asked regulatory officials and

527
00:25:19,558 --> 00:25:25,740
other subject matter experts in in the

528
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:28,440
microbial testing World why these total

529
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:29,759
counts what value these total count

530
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:34,140
tests had

531
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:37,679
or why were they adopted and the primary

532
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:41,580
answer I got was well we we're requiring

533
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:44,340
this on the side of caution

534
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:47,038
but that's why I recommend if you exceed

535
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:50,220
if you're dead set on keeping the total

536
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,140
count tests I feel that a second test

537
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,400
should be done seeking specific

538
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:56,640
pathogens

539
00:25:53,400 --> 00:26:00,480
because as I understand from networking

540
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:04,620
with multi-state cultivators

541
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:08,058
millions of dollars of cannabis is being

542
00:26:04,619 --> 00:26:12,778
diverted into concentrate or

543
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:15,240
destroyed due to laboratory results that

544
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:19,079
do not provide any

545
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:23,579
real information about the

546
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:25,500
danger of the sample to human health

547
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:26,639
yeah and I think you touched on a great

548
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,919
point there and it was one of the

549
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,419
questions I had here to ask you

550
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:32,520
um but again I think you kind of

551
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:34,679
answered it here but maybe to reiterate

552
00:26:32,519 --> 00:26:36,658
you know these microbial testing

553
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,940
regulations have a real effect on

554
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:40,620
Growers so you know although it's it's

555
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:42,480
nice that The Regulators are airing on

556
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,739
the side of caution

557
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,500
um it can

558
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,700
it can be a real Financial toll or you

559
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,400
know can

560
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:53,220
lead to this diversion to to concentrate

561
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:56,100
if the regulations are hard for the

562
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,360
Growers to meet so you know maybe you

563
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:59,099
could just kind of reiterate how do

564
00:26:57,359 --> 00:27:01,259
these microbial testing regulations

565
00:26:59,099 --> 00:27:05,278
affect Growers

566
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:07,740
okay yeah I'll uh try to summarize my

567
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:10,980
answer in a succinct manner

568
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:13,740
uh I'll start with the total count tests

569
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:17,099
they always have an action level so

570
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:21,480
let's take a common 10 000 Colony

571
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:23,639
forming units per gram of flower sample

572
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:27,480
if the number of colonies per gram

573
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:30,659
exceeds the Action level the consequence

574
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:34,740
in many states is diversion to produce

575
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:36,720
concentrate with a retest of the total

576
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,440
Eastern mold

577
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,640
as I understand it that's a financial

578
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:44,580
loss because

579
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,220
the the value of flour versus the value

580
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:49,798
of concentrate is

581
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:52,259
the flower is more valuable

582
00:27:49,798 --> 00:27:55,079
so as a grower

583
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:56,400
processor or product manufacturer if I

584
00:27:55,079 --> 00:27:59,038
was such a

585
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,620
owner I would have no information

586
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,839
whether the diverted batch of cannabis

587
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:05,038
flour had any human pathogens that may

588
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:07,319
cause illness

589
00:28:05,038 --> 00:28:10,859
on the other hand

590
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:13,439
a grower that that knows one has the

591
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:16,019
pathogens in the flower if I was the

592
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,080
owner I then I would want an opportunity

593
00:28:16,019 --> 00:28:21,440
to divert the batch to May concentrate

594
00:28:19,079 --> 00:28:25,319
within retest instead of Destruction

595
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,179
which is required in some states

596
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:28,980
yeah at least get something out of it

597
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:32,220
that's right

598
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,380
let's be reasonable

599
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:36,298
speaking of reasonable are there certain

600
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,440
jurisdictions where Growers have a

601
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:40,918
really hard time meeting the

602
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:44,640
requirements there is one state in this

603
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:47,159
that is Illinois it is the only state

604
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,860
where Growers have an almost impossible

605
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,539
time getting underneath a particular

606
00:28:49,859 --> 00:28:53,819
Action level

607
00:28:51,538 --> 00:28:56,099
and that is the Action level for total

608
00:28:53,819 --> 00:29:00,000
yeast and mold tests

609
00:28:56,099 --> 00:29:03,959
and it is 1 000 Colony forming units per

610
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,538
gram which is 10 to 100 times lower than

611
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,220
all the other states that require that

612
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:12,019
particular test

613
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:15,140
I'd like to elaborate a little bit more

614
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:19,079
we have

615
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:21,899
Laboratory Testing evidence that perhaps

616
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:24,778
many Illinois Growers are using various

617
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:28,019
remediation Technologies

618
00:29:24,778 --> 00:29:32,460
to lower the number of yeast and molds

619
00:29:28,019 --> 00:29:35,038
and other microorganisms before testing

620
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:38,100
now some remediation Technologies

621
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:40,519
degrade The Beneficial chemicals in the

622
00:29:38,099 --> 00:29:44,459
Cannabis by other remediation

623
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:47,278
Technologies may cause the formation of

624
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:49,798
viable but not cultural microbes that

625
00:29:47,278 --> 00:29:51,659
will resuscitate and multiply on

626
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:54,720
dispensary shelves

627
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:57,380
and this was exemplified by last year's

628
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,600
Chicago Sun Times investigative report

629
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:04,140
that a vast majority of the dispensary

630
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:07,079
bought pre-rolls had total yeast in mold

631
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:09,240
levels above the Action level but the

632
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:11,220
certificate of analysis showed levels

633
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,960
under the action levels

634
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:17,659
but one can make a

635
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,298
parallel concerning the dangerous

636
00:30:17,659 --> 00:30:24,899
aspergillus pathogens

637
00:30:20,298 --> 00:30:28,700
whereby a grower could

638
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,699
perform a remediation

639
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,880
method on the Cannabis flower

640
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:39,058
caused the formation of viable but not

641
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,539
culturable dangerous

642
00:30:39,058 --> 00:30:45,298
pathogenic aspergillus species

643
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:48,179
it would pass the test

644
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:51,778
you wouldn't be able to detect it let's

645
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:53,519
say on a auger plate and then it would

646
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:57,000
grow in the dispensary shelf and

647
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,259
possibly cause harm to a medical patient

648
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,720
right

649
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,179
and now I think it's important to

650
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,880
to clarify too that you know we're

651
00:31:03,179 --> 00:31:08,820
talking about sort of an allowable limit

652
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,380
which you know again for someone who's

653
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:13,558
not in the microbial World who'd think

654
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:15,480
like well why is there any why is there

655
00:31:13,558 --> 00:31:17,519
any yeast involved on my cannabis like

656
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:20,579
is

657
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,839
Is it feasible I think I know the answer

658
00:31:20,579 --> 00:31:23,519
to this question but maybe we should

659
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:26,519
kind of spell it out that you know it's

660
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:29,038
not possible to really have cannabis

661
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:31,980
flour that is devoid of any microbial

662
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:34,079
life just because of the nature of it

663
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,179
correct that's right

664
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:39,418
um

665
00:31:35,179 --> 00:31:40,919
microorganisms are ubiquitous in all

666
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:43,399
environments

667
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:45,740
and there are beneficial

668
00:31:43,398 --> 00:31:50,038
microorganisms there's what I call

669
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:52,620
benign ones that are neutral

670
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:55,619
they're just hanging out

671
00:31:52,619 --> 00:32:00,439
and then there are those that are

672
00:31:55,619 --> 00:32:02,219
pathogenic and as a microbiologist

673
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:05,580
most

674
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:08,700
of the microorganisms

675
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:12,500
on our Earth are beneficial

676
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,500
and there are a few pathogens

677
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:17,939
excellent and you did bring up another

678
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,179
point and I'd be remiss if I didn't

679
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,220
address this but I was wondering if you

680
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,679
could speak a little bit about the

681
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,538
difference between

682
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:32,700
microbial testing techniques

683
00:32:27,538 --> 00:32:36,798
specifically plating versus qpcr

684
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,798
yes that this uh

685
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,860
a very hot topic and very important

686
00:32:42,058 --> 00:32:45,839
topic

687
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:49,199
to

688
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:52,199
have dialogue upon because the other

689
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:55,140
major regulatory issue when it comes to

690
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,740
cannabis microbial testing is not only

691
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:01,259
what test is required or Action level

692
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:03,899
that you have

693
00:33:01,259 --> 00:33:07,140
but also what

694
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:09,599
rules that you have in what I call

695
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:13,740
allowable methods

696
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:17,339
so when I started examining microbial

697
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:22,019
testing rules for allowable methods

698
00:33:17,339 --> 00:33:24,359
I noted that some states were very

699
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:26,759
one-sided

700
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:29,519
which is what is termed the gold

701
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:34,140
standard or historical standard and that

702
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:37,380
is the culture or auger plating method

703
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:39,240
and then there were some states that

704
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,000
allowed both

705
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:46,620
which is more fair because one has to

706
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,440
know the advantages and disadvantages of

707
00:33:46,619 --> 00:33:53,939
these two primary methods

708
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:58,380
and I have and I have performed

709
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:03,298
over decades both types of Technologies

710
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:06,600
and I sincerely feel that

711
00:34:03,298 --> 00:34:09,838
there are many well there are multiple

712
00:34:06,599 --> 00:34:12,418
drawbacks concerning plating methods and

713
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:15,559
the first that comes to my mind

714
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:18,299
is that not all

715
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:22,440
microorganisms well you have to pick one

716
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,940
growth medium for your accounting or

717
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,599
enumerating

718
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:29,760
a group of microorganisms and not there

719
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,859
is no one medium that will count all of

720
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,859
them

721
00:34:30,858 --> 00:34:36,659
generically close to 95 percent of the

722
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:39,719
microorganisms

723
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:41,039
on the earth do not form a colony on a

724
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:44,039
plate

725
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:47,579
and so you're missing a lot another

726
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:51,119
feature of the Cannabis Matrix are the

727
00:34:47,579 --> 00:34:54,779
cannabinoids it's a very unique Matrix

728
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,460
because the cannabinoids have antibiotic

729
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,780
activity

730
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,659
and so that will alter

731
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:06,480
your results because many bacterial

732
00:35:03,659 --> 00:35:11,219
species and fungal species

733
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:13,440
they are sensitive to antibiotics

734
00:35:11,219 --> 00:35:14,959
and also

735
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,139
many

736
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,858
both bacteria as well as fungal species

737
00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:25,739
have been found to be what's called

738
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:27,960
endophytes part of their life cycle is

739
00:35:25,739 --> 00:35:31,858
inside the plant tissue

740
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:36,599
so any method that that

741
00:35:31,858 --> 00:35:40,799
tries to isolate those microorganisms

742
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:43,680
within the plant tissue will destroy all

743
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,680
the microbial cells

744
00:35:43,679 --> 00:35:49,739
and really alter ones or many of the

745
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:51,059
microbial cells which will alter your

746
00:35:49,739 --> 00:35:55,979
test

747
00:35:51,059 --> 00:35:59,119
and also the culture or plating methods

748
00:35:55,980 --> 00:36:00,679
are done at a single temperature in some

749
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,838
pathogens

750
00:36:00,679 --> 00:36:07,500
microbial pathogens grow at lower

751
00:36:03,838 --> 00:36:11,719
temperatures than the usual 35 to 37

752
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:11,719
degrees Centigrade on the other hand

753
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:19,079
the quantitative polymerase Chain

754
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:21,440
Reaction tests for for microbial

755
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:24,839
detection

756
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:28,380
avoids all these drawbacks and they're

757
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:31,199
also known in many Industries especially

758
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:35,519
the clinical diagnostic industry to be

759
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:38,279
the most sensitive the most specific

760
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:40,139
also to have the lowest limit of

761
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,440
detection

762
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:46,019
and they and the fastest turnaround time

763
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:49,619
which is very important so those are the

764
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:53,338
four advantages I see with quantitative

765
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:55,920
PCR and of course everyone is just

766
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:56,880
waiting me to finish my my

767
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,500
um

768
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,119
my thoughts

769
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:02,760
and it happened to me just yesterday

770
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,280
where there was a microbiologist that

771
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,960
said to me well there is one big problem

772
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:11,519
with qpcr tests and that is one might

773
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:14,400
detect

774
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,869
genetic material from dead pathogenic

775
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,460
cells and so therefore

776
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:18,719
[Music]

777
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,820
um

778
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:22,199
a positive which would cause a

779
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:26,220
consequence

780
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:29,480
you know is a false positive and I

781
00:37:26,219 --> 00:37:33,480
want to Simply share with everyone that

782
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:36,740
multiple test developers have developed

783
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:43,139
methods to

784
00:37:36,739 --> 00:37:46,919
eliminate the DNA from dead cells before

785
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:49,379
the detection of the DNA from live cells

786
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:52,800
which is quite an advancement for the

787
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:55,140
diagnostic testing world

788
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,300
absolutely and medicinal genomics is one

789
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:58,920
of those developers Grim reefer that's

790
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,859
one of our products you can check it out

791
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,079
on medicinalgenomics.com all right

792
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:05,819
chairman we're winding down here but

793
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,500
before I let you go one more question

794
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,099
that I want to ask you because we did

795
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:14,699
call out Illinois for their their overly

796
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:16,440
restrictive regulations I was curious in

797
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:18,659
your opinion what jurisdictions have

798
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,519
done a good job regulating cannabis

799
00:38:18,659 --> 00:38:22,440
microbial testing well there are four

800
00:38:20,519 --> 00:38:24,920
states I'd like to give a shout out to

801
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:27,539
and that would be California Oregon

802
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:30,838
Montana and Vermont

803
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:32,400
and these are examples where these

804
00:38:30,838 --> 00:38:34,799
jurisdictions

805
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,000
follow

806
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:41,039
what I believe is the appropriate or the

807
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,440
correct Approach at this time and that

808
00:38:41,039 --> 00:38:45,179
is requiring for the testing of specific

809
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,059
pathogens

810
00:38:45,179 --> 00:38:49,578
also I'd like to give a shout out to the

811
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:52,858
states

812
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:56,579
such as Oregon

813
00:38:52,858 --> 00:38:59,400
Vermont Montana and Connecticut

814
00:38:56,579 --> 00:39:03,180
that require that for allowable methods

815
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:06,300
require the aoac performance test

816
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:09,419
methods that follow the guidelines of of

817
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:13,320
the the standard method performance

818
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:16,400
requirements that aoac issued for the

819
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,400
test Developers

820
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,440
