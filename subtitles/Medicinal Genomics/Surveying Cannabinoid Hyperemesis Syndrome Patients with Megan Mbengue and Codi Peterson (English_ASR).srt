100
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,680
good morning Megan and Cody thanks so

101
00:04:44,439 --> 00:04:49,918
much for joining me on the

102
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,840
podcast morning thanks for having us all

103
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:55,319
right well I'm excited to talk to you

104
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:58,000
both about the mysterious canabo

105
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:59,839
hyperemesis syndrome longtime listeners

106
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,240
of the podcast or perhaps people who

107
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:05,000
have checked out the camed archive may

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,960
be familiar with CHS we've done a couple

109
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,839
episodes on it and I know that Ethan

110
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,038
Russo presented at cmed 24 about some of

111
00:05:10,839 --> 00:05:15,038
the research that he's done but really

112
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:16,639
the first time we discussed it at canmed

113
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,439
was back in

114
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,280
2019 and if I remember correctly we

115
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:23,959
actually kind of had a hard time filling

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,119
that panel because the topic was still

117
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:28,359
very new and not a lot of people knew

118
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,439
about it but you know since then

119
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,960
awareness has increased but there are

120
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,079
still a lot more questions than answers

121
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:37,399
when it comes to CHS so I'm thrilled

122
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:40,000
that you guys are are doing the good

123
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:42,918
work to try to better understand this

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,478
condition but with that said I always

125
00:05:42,918 --> 00:05:46,639
like to start with the basics for folks

126
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:50,839
who might not be familiar with the topic

127
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,918
so Cody would you please summarize CHS

128
00:05:50,839 --> 00:05:55,918
what we and what we do know about it

129
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:57,198
yeah thanks again Ben uh for for the

130
00:05:55,918 --> 00:05:58,639
complimentary words there's a lot of

131
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:01,120
people talking about this topic because

132
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,360
it's increasingly important because more

133
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,240
and more patients are showing up with

134
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,520
this collection of symptoms and really

135
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,079
it's kind of a a pretty simple list of

136
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:12,918
symptoms it's uncontrollable nausea

137
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:16,279
vomiting episodes of That So this

138
00:06:12,918 --> 00:06:17,879
lasting for hours or even days and we

139
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,879
see this associated with someone who's

140
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,199
using cannabis very regularly oftentimes

141
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:26,478
daily or more and these are uh

142
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:29,759
refractory vomiting condition that does

143
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:33,360
not respond to normal antiemetics

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,759
but is often relieved by um a somewhat

145
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,080
peculiar phenomenon that is hot showers

146
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,720
or bathing and talking very hot you know

147
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:42,719
in the shower is the only time they're

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,680
getting relief from this very intense

149
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,680
nausea feeling um and sort of that

150
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,319
little collection believe it or not is

151
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,519
the is the vast majority of what we know

152
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,400
or what we're what we're trying to call

153
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:58,279
CHS um but there's a lot of questions

154
00:06:55,399 --> 00:07:00,359
around that as well um but definitely

155
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:01,799
repeating episodes of intense nausea and

156
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,080
vomiting doesn't respond to other

157
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:07,240
medicine patients who consume cannabis

158
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:10,318
and might be relieved with hot

159
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:13,240
baths great Megan anything to add

160
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:15,879
there um we'll get into it all right

161
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:18,360
very good all the things I have to add

162
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,840
cool and so kind of before we get into

163
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,759
you know the different things that we're

164
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:24,638
curious about or you know that we're

165
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,960
trying to uncover with CHS I was curious

166
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,960
about the two of you being clinicians

167
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,719
you know your experience dealing with

168
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,399
patients who are kind of suffering from

169
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,120
this um so yeah let's talk about that

170
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:37,799
and Megan maybe maybe you can start

171
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,639
there like um have you worked with

172
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,759
patients suffering from CHS and sort of

173
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,800
what do those cases maybe have in common

174
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,360
or what's unique in what you've seen

175
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,199
yeah uh before we get into that we'll

176
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
plug the study real quick that we are

177
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,759
recruiting right now for our CHS survey

178
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:57,038
where we're it's a two-part survey where

179
00:07:54,759 --> 00:07:59,720
people will answer detailed detailed

180
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:02,439
questions on their CHS symptoms and

181
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,919
their cannabis use history so um I don't

182
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,800
know where we're going to post the link

183
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:07,478
but um we're recruiting for that be

184
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,960
multiple places we're going to it'll be

185
00:08:07,478 --> 00:08:10,439
all over the place yeah I'll definitely

186
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:12,318
put it in the show description for this

187
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,918
episode too so people can e easily find

188
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,199
it perfect perfect thank you um so what

189
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:22,198
I see oftentimes I see people in the

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:25,759
early stages of CHS in What's called the

191
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:28,240
prodrome phase which is Phase One of CHS

192
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,000
and this is a phase that can last for

193
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,320
months years

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,759
maybe even a decade or two and common

195
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,959
symptoms of prodrome are waking up with

196
00:08:36,759 --> 00:08:43,038
morning

197
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:46,958
nausea um anxiety like kind of GI upset

198
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:50,080
heartburn just not feeling well and

199
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:52,479
alcohol intolerance is one that were um

200
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:56,278
that's surprising a surprising like

201
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,639
early symptom but very common among CHS

202
00:08:56,278 --> 00:09:01,399
patients and so I get those people a lot

203
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:04,120
that that say that they have these

204
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,879
symptoms and oftentimes cannabis can

205
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,120
help these symptoms you know they wake

206
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:11,958
up feeling nauseous they use their THC

207
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,440
and then they feel better for a limited

208
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:17,278
amount of time and then eventually this

209
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,279
rolls into the hyper medic phase and

210
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:21,519
I'll let Cody um we sort of touched on

211
00:09:20,278 --> 00:09:23,439
that that's sort of like what we're

212
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:26,959
characterized with which is this intense

213
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,560
nausea and vomiting once again for no

214
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,518
other reason you know when you come into

215
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:32,838
the hospital where I see patients in the

216
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:34,399
hyperic phase um they're not reaching

217
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,240
out to me online but rather I I still

218
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,519
work in a a traditional hospital setting

219
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,200
as a pharmacist and we're seeing

220
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,639
patients come in in these these intense

221
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:45,640
bouts of vomiting kind of unaware of

222
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:47,319
this unwellness or the cause of this

223
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:49,559
unwellness that Megan just described for

224
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:51,079
extreme periods of time and now they

225
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:53,799
come into the hospital we do what's

226
00:09:51,078 --> 00:09:56,519
called a full workup we scan them we we

227
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:58,838
check every you know potential cause of

228
00:09:56,519 --> 00:10:00,240
nause and vomiting the top 20 most

229
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:01,720
common things that cause vomiting in

230
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,440
kids and none of them are they're all

231
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,360
clear you know you might find a little

232
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,240
inflammation in the belly or something

233
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,680
like that but generally almost nothing

234
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,278
and um sometimes if they don't say

235
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:13,679
anything about their THC use we don't

236
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,958
even know right because we didn't do a

237
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:17,838
urine screen we weren't looking for it

238
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:19,799
this again I deal with kids so they're

239
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,680
under 18 so they might not be honest

240
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,439
let's be honest adults are also not

241
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,000
telling their doctors about their

242
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,519
cannabis use and so they go undiagnosed

243
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,720
and so we frequently see this with

244
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,919
patients with c HS as well is they get

245
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,440
into this hypomesus phase they kind of

246
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,879
recover they fall back into this

247
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,440
unwellness maybe they have a GI doctor

248
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:41,799
they're in the Health Care System but we

249
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,760
don't know um and then they bounce back

250
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:45,879
in this intense vomiting the right

251
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,799
person or the right doctor or the right

252
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:50,559
lab those sort of three things align and

253
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:54,199
there's a light bulb moment like ah this

254
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:57,119
is probably cannabis um and I see this

255
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,040
with some some frequency I mean look I

256
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,399
saw a patient definitively with this

257
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,759
condition last two nights ago in the

258
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:06,480
hospital and then last night I was asked

259
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:08,600
to come see check out a patient um and

260
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,959
and assess whether they had CHS and and

261
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:13,399
it looked like probably not and so like

262
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:15,799
there are times where this isn't the the

263
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:19,000
diagnosis but I'm seeing this more and

264
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:21,439
more in person myself who's a big

265
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,759
skeptic a huge proponent of cannabis I'm

266
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,440
not trying to to demean the plant or or

267
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:30,278
raise alarm Bells but the Cannabis

268
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,240
products whether it's the itself or

269
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:34,639
something else in these products is

270
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,440
causing this syndrome this collection of

271
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:40,639
symptoms in an increasing amount of

272
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,279
people American citizens our friends

273
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:46,039
smoking legal weed potentially are

274
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:48,720
getting sick

275
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:52,000
why no and you touched on a good point

276
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:54,759
the the amount of cases are growing is

277
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,600
that just because of a better awareness

278
00:11:54,759 --> 00:12:01,360
we we're better able to identify it or

279
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,320
is it potential something else there's

280
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,320
evidence to say that that's that you

281
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,480
know well into the knowing about this

282
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,920
disease like

283
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,480
200 five is when it was first described

284
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:14,000
now this this was actually first

285
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,680
described in in Australia by by a doctor

286
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,440
who noticed this in these patients who

287
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,519
had been consuming a lot of cannabis

288
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,720
word kind of slowly spread and we've

289
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:23,320
seen more and more there's still a lot

290
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:25,320
of lack of awareness and there's still a

291
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,160
lot of stigma so we're seeing both sides

292
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,320
of the coin of overdiagnosing and

293
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:32,278
underdiagnosing lack of awareness or

294
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,360
lack of sharing right it's all kind of

295
00:12:32,278 --> 00:12:36,879
swirling to make a bad situation for

296
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:38,680
patients who are just really trying to

297
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:41,320
understand why they're sick and most of

298
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:43,359
them have no idea that it's their their

299
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,760
cannabis which they believe to be highly

300
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,639
medicinal and have very little negative

301
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:50,278
effect and that is the case for the vast

302
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,360
majority of our patients um but for some

303
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:54,480
reason and Ethan Russo you kind of

304
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,519
alluded to maybe for genetic reasons

305
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,000
there seems to be some patients who just

306
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:03,078
cannot tolerate cannabis um in large

307
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,559
doses over long periods of time you know

308
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:09,439
we don't fully understand why

309
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,919
yet excellent no and you I was glad that

310
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,399
you brought it up Megan about sort of

311
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,039
these early warning signs of CHS um and

312
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,159
it seems like you you've described them

313
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:21,439
so when patients come to you with that

314
00:13:19,159 --> 00:13:23,838
um sort of what is your advice or a way

315
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:27,279
to sort of uh prevent them from getting

316
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,360
to the hyper edic stage well first I

317
00:13:27,278 --> 00:13:31,159
asked a lot of questions on what does

318
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,320
their use look like how long have they

319
00:13:31,159 --> 00:13:35,000
been using tell me more about your

320
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,480
symptoms and what you know what you're

321
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,720
feeling and what you're experiencing um

322
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,639
a lot of them have like almost textbook

323
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,680
exact same stories they've been using

324
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,440
for a long time they wake up with

325
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:52,278
morning nausea uh cannabis helps a

326
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:54,639
little bit you know in the interim um

327
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:56,559
they seen 10 different doctors they've

328
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,440
been treating with two different three

329
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,039
different GI medicines yes you know like

330
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,480
they've done all the scans they've done

331
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:05,759
ruled everything out no one seems to

332
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:08,519
know what's actually causing their

333
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,800
illness and it's not just not just belly

334
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,399
pain or the EM the emesis it's this

335
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:16,679
overall malaise and like uh the

336
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,839
prodromal phase is not fun people don't

337
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,198
feel well even though they're not in the

338
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,160
vomiting phase so those individuals who

339
00:14:22,198 --> 00:14:25,278
haven't figured out that it's the

340
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:28,078
Cannabis they're consuming daily or or

341
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,919
near daily is what most it seems have

342
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:31,399
developed it although there's some

343
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:33,679
variability there that we're trying to

344
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:35,159
tease apart in our study like how often

345
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,078
are individuals developing this

346
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:40,120
consuming is it once a week or does it

347
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:43,000
seem like everybody's consuming multiple

348
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,440
times a day you know are they smoking

349
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,919
High CBD flour or is it mostly high THC

350
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,759
products are you getting your products

351
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:51,958
in the dispensary or are you growing

352
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:54,720
your own and there's so many questions

353
00:14:51,958 --> 00:14:56,679
that we don't have at least even like

354
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,160
weight to right it's just sort of

355
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,958
opinion that we've heard on the internet

356
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:03,639
and so we were really trying to put some

357
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:06,479
weight to that and help guide doctors

358
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,320
and uh inform patients about what could

359
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,720
be going on with them yeah and I think

360
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:15,000
one of the one of the really interesting

361
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,839
nuances of this syndrome is that it's

362
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,799
not is how the THC can help in the

363
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:23,120
interim but it's when

364
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:25,000
patients get towards you know not

365
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,519
consuming they've like maybe that's

366
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,440
because they're they've either been

367
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,000
sleeping or they go on vacation and

368
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,440
that's when the symptoms tend to start

369
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,519
to rev up and they start to have like

370
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:40,240
the nausea the GI

371
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,480
distress Cody what else do we see but we

372
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:46,480
see that in oftentimes like days two to

373
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,278
three of abstinence from canabus which

374
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:52,680
kind of that that rebuts the whole neem

375
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:55,519
oil pesticide thing that like in the

376
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:57,399
absence of that wor seeing these

377
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:59,078
symptoms I would say the other two

378
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,078
things that that are pretty commonly

379
00:15:59,078 --> 00:16:05,120
seen and yes sometimes in the morning

380
00:16:01,078 --> 00:16:07,159
not exclusively by any means are um in

381
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,278
thermo disregulation which is a fancy

382
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:10,278
way of saying my temperature is

383
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:13,318
fluctuating a lot I feel hot and cold

384
00:16:10,278 --> 00:16:14,838
I'm sweaty I'm I'm you know flush but

385
00:16:13,318 --> 00:16:17,679
not feeling not being able to regulate

386
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:20,680
that normally and ex intense anxiety

387
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:22,078
abnormal anxiety uh you know it's you're

388
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,638
kind of like your heart's already racing

389
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:26,519
in the morning and you're already Doom

390
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:29,039
and Gloom uh and stressed about your day

391
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,839
but you're just started like and that

392
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:34,039
not normal for you some individuals that

393
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,440
that is actually just their Norm um but

394
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:39,240
you know when it when it's not then this

395
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,079
is another I think kind of lowlevel

396
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:44,198
disregulation alarm that I would call

397
00:16:42,078 --> 00:16:46,559
most of what Megan has described in the

398
00:16:44,198 --> 00:16:48,240
Pro Drome and again that's speculation

399
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:50,599
we don't fully understand the condition

400
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:53,839
but we know there's a disregulation we

401
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,759
see these cycles of nausea and vomiting

402
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:59,800
we know there is a weight being put on

403
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,399
the scale which is cannabis product

404
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:04,438
again usually as far as we know high THC

405
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,558
cannabis products and trying to figure

406
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:09,279
out how would we push on that scale at

407
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,078
all comes out to this vomiting condition

408
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,359
we're trying to pick apart and there are

409
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:16,000
theories that it's not the THC by the

410
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,119
way have you heard one yeah yeah I have

411
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:21,679
heard what's the one you've heard the

412
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,479
most Ben um pesticides NE oil pesticides

413
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,798
neem oil specifically right first of all

414
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,519
I would say for a lot of weed people we

415
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:31,599
like natural things right need oil is

416
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:34,440
extremely natural it is the you know it

417
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:40,000
is the actual oil from a a tree nut and

418
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:44,080
so um a tree maybe just the tree pulp

419
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
but either way from the neem tree um and

420
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:48,960
you know there's not a lot of evidence

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,919
here Ethan Russo very definitively you

422
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,840
know puts his his uh Line in the Sand

423
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,320
here and says this doesn't look like uh

424
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,000
and I'm going to mispronounce the active

425
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:00,119
ingredient in me but this doesn't look

426
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,319
like that toxicity and when I talk to

427
00:18:00,119 --> 00:18:04,879
you know uh toxicologists and emergency

428
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:06,918
physicians who I work with closely it

429
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,000
doesn't really look like acute pesticide

430
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,840
toxicity in almost all the forms in

431
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,480
which we know because the response to

432
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,439
the toxin is not immediate which is

433
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,880
almost always the case especially if

434
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:23,919
you're smoking it um and and so you know

435
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:26,360
it would be very weird to have repeating

436
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,038
episodes in this cyclical nature every

437
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:31,439
couple months and that is correl ated

438
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,240
with potentially your menstrual cycle or

439
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,720
stressful events or whether you drink

440
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,079
alcohol it just doesn't it doesn't

441
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:39,319
totally line up with it I wouldn't even

442
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:41,639
say totally it doesn't line up with a

443
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:44,639
traditional toxidrome which is being

444
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:48,919
Intoxicated by a substance or being imp

445
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,280
um having that poison in your body so

446
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,799
you know there's a lot of reasons it

447
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:55,038
doesn't look like neem but I'm

448
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,599
open-minded there could definitely be

449
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:59,879
increasing amount of pesticides in our

450
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:02,519
cannabis and we need to study that but

451
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,159
it would be a little naive to call it

452
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,918
pesticides when we know some patients

453
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,960
smoking what is presumed to be clean

454
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,440
cannabis there's an argument to be made

455
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:12,279
about what the definition of is but

456
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,080
legally purchased regulated cannabis who

457
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:16,720
are still developing CHS right so then

458
00:19:15,079 --> 00:19:18,480
if I look at what's in that product and

459
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,480
I can definitively say there's not very

460
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,558
much of any of this other stuff but

461
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,159
there seems to be a lot of one

462
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:29,119
particular thing that thing is CHC and

463
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:31,679
it tends to be the warmest you know know

464
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:33,439
uh in in a doctor is like that's

465
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,120
probably the thing that's causing it the

466
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,640
thing that exists in 30% not less than

467
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:42,719
05% because it's under the detectable

468
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:45,240
limit right aam's Razer right I mean the

469
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,159
most logical explanation is typically

470
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,720
the right one yeah and and I want to

471
00:19:47,159 --> 00:19:51,360
point out so my expertise is in the

472
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,200
endoc canabo system I love this system

473
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:54,599
I'm doing a talk on it two of them in

474
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,279
the next in the next two months at

475
00:19:54,599 --> 00:20:00,839
either MJ uh unpacked in Missouri or at

476
00:19:58,279 --> 00:20:03,720
um Society of cannabis clinicians in

477
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,399
Baltimore I love this system this system

478
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,440
is homeostatic regulatory system

479
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,280
connecting all of the other systems in

480
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,798
the body including the adrenal system

481
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:14,879
which we know is disrupted in the ECS

482
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:16,759
including your thermo regulatory system

483
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,480
which we know as I've related it's

484
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:22,440
related to your GI motility it's related

485
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:25,279
to your pain sensitization it's related

486
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:28,200
to your again heat sensitization your

487
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:31,558
hot bath and hot shower complex we can

488
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,480
explain away without even much of a

489
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:36,720
stretch how THC interacting with CB1

490
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,079
receptors could disregulated well not

491
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,279
just CB1 but the endoc canabo system

492
00:20:39,079 --> 00:20:44,798
could disregulated in a way that could

493
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,359
explain almost all of this um and and so

494
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,000
for me that is the warmest Theory but we

495
00:20:47,359 --> 00:20:51,558
need real science this is a theory and

496
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,798
and a loose one of best I it's not even

497
00:20:51,558 --> 00:20:55,038
a hypothesis or maybe it's a hypothesis

498
00:20:53,798 --> 00:20:58,079
and not a theory either way it's the

499
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:59,720
lowest one and and but we need to do

500
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,158
this work and we need to start with

501
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,440
asking the right questions and is the

502
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:07,159
right question is is this what pesticide

503
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,279
toxicity looks like the answer is almost

504
00:21:07,159 --> 00:21:11,799
a resounding no especially when you

505
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:14,480
consider the hot

506
00:21:11,798 --> 00:21:17,679
bath I haven't seen anybody get exposed

507
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:19,759
to Organo phosphates at a farm in you

508
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,080
know Sacramento where they rush into the

509
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:27,038
hospital and place into a warm bath

510
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:30,599
yeah no and we you kind of touched on

511
00:21:27,038 --> 00:21:33,158
other you know hyper edic type of

512
00:21:30,599 --> 00:21:36,240
conditions that may sometimes be

513
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:39,679
misdiagnosed as CHS but so I'm curious

514
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:42,000
in those cases are the hot baths um

515
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,720
helpful for other sort of similar

516
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,919
conditions or is that very much unique

517
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,919
to

518
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,520
CHS it wouldn't use the word very much

519
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,038
do you want to take it Megan sure sure I

520
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:55,480
had to do this uh as part of a program

521
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,519
or a part of a project in grad school so

522
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:01,038
you know their CBS is like the umbrella

523
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,720
CHS is a vomiting syndrome is the big

524
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:07,000
term for conditions like this and then

525
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:11,000
CHS is a subsection within that right

526
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:13,919
and with c CVS uh oftentimes that's not

527
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:16,119
related to cannabis use oftentimes it's

528
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,640
related to Childhood stressors or

529
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:22,359
traumas and that's how like the stress

530
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:26,679
manifests in kids and teens is cyclic

531
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:28,879
vomiting and THC cannabis helps those

532
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,600
with CVS and it doesn't make it worse

533
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,159
and that's like a big differentiating

534
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:37,079
factor there is some evidence that hot

535
00:22:33,159 --> 00:22:40,760
showers can help those with CVS but it

536
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:43,000
is like predominantly like in CHS it's

537
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:45,759
like one of the pillars of of the

538
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:48,079
syndrome itself so yeah I think just to

539
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:51,558
to C go back and and I guess rephrase

540
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:53,480
because I agree so you've got hot baths

541
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:54,879
and showers it's not common that people

542
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,079
would do that for nausea vomiting but

543
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,760
it's not also unheard of you feel unwell

544
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,240
you're going to go take a hot bath and a

545
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:01,879
little bit better so just throwing that

546
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,038
out there for not even cyli vomiting

547
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,600
like some people would argue you can

548
00:23:04,038 --> 00:23:08,278
feel better from a hot bath now these

549
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:10,759
patients report a significant difference

550
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:13,038
from I want to die I'm so nauseous to I

551
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:15,440
can tolerate life on this realm you know

552
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:17,919
and it's like a big Stark difference but

553
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,640
setting that aside cyclic vomitor which

554
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:20,440
Megan alluded to we don't fully

555
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,080
understand but it's definitely

556
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,038
associated with childhood stressors and

557
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:26,918
traumas but there's a there's an

558
00:23:24,038 --> 00:23:29,158
imbalance or a disregulation of the of

559
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,840
the the systems now now those

560
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,559
individuals are still hard to treat but

561
00:23:31,839 --> 00:23:35,918
we do treat them with traditional

562
00:23:33,558 --> 00:23:38,319
antiemetics they typically respond more

563
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,720
to the Zofran the serotonin blockers

564
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:44,639
that we give normally um the other thing

565
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,880
is like Megan said it's so um almost all

566
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,320
of them will have developed this

567
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,080
condition before they started smoking

568
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:52,720
cannabis uh because it is a childhood or

569
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,720
like teen developing although it can

570
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,720
happen in adults too but but I'm trying

571
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:59,038
to speak in generalities you're going to

572
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,400
see earlier and these patients often

573
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,839
report benefit from THC but don't forget

574
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:06,240
Megan mentioned that a lot of patients

575
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:08,918
who develop CHS also get a some benefit

576
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:10,798
and now I've got a patient who's got a

577
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:12,120
cyclic vomiting disorder who say smokes

578
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:13,519
cannabis who says it makes him feel

579
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:15,359
better now the doctor is like oh this

580
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:17,000
could be CHS especially if they don't

581
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:19,519
know that patient or know their history

582
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
very well so there's a misdiagnosis

583
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:24,158
there even though they're not taking hot

584
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,599
baths it's because the THC showed up in

585
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
their urine there's a cross

586
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:30,959
confusion lastly I want to say

587
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,240
differentiate around the hot baths I've

588
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,079
seen both I've seen a paper that

589
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,480
suggests yes that's a good indicator and

590
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,960
I've seen another paper more recently

591
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,798
that suggested actually both cyclic

592
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:45,399
vomitor and cannaboid hyperemesis

593
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:48,720
sufferers both find some relief from hot

594
00:24:45,398 --> 00:24:51,439
baths which sort of mutes out that as a

595
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
diagnostic Factor only making the job

596
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:55,159
more challenging right like truly

597
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,440
identifying which condition we're

598
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,159
dealing with is it the weed that's

599
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,798
causing the condition or does this

600
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,159
patient have an underlying condition in

601
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,879
which weed is helping them but they have

602
00:25:03,159 --> 00:25:08,919
the same vomiting problem um cyclic

603
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:12,120
vomitor don't typically have prodromal

604
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:15,600
symptoms in the same way that that c CH

605
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,278
sers do and um I think headache if I

606
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:21,678
recall correctly is a more common

607
00:25:18,278 --> 00:25:25,079
precursor to a cyclic vomiting episode

608
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,320
um but it can happen before a CHS

609
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,839
episode as well so it's not a clear

610
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:30,158
picture

611
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,639
right and with the hot bathing too I

612
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,760
think with CHS it's like it's labeled as

613
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,960
like pathological hot bathing like like

614
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:40,319
people will burn their skin get second

615
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:43,079
third degree burns on their skin from

616
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:45,720
needing to be in the scalding hot

617
00:25:43,079 --> 00:25:49,879
showers for long periods of time yeah

618
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,558
wow Yik I yeah it's we've seen some

619
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,640
pretty severe cases you know the average

620
00:25:51,558 --> 00:25:56,599
person isn't doing that but they will

621
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,840
rack up a $500 gas bill or you know

622
00:25:56,599 --> 00:26:00,519
water bill and they just run the all day

623
00:25:58,839 --> 00:26:02,439
long we can't parents will be like we

624
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,519
cannot get him out of the B like he

625
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:06,399
won't come out at in the morning we're

626
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,599
late for school like all the things

627
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,558
because the

628
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,918
showers and now is total abstinence from

629
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:17,278
THC a a

630
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:23,000
solution I would say it is the textbook

631
00:26:17,278 --> 00:26:24,200
solution um how in your experience um

632
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:29,798
with

633
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:33,038
abstinence uh how do you people do

634
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:35,879
can be difficult leav some to be desired

635
00:26:33,038 --> 00:26:37,759
right uh Megan Have You Ever Seen I'm

636
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:39,360
sure you've seen patients go abstinent

637
00:26:37,759 --> 00:26:42,798
but have you ever seen anybody you know

638
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:46,359
not go abstinent um I mean all the time

639
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:49,000
people continue to to use often not

640
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:51,439
believing their diagnosis right right or

641
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:54,919
that they feel like they can still

642
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,320
continue to use low amounts and manage

643
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,038
their symptoms that way um but for the

644
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:05,599
like that is interestingly like one of

645
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:07,640
the only published criteria for CHS is

646
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,839
you know the symptoms if your symptoms

647
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:12,960
go away after six months of abstinence

648
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:16,158
then it's likely that you had CHS six

649
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:19,240
months ago so um but it is you know if

650
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,360
it's like the the presumed cause then

651
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,599
taking away the cause is likely going to

652
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:26,278
be the solution and I think that for

653
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,839
some reason that pisses a lot of people

654
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:29,759
off like we're actually getting at the

655
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:32,038
root cause of this and they're like

656
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:35,919
there's no cure for it well you take

657
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:38,000
away the cause of it which is uh that's

658
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:43,840
an interesting you know Paradigm that I

659
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:46,759
see um but but yeah it's um that really

660
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:49,119
is the only the only known thing to help

661
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:51,359
with CHS and it's recovery is a roller

662
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:53,678
coaster it's not like you stop using and

663
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:58,319
then your Syms go away and you know

664
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,840
stopping use can then trigger episodes

665
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:03,038
down the line and um and people are

666
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:05,398
using their cannabis to stop an episode

667
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,798
from happening and then they stop using

668
00:28:05,398 --> 00:28:09,319
and then it triggers an episode or they

669
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,319
have stopped using for a couple of

670
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:14,599
months and then they eat some food that

671
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,439
triggers them or alcohol or stressful

672
00:28:14,599 --> 00:28:19,798
event triggers a CHS episode and they

673
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:22,200
haven't used in three months so recovery

674
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:24,839
now they don't think they have CHS right

675
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,640
right because this disregulation or this

676
00:28:24,839 --> 00:28:30,398
imbalance sort of lingers in our system

677
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,519
for an extended period of time patients

678
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:35,359
sometimes reporting 12 months before

679
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:37,440
they feel whole again from a GI

680
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:39,439
perspective the damage and the the

681
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,080
inflammation that went on during their

682
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,759
EP and you remember people suffered for

683
00:28:41,079 --> 00:28:43,960
years without knowing right there are

684
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:46,440
people on these discussion boards that

685
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:47,919
suffered for 15 years with a condition

686
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,720
they'd seen every doctor no one knew

687
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,640
what it was right and they've been

688
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,759
taking medicine and had all the Scopes

689
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,240
and done everything um but the where did

690
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:01,359
how did I get on this point Megan um

691
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:03,759
don't remember you just talking recovery

692
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:06,319
recovery being a roller coaster right so

693
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:09,759
so what I always counsel my patients on

694
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:11,439
is like you know we like patient

695
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:13,200
yesterday hadn't consumed cannabis in

696
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,919
nine days and she was in the middle of

697
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,600
an episode and it was triggered you know

698
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:21,240
at Disneyland from uh a hot burrito uh

699
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:23,519
beia taco or something of this effect

700
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,159
right and that's what set her off into

701
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,000
into this this problem so we don't you

702
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,559
know um we don't

703
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,720
fully know what the the timeline looks

704
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:35,278
like we're going to ask you questions

705
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,640
about this if you take our survey or you

706
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:38,759
send this to your friend we're going to

707
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,440
ask about how long after you quit did

708
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:43,158
you have symptoms but I can tell you in

709
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,240
my personal um you know practice

710
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:48,080
experience I am not a CS CHS sufferer

711
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:49,759
but in my experience talking to patients

712
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:55,639
that have it we're

713
00:29:49,759 --> 00:29:59,240
seeing um easily 7 days usually 21 to 30

714
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:01,200
days and sometimes 60 plus plus days of

715
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,798
oh I just had an episode again don't

716
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,840
know what it was didn't know maybe it

717
00:30:03,798 --> 00:30:07,879
was stress like Megan said maybe it was

718
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,599
some weird food that you thought you

719
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:11,720
could try again because it made you sick

720
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,519
a long time ago but it happened we don't

721
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,679
know but we're trying to put that

722
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:17,599
together so we can use that to educate

723
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,440
patients to help them know because

724
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:22,398
Physicians aren't telling patients to I

725
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:25,360
shouldn't say any most Physicians are

726
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:27,759
not not telling folks that hey you might

727
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:30,359
have more vomiting over the next few

728
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:32,359
days you should expect to have more

729
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:34,359
vomiting over the next few days even

730
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:36,839
though I believe you and you quit three

731
00:30:34,359 --> 00:30:39,079
days ago and that conversation is not

732
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:41,639
happening because Physicians aren't

733
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,798
aware enough or frankly the data doesn't

734
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,840
help them right now there's not a lot of

735
00:30:43,798 --> 00:30:48,119
evidence for them to lean on and say oh

736
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:50,480
yeah most patients will have another

737
00:30:48,119 --> 00:30:52,119
episode in the next 21 days they don't

738
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,079
have that information so that's what

739
00:30:52,119 --> 00:30:57,119
again the survey is trying to give them

740
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:58,558
some info to lean on to more quickly and

741
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:00,158
definitively know

742
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:03,798
sort of how to categorize and then how

743
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:05,880
to treat as opposed to throwing a label

744
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:07,480
on something throwing an anti psychotic

745
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:09,480
to help get them out of the emergency

746
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,480
room and sending people on their merry

747
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:15,079
way which unfortunately happens more

748
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:17,399
often than not yeah no that's that's new

749
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:19,398
to me like I said done a few episodes on

750
00:31:17,398 --> 00:31:21,479
this and seen some cannmed talks on it

751
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,278
and obviously seen other things um I

752
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,120
didn't realize the the the roller

753
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:27,638
coaster of recovery there I thought you

754
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:30,038
know you you abstain your your symptoms

755
00:31:27,638 --> 00:31:33,678
go away um it's really interesting that

756
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:37,119
other things can sort of trigger it and

757
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:38,798
I mean not that I'm a clinician but my

758
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:41,079
thought with that and you could tell me

759
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:42,638
if I'm on the right track is you know

760
00:31:41,079 --> 00:31:45,439
other things are interfacing with the

761
00:31:42,638 --> 00:31:48,638
endoc canabo system not just canabo and

762
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:51,600
other things can can kind of cause uh

763
00:31:48,638 --> 00:31:53,479
spikes in your endoc canabo so do you

764
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:56,839
think that's perhaps what's going on

765
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:59,079
like certain stressors triggers um can

766
00:31:56,839 --> 00:32:02,158
sort of just

767
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:05,638
disre I'll h on one point of that is

768
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,320
that um oftentimes people in

769
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:11,359
recovery some people will exercise and

770
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:13,960
work out and then sometimes that can

771
00:32:11,359 --> 00:32:17,079
trigger symptoms and you know we know

772
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,798
what exercise does to our ECS so some

773
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:20,558
people are told to like yeah exercise

774
00:32:18,798 --> 00:32:23,319
but don't go overboard because you don't

775
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,319
want to trigger anything Cody go ahead

776
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:26,960
yeah and we know that part of the endoc

777
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:28,599
canabo system's role is to chase the

778
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:31,000
Circadian rhythm and we're seeing this

779
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:32,480
weird sort of morning presentation once

780
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,079
again there's not good data on how many

781
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,240
people are having this morning is

782
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:38,000
mentioned in the literature but how many

783
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,839
is is unclear so we're hoping to get

784
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,599
some hands on that but the ECS naturally

785
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:45,359
follows the cortisol level so as

786
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:47,719
cortisol comes up the ECS comes up and

787
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,278
turns it off okay but if your ECS isn't

788
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:51,440
working and the cortisol is running out

789
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,240
of control and now you've got this sort

790
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,159
of inbalance we see this almost every

791
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,480
day I guess is what I'm getting at on a

792
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,159
micro scale on a macro scale yeah we

793
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,558
some women are reporting their menstrual

794
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:04,200
periods which we know there's a dramatic

795
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,879
shift in endoc canabo and function

796
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:10,440
throughout the body and and the you know

797
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,278
reproductive track um just like so many

798
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,080
again like ways to kind of tease it

799
00:33:12,278 --> 00:33:19,000
together I do think there are things we

800
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:22,038
can do outside of um THC right that that

801
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,798
interact with our ECS but very few are

802
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:28,278
as powerful of a hack as sucking down

803
00:33:24,798 --> 00:33:31,599
the Plant medicine out of a a battery 18

804
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:34,038
times a day and you know I don't think

805
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:36,359
no amount of meditation will be able to

806
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:40,158
sort of replicate that sort of stimulus

807
00:33:36,359 --> 00:33:43,240
to the system and so you know I I still

808
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:46,200
tend to lean towards like yes there are

809
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,038
things that happen but the the ECS is

810
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:50,080
highly Dynamic and it's working real

811
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:52,240
hard even when you smoke weed all day to

812
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,359
keep you in balance in check awake when

813
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,120
you're supposed to be sleeping when

814
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:58,798
you're not Etc and so if it just doesn't

815
00:33:56,119 --> 00:34:02,839
have the muster and that's maybe what's

816
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:05,440
leading to to the this disregulation um

817
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:08,039
you know sort of a suppression of the

818
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,878
natural ECS because of too many phyto

819
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:12,800
canabo um then it seems pretty obvious

820
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:14,719
that treatment would then lean towards

821
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,119
trying to restore balance without the

822
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:20,239
introduction of that phyto canabo this

823
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:23,039
very powerful modulator of this system

824
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:25,039
um so back to and I wanted to finish

825
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:29,719
where Megan was going and I'm so glad I

826
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,719
just remembered is to like um

827
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,960
what cannabis can you use right

828
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:35,440
abstinence is look I tell all my

829
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:37,320
patients the textbook answer is you got

830
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,720
to quit and the truth is I you

831
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:42,320
definitely have to quit for now I don't

832
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,759
know what the future holds for you I can

833
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,960
assure you what you're doing right now

834
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:49,119
you don't get to do this again like you

835
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
you you don't get to go and just consume

836
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:54,079
cannabis willy-nilly like it doesn't

837
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:56,838
have an effect on you we now know you're

838
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,599
for lack of just using poor terms a

839
00:34:56,838 --> 00:35:01,838
carrier right right of you have this

840
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,800
genetic makeup you have this

841
00:35:01,838 --> 00:35:06,239
disposition and therefore if and when

842
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
you decide to go back to cannabis know

843
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,919
that this is a risk what you're dealing

844
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,400
with right now is a very much a risk and

845
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,680
you're going to need to be aware of it

846
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,920
because remember those symptoms that you

847
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,719
had five six days ago that was your body

848
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:20,400
telling you that we got a problem and

849
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:22,559
you didn't listen or just as an example

850
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,559
but you know I think there's a

851
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:30,039
conversation to be had that is uh well

852
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:32,000
you know there there's a risk and uh

853
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:33,960
therefore you shouldn't do it it'd be

854
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:36,119
like somebody who contracted an STD and

855
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:39,119
you told them hey no more sex for you

856
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:40,960
buddy that stuff's dangerous right and

857
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:43,519
instead of teaching them mitigation

858
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:45,280
factors acknowledging that we're humans

859
00:35:43,519 --> 00:35:47,599
and potentially that that person had was

860
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,760
deriving substantial medical benefit

861
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,240
from Cannabis medicine and that's where

862
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,319
they started right they didn't just

863
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:54,959
start consuming cannabis all day because

864
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:56,519
they were bored I mean I'm sure there's

865
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,280
a couple examples that most people are

866
00:35:56,519 --> 00:35:59,679
using it because they're are anxious

867
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,720
because they're dealing with pain

868
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:04,000
because they're they're dealing with uh

869
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,279
the stressors of this crazy you know

870
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,159
modern world we live in

871
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:11,119
so you know to deny them of any cannabis

872
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:12,199
medicine is challenging and I think that

873
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:14,599
there might be hope for other

874
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:16,480
cannabinoids as well and if if you're

875
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:18,400
listening and you have CHS or you're you

876
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,880
know you're you're hearing about this we

877
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,200
want to hear about what you've tried

878
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:25,039
that works what did you change to what

879
00:36:22,199 --> 00:36:26,598
what has you know not set you off

880
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:28,519
because we know people are doing this

881
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm willing to bet I hope the data shows

882
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:33,759
this probably half are floating this

883
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:36,358
like I don't fully accept or I know that

884
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:38,040
I have CHS but I still smoke on occasion

885
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:39,960
we've got some people who who've gone

886
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,599
hard you know they develop CHS and they

887
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,400
discover mushrooms and they're like holy

888
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,960
cow I can't believe how cannabis wasn't

889
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,039
serving me like we see this whole

890
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,639
spectrum of experiences among these

891
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:51,719
these sufferers and we really just want

892
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,920
to catalog them and document them um so

893
00:36:51,719 --> 00:36:56,919
thanks for having us on to talk about it

894
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:59,079
yeah absolutely um and I did want to

895
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,920
sort of talk so we talked about the you

896
00:36:59,079 --> 00:37:03,480
know the contaminants and you know

897
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,119
whether or not that's that's a a factor

898
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,318
the positive factor I believe there are

899
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:09,680
contaminants in cannabis sure I believe

900
00:37:07,318 --> 00:37:11,400
they can cause certain illnesses just

901
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,519
not convinced that this collection of

902
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,880
symptoms that we're talking about here

903
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:18,280
today is that you know I think people

904
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,599
are getting sick from contaminants

905
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:22,119
whether it's in hemp converted products

906
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:23,280
or whether it's in pesticide ritten

907
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:25,720
legal products that are even in

908
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,280
regulated markets that's just not what

909
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:29,519
I'm talking about I'm talking about this

910
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:32,319
very specific set of symptoms of

911
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,639
hyperemesis and prodrome that doesn't

912
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:37,679
line up with a typical toxidrome right

913
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:41,759
so it's much more likely that this is a

914
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:44,000
cause of high doses of THC correct um so

915
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,880
talk a bit about sort of I mean what

916
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,599
patterns you've seen in terms of like

917
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:50,400
what's the run of administration like

918
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,359
are these people consuming concentrates

919
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,318
versus Flour Edibles what does that look

920
00:37:53,358 --> 00:37:57,519
like have you seen any studies on this

921
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,480
Megan like have you um I have not seen

922
00:37:57,519 --> 00:38:01,000
studies but I do have lots of anecdotes

923
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,480
of people who come to me and this is

924
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,400
exactly what we are this survey is for

925
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:08,920
is to tease this apart but I the people

926
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:11,838
who come to me will say either I've been

927
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,720
smoking for a decade or two or three or

928
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:19,279
five um usually smoking flour or I've

929
00:38:15,719 --> 00:38:22,078
been using concentrates for a much

930
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,560
shorter period of time um that's what I

931
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,480
have seen and then they start to develop

932
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:29,279
those six months one year two years for

933
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,599
concentrates as opposed to this decade

934
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:32,160
that you feel like you're most of your

935
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,720
patients Megan and I have talked about

936
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:37,679
this so I kind of knew what right right

937
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:39,598
and and it's interesting that in teens

938
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,440
the teens Cody has worked with more

939
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,119
teens than I have but the few teens that

940
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,400
I have seen has been like a short short

941
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:48,480
period of time of using concentrates

942
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,480
like two to three months of using

943
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,679
concentrates go on vacation and then

944
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:56,159
start to have CHS like symptoms with the

945
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:59,399
pro Drome in there

946
00:38:56,159 --> 00:39:02,000
too yeah that sounds shorter than

947
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:03,800
average um not denying that it happened

948
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,480
I think you know that individual may be

949
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,960
more predisposed from a genetic

950
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:09,639
perspective we we know that there's at

951
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,838
least six uh mutations that Ethan was

952
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:14,039
able to identify you know just in his

953
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:18,239
preliminary relatively small studies so

954
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:20,599
we're gonna learn more as well um I

955
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:23,519
think what we've seen in data so I'm

956
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:27,440
trying to reach back in 2019 you had

957
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:29,318
Alice moon on in your your uh guest I

958
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,519
was in 2021 I was my class president at

959
00:39:29,318 --> 00:39:35,199
um Maryland we did a online education on

960
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:37,239
on CHS and we had Alice as our guest

961
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:39,318
Alice was able to present her survey

962
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:41,000
data that she had done which ended up

963
00:39:39,318 --> 00:39:43,440
not ever being published I think she

964
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,599
recently collaborated on a new study

965
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,760
that should be published soon out of

966
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,400
UCLA looking very similar to what we're

967
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,280
doing which is great because we got to

968
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,760
get more data we need to help we need to

969
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,640
help and one stud is nothing like we

970
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:58,160
need robust um decision support so what

971
00:39:55,639 --> 00:40:00,400
I'm getting at is Alice shared her data

972
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:02,719
back then with me and when she showed us

973
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,599
she did show that the majority of of

974
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,480
consumers had been smoking greater than

975
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,760
3 years sorry inhaling cannabis for

976
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:13,039
greater than three years and um there

977
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:15,119
was a mixed collection the vapor dabbers

978
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:17,279
and the smokers they all had sort of

979
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,119
developed it but very few had been

980
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,079
edible only people very even less had

981
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,599
been CBD people um there's a couple

982
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:27,519
other distinctions in her data that were

983
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,880
interesting um but that's the one that

984
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,639
comes to mind it was very clear in her

985
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:32,400
data collected from like two or 300

986
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:34,039
patients that she personally interviewed

987
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:36,358
because she was afflicted by this

988
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,960
condition and no one was doing this work

989
00:40:36,358 --> 00:40:39,719
so every time someone would express to

990
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:42,159
her that she had CHS she would send them

991
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:45,000
her survey um she would collect that

992
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:47,358
data and uh you know it was enough to to

993
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,159
kick Alice off as as to be a powerful

994
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:51,838
voice and advocate in this space which I

995
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:55,039
which I'm happy she she's able to be you

996
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:58,719
know she's taken a lot of yeah kicks and

997
00:40:55,039 --> 00:41:00,400
Jabs um for her role and I think that's

998
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:03,039
representative of the stigma that the

999
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,920
community gives off to many patients

1000
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:06,679
Afflicted patients don't want to share

1001
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:09,358
that they've developed an intolerance to

1002
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:12,078
the medicine that they loved and also

1003
00:41:09,358 --> 00:41:14,239
that their friends consume every day and

1004
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,839
their friends would not understand or

1005
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:17,799
say they're making it up or tell them

1006
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,078
there it's not what it is it's neem oil

1007
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:21,440
you're smoking the wrong weed there's

1008
00:41:19,079 --> 00:41:22,599
all these things the stigma is real and

1009
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,000
we're trying to measure that in the

1010
00:41:22,599 --> 00:41:27,359
study

1011
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,039
too yeah see I'm getting excited we're

1012
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:30,159
pushing it out like this week y'all if

1013
00:41:29,039 --> 00:41:31,759
you're listening to this survey we're

1014
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:33,480
pushing it out which is great this thing

1015
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:35,680
has been I don't want to say a thorn in

1016
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:38,559
my side it's been my baby but this needs

1017
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:40,000
to fly yeah so talk more about the study

1018
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,679
so if people are listening here and

1019
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,519
they're curious about whether or not

1020
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:46,118
they're a good fit or who you're looking

1021
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:50,039
for talk about you know who should be

1022
00:41:46,119 --> 00:41:52,440
participating yeah so uh Megan me um our

1023
00:41:50,039 --> 00:41:55,199
our principal investigator Dr Ariana

1024
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:57,240
Nelson at uh UCI uh where this this

1025
00:41:55,199 --> 00:42:00,679
study has been uh submitted and approved

1026
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:03,479
through their IRB um we are looking

1027
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:05,318
specifically for just really simply uh

1028
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,760
two criteria basically are you an adult

1029
00:42:05,318 --> 00:42:09,960
we need 18 or older um there's just too

1030
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,960
much uh complexity in trying to get this

1031
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:14,559
info from kids hopefully we can start to

1032
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:16,480
uncover more about Pediatrics later so

1033
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:19,199
we need you to be an adult who either

1034
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,199
has been diagnosed with CHS or is

1035
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:22,399
believes they're suffering with CHS

1036
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:23,759
right we don't need you to be diagnosed

1037
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,240
by a doctor but we we need you to kind

1038
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,839
of think like this is this is what I'm

1039
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:30,318
pretty sure what's going on um and we're

1040
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,078
going to we got a Litany of questions

1041
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:34,239
right it's two parts each part's going

1042
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:36,440
to take you about 25 minutes it's a long

1043
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:38,479
time I do recognize but to make it more

1044
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:40,280
valuable for you you will be entered

1045
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:43,400
when you complete the survey into a

1046
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,680
raffle for $100 gift card um we're

1047
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,599
leaning towards Amazon but not the brand

1048
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:49,039
drop uh but we're gonna we're still

1049
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,960
figuring out where where that's going to

1050
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:55,199
come from um but yeah it's we're really

1051
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,800
excited to drop this two-part survey to

1052
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:57,679
understand both the symptoms and use

1053
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,680
pattern

1054
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,759
and then also the burden how much health

1055
00:42:59,679 --> 00:43:03,399
care you know how how hard has this been

1056
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,559
on you and your family and the truth is

1057
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,838
it's going to be what organs did you

1058
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:09,240
have removed that's literally a thing

1059
00:43:06,838 --> 00:43:11,318
right did someone cut out your appendix

1060
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:13,318
during the process of trying to discover

1061
00:43:11,318 --> 00:43:14,838
that all of this inflammation was

1062
00:43:13,318 --> 00:43:16,558
because your endocan ammonoid system was

1063
00:43:14,838 --> 00:43:18,880
out of balance because you've been

1064
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:20,720
smoking uh too much cannabis or

1065
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,119
marijuana as they

1066
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:27,759
say and now so we talked about before

1067
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:31,960
sort of that early stage uh pro pro drom

1068
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:34,000
is the dral yes um now people who are

1069
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:35,519
listening to this and think oh that kind

1070
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,159
of sounds like what I'm dealing with

1071
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:39,559
like is are you interested in those

1072
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:42,159
folks too or or only kind of in the

1073
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,440
later stages um we're looking for

1074
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:47,960
individuals who've experienced uh

1075
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,760
hyperemesis right so I understand that

1076
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:50,960
they're what Megan and I talked about

1077
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,119
which again we're trying to understand

1078
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,199
better too as part of the study but what

1079
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:57,358
we talked about is that early sign and

1080
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,639
we've seen that those are not the

1081
00:43:57,358 --> 00:43:59,920
patients we're trying to talk to because

1082
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:02,480
we want to understand more about your

1083
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,240
hyperic phase and and what might have

1084
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,400
changed leading up to it so for those

1085
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:10,279
folks I would encourage you to um go

1086
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:12,680
read about cannaboid hyperemesis

1087
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:15,280
syndrome I would encourage you to go

1088
00:44:12,679 --> 00:44:17,118
understand it more and not to freak out

1089
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,359
I've also had people who are so anxious

1090
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:20,880
about developing this you know and they

1091
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:23,679
don't want to get this because cannabis

1092
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,318
is so helpful to them it's unlikely that

1093
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:27,799
it's going to happen but what's the most

1094
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:31,000
definitive fact

1095
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:33,760
is going to be um thoughtful or

1096
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,318
conscious or mindful cannabis use as

1097
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,240
opposed to continuous all day you know

1098
00:44:37,318 --> 00:44:42,679
use and some people need cannabis all

1099
00:44:39,239 --> 00:44:46,439
day Some people prefer cannabis all day

1100
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:49,440
um and and in individuals who prefer

1101
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,440
cannabis all day and develop CHS the

1102
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,679
truth of the matter is is we probably

1103
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,679
can't make that that decision that way

1104
00:44:53,679 --> 00:44:58,879
anymore um but I wanted to acknowledge

1105
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,879
that medical patients very much need

1106
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,200
right to get through their day CHS and

1107
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:05,160
unfortunately some of those individuals

1108
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:07,439
have developed you know CHS as well and

1109
00:45:05,159 --> 00:45:08,920
then we got to fight through how do we

1110
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,480
you know switch to Pharmaceuticals or

1111
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:13,318
how do we change your

1112
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,920
canabo to try to do this so there's a

1113
00:45:13,318 --> 00:45:17,440
lot to learn but right now those who

1114
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:18,960
have CHS or those who believe they have

1115
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:20,559
CHS but that we would look for

1116
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,039
specifically for people who have had an

1117
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,119
episode of hyper Amis just so we can get

1118
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,599
the the most understanding of their path

1119
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,838
through the through the hospital system

1120
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,200
um but yeah for anybody who's

1121
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,239
experienced what you just described

1122
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,480
those Pro dral symptoms but you you're

1123
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:36,959
not sure it would be really reflective

1124
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,719
on the way cannabis feels it might be

1125
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:40,800
time to take a tolerance break and see

1126
00:45:38,719 --> 00:45:43,039
how you feel in five to seven days you

1127
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,240
might be astounded right and and so it

1128
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:48,400
could be a really really powerful

1129
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:50,719
experience um and if you happen to

1130
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:56,000
develop hyperemesis while you try to

1131
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,000
stop THC I need you to take my survey

1132
00:45:57,318 --> 00:46:01,279
uh that just I'm teasing but seriously

1133
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:03,159
because this is another one of our

1134
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:04,599
leading hypo not not leading but like

1135
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:07,879
this is another idea that we've kicked

1136
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:11,280
around as a group um you know knowing

1137
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:14,640
that we see this sort of withdrawal

1138
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,920
induced yeah like again it makes sense

1139
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,960
in the in the setting of like

1140
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,519
disregulation if it's all out of whack

1141
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,159
and it's been gotten used to having the

1142
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:24,318
THC and then you pull that back now the

1143
00:46:22,159 --> 00:46:26,279
system is out of whack again and so that

1144
00:46:24,318 --> 00:46:28,279
might be it but again that's that's full

1145
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,160
speculation

1146
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:33,960
by excellent all right well Cody and

1147
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:35,399
Megan thank you so much for the time um

1148
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,559
again we're going to put the link to the

1149
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:39,920
survey in the show description so that

1150
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:42,119
people can find it and um you know

1151
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,119
anyone listening please spread the word

1152
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,318
let people know that this survey is out

1153
00:46:44,119 --> 00:46:47,519
there and that you should be

1154
00:46:45,318 --> 00:46:50,558
participating um but before I let you go

1155
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:52,838
I'm going to let you both um share any

1156
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,079
other additional resources uh around

1157
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,078
this topic that you think might be

1158
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,160
useful and then you know information

1159
00:46:56,079 --> 00:47:00,960
about yourself and how folks can maybe

1160
00:46:58,159 --> 00:47:03,399
uh get in touch or connect with you yeah

1161
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,639
I think one of the one of the

1162
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:07,880
fascinating places to actually learn

1163
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:09,598
about this in real time we get a lot of

1164
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:11,720
flack for this but it's the Facebook

1165
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:14,440
groups it's the online CHS Facebook

1166
00:47:11,719 --> 00:47:17,039
groups where you get realtime anecdotes

1167
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:19,800
from people and their experience and a

1168
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,639
lot of that has triggered what we are

1169
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:23,160
putting in the survey and how we have

1170
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,920
asked the questions in the survey so

1171
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,118
that's a fantastic place for people to

1172
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,559
not only like learn about it as

1173
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,838
clinicians and cannabis consumers but to

1174
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:34,559
share their experience and get advice

1175
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:36,318
from peers on what has helped them how

1176
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:39,960
long their symptoms lasted because it's

1177
00:47:36,318 --> 00:47:42,119
so nuanced so Facebook groups are one um

1178
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:44,240
there's one that that's called what is

1179
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:46,240
Katie's group called uh it's run by a

1180
00:47:44,239 --> 00:47:48,439
nurse friend and colleague of ours who's

1181
00:47:46,239 --> 00:47:50,719
working with us on the study um safe

1182
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:53,280
space safe space yeah CHS a safe space

1183
00:47:50,719 --> 00:47:56,000
to learn it has a purple um you know

1184
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,440
purple on it and she's she's a nurse and

1185
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,079
she helps people directly you know going

1186
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:03,358
through their CHS episodes so that's a

1187
00:48:01,079 --> 00:48:06,318
fantastic

1188
00:48:03,358 --> 00:48:08,679
resource and uh trusted canon.com

1189
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:11,239
obviously well yeah yeah I mean we don't

1190
00:48:08,679 --> 00:48:13,078
we typically refer people out to her if

1191
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:15,838
people are wanting to like stop the

1192
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:17,920
cannabis use and kind of like um you

1193
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,318
know if they need help with that part of

1194
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,119
it then we talked about this last year

1195
00:48:20,318 --> 00:48:25,039
this is what we do micro doing of

1196
00:48:22,119 --> 00:48:27,280
psilocybin for to help them desire

1197
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,679
cannabis less but in the immediate

1198
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,440
hypermed phases that's where like Katie

1199
00:48:29,679 --> 00:48:35,118
is a fantastic

1200
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,920
resource awesome our study as well she's

1201
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:38,559
one of going to be one of our authors um

1202
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,200
and it's going to help us get this into

1203
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,319
those communities on Facebook um so

1204
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:43,759
first I want to speak to anyone who

1205
00:48:42,318 --> 00:48:46,519
listened thank you so much for making it

1206
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:48,720
this far I appreciate your time um I

1207
00:48:46,519 --> 00:48:50,318
know that you may or may not more than

1208
00:48:48,719 --> 00:48:52,919
likely just statistically you don't have

1209
00:48:50,318 --> 00:48:55,239
CHS but you could share this podcast and

1210
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,519
you can share our poster which will be

1211
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,879
shared in in this as well come to any of

1212
00:48:57,519 --> 00:49:01,239
my pages it would mean a lot I just

1213
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,798
we're trying to get this out here the

1214
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:06,000
more people we talk to the better data

1215
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:07,440
we get the better we can lead Physicians

1216
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,079
to not make some of these standard

1217
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,280
mistakes the help more we can help

1218
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:13,400
patients to understand what to expect

1219
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:15,720
there's so many benefits and really no

1220
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,440
downside all you got to do is share you

1221
