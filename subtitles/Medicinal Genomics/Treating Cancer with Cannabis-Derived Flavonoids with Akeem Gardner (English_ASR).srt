Our Guest today is Akeem Gardner Akeem

37
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:48,000
is the founder and CEO of Canada in 2018

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,579
Akeem acquired an industrial hemp

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,739
license from Health Canada and began to

40
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:55,679
farm hemp as he embarked on his

41
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:58,078
entrepreneurial venture this allowed him

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,500
to meet with the University of Guelph

43
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,779
professors in the summer of 2019 to

44
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,599
begin the canned Flavin project

45
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:09,659
at can Med 23 Akeem will present

46

49
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:20,039
provides a preview of that presentation

50
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,180
as well as insights on the following

51
00:02:20,039 --> 00:02:23,459
topics

52
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,920
what are flavonoids and how are they

53
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:28,020
different from cannabinoids and terpenes

54
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,500
the flavonoids that are unique to

55
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:33,239
cannabis also known as canned flavins

56
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,780
why canned flavins are not as well

57
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:38,700
studied as other cannabis compounds

58
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:41,459
Canada's method for isolating capturing

59
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,318
and concentrating these molecules and

60
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,659
potential medical applications for

61
00:02:43,318 --> 00:02:48,119
canned flavins and how they may work in

62
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:50,340
combination with cannabinoids

63
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,500

85
00:03:56,098 --> 00:04:00,539
good afternoon Akeem thanks so much for

86
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:02,459
joining us on the podcast thanks for

87
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:03,840
having me Ben excited to be here all

88
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,658
right and I'm excited to talk with you

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,640
because you are presenting at can mid 23

90
00:04:06,658 --> 00:04:11,280
about research that your team has done

91
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:14,579
into using cannabis derived flavonoids

92
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,620
or canned flavins to treat cancer but

93
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,139
before we get too deep into that I

94
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,939
always like to start with the basics and

95
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:23,100
that might be especially true here

96
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,899
because I know that canned flavins are

97
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:28,379
not as well known as other cannabis

98
00:04:24,899 --> 00:04:30,779
compounds so what are flavonoids or

99
00:04:28,379 --> 00:04:32,819
canned flavins well we'll we'll start

100
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:36,119
with flavonoids and we'll get to the can

101
00:04:32,819 --> 00:04:39,139
flavins in a second right but nice and

102
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,060
nice and sweet flavonoids are a class of

103
00:04:39,139 --> 00:04:44,699
polyphenolic secondary metabolites found

104
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:46,500
in most plants so they're commonly

105
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:48,360
consumed in the diets of humans and

106
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,939
animals right we've been consuming them

107
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,580
since the beginning of time chemically

108
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:56,699
flavonoids have a general structure of a

109
00:04:53,579 --> 00:05:00,079
15 carbon skeleton which consists of of

110
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:03,000
two fennel rings and a heterocyclic ring

111
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:04,978
and the key important differentiation

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,259
here is that it's a completely different

113
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:09,599
class of molecules than the more

114
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:12,060
commonly well-known cannabinoids or

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,759
terpenes that people are familiar with

116
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,040
from Cannabis hemp

117
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:18,240
right and so structurally they're

118
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,540
different how else are they different

119
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,379
from from cannabinoids and terpenes well

120
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:25,620
it

121
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:28,199
really the structure and and

122
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,699
I guess their activity and how the plant

123
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,600
uses them right

124
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:35,699
usually these molecules they have high

125
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,320
antioxidant properties the plant uses

126
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:40,439
them as part of their defense mechanism

127
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,478
they don't work on the endocannabinoid

128
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:45,120
system at least in the same way as our

129
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,038
cannabinoids and our terpenes do there

130
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,478
are different class of molecules and

131
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,699
that's what makes them unique for

132
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,978
exploration when it comes to people

133
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:55,580
exploring the synergistic effect of full

134
00:05:52,978 --> 00:05:58,500
plant extracts in order to understand

135
00:05:55,579 --> 00:06:00,120
this Synergy you need to be able to

136
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,579
understand all the different components

137
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:05,280
of the plant and that includes these

138
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:06,060
polyphenols or these flavonoids that are

139
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,159
there

140
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,319
great and now

141
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,580
how many different I mean I don't know

142
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,959
if you could put a number on it but how

143
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:15,599
many different flavonoids are found in

144
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:17,579
cannabis and are they unique to cannabis

145
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,340
are they found elsewhere in other plants

146
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:22,978
as well well just like much like the

147
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:24,418
cannabinoids right the flavonoids

148
00:06:22,978 --> 00:06:27,418
there's a whole bunch of them and

149
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:30,418
they're found all across plant species

150
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:33,478
um all across the world right but what

151
00:06:30,418 --> 00:06:34,740
makes cannabis hemp unique is that they

152
00:06:33,478 --> 00:06:37,639
have very

153
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:40,439
specific or unique

154
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,240
flavonoids to them and this is where we

155
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,860
get to our canned flavins our canned

156
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,680
flavins aren't found anywhere else in

157
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:48,960
the plant life right and included with

158
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,478
the camp lavins are other molecules that

159
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:53,459
we might get to a little bit later

160
00:06:51,478 --> 00:06:57,120
um still beans but benzyls that are

161
00:06:53,459 --> 00:06:59,579
unique to cannabis hemp right now these

162
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,939
unique molecules are what we believe

163
00:06:59,579 --> 00:07:05,939
adds to the high therapeutic effect of

164
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:07,680
the Cannabis hemp plant that humans have

165
00:07:05,939 --> 00:07:09,839
experienced from the beginning of time

166
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,000
right why they continue to come back to

167
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:13,818
cannabis as a treatment for a variety of

168
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,100
different indications because

169
00:07:13,819 --> 00:07:20,039
specifically in the synergistic profile

170
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,259
of this plant right are these novel

171
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:24,360
molecules that are known to help with

172
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,439
human and animal health

173
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,199
he

174
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,560
okay and now

175
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,840
are there certain canned flavins that

176
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:36,199
are you know more well known than others

177
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:39,119
that folks may have heard about before

178
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,620
well not canned flavins right because

179
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,259
again canned flavins are the more

180
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,259
specific molecule but flavonoids

181
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:49,860
probably yes right these are molecules

182
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:53,699
like the epigenous right

183
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,098
um cursor tin Resveratrol is uh more

184
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:58,919
recently well-known flavonoid because of

185
00:07:56,098 --> 00:08:00,418
its um promise in regards to longevity

186
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:03,859
research right

187
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:07,379
Rootin was first isolated from oranges

188
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,979
in the mid 19 I think it was 1960s so

189
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,538
that was the first one of the first

190
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:13,978
flavonoids to be identified in the plant

191
00:08:12,538 --> 00:08:16,699
matter so

192
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:19,378
there are more well-known ones but

193
00:08:16,699 --> 00:08:21,240
flavonoids as a whole people aren't

194
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,160
really familiar with right they just

195
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,478
know to eat their fruits and vegetables

196
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,160
because they're good for the good for

197
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,918
you right

198
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,539
right and now so you mentioned a few

199
00:08:28,918 --> 00:08:32,158
there

200
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:35,939
um are there flavonoids that are

201
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:38,519
currently being used as Therapeutics or

202
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:41,219
um for other indications

203
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:44,098
they're in a lot of exploration around

204
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:46,500
them right so again Resveratrol the more

205
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:49,080
most commonly known one

206
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:52,019
um has shown in different assays uh of

207
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,420
zebrafish and C elegans to be

208
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,399
have a lot of promise when it comes to

209
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:58,799
longevity neuroprotective properties

210
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,958
right but researchers around the world

211
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:01,799
scientists around the world and as you

212
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:03,479
know

213
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,120
most prevalent with natural health

214
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:08,339
ingredients in general there's always

215
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,959
the problem of translation and always

216
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:13,019
the problem of doing something with

217
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:16,319
enough specif specificity to be able to

218
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:18,419
get FDA approval as a registered

219
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,640
therapeutic but the work is out there

220
00:09:18,419 --> 00:09:24,000
people are exploring it

221
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:27,000
um in fact in September I went for the

222
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,559
first time ever to the world polyphenol

223
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,259
conference and this is an annual

224
00:09:28,559 --> 00:09:33,299
conference every year where people come

225
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:37,319
and they talk about all the different

226
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:39,659
signs from all around the world and the

227
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:41,519
researchers that's exploring this really

228
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:42,778
really unique class of molecules and

229
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,778
what they can do

230
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:49,019
interesting and now did I hear you right

231
00:09:45,778 --> 00:09:51,360
is it difficult to really isolate these

232
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:53,220
compounds to really kind of study them

233
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,740
specifically

234
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:58,278
yes yes and especially when you're

235
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,839
looking at cannabis hemp yes right

236
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:02,939
more broadly when it comes to Natural

237
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:04,620
Health Products and um Natural Health

238
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,560
ingredients ingredients found in the

239
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,019
plant right there's a lot of challenges

240
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:12,239
about batch to batch repeatability how

241
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:13,919
do you know that this ingredient that

242
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:16,019
you get from one plant is the same as

243
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:19,860
the other plant so on and so forth right

244
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:21,899
so this makes um the exploration of most

245
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:24,539
plant-based molecules challenging in

246
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:28,139
themselves but when we look specifically

247
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:30,659
at Industrial Hemp cannabis right they

248
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:32,338
produce flavonoids at a very very

249
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:35,458
minimal

250
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,320
um profile in fact our can flavins so

251
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:39,359
when we talk about can flavins I'm

252
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,480
usually talking about can Flav and a and

253
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,240
b right and these molecules are found in

254
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,240
under

255
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:51,839
0.014 of the plant's biomass so they're

256
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:55,379
extremely minute extremely rare and that

257
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:57,060
makes isolating them capturing them

258
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:59,278
um very challenging it's part of the

259
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,458
reason why since their Discovery in the

260
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:04,559
mid-1980s there hasn't been a lot of

261
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:06,899
commercial or clinical work done on

262
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:09,719
these molecules they've mainly lived in

263
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:12,600
the world of Academia until professors

264
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,278
at the University of Guelph developed a

265
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,278
few technologies that allow for the

266
00:11:14,278 --> 00:11:19,679
production of them in higher quantities

267
00:11:16,278 --> 00:11:22,259
and it's these technologies that Canada

268
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,639
is the direct beneficiary of which

269
00:11:22,259 --> 00:11:25,019
allows us to do the work that we're

270
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,480
doing today

271
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,000
okay interesting yeah I'm I'm kind of

272
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,519
interested to learn how you got

273
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,240
interested in canned flavins

274
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:35,339
um

275
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,220
what was it that attracted you to them

276
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:40,500
or what opportunity did you see there

277
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,139
well I got introduced to these molecules

278
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,578
by chance I was in the right place right

279
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:46,799
time

280
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:48,659
um and I was the lucky entrepreneur that

281
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,099
these professors at the University of

282
00:11:48,659 --> 00:11:50,939
Guelph

283
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,920
um

284
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,500
chose to be able to partner with to

285
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:59,039
bring this forward right

286
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,720
um long story less Long right I'm not a

287
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:02,219
scientist by background or training

288
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,620
right

289
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,440
um I actually went to law school in the

290
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:09,419
United Kingdom from 2015 to 2017. after

291
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,339
graduating from the University of Ottawa

292
00:12:09,419 --> 00:12:13,979
I did get my degree in Psychology and

293
00:12:11,339 --> 00:12:16,079
philosophy there so some psychology of

294
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,360
the mind and how drugs affect the mind I

295
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,879
have some familiarity with but I thought

296
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,039
I was going to be a lawyer after but it

297
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,919
was really when I graduated from school

298
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:28,500
in 2017 and I returned back to Canada

299
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,319
and the legalization of marijuana

300
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:33,179
federally was amongst us I knew that

301
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,820
there was an opportunity going on in

302
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,759
Canada to be able to be part of this

303
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,740
emerging growing industry

304
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:42,600
um and an opportunity because we were

305
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,180
going to do it before the bigger Market

306
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:47,879
directly south in the U.S legalized

307
00:12:45,179 --> 00:12:48,419
federally so I said to myself

308
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:50,278
um

309
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:51,958
um hey if I start now then I can be a

310
00:12:50,278 --> 00:12:53,700
part of this movement of all the new

311
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:56,458
Innovations and everything going going

312
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:00,420
forward how can I get involved well the

313
00:12:56,458 --> 00:13:02,039
hemp plant has 50 000 commercial uses I

314
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:04,860
like to say that's fifty thousand before

315
00:13:02,039 --> 00:13:06,179
we add modern technology to it we're

316
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:09,539
really just now getting to understand

317
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:11,759
what this planet can do to accelerate

318
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,659
and create a more sustainable productive

319
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,259
world

320
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:18,240
so I decided instead of finishing my

321
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,578
accreditation to be a lawyer I was going

322
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,139
to use the money that I had from going

323
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,899
to school the line of credit to find

324
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:26,700
some farmland and start to grow hemp

325
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:29,339
and that's what I did I turned myself

326
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:31,379
from a law school graduate to a farmer

327
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:32,279
and I started to grow

328
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:34,679
um

329
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:37,139
no experience

330
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,000
um just a bright idea knew that this was

331
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,180
coming and I got my ass kicked on the

332
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,399
farm but what it did yeah it was it was

333
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:48,179
a crazy time but what it did do though

334
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:50,879
was it put me in a position of being a

335
00:13:48,179 --> 00:13:53,699
king not the person with

336
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:55,620
just bright ideas Akeem the person who

337
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,200
was willing to work hard to see this

338
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:00,839
industry through right here in Ontario

339
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:03,180
and that ultimately led to a gentleman

340
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,100
from Omas omafra our ministry of food

341
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:07,199
and agricultural resources

342
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:09,180
to saying hey Akeem there are some

343
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,220
professors at the University of Guelph

344
00:14:09,179 --> 00:14:14,039
they need some hemp they need a farmer

345
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:16,019
someone like myself to be able to do

346
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:17,699
some investigation on some of these

347
00:14:16,019 --> 00:14:19,799
novel molecules that were there in the

348
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,899
plant and of course I was like wait

349
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,240
there's something else there outside of

350
00:14:21,899 --> 00:14:26,278
the cannabinoids and terpenes send them

351
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,320
to my farm tell them to take all the

352
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,240
things that all the plants that they

353
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,100
want but I want to be a part of this

354
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,139
journey I want to know what's going on

355
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:37,019
and if there's ever the opportunity to

356
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,419
be a commercialization partner

357
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:41,639
um I'll prove it to you that I'm the

358
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:43,439
right partner to have and with that I

359
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,299
was able to show myself

360
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,980
um and I was able to show our dedication

361
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:49,620
the dedication of the team that we had

362
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:52,680
to this plant and that led them to

363
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:54,899
introducing us to all the amazing

364
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:57,239
possibilities around these unique

365
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:59,759
flavonoids the canned flavins and some

366
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,519
of the other molecules that we're trying

367
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,379
to investigate and explore right in the

368
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,600
Cannabis hemp plan

369
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,480
interesting so

370
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,820
is the is the technology here a way to

371
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,800
just concentrate the canned flavins or

372
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:16,199
is it um like breeding techniques to

373
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:18,240
have plants that produce more of them

374
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:21,120
what's going on here if you can even

375
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:24,000
share I'll Cheryl sure and this is where

376
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,120
things things get a little bit fun so

377
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
all of this started primarily with an

378
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,879
extraction technology right we have a

379
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,299
patented way of isolating capturing

380
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,980
concentrating these molecules out of the

381
00:15:36,299 --> 00:15:41,159
plants of biomass and this is what we

382
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:44,778
started with but as we continue to grow

383
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:47,939
from 2020 when we acquired our first

384
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:50,159
intellectual property patent to where we

385
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:52,339
are now we also have two other ways of

386
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:54,719
getting to the molecules we also have a

387
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:56,220
growing production pattern a way of

388
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,180
enriching these molecules in the plant

389
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:02,699
matter right from the seed and we also

390
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,979
have an enzymatic biosynthesis

391
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:07,859
production platform a way of creating

392
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:09,120
these molecules in bioreactors purely

393
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:11,519
from scratch

394
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,100
now the combination of all these

395
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:16,620
Technologies give us a really really

396
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,220
interesting

397
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,919
um

398
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:21,180
commercial Advantage because not only

399
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:23,698
can we

400
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:26,099
now make these molecules purely from

401
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:27,958
scratch but we can also make pure and

402
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,820
authentic standards of these molecules

403
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:31,859
so that when we're looking in the plant

404
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,260
matter whether whether it be a grown

405
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,360
plant or an extract we can correctly

406
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:40,500
identify and label and say that there's

407
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:42,720
this much of flavonoid a b and c d right

408
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,299
that are there and this is what the FDA

409
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,740
and any regulatory agency wants to see

410
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:49,258
when you're bringing a natural health

411
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,240
product or a drug product to Market they

412
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,100
want to know that you can have batch to

413
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,560
batch consistency that they want to know

414
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:58,500
that you have clinically relevant assays

415
00:16:55,559 --> 00:17:01,500
of what each ratio of these molecules

416
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,839
can provide and it gives us the ability

417
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:07,199
to not only bring these molecules to

418
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,900
Market in complex mixtures but also in

419
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,699
their pure individual forms and when it

420
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,500
comes to developing drugs and

421
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,019
Therapeutics this is where things get

422
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,880
exciting because now we can really play

423
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:20,039
around and say Hey What Can these

424
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,140
molecules do on their own what can they

425
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:24,959
do in combination and what can they do

426
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:27,000
against a variety of different

427
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,078
um disease States and therapeutic

428
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,058
indications

429
00:17:28,078 --> 00:17:31,379
excellent so that's a good segue so

430
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,099
let's start talking about some of that

431
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,080
work

432
00:17:32,099 --> 00:17:35,519
um so I know that the abstract that

433
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,798
you're going to present be presenting at

434
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:39,480
km at 23 it's looking at canned flavins

435
00:17:37,798 --> 00:17:42,058
A and B

436
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,220
um so in addition to the fact that

437
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:46,859
they're you know alphabetically first

438
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:49,500
what was it about it again for Evans AMV

439
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:53,399
that were of particular interest

440
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:54,660
well well CAT5 and a and b are the most

441
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,200
well-known

442
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,140
novel flavonoids in the plaque they were

443
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,759
first identified in the mid-1980s and

444
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,340
when they were first identified by

445
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:07,558
Marilyn Barrett and her colleagues they

446
00:18:05,339 --> 00:18:10,079
were found to have 30 times the

447
00:18:07,558 --> 00:18:13,980
anti-inflammatory power than ASA the

448
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:16,740
active ingredient in Aspirin but also in

449
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,480
later in 2014 we learned that they had a

450
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,079
different mechanism of action than most

451
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:25,259
NSAIDs so they don't lead to many of the

452
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,879
GI issues the bleeding of the gut and

453
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:28,679
the ulcers that you get from our end

454
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,799
seeds

455
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,419
um so this led to the camp flavins being

456
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:35,519
at the top of the list of the novel

457
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,679
molecules that are in the plant and

458
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,259
that's where the researchers at Guelph

459
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:41,700
wanted to start their research

460
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:42,359
um but

461
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,640
um

462
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:47,819
I guess seguing to how we get from

463
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:51,000
inflammation to cancer we know that not

464
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:53,038
only do does many chronic diseases start

465
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,380
with systematic chronic inflammation but

466
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,440
we also know that

467
00:18:55,380 --> 00:19:00,660
um some of these Solutions some of these

468
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,580
bioflavonoids right they have a host of

469
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,340
therapeutic potential that are

470
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:09,599
unexplored right now I'm an unexplored

471
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:13,379
with modern assays so one Professor uh

472
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:15,839
inventor of our patents Dr akhtar he

473
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,059
gave a colleague in his lab Dr Jasmine

474
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:20,459
Le long the can flavins to play with and

475
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:23,339
look at to say hey could these be

476
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,620
beneficial for nor protection for

477
00:19:23,339 --> 00:19:28,079
neuroinflammation and Jasmine did an

478
00:19:25,619 --> 00:19:31,500
initial screen to check and see might

479
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:33,899
they be and what Jasmine found was

480
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,058
actually the opposite expectation of

481
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:39,120
what he was initially looking for right

482
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:40,798
that these molecules were not

483
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:43,019
necessarily useful for neural

484
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,940
inflammation which we can talk about a

485
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:47,700
little bit later but they showed promise

486
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,660
of blocking an important receptor the

487
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:54,480
Trek B receptor tropomycin kinase B and

488
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,080
this led him to believe that

489
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,120
um

490
00:19:55,079 --> 00:19:59,519
this is what this led him to believe

491
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:02,459
that this could be extremely important

492
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:04,200
in regards to a variety of different

493
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,298
um cancers including glioblastoma

494
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,580
multiform which is what our published

495
00:20:06,298 --> 00:20:10,519
paper is on is about

496
00:20:08,579 --> 00:20:13,740
great so so you mentioned the

497
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:15,779
anti-inflammatory properties of these of

498
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,779
these compounds and I know that you know

499
00:20:15,779 --> 00:20:20,339
CBD is also credited to be a very you

500
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:21,798
know anti-inflammatory the way that it

501
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:24,480
acts on the

502
00:20:21,798 --> 00:20:26,819
endocannabinoid system so

503
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,519
I was wondering how do those two how

504
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:31,379
those two compounds kind of interact and

505
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:34,379
is

506
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:36,780
and and I guess my question is

507
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,340
is CBD the only thing that's doing well

508
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:41,579
obviously it's not so maybe that's not

509
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:44,519
the right way to phrase it but is was

510
00:20:41,579 --> 00:20:46,379
some of the anti-inflammatory uh effects

511
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:49,918
of CBD maybe

512
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:51,660
um inappropriately credited to CBD in

513
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,580
that the canned flavins were actually

514
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:56,519
doing some of the work too

515
00:20:53,579 --> 00:20:58,918
maybe who knows this is some of the

516
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:01,379
excitement of the work that we have

517
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:02,700
um in front of us up here at Canada

518
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,340
the

519
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:06,840
interesting thing is that we know and we

520
00:21:05,339 --> 00:21:09,659
know this the literature is out there

521
00:21:06,839 --> 00:21:13,199
right that when you look at whole plant

522
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:15,720
extract versus pure isolated CBD there's

523
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:18,840
a difference of efficacy in the whole

524
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,700
plant versus the pure isolab right when

525
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:23,038
it comes to anti-inflammation anti-pain

526
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:25,740
and a host of other things right

527
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:27,359
so the real thing that we want to

528
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,058
investigate is when you start to break

529
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:33,658
down these components of the Pure Plant

530
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:36,839
extract what is each constituent

531
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:39,299
um responsible for and not only what are

532
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:42,418
they responsible for but how do they act

533
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:44,599
in Synergy with each other so

534
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,600
instead of having a pure CBD

535
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:49,859
anti-inflammatory or pure can Flavin

536
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,279
anti-inflammatory can you have a

537
00:21:49,859 --> 00:21:55,199
combined CBD can Flavin

538
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,819
anti-inflammatory things that work on

539
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,740
different mechanisms that are

540
00:21:56,819 --> 00:22:00,599
responsible are different targets that

541
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:02,279
are responsible for inflammation in the

542
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:05,038
body and then when they work

543
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:08,279
synergistically they're for the optimal

544
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:11,759
benefit of human or animal health right

545
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:15,000
this is where we know that some of our

546
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:17,519
work is going to start to open the doors

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,679
to researchers around the world when

548
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:22,918
they start to look and explore and say

549
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,320
what can these molecules do

550
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:28,500
um or why is the Cannabis hemp plant

551
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,259
doing what it's doing and

552
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,298
give them hopefully the data set that

553
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:36,538
they need when it comes to dealing with

554
00:22:33,298 --> 00:22:39,418
regular regulators and getting um

555
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:41,099
Therapeutics passed and improved to go

556
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,799
to market

557
00:22:41,099 --> 00:22:46,859
yeah no and that's a great point and I I

558
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,900
it it escapes me who who mentioned it on

559
00:22:46,859 --> 00:22:50,759
the podcast before but they were looking

560
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,500
at you know different cannabinoid

561
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:54,480
concentrations for certain indications

562
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,519
and trying to isolate the the

563
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,659
cannabinoids to try to get the similar

564
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:59,400
effect

565
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:01,320
um and even maybe even using a

566
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,820
combination of cannabinoids but they

567
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:04,740
weren't able to see the same thing that

568
00:23:02,819 --> 00:23:07,859
they could in the whole plant extract

569
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:10,558
and obviously their hypothesis was there

570
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,500
must be some other smaller compound or

571
00:23:10,558 --> 00:23:14,940
compounds present there that they didn't

572
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,440
account for that's doing some of the

573
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,580
work and hey maybe that's the canned

574
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,798
flavins or maybe that's something else

575
00:23:17,579 --> 00:23:22,439
that we haven't even found yet

576
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:24,900
this is where things get exciting right

577
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:26,640
I can share right

578
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,240
that um

579
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:33,000
there are about 15 to 20 other molecules

580
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,000
in the plant that we're pretty excited

581
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,480
about that

582
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:42,240
this modern standards of identification

583
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,400
aren't available to the masses yet these

584
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,298
molecules are there again arcanflav and

585
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:50,700
a and b are there in under

586
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:53,940
0.014 of the plant so we have to

587
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:55,620
concentrate so much to be able to get

588
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,919
these out in commercial or clinical

589
00:23:55,619 --> 00:24:01,259
quantities luckily we found out we found

590
00:23:58,919 --> 00:24:03,059
a pretty unique and easy way to do it to

591
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:06,900
do so to make it commercially feasible

592
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:09,359
but as we start to concentrate now we

593
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,538
start to get to look at what are some of

594
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:15,240
these other Peaks um that our hplc is

595
00:24:12,538 --> 00:24:17,879
identifying and can we create standards

596
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,919
to identify these other molecules that

597
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:22,200
are there and when we start to isolate

598
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,720
these other molecules what can they do

599
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,720
on their own what do they do in Synergy

600
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,380
and how can each of these class of

601
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,819
compounds be best used to optimize human

602
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,580
and animal health

603
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:38,779
this is where we think that things are

604
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:41,279
extremely promising when it comes to

605
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:43,940
indications like inflammatory related

606
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:47,819
diseases cancers

607
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,460
respiratory diseases neuroprotective

608
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,319
um diseases neurodegenerative diseases

609
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:54,620
sorry I should say and then your

610
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:59,220
protective qualities of these molecules

611
00:24:54,619 --> 00:25:02,219
and what the next 10 15 20 years looks

612
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,679
like especially after the rest of the

613
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:08,038
world starts to legalize one of the

614
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:10,620
things that again I'm a very fortunate

615
00:25:08,038 --> 00:25:12,839
and lucky beneficiary of is the fact

616
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:15,418
that Canada decided to go first as the

617
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:18,538
first G7 country to legalize federally

618
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:20,880
that allowed for our universities to be

619
00:25:18,538 --> 00:25:24,179
able to come to my farm take them take

620
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,400
the plant and say what's there we know

621
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:29,100
that in the U.S right now state to state

622
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,659
we have legalization and we're starting

623
00:25:29,099 --> 00:25:32,879
to

624
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:35,220
get to the aspects of federal

625
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,039
legalization at least in regards to

626
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:40,919
research right now under Biden but as

627
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,900
this continues to open up it just allows

628
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:45,600
so many bright minds and people with

629
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,419
innovative ideas to come touch the plant

630
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:51,058
add their unique twists and Spins to it

631
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:52,860
and that's really going to push health

632
00:25:51,058 --> 00:25:54,778
care and plant-based medicine forward

633
00:25:52,859 --> 00:25:56,699
and that's one of the things that I'm

634
00:25:54,778 --> 00:25:58,380
excited about being a part of

635
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,240
yeah we're excited about that too it's

636
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:02,640
one of the things that we try to create

637
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,278
an environment for at can Med is to

638
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,840
bring uh all all people that are working

639
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,480
on the plant together to share their

640
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:11,699
information make connections

641
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:13,798
um and kind of move this forward so

642
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,298
um so that's great uh but I did want to

643
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:17,940
ask you so you brought up again the

644
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:21,000
small concentrations that are found in

645
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:22,980
the cannabis plant so is it is the case

646
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,538
that a little goes a long way when it

647
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:26,519
comes to canned flavins that you don't

648
00:26:24,538 --> 00:26:29,240
need a super high dose to get that

649
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:29,240
therapeutic effect

650
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,640
depending on what indication you're

651
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:35,039
going for

652
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:37,679
probably most most probably right and

653
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:40,679
this is what some of our initial data is

654
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:43,200
is showing us right now we have a suite

655
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:46,380
of a variety of different in silicone

656
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:49,319
and in vitro and early in Vivo data

657
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:51,900
animal data that's showing us um the

658
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:54,119
different areas of indications that we

659
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:56,640
should go after and we know the

660
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:58,019
concentrations and the ranges of how our

661
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,778
molecules work

662
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,900
the real key now is how does this

663
00:27:00,778 --> 00:27:07,259
translate to humans right who are

664
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:09,778
um we're bigger right we need

665
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:11,278
um viral distribution of these molecules

666
00:27:09,778 --> 00:27:12,900
in the bloodstream at the site of

667
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:13,798
actions to be able to get therapeutic

668
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,100
effect

669
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:19,139
can we do that with these rare molecules

670
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:22,019
we know that we can capture these

671
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:24,538
molecules at Commercial and clinical in

672
00:27:22,019 --> 00:27:26,400
clinical amounts we have a variety of

673
00:27:24,538 --> 00:27:28,079
different Natural Health ingredients but

674
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:30,179
also pharmaceutical ingredients that

675
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:32,399
will launch in the years to come to

676
00:27:30,179 --> 00:27:35,340
start to get these ingredients and these

677
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:37,980
molecules onto the market but now it's

678
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:39,000
about now in our current investigation

679
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,679
it's

680
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,179
how do we get

681
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:44,640
um well and in the paper that we're

682
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,400
going to discuss and the interference on

683
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,980
track B and how that affects a variety

684
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,820
of different cancers how do we get our

685
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:55,740
mixture of can 5 and ABC

686
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:58,558
um to the site of the tumor to be able

687
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:01,200
to whether it be kill the tumor whether

688
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:03,720
it be to slow the spread whether it be

689
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,759
to work as an adjunct therapy so that

690
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,100
you need less radiation and less

691
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:11,099
chemotherapy to be able to help the

692
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:13,079
patients how does all of this work and

693
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:16,619
this is what we're really focusing on

694
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,298
right now in our research up at Canada

695
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:19,199
excellent yeah I know I'm glad you

696
00:28:18,298 --> 00:28:21,000
brought that up because we're getting

697
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,740
towards in here we didn't even get into

698
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,240
the abstract that you're going to be

699
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,620
presenting we kind of danced around it

700
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,220
but let's

701
00:28:25,619 --> 00:28:28,439
um

702
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,019
let's talk about it in more detail so

703
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:32,340
give me a summary or you know sort of

704
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:34,139
the main takeaway that you're that

705
00:28:32,339 --> 00:28:36,058
you're hoping to to get across with your

706
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:39,299
presentation

707
00:28:36,058 --> 00:28:41,579
so the main takeaway that we that we're

708
00:28:39,298 --> 00:28:44,099
um hoping to get get across is that we

709
00:28:41,579 --> 00:28:46,678
know that our flavonoids are can 5 and a

710
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:49,918
and b and they inhibit the activation of

711
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,679
the tropomycin kinase B tropomycin

712
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:54,900
receptor kinase B in primary cortical

713
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,840
neurons and this is very promising when

714
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:00,120
it comes to glioblastoma but other other

715
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:02,639
areas of cancer research as well like

716
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:03,538
breast cancer and pancreatic cancer as

717
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,179
well

718
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:08,099
we know we have doses that can disrupt

719
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:10,500
the downstream signaling of the track B

720
00:29:08,099 --> 00:29:12,558
receptors they reduce the accumulation

721
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,159
of active activity regulated

722
00:29:12,558 --> 00:29:19,259
psychoskeleton Associated proteins right

723
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,980
and they've been working in the

724
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:26,398
neuroblastoma cell line so now

725
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:28,319
um well at the at kanmed my hope is to

726
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,459
dive a little bit deeper into how we got

727
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,678
here

728
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:34,319
um to share some of the assays that we

729
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,200
did to be able to prove this and show

730
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:40,379
some of our more more recent work since

731
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,720
we published at the top of the Year from

732
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,700
Dr Jasmine the Long's Lab at the

733
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,740
University of Guelph

734
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,899
excellent and now you mentioned that

735
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,399
you're you know that your team you're

736
00:29:48,898 --> 00:29:53,699
interested in other compounds you're

737
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,139
interested in other indications sort of

738
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:57,179
um what other things are you looking

739
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,240
into

740
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,240
um

741
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:06,240
as simple as put in I'll be very broad

742
00:30:03,298 --> 00:30:09,658
here today because I do have a couple of

743
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,579
other well actually I could actually say

744
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:13,380
I think at cadmed you're going to be

745
00:30:11,579 --> 00:30:15,839
able to hear from not only ourself but

746
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,140
Mr Hunter land in regards to what our

747
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,939
molecules can do in areas of

748
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:23,520
neurodegeneration longevity and health

749
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:26,580
span as well right this is an area

750
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:29,038
that's pretty interesting and

751
00:30:26,579 --> 00:30:30,538
um in presentation with Hunter

752
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:32,220
um we're hoping that we can show some

753
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:34,019
pretty positive signs of what these

754
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:36,839
molecules can do not only on their own

755
00:30:34,019 --> 00:30:38,220
but in combination with cannabinoids as

756
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:40,379
well

757
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:42,720
um outside of the neurodegeneration and

758
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:45,539
our anti-cancer promise I mentioned we

759
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,778
have some respiratory diseases that

760
00:30:45,538 --> 00:30:51,179
we're looking at and the clear

761
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:53,038
anti-inflammatory angle as well so over

762
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:55,620
the in the years to come we're hoping

763
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,960
that we can continue to build up

764
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:59,759
momentum and show promise for our

765
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,159
molecules so that we can continue to

766
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:04,079
explore again just how effective and

767
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,720
useful these molecules can do across a

768
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:09,359
wide variety of chronic diseases for

769
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,019
both human and animals as well

770
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,339
all right you got a lot of work to do

771
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,240
so before I let you get back to that

772
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:17,459
work

773
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,220
um and Before I Let You Go I want to

774
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,360
give you the opportunity to share any

775
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,120
other

776
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:26,459
um resources that the listeners might be

777
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:29,398
interested to learn more about whether

778
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:31,200
it's your company or can flavins or any

779
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:32,278
of the research that you're doing and

780
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,319
then of course

781
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:35,460
um any websites or social media that

782
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,839
you'd like to share with the folks so

783
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,038
they can keep up with you please plug

784
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:40,678
away

c-a-n-u-r-t-a.com you can find a lot of

788
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:51,778
information about what we're doing and

789
00:31:49,019 --> 00:31:54,000
how we're doing it there also the

790
00:31:51,778 --> 00:31:55,380
abstract that we'll be presenting at can

791
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,480
Med

792
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,940
um the main paper was published the

793
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,819
interference of neuronal track B

794
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:05,460
signaling by the can cannabis derived

795
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:07,918
flavonoids can Flav and a and b the lead

796
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,038
author the on that paper is Jennifer

797
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,080
Jennifer Holborn out of Dr Jasmine

798
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:16,140
luong's Lab at the University of Guelph

799
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:18,178
this was published in February in the

800
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,720
Journal of fidal Medicine plus if anyone

801
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:23,640
wants to read it there as well and you

802

my name is Akeem Gardner I'm always

804
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:31,019
excited to talk about cannabis about

805
00:32:28,679 --> 00:32:32,640
health and wellness and about what this

806
00:32:31,019 --> 00:32:34,379
plant can do for the future so if

807
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,600
anyone's interested in diving a little

808
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:40,440
bit deeper I look forward to seeing you

809
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:42,480
