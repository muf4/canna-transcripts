2
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:20,480
so you mentioned Nano emolion um for

3
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,920
those listeners and hosts who might not

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,640
be familiar with what exactly that is

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,320
could you sort of

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,039
explain well let's go back to the very

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:33,119
Basics on it the very Basics are what is

8
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,000
an Emulsion so you can think about an

9
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:38,280
Emulsion as very very simple as making

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,878
salad dressing you take your oil in your

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,399
vinegar and you shake it and you get

12
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:45,039
something that looks very different than

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,480
oil and vinegar that's an Emulsion well

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,120
that's going to be a very very weak

15
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,878
Emulsion it's going to separate out in

16
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:53,640
some cases before you can even get it

17
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,759
out of the bottle onto your salad but

18
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,920
what we do with a nano Emulsion is we

19
00:00:55,759 --> 00:01:02,718
make those kind those uh little oil

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,079
droplets very very small Nano means like

21
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,478
10 to the 9th when you're talking about

22
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:12,400
things uh and so we we make these very

23
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:15,560
small and we suspend the Tarpin in these

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,759
uh compounds in these little oil bubbles

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:21,400
essentially and they uh will stay in

26
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,879
solution we've been able to keep them on

27
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:30,280
the lab bench at room temperature uh for

28
00:01:24,879 --> 00:01:34,959
over two years well and so it's in water

29
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,478
it's in water and we use a natural um

30
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:41,919
soap it's called Uh

31
00:01:37,478 --> 00:01:45,438
tween uh and basically uh we are going

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,560
for things that are extremely safe so we

33
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:50,478
use only used products in what we're

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,040
doing that are considered to be grass

35
00:01:50,478 --> 00:01:56,039
and grass is

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:59,240
G and it's an FDA category that's gener

37
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:01,519
generally regarded as safe so the bottom

38
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,959
line is this is a pesticide that you

39
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:06,039
could probably eat no I wouldn't advise

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:09,439
it but you could probably you could

41
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,959
probably eat it it smells very strong um

42
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,039
but it's um but it we are trying to make

43
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,039
it as safe as

44
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:18,280
possible excellent no I'm glad you

45
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:22,479
brought that up because obviously yeah

46
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:24,919
turpins they they smell and so if you're

47
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:27,719
adding these to the plant is it going to

48
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:29,958
affect I mean if it's if it's cannabis

49
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:31,318
it's one thing but um if you're if

50
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,719
you're looking to put this on other

51
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,359
crops is it going to affect the smell

52
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,519
Taste of those

53
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,400
crops um I think that we would have a

54
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,640
limit of

55
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:46,239
how late we can spray this on on some

56
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,598
crops for example you wouldn't want to

57
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,158
dunk your Apple in it and keep that as a

58
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:56,399
post Harvest uh but if you spray uh like

59
00:02:53,158 --> 00:02:59,919
the C cbits uh we didn't affect the the

60
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,200
quality of those uh by doing early early

61
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,439
earlier sprays we did not spray the

62
00:03:02,199 --> 00:03:07,598
fruit themselves so in the you know in

63
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:12,280
most cases we're not looking for the

64
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:14,479
plant as the uh product we're looking at

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:16,598
you know a fruit so you just have to be

66
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:19,280
careful when you can spray those and

67
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:22,439
also remember that that tarping are

68
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,199
ephemeral even ours will eventually uh

69
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:26,000
go away but I have a feeling that we

70
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,878
won't be using them on post Harvest

71
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,878
because I think it will affect consumer

72
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:30,878
taste

73
