1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:10,120
so everyone I'm excited to be here AEM

2
00:00:07,278 --> 00:00:15,120
Gardner those lights are

3
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:17,079
bright um first of all may is ALS

4
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:18,879
awareness month so I want I'm very

5
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:20,759
excited to be able to be here to present

6
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,320
on what we're doing in regards to ALS

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,400
research I want to challenge all of you

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,320
if you know the ice bucket challenge go

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:29,559
home do the ice bucket challenge

10
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,879
challenge your peers to do that and we

11
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:33,759
are um continuing along with the ALS

12
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,920
Association to raise money for ALS

13
00:00:33,759 --> 00:00:38,359
research it's very well needed now today

14
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:39,920
I'm going to try something a little bit

15
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:42,640
different a little bit new so I'm going

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,000
to start by asking a question have any

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:48,159
of you guys watched the movie

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,198
Oppenheimer alimer learned the story of

19
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:53,759
the atomic bomb right I thought it was a

20
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:57,000
very very good movie a powerful and

21
00:00:53,759 --> 00:01:00,000
compelling sto Story one of the things

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,320
that blew me away no pun intended but

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,680
blew me away the Striking power of

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,438
nature when combined with modern

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,040
science and just as that film aimed to

26
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:11,839
bring to light a pivotal moment in

27
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,360
history today I aim to draw a similar

28
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,320
parallel but in the realm of Medical

29
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:20,078
Science to benefit human health by the

30
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:22,519
end my aim is to aim is to convince you

31
00:01:20,078 --> 00:01:25,118
that complex human disease are best

32
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,478
solved with the complex but beautifully

33
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:30,560
beautifully designed power of nature not

34
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:33,118
as n not nature as a Destroyer but

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,840
nature as a Giver of Life and today I'm

36
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,599
excited to share with you the story of

37
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,799
how I think we get

38
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:41,719
there good

39
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,360
perfect so to start to quickly recap our

40
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:45,158
mission at Kera is to develop

41
00:01:43,359 --> 00:01:47,680
Therapeutics that Target inflammation

42
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,439
and address unmet needs in neurology and

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,200
we're using the Synergy of Cutting Edge

44
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,718
science and proprietary natural

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,799
ingredients to do just

46
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:59,438
that over the last 3 years we've been

47
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:02,520
exploring Uncharted plant molecules and

48
00:01:59,438 --> 00:02:06,199
doing a lot of work to validate them

49
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,878
pre-clinically this our team is Young

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,560
talented gritty and driven there's such

51
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,120
a joy for me to work with each and every

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,840
day and we have a science Advisory Board

53
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,959
experienced and proven in Botanical

54
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,878
Pharmaceuticals our goal is to Target

55
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,199
inflammation the root cause of all

56
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:27,159
disease because 50% of human mortality

57
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:29,280
is attributed to systematic chronic

58
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:30,919
inflammation now most drugs on the

59
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,360
market and the ones that still fail in

60
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:36,119
development still have pretty bad safety

61
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,360
concerns and Botanicals though generally

62
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,680
regarded as safe have efficacy

63
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:43,120
standardization and patentability issues

64
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,599
but as the prevalence of disease

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,519
continues to rise we at kerta see an

66
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:49,919
opportunity to challenge the traditional

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,120
drug development and treatment

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,158
Paradigm now can Flavin A and B are two

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,560
of our star molecules that help us do

70
00:02:55,158 --> 00:03:00,919
just that these two are penol flavonoids

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,800
unique to Cannabis sativa

72
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,119
they have a flavone backbone consisting

73
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,239
of two fennel rings and a heterocyclic

74
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,039
ring they're highly lipophilic and that

75
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,158
allows them to easily accumulate in

76
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:15,000
cells and potentially membrane Brown

77
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:17,280
enzymes and receptors and they're

78
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,959
traditionally found extremely scarce and

79
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,959
rare in the plant and under

80
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:25,920
0.014% of the plant's

81
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,479
biomass well we've developed production

82
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:30,919
technology um patented Tech that allows

83
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:33,479
us to be able to produce the as extracts

84
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,438
alongside purified molecules that we've

85
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,438
been able to use to gain deeper

86
00:03:35,438 --> 00:03:39,120
understanding of their mechanisms how

87
00:03:37,438 --> 00:03:41,639
they work against inflammatory and

88
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,120
neurodegenerative targets today I'm

89
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,639
going to start by laying the groundwork

90
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,400
of how these molecules might be

91
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,000
beneficial in areas of neurod

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,000
degenerative

93
00:03:49,239 --> 00:03:55,400
disease canlen is a dual inhibitor of

94
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,959
proinflammatory enzymes it has 30 times

95
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:00,480
the potency of Asa the active ingredient

96
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,400
in Aspirin but it doesn't have Cox one

97
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:06,039
activity as it works through five alone

98
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,920
so a higher safety profile is expected

99
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:11,039
with repeated and chronic use now though

100
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:13,639
this initial Discovery was made in vitro

101
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,280
in the mid 1980s no one's produced

102
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,159
enough of this molecule to be able to

103
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,680
validate the original assays with

104
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,240
botanically derived ingredients as we

105
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,280
have here or they haven't moved things

106
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,960
forward in Vivo not in a human or in a

107
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:30,478
mouse until

108
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,079
now what we were able to do was do an

109
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,918
LPS induced acute respiratory distress

110
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:37,359
model that was able to show that can

111
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:40,240
flaven a was able to reduce cyto kind

112
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,439
storm markers and amarate the pulmonary

113
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,120
function in a statistically significant

114
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,279
way we have other data not shown on the

115
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,959
slide but it shows that we were able to

116
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:52,239
decrease no activity which is a measure

117
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:54,638
of inflammation and a reduction in the

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,478
cyto known as

119
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,079
cxcl1 notably while

120
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,279
dexamethasone I think we can see it here

121
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:05,120
in this one is what I'm talking about

122
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:08,559
dexamethasone was failed to improve the

123
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,680
respiratory dysfunction improved by LPS

124
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:15,600
our can 5 and a successfully restored

125
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,600
the respiratory function in these

126
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,680
mice so then we contined to look at how

127
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:23,038
these molecules could help and what we

128
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,478
used here was C elegans in a model due

129
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:26,680
to their genetic and behavioral

130
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,758
suitability for simulating human

131
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,478
neurological conditions in these studies

132
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,960
compounds were tested at a concentration

133
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:37,038
of 20 micromolar with Endeavor own

134
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:38,839
serving as the positive control over 10

135
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,639
experiments three that I'm going to show

136
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:43,599
you today our can Flavin exhibited

137
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,960
significant activity especially in

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,800
models related to ALS and frontal

139
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:51,079
temporal dementia this suggested to us a

140
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,478
valuable direction for future Research

141
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:55,719
into their potential

142
00:05:53,478 --> 00:06:00,079
benefits and this is what brought us to

143
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,600
ALS otherwise known as lugar's disease

144
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:05,758
for any of you not familiar ALS is a

145
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,840
rare dehab motor neuron disease with

146
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:10,038
rapid progression and average mortality

147
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,079
coming just 2 years after

148
00:06:10,038 --> 00:06:15,318
diagnosis there's currently no cure and

149
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:17,439
or treatments to manage symptoms as the

150
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,199
disease is very complex with a

151
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,120
multifactoral nature of neuron

152
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:23,840
degeneration there's a need for new

153
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,280
treatments to meet the unmet needs of

154
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,279
patients as every 90 minutes someone in

155
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:32,159
the US is newly diagnosed with ALS and

156
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,598
every 90 minutes someone with ALS passes

157
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,039
away from the

158
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,079
disease it's hard to understate just how

159
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,879
much of a challenge this disease is and

160
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:43,279
how much of a challenge it's been to

161
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:46,199
modern science as it's completely

162
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:48,318
heterogeneous means meaning it manifests

163
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:50,000
differently in each patient and it's

164
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,319
governed by a unique combination of

165
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,800
genetic environmental and biological

166
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,560
factors and there's so many different

167
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:01,038
things going wrong in the motor neurons

168
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,079
once they start to degenerate

169
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:05,318
the disease also exists on a spectrum

170
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,318
with other diseases like FTD and

171
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,960
Parkinson's so symptoms are often

172
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:11,039
misdiagnosed leading to a challenge when

173
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:13,638
it comes to

174
00:07:11,038 --> 00:07:15,399
treatment traditional drug therapies are

175
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:17,680
often designed to Target a singular

176
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,959
pathway and these continue to fall short

177
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,680
in effectively treating the multifaceted

178
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:25,279
disease now one would think with our new

179
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:29,120
technology and our new ways of making

180
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,758
medicines today over a 150e history of

181
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,319
this dis disease we would have some

182
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:37,680
traction towards the solution but nope

183
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,160
life expectancy back then was 2 years

184
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,400
post diagnosis and it's still the same

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,800
today and the options that we have on

186
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,359
the market today are no good as patients

187
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,199
are left with the options of taking

188
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,038
multiple drugs multiple pills various

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,598
solutions to help them manage a dehab

190
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:54,598
quality of

191
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:59,918
life even in today's news we still

192
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,478
continue to see failure after failure

193
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:05,478
after failure in clinical trials most

194
00:08:02,478 --> 00:08:07,560
recently with Amex voluntar voluntarily

195
00:08:05,478 --> 00:08:09,719
withdrawing their medicine due to a

196
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,079
failure after phase three clinical

197
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,599
trials even though both the analyst and

198
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:16,478
the company thought that this could be a

199
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:19,560
blockbuster drug but once again patients

200
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:22,918
were let down um and disappointed after

201
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,759
promising phe 2 Data because it didn't

202
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:28,240
work and this is just top of the news

203
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:31,038
over the last 12 months a lot of

204
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,519
failures from a lot of far tical

205
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:35,639
companies now this has led to Industry

206
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,719
experts calling for change in how we

207
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:41,319
approached ALS diseases it's not just

208
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,240
one disease you have to treat treat the

209
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,080
illness in multiple different ways and

210
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,320
someone in the room here with us had a

211
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,080
similar calling he had been talking

212
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,480
about it for many of

213
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:57,320
years this was Dr Ethan Russo our senior

214
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,639
medical adviser and CEO of kedto science

215
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,079
where part of his business is

216
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:02,679
formulating novel Botanicals that could

217
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:04,879
be developed

218
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:07,000
pharmaceutically a few years ago Ethan

219
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:08,439
began to tell me a story of a patient

220
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,919
that he had first treated when he came

221
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,440
to practice diagnosed with this terminal

222
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,319
disease and this patient refused to be

223
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,440
treated with the traditional

224
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:20,240
Pharmaceuticals his choice of therapy

225
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,600
was Cannabis and as Ethan will tell you

226
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,919
over 10 years of seeing this patient he

227
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,560
never got

228
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,399
weaker he also told me of his personal

229
00:09:26,559 --> 00:09:30,679
mission to do something here for this

230
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,399
patient population as he too felt the

231
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:33,639
pain of watching a loved one pass away

232
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,120
from the

233
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:37,958
disease so as Ethan and I started to

234
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,039
talk this is where things started to

235
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,759
change for me as Ethan let me know about

236
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:44,159
a patent and formulation he had been

237
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,958
working on throughout his career that he

238
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:47,958
knew would be able to serve this patient

239
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,759
population so the first thing that I

240
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:54,958
needed to catch up on was learning the

241
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:57,519
full potential of the cannabis plant one

242
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,518
of Nature's greatest medicinal plants

243
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,639
with respect to ALS it's important to to

244
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,120
note that there's much anodal evidence

245
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:06,159
reported of the plant's utility as

246
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,360
patients suffering from both ALS and

247
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:11,000
other neurodegenerative diseases have

248
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,320
used it in various forms since Antiquity

249
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,639
to manage their

250
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,240
symptoms the second thing I had to learn

251
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:20,078
was all the advantages of of the

252
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:22,278
Botanical drug these are multi-target

253
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:24,958
therapies that are made up of well Toler

254
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:27,439
tolerated ingredients that we as humans

255
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:29,479
co-evolved within nature they can be

256
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,560
delivered in a uniform product and as as

257
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,278
many of you know there are Streamlight

258
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:36,039
advantages in developing Botanical drugs

259
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:38,120
with Regulators around the world

260
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:41,240
recognizing the long history of

261
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,600
traditional use that we have for these

262
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,480
medicines and lastly patients they

263
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:48,000
generally prefer natural naturally

264
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:50,519
derived medicines anyways versus the

265
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,480
synthetically derived ones they all lean

266
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,959
towards the laws of

267
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:57,000
nature now for me as a law school

268
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,359
graduate I love that I get to lean on

269
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,600
the historical evidence of proof of can

270
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,240
ab's utility in human health like in

271
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:09,800
2700 BCE Emperor shenan wrote that

272
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,639
protracted taking may make one fat may

273
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:13,039
make you will make you strong but you'll

274
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,879
never go see

275
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:20,399
now in the 1200 CE writings from the

276
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:23,039
anak Anaconda shared that in combination

277
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:25,320
with celibacy those who used cannabis as

278
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,480
part of a rigorous regime could leave

279
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,320
live 300 years free from any disease and

280
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
signs of old age maybe worth it maybe

281
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:35,639
not I don't

282
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,200
know and in the 9th century alindi

283
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,360
famously wrote hashish eases the muscles

284
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,040
of the limbs and What

285
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,440
flows now more recently the bioactive

286
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,759
molecules from the plant have been

287
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,880
pharmaceutically developed and

288
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:51,399
standardized to treat neurological

289
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,480
diseases like multiple sorosis and D

290
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,000
syndrome with commercial

291
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,079
success and researchers have long

292
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,839
investigated how the key constituents

293
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:03,599
from the plant may be us useful for

294
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,600
helping patients suffering from

295
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,759
ALS one of these studies was a

296
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:09,879
randomized control clinical trials of

297
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:13,319
nials trade named

298
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:15,879
satx 60 patients in the study 29 took

299
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:18,440
nials all of them looking to treat their

300
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:20,519
spasticity and here Not only was the

301
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:22,639
drug tolerable but patients showed

302
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,120
statistically significant Improvement

303
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,720
when compared to Placebo at two of their

304
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,360
endpoints the Modified Ashworth Scale

305
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,320
for spasticity and on the pain numeric

306
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,680
rating

307
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,079
scale but the trial wasn't powered

308
00:12:33,679 --> 00:12:36,519
strong enough to show statistical

309
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:38,958
significance on all the other

310
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,240
secondaries including the ALS functional

311
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:42,479
rating scale

312
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:45,198
revised though some of these findings

313
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,360
were St were statistically significant

314
00:12:45,198 --> 00:12:50,240
and some were not what's key here is

315
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:52,639
that satx was not optimized for the ALS

316
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,519
patient this is exactly what we have the

317
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,000
ability to do with CNR 4

318
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:00,120
or1 this is our botanically derived

319
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,198
cocktail mixture specifically designed

320
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,919
to harness the powers of nature

321
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,879
standardized in a way that will meet the

322
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:08,799
requirements of regulators like the FDA

323
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:10,600
and just like a nuclear bomb doesn't

324
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:13,198
rely on a singular

325
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,240
reaction but a series of simultaneous

326
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:17,838
reactions that amplify each other to

327
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,959
produce a massive synergistic effect

328
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,720
similarly 401 isn't just us throwing

329
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:25,559
together a bunch of ingredients in a pot

330
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,639
or an extract and hoping that one works

331
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,919
it's a calculated strategy where each

332
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,799
component plays a specific role

333
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:35,439
enhancing the overall drugs

334
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,879
effect the beauty of this approach lies

335
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,000
in its Synergy each ingredient in the

336
00:13:37,879 --> 00:13:42,559
cocktail is selected not only for

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
individual effects but how it interacts

338
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:48,278
with each other this is crucial because

339
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,639
in ALS where multiple cell cellular and

340
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:53,159
multiple pathways are impaired what we

341
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,839
have the ability to to do is to provide

342
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:59,319
benefit by targeting multiple Pathways

343
00:13:56,839 --> 00:14:01,120
simultaneously leading to a therapy that

344
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,440
will create a Cascade of beneficial

345
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,839
effects mitigating the disease from

346
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,839
several angles with with each and every

347
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,278
dose now I know all this sounds nice but

348
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:14,919
some may ask where's the proof what are

349
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,919
the other ingredients how do we know

350
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:18,159
this approach will work well now I'm

351
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:19,759
going to take you through a little bit

352
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,799
about what the last few months have

353
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,800
looked like for us and where we intend

354
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:27,799
to go from

355
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:30,679
here so several toxic agents such as BPA

356
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:33,599
bmaa pet pesticides and heavy metals are

357
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:36,198
known to trigger symptoms similar to Als

358
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,440
bmaa in particular is produced by a

359
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:41,519
symbiotic cob bacteria and has been

360
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:43,800
linked to ALS Parkinson's and

361
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,600
dementia this compound has been found in

362
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:47,679
the food supply chain in Guam and

363
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,079
detected in the brains of individuals as

364
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:54,000
well as American Alzheimer patients and

365
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:56,799
bmaa is suspective of causing neuron

366
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,799
damage by promoting excessive glutamate

367
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,758
ex

368
00:14:57,799 --> 00:15:02,958
cytotoxicity which which has propelled

369
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,399
it which has propelled its study um as a

370
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:09,319
significant environmental factor in ALS

371
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:09,320
research across various preclinical

372
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:14,278
models now zebra fish are increasingly

373
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:17,278
recognized as a preferred model for

374
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:18,958
preclinical drug research particularly

375
00:15:17,278 --> 00:15:21,439
in the study of neurodegenerative

376
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:24,599
diseases so we've partnered with crem

377
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,720
cabs a CR with specializing in zeber

378
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:30,720
fish studies to conduct an assay

379
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,319
involving neurotoxicity induced by

380
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,278
bmaa In This study first we had to

381
00:15:33,318 --> 00:15:38,318
establish the toxicity parameters for

382
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:40,759
bmaa using zebrafish larve and then we

383
00:15:38,318 --> 00:15:42,879
validated the study using Endeavor own a

384
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,039
therapeutic drug for ALS known to

385
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:46,759
restore motor function ensuring the

386
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:50,719
relevance and the reliability of our

387
00:15:46,759 --> 00:15:50,720
findings in the context of ALS

388
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:56,159
research our objective in this overall

389
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,120
project is to develop a Botanical drug

390
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:59,799
this is going to be a product composed

391
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,600
of plant extract effect that meet our

392
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:04,519
targeted ingredient ratios but as we

393
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,680
finalized the chemistry manufacturing

394
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:08,120
controls for this investigational

395
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:10,958
product that will put into human

396
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:14,078
clinical trials we used botanically

397
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:16,559
derived isolates at optimal ratios to

398
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:18,559
ensure that in these initial tests we

399
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:20,879
were able to assess the overall Target

400
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,838
activity of our formulation just for

401
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:25,559
these

402
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,000
studies with these materials we then had

403
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:29,559
to make sure that they actually worked

404
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:33,159
in the medium so what we did determined

405
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:36,439
was that a uh an addition of 10 molar of

406
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:39,278
py cyclodextrin solution was safe and

407
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:42,959
non-toxic as a carrier for dissolving

408
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:46,318
the ALS formulation into the test

409
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,758
medium our toxicity assays conducted um

410
00:16:46,318 --> 00:16:50,399
6 days post treatment confirmed that all

411
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,480
the products that we were that we were

412
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,318
using were safe up to final

413
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,560
concentration of two micromolar and they

414
00:16:55,318 --> 00:16:59,120
all stayed in the

415
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:01,799
medium after we were able to do all this

416
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,959
it was time for our

417
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:06,798
experiment our findings were able to

418
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:08,838
show us that our CNR 401 and some of our

419
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,119
other products were able to demonstrate

420
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,480
a statistically significant effect in

421
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,719
this model indicating the promising

422
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,160
therapeutic effect that we have for

423
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:19,679
potentially treating

424
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,519
ALS treatment with our 401 in the

425
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,360
zebrafish lar larva led us led to

426
00:17:22,519 --> 00:17:27,439
statistically significant Improvement in

427
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,558
the bmaa induced phenotype compared to

428
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,679
the positive control and Deon and these

429
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:35,440
experiments were conducted in 48 wall

430
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:37,640
plates with 6 to9 experiments performed

431
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,558
per

432
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:42,840
condition after we knew we had our hit

433
00:17:40,558 --> 00:17:45,119
then we wanted to test the uh efficacy

434
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:47,678
of our formulation across various

435
00:17:45,119 --> 00:17:49,719
doses so we did a couple more

436
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,960
experiments um these assets were

437
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,558
performed in 48 wall plates with seven

438
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,640
replicates involving more than 60 larvae

439
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:57,960
for each

440
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:01,280
formulation the results showed a dose

441
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:06,519
dependent response for both CNR 401a and

442
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:06,519
402a are mixed and pure formulations

443
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,519
respectively so next what we're doing is

444
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,559
we're progressing our formulations and

445
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:15,480
development research research

446
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:17,480
initiatives our current efforts are

447
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,640
Guided by the Botanical drug development

448
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:21,798
standards which need us to refine our

449
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,880
extraction Sops enhance our product

450
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:29,279
fingerprinting and and ask us to adhere

451
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:31,240
to rigorous QA QC procedures

452
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,639
in terms of our drug delivery we're

453
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,798
focusing on optimizing our

454
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,080
investigational product formats our

455
00:18:34,798 --> 00:18:38,679
pharmakinetics studies are particularly

456
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:41,199
concentrated on enhancing the bloodb

457
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:44,519
brain barrier penetration using things

458
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:46,440
like solid lipid Nano par particles and

459
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:48,679
in addition we're also embarking on a

460
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,558
study of our investigational product in

461
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:54,798
a k9 degenerative myopathy study at the

462
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:56,599
University of Montreal this is a

463
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:59,599
naturally occurring animal model that

464
00:18:56,599 --> 00:19:01,798
mimics ALS and has various similarities

465
00:18:59,599 --> 00:19:05,558
because these dogs also carry the sod

466
00:19:01,798 --> 00:19:05,558
one sod one mutant

467
00:19:05,798 --> 00:19:10,079
Gene we're also working to better

468
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:12,558
understand the multi-target modes of

469
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:15,480
actions of our formulation and how what

470
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:16,678
that has on ALS progression one of the

471
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,519
things that we're looking at is

472
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:21,280
investigating the potential role of can

473
00:19:18,519 --> 00:19:23,918
Flavin on mod modulating calcium levels

474
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,119
in the bra in the brain and addressing

475
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:28,919
impaired glutamate uptake by asites this

476
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:31,279
is a Hallmark of neurodegenerative

477
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:33,240
diseases like ALS so we're very

478
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:36,119
interested in what we're going to find

479
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,880
there we're also doing some biomarker

480
00:19:36,119 --> 00:19:40,678
Discovery um including RNA sequencing

481
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,600
from our previous experiments to gain

482
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,159
insight into Gene regulation and

483
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:46,519
biomarker Analysis and we're looking

484
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,200
we're using

485
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:51,038
bioinformatics bioinformatic screens

486
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,200
from people on our team to enrich

487
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,440
patient data profiles and predict

488
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:59,279
outcomes by integrating existing data uh

489
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:01,600
respirator like answer ALS

490
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:04,038
and other information so that we can

491
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,038
identify biological Pathways for

492
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:08,158
intervention one of the targets that

493
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:10,319
we're really interested in is the bitter

494
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,559
taste receptors and we're going to talk

495
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:14,599
more on this at our later presentations

496
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:17,038
later in the

497
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:19,439
year we're also preparing and raising

498
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,200
money to go into a pivotal P Phase 2

499
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,120
trial right now we're putting our team

500
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,319
and our infrastructure together

501
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:29,798
targeting a first patient dose sometime

502
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:29,798
in the first nine months of 2025

503
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,759
so we have and we and we have a strong

504
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,799
understanding of the road map in front

505
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,759
of us with a potential accelerated

506
00:20:35,798 --> 00:20:39,759
approval obtainable and orphan drug

00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,079
designation Pro protecting our

508
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:44,798
commercial advantages as we continue to

509
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:47,798
grow and develop out this

510
00:20:44,798 --> 00:20:50,279
asset our patents are filed globally and

511
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:52,158
give exclusivity to our methods our

compositions and our products over the

513
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:58,559
next 20 plus years and Beyond C CNR 401

514
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,240
we also have multiple other assets

515
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:03,119
Assets in development that follow

516
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,798
closely behind and Beyond this we have

517
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,798
numerous molecules in Discovery some of

518
00:21:05,798 --> 00:21:10,960
that them that have been characterized

519
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:13,079
some of them that are yet too that as we

520
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,558
learn more and more about and learn more

521
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:17,000
and more about their therapeutic

522
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:19,678
potential we're extremely excited about

523
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,720
what we can bring to the

524
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,038
world so just as Oppenheimer and his

525
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:27,720
team orchestrated reactions to change

526
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,599
the course of history today we're aiming

527
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,839
to coordinate a therapy that can

528
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:34,199
fundamentally change the trajectory of

529
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:35,000
those living with ALS its treatment and

530
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,720
its

531
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,079
care this isn't just an addition to our

532
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,079
Arsenal against ALS it's a really

533
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,240
transformational solution that will

534
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,879
resonate across the spectrum of neurod

535
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:49,839
degenerative diseases bringing New Hope

536
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:51,880
where there were previously very little

537
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,000
so as we dive deeper into our work and

538
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:56,400
we roll up our sleeves and get ready for

539
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,278
the real work to begin I invite any of

540
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:01,720
you who that may be able to help in any

541
00:21:58,278 --> 00:22:03,319
way possible to join our team our story

542
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,798
which is a tale of groundbreaking

543
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:08,798
science complex challenges and the

544
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:10,599
profound impact of natural Innovation

545
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:12,440
this is the moment we seek to emulate in

546
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:15,240
our journey towards a breakthrough ALS

547
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:17,798
treatment and a world without complex

548
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,880
degenerative terminal

549
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:21,960
illnesses thank you for our for

550
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:24,080
listening to our presentation a special

551

you and I have a couple of minutes so if

559
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:44,159
we have any

560
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:44,159
questions I'm here any

561
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:52,640
questions or you can find me oh

562

question two Bonnie I just thank you

563
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,559
very interesting presentation oh thank

564
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,360
you so much very interesting um it's

565
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:02,720
probably proprietary Terry but any

566
00:22:59,359 --> 00:23:05,399
chance to give us a hint as to what um

567
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,839
cannabinoids or non-cannabinoid

568
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,840
compounds you're focused

569
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:16,519
on as as Ethan spoke about yesterday we

570
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,960
have a variety of different ingredients

571
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:22,119
in our mixture that we know that do

572
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,960
various things that help with the ALS

573
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:25,879
pathophysiology if you're at Ethan's

574
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,798
presentation yesterday you got A Sneak

575
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:30,559
Peek or you can bother Ethan later to

576
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:33,679
find out about his Trade

577
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:35,278
Secrets hiim thank you that was a great

578
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,360
presentation I'm curious about the

579
00:23:35,278 --> 00:23:40,079
results of the zebra fish model and the

580
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:42,199
I forget what drug it was that was the

581
00:23:40,079 --> 00:23:44,519
standard you were comparing against

582
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,038
which obviously did not translate to

583
00:23:44,519 --> 00:23:48,798
humans and I'm curious about you know

584
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,000
your thoughts on the translational

585
00:23:48,798 --> 00:23:54,158
potential there and the results of your

586
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:56,839
compound versus that drug well actually

587
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:59,520
Endeavor own is a solution right now

588
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:02,319
that's used for ALS treat ALS patients

589
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:05,119
it's approved as an IV formulation but

590
00:24:02,319 --> 00:24:08,240
it only minimally extends lifespan about

591
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:10,719
2 to 5 months right so we know it works

592
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,798
at restoring motor functions but what it

593
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,880
doesn't do is um over a series of time

594
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:19,278
is stop the disease progression and help

595
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,039
the patients what we know is that with

596
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:23,319
cannaboids our ingredients and our

597
00:24:21,038 --> 00:24:24,879
mixtures will be safe for chronic use

598
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:27,639
and there's a variety of different

599
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,880
information on the various cannabinoids

600
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,520
tpin and flavonoids that we have in our

601
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:34,919
mixture that should allow this to be um

602
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:36,960
beneficial for the patients at

603
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,520
mitigating their symptoms but also

604
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,278
provide the neuroprotective patient the

605
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:44,158
neuroprotective potential sorry so that

606
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:46,839
as they use it each and every day

607
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,320
they're able to stay alive longer have a

608
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:52,038
better quality of life and um it just

609
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,398
changed their overall experience of what

610
00:24:52,038 --> 00:24:59,558
it means living with ALS or other motor

611
00:24:54,398 --> 00:24:59,558
neuron diseases thank you great answer

612
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:09,199
