00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,279
with you today

131
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:24,159
about an issue that i imagine a lot of

132
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,439
our listeners don't

133
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,600
know too much about cannabis hyperemesis

134
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:33,199
syndrome or cannabinoid hyperemesis

135
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,879
syndrome um so you have dealt with this

136
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
personally and i know you've told your

137
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,519
story

138
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:39,439
countless times but i hope you wouldn't

139
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:41,839
mind sharing it again

140
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,959
um just tell us about your your

141
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,198
experience with this

142
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:46,399
syndrome and then we can talk more about

143
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,560
um

144
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:50,399
kind of everything that goes into it

145
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,160
yeah so um i joined the cannabis

146
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,478
industry back in 2011

147
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,319
and in 2015 i started writing edible

148
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:58,159
reviews so i was consuming

149
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
a good amount of edibles about 10 to 15

150
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,520
milligrams of edibles a day i'd smoke

151
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:03,279
about half a joint a day

152
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,399
i wouldn't consider myself a heavy user

153
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:08,318
by any means but i was definitely a user

154
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:09,839
i used cannabis for anxiety and

155
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,439
depression and for sleep

156
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,719
so it was definitely a medicine for me

157
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:14,478
um while i also would use it

158
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,240
recreationally sometimes during the day

159
00:06:14,478 --> 00:06:17,519
so it had a lot of benefits and purposes

160
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,720
for me

161
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:23,120
around 2016 i started to throw up and

162
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,960
i would just get really sick for a few

163
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,759
hours at a time they would go away and

164
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:28,000
it would happen

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,038
about once a month and then as time went

166
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,839
on it started happening

167
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,360
more and more like once a week and then

168
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,560
in 2018

169
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,080
i threw up for 14 days straight and that

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,120
was non-stop vomiting

171
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:42,240
all day every day 14 days and doctors

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,720
couldn't figure out what was wrong with

173
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
me

174
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,639
then eventually i saw a doctor who said

175
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,560
you know it's got to be the weed so i

176
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:50,240
took a three-month cannabis break

177
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,959
and then i reintroduced cannabis back

178
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,879
into my life and i got sick again this

179
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:57,038
time only lasting four days

180
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,240
and then i said okay maybe i can

181
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,318
introduce cbd

182
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,560
oh and when i reintroduced cannabis into

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:05,439
my life that was pesticide-free cannabis

184
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,360
i made sure it's pesticide-free um so

185
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:08,879
because a lot of people say that chs

186
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,199
caused by pesticides so

187
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:13,199
went pesticide free still got sick and

188
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:15,120
then i introduced cbd into my life

189
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,478
and i was able to use cbd for about

190
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,240
three months until i had

191
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,800
my worst episode yet where i threw up

192
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,800
all day every day for 16 days straight

193
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
so it's been a really crazy journey with

194
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
chs um

195
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
just being so sick for so many years not

196
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,919
knowing what was going on with me having

197
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,560
my near-death experiences with all my

198
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:33,598
throwing up

199
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,680
and my 16-day episode i got an

200
00:07:33,598 --> 00:07:38,959
ulcer hernia and a bacteria infection in

201
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:42,720
my gut from all the throwing up

202
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,560
wow that is that's unbelievable really

203
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
um i can't believe you had to go through

204
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,639
that um

205
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,918
so when was it that you actually figured

206
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,960
out that this was

207
00:07:49,918 --> 00:07:56,399
chs or that it was the cannabis that was

208
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,839
was causing this and i mean i'll be very

209
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:59,758
i'll be very frank i had never heard of

210
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:00,959
chs until i heard your story i came in

211
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
2019.

212
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:04,239
um so what resources were available to

213
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,080
you

214
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,079
at the time um when you were going

215
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:08,639
through this was it how well known was

216
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:10,399
it

217
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,000
it wasn't very well known at all there

218
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:13,918
was barely any resources

219
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
the only things i could find online when

220
00:08:13,918 --> 00:08:17,279
searching um

221
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,598
were like very fear-mongering articles

222
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,198
that are like cannabis is bad and

223
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:22,800
people are getting really really sick

224
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,639
and it's crazy and just

225
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,079
it was very fear-mongering and wasn't

226
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,439
informative at all

227
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:30,878
um dr jeff rober um raber i don't know

228
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,759
exactly how to pronounce his last name

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:34,240
um

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,800
with um he's with the terpene company he

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,000
um

232
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:38,000
actually is the one who told me to put

233
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,679
capsaicin cream on my stomach and so

234
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,679
that did provide some relief when i used

235
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,759
capsaicin cream but then my skin was on

236
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,879
fire and was burning and so i used a wet

237
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:46,958
rag to try to

238
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:48,799
wipe the capsaicin off not knowing that

239
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:49,199
water actually increases the effects of

240
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:50,958
it

241
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,560
and so i just made it even worse and

242
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:55,439
then i was crying in tears

243
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,958
because my stomach was on fire um and so

244
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
i couldn't use capsaicin again after

245
00:08:56,958 --> 00:09:01,039
that because it was so traumatizing but

246
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,039
capsaicin does help a lot of people um

247
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:05,599
but back to your question there wasn't a

248
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,199
lot of information out there at all

249
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
there's a few facebook groups that exist

250
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
that are great resources now but i

251
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,359
didn't have them at the time i wasn't

252
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
aware of them

253
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,320
it wasn't until i started publicly

254
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:15,759
speaking that people reached out to me

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,959
and told me about the facebook group so

256
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,879
it took me

257
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:20,479
a few years to like really find a lot of

258
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,320
resources on it and

259
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,278
when did i first truly believe that i

260
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,440
had it well before my 14-day episode

261
00:09:25,278 --> 00:09:29,200
right before i had seen a doctor and she

262
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,000
had said it could probably be the weed

263
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,000
and so

264
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,759
before my 14-day episode i said okay i'm

265
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,759
gonna go have one last hurrah

266
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:37,519
i'm going to an infused dinner in the

267
00:09:35,759 --> 00:09:38,399
malibu hills i just didn't want to pass

268
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,399
it up and

269
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,000
that last hurrah is what triggered my 14

270
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,519
day episode and so it became very

271
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,440
apparent that it was cannabis that was

272
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,839
triggering my symptoms

273
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
wow you know and i have to imagine that

274
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:51,360
that's that must have been hard for you

275
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,360
personally too because you were in the

276
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,120
in the industry you're very vocal

277
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,159
advocate for cannabis and then to have

278
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,440
this be

279
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,079
something that's causing you illness

280
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,480
must have been a hard thing to accept

281
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,480
a very hard thing to accept it's been a

282
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,399
very challenging thing i still you know

283
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,039
get upset about it from time to time

284
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,720
because

285
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,319
not only is cannabis my medicine but

286
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,320
cannabis is my entire life

287
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,760
like i'm a cannabis socialite i go to

288
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,440
events all the time i review

289
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:16,799
products i educate people on safe

290
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
consumption i

291
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:21,120
live eat breathe sleep cannabis it is my

292
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,719
world completely so

293
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
definitely hard pill to swallow on that

294
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,920
one

295
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:29,919
and i wonder if you could speak to what

296
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,679
has sort of the response been from the

297
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:32,479
cannabis community now that you've been

298
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,039
more vocal

299
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,759
about this issue i'm i mean i can speak

300
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,919
from

301
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:39,838
not really experience but talking with

302
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:40,240
other folks on the podcast who have

303
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,640
maybe

304
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,440
raised some concerns about potentially

305
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,439
negative effects of cannabis that

306
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,040
they do receive some backlash from

307
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
people in the community so i was

308
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:53,759
wondering uh

309
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,440
if you experienced that at all yes so

310
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:57,360
while i have had some support from

311
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,760
people in the industry i've also

312
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:02,079
had an overwhelming amount of backlash

313
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:04,078
um someone said i deserve to be beaten

314
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,399
up because i was speaking out about it

315
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:08,078
um i've received targeted attacks so

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
many different times um from people both

317
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:12,078
within the industry and without

318
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,360
outside of the industry i've lost a lot

319
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:15,199
of peers

320
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,959
in the space people who i thought that

321
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,720
were like friends

322
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,159
because they were just so frustrated

323
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
that i was speaking out about this

324
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:24,480
and they think that it's a potential

325
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,919
harm to legalization but i just think

326
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,039
it's a potential negative that needs to

327
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:28,719
be discussed and

328
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:30,559
by not discussing it we're doing more

329
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:33,839
harm than good

330
00:11:30,559 --> 00:11:35,119
i agree with you 100 um i think we all

331
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,160
agree that cannabis has

332
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,078
amazing therapeutic potential um

333
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:41,360
and if we believe that can do all these

334
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:44,078
great things then

335
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,680
we have to assume that they it could do

336
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,879
some negative things too

337
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,719
in certain situations and thankfully um

338
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:52,720
it doesn't happen too often but we need

339
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,120
to acknowledge that there is a risk out

340
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
there

341
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,120
in some cases and the more we understand

342
00:11:55,039 --> 00:11:59,120
it the better we can um

343
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,560
we better we can use the medicine

344
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,240
absolutely yeah

345
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:03,919
i really want the cannabis community to

346
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,839
understand that um

347
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:07,360
and become more accepting and aware of

348
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,720
it because i was sick for two years

349
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,839
before i knew what was wrong with me and

350
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,440
that's because there wasn't any

351
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,200
education and awareness and

352
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,480
i that's two years of suffering that i

353
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,560
went through that you know

354
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,399
things that i had to cancel all the time

355
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:20,319
flights that were missed things that

356
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,399
my life was disrupted because i was so

357
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,600
sick and i don't want anyone else to

358
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,078
have to go through that so i think

359
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,959
awareness

360
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,799
is super important all right so on the

361
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,239
topic of awareness so

362
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,838
as i was saying to you before we started

363
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,320
recording that back in

364
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,560
2019 when you were on the panel about

365
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,278
this this issue at kim in 2019

366
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:41,278
i had never heard of chs um but since

367
00:12:39,278 --> 00:12:44,078
then i have heard of it a few times

368
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,799
most recently in a clubhouse room

369
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:46,799
discussing

370
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,439
thc limits that are going to be placed

371
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:52,479
on edibles where someone mentioned that

372
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,440
chs is a real thing

373
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,480
and um a lot of people on that call had

374
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
had never heard of it

375
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,639
and i actually actually uh raised my

376
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:02,879
hand and pointed people to

377
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,560
the video of the panel that you were on

378
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:06,320
uh and i hope people actually check that

379
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,958
out and i will definitely add a link to

380
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,879
that

381
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:10,479
in the show notes for um for this

382
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:11,120
podcast as well for anyone who hasn't

383
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
seen it

384
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,799
but back to the original question about

385
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,279
awareness that

386
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:21,439
how has awareness grown since 2019

387
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,439
um awareness is definitely growing i

388
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,320
mean i was featured by washington post

389
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,920
last summer

390
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,600
they did a cover story in their health

391
00:13:25,919 --> 00:13:30,639
section of the newspaper

392
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,800
about chs so that was a big deal

393
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,000
business insider leafly high times

394
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,319
they've all done pieces on it

395
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
as well and then a few tv stations have

396
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
also done pieces

397
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,278
so i think awareness is growing um i

398
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:42,319
created an instagram account and a

399
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,278
twitter account

400
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,879
that um you know i use chs hashtags and

401
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:48,399
constantly i'm searching twitter for

402
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,519
people who are talking about chs that

403
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,039
way i can point them in the right

404
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,399
direction for resources

405
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:53,759
so i think awareness is definitely

406
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,799
growing a lot more people are hearing

407
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,559
about it but there's still

408
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,240
a lot more people who need to hear about

409
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:04,719
it so the work is not over yet

410
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,320
yeah and again during that panel in 2019

411
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,160
you know this whole condition was still

412
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,760
very mysterious as to

413
00:14:08,159 --> 00:14:11,600
you know what are the causes what are

414
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:12,480
the treatments there hadn't been enough

415
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,040
research into

416
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,320
chs what's changed on that front do we

417
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:19,120
have any more

418
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,480
idea of sort of what's triggering this

419
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:23,600
condition or maybe

420
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,759
um at least some commonalities

421
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,920
between people who are experiencing it

422
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,159
so um at the canmed panel i had done a

423
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,159
survey of i believe it was like 130 or

424
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:34,159
150 people i'm since then i've done a

425
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,559
survey of 330 people

426
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,399
and i asked more in-depth questions and

427
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:40,078
really the only commonality that we all

428
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,000
have is that we use cannabis

429
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,120
the amount that we use the duration we

430
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,240
used um

431
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:49,679
the type used it all varies

432
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,120
um the age of people the majority of

433
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:52,719
people were using for eight years or

434
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,000
longer before developing symptoms but

435
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,759
there were people who were using for

436
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,639
less than a year that developed symptoms

437
00:14:55,759 --> 00:15:00,000
so it's kind of

438
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:01,519
all over the place um and uh there was

439
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,039
one other point with it that

440
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,879
i just slipped my brain it'll come back

441
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:07,439
to me um but yeah

442
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:09,439
oh um there was a high amount of people

443
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,839
with anxiety and depression

444
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,120
so that is interesting i can't say that

445
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,560
oh if you have anxiety and depression

446
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,240
you're gonna get chs it might be

447
00:15:14,559 --> 00:15:17,599
those people are just using cannabis to

448
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,240
treat their anxiety and depression and

449
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,600
that's why

450
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,278
we have a high amount of people that

451
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,720
have it but that was the pre-existing

452
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,919
condition that there was a high amount

453
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,879
of people having it

454
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,639
um as far as treatment goes 90 i think

455
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:31,360
believe like 97

456
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:32,879
of people use hot baths successfully um

457
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,039
to treat their symptoms

458
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,039
um haldol is a medication that is

459
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:38,559
commonly used and there was a small

460
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:40,399
amount of people who use haldol

461
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:42,078
and it did work for them but it gave

462
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
them such severe side effects that they

463
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:44,719
said they would have preferred the

464
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,679
nausea and vomiting over the side

465
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:48,959
effects

466
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:51,120
so aldol is really a medication that is

467
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:52,958
being used more it's kind of the go-to

468
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,879
now in emergency rooms so doctors are

469
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:57,838
turning to that medication

470
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,198
it's benzodiazepine and antipsychotic

471
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,680
and so for people who don't have

472
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:03,679
psychotic issues it can cause psychosis

473
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:05,599
so it is should be a last resort

474
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,599
capsaicin cream should be the go-to but

475
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,199
a lot of doctors are using haldol and a

476
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:11,680
few other medications

477
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,359
um university of calgary in canada is

478
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:15,519
currently doing a study to see

479
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,879
how beneficial haldol truly is as a

480
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,480
medication for treatment

481
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,240
so we'll see those results in a few

482
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,240
months see what they come up with

483
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,759
they did a study already on capsaicin

484
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,680
and so now they're working on hal doll

485
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,360
to see how that works out

486
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,039
oh well so that's encouraging that there

487
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,800
are some some folks that are doing some

488
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,639
research into treatments for this

489
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,639
yeah um i wish that there was some

490
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,198
research going on into the cause behind

491
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,959
it

492
00:16:35,198 --> 00:16:38,879
i think that would be more beneficial if

493
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,159
we could figure out the root cause and a

494
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,240
way to test for it

495
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:43,919
to see why this is occurring and who

496
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,360
this is occurring in so that way people

497
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,479
if there's like some type of genetic

498
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,919
predisposition

499
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,440
we can figure it out sooner before

500
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:51,439
people go through you know months to

501
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,000
years of suffering

502
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,440
yeah and the thing that really kind of

503
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,679
stands out to me is that

504
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,759
you know as you as you mentioned in your

505
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:02,159
stories that you enjoyed cannabis

506
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
symptom-free for years um before

507
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,879
developing this condition so

508
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
i mean do we understand is there some

509
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,839
sort of

510
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,520
you know mechanism that flips that you

511
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:12,639
can no longer tolerate it i mean

512
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,639
obviously i think

513
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,679
as you said we still don't know but it

514
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,600
just

515
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,439
it seems interesting and not something i

516
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,678
can really think of happening with

517
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
any other allergy or condition or

518
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,959
syndrome

519
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,959
yeah it seems like it's just like a flip

520
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:29,120
that gets switched all of a sudden

521
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
your body just rejects it there's one

522
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:32,079
theory that too much cannabis can turn

523
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:35,119
off the trip 1

524
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,119
receptor the crpv1 receptor which is a

525
00:17:35,119 --> 00:17:39,038
receptor it's a capsaicin receptor that

526
00:17:37,119 --> 00:17:41,038
actually helps regulate digestion

527
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:42,960
and it's suggested that perhaps too much

528
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,000
cannabis can turn off that receptor in

529
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,640
some people

530
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,240
and the heat hot bath and capsaicin

531
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,679
cream on the stomach turn that receptor

532
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,640
back on because it's a capsaicin

533
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,720
receptor

534
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,679
so there is that theory that um

535
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,079
potentially that

536
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:57,919
receptor is what is getting shut down

537
00:17:56,079 --> 00:18:00,159
but you know that is just a theory and

538
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:03,440
we don't 100 know

539
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,720
yeah and so is there any sort of general

540
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,798
advice that

541
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,279
that folks are giving to you know sort

542
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:12,798
of prevent that if it is sort of like an

543
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:14,319
overload of that system in terms of

544
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:16,160
you know whether it's taking regular

545
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:17,200
breaks from cannabis to kind of reset

546
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,679
the receptors

547
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,120
i uh recently did a podcast with dr

548
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:24,000
dustin sulaku

549
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:25,839
who recommended that not in not for chs

550
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,400
specifically but just in general to you

551
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:28,000
know

552
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,080
take a break every now and then and that

553
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,558
you can actually see some regeneration

554
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,519
of

555
00:18:30,558 --> 00:18:34,720
um cb1 receptors in just 48 hours of

556
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,119
cessation so

557
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
is there any thought to maybe that being

558
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:40,479
a potential way to

559
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,919
prevent something like this absolutely

560
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,839
yeah i think everyone should take

561
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,320
cannabis breaks every now and then

562
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:47,759
just give your body a reset um yeah i

563
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:48,558
think that's very important and that's

564
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:50,798
something that i

565
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,720
rarely did is i didn't take breaks i was

566
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,279
consuming quite often

567
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,798
so i wish i would have taken more breaks

568
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:58,639
for sure and i think

569
00:18:56,798 --> 00:19:00,319
you know there's three phases to chs

570
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
there's the padronal phase which is

571
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:04,399
nausea and stomach aches then there's

572
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,440
the hyperemetic stage which is where the

573
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,960
people are throwing up

574
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,480
and then there's the recovery stage

575
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,079
which is when you're getting better so

576
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,440
if people hate that for dramaal stage

577
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,480
the beginning stage of it where they're

578
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,240
just feeling nauseous

579
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,839
that's definitely a key sign that they

580
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,440
should be taking a break and then

581
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,839
hopefully by taking a break they won't

582
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,720
ever get to the hypometic stage

583
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:23,678
oh interesting so is that something that

584
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,440
you know

585
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,919
will start happening like you'll feel

586
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,000
nauseous with one session and it sort of

587
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,080
goes away but you continue to use and it

588
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
progresses or does it all kind of

589
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:35,519
progress one after another it kind of

590
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,679
progresses generally

591
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:39,279
um and some people won't even experience

592
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,798
the padronal phase like i didn't

593
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,079
experience that phase i went straight to

594
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,879
the hyperometic phase

595
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,720
so this hits everyone differently

596
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,400
unfortunately like there isn't like a

597
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,759
real pattern with things it kind of is

598
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,038
like all over the place with how it's

599
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,279
gonna affect people

600
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:54,798
and another thing is it's usually not

601
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,519
immediately after smoking

602
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,639
it's usually about 24 hours after using

603
00:19:57,519 --> 00:20:00,400
so that's why it can be hard to

604
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,559
correlate that it's cannabis because

605
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,720
it's not always immediately after use

606
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,399
now once you get to the hypermedic phase

607
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,159
and you're like really bad off it can

608
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,679
happen immediately like right after you

609
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
smoke you're immediately sick but

610
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,640
generally

611
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,519
for people it's like 24 hours afterwards

612
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,200
which is really

613
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,599
why it's hard to correlate the fact that

614
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,798
it is cannabis making you sick

615
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:21,119
yeah and i think one of the things that

616
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,599
you had mentioned on that panel is

617
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,879
you know cannabis is largely accepted or

618
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:28,719
believed to be

619
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,440
kind of an anti-nausea remedy

620
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:33,839
so if what you're saying is that after

621
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,240
24 hours of using cannabis you could

622
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:39,119
start feeling nauseous

623
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,558
it's not um it could be a logical

624
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,319
response to be like hey i'll have some

625
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,079
cannabis to help relieve my nausea but

626
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:45,119
that could be the exact opposite of what

627
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,038
you should be doing

628
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,558
absolutely yeah a lot of people do use

629
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:50,000
cannabis to try to treat their symptoms

630
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,200
of chs and then they only make

631
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,720
themselves worse

632
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,919
and that's because they don't know about

633
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,839
chs and what's going on with their body

634
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,200
absolutely and then so i mean we're

635
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,079
talking about raising awareness

636
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,880
in in users but what about awareness

637
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,359
amongst

638
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,880
medical professionals and you know er

639
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:09,599
physicians for example

640
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,440
um you know what sort of efforts are

641
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:13,839
being done to kind of educate them on

642
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,279
on this condition so last year i worked

643
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,279
with the institute for safe medicine

644
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:19,038
practices in canada and we developed a

645
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:20,720
brochure to give out to

646
00:21:19,038 --> 00:21:22,400
people in emergency rooms all across

647
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,720
canada so

648
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,000
now i have canada down now it's next to

649
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,400
us try to

650
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,440
work on something similar in the united

651
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,960
states so

652
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,720
um you know i'm just one person here and

653
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,480
i don't get paid to do this so i try my

654
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,640
hardest to get things done but

655
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:38,960
so we at least educated um you know

656
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,360
physicians and emergency room doctors in

657
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,600
canada but there isn't a lot of efforts

658
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,439
being made in the united states and

659
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:47,439
i think there's two issues right now

660
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,120
either doctors don't know about chs

661
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,038
or doctors know about it and they're too

662
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:53,519
quick to diagnose people with it

663
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,038
so a lot of doctors can misdiagnose

664
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:56,558
people because they just ask the patient

665
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,158
like are you using cannabis

666
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:59,918
okay that's what's making you sick and

667
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,440
that person could potentially have other

668
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,799
underlying conditions that the doctor

669
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,480
doesn't want to test for because they

670
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,839
just want to put it straight to cannabis

671
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,839
and we're seeing that a lot and that

672
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,639
kind of um

673
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:12,079
makes people disbelieve in chs because

674
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,200
then they end up finding out that

675
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:14,480
there's something else going on with

676
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,159
them and so they're saying you know

677
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,038
doctors are just too quick to make this

678
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,799
up

679
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:21,200
so i think that there's like two issues

680
00:22:18,798 --> 00:22:22,960
at hand so we need to educate doctors on

681
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
it but we also need doctors to make sure

682
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,360
that they're ruling out every other

683
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,000
possibility before saying it chs

684
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,199
yeah that's a great point and now so i

685
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,480
guess in that

686
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,720
in that vein are there some symptoms

687
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,319
that are specific to chs that's sort of

688
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,880
a clear indicator that

689
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:42,240
that's what that's what this is finding

690
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,080
a relief from a hot bath

691
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,519
is one of the key indicators that

692
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:47,918
doctors use for diagnosis

693
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,839
because there isn't anything else that

694
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:52,000
really provides this kind of relief

695
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,359
i'm talking about like i was throwing up

696
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,038
excessively and i would get in the hot

697
00:22:53,359 --> 00:22:56,558
tub and i would stop completely and then

698
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:57,839
within seconds of getting out of the tub

699
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,879
i'd be throwing up again

700
00:22:57,839 --> 00:23:04,879
so it's really that like important

701
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,480
and just impactful the hot bath the heat

702
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,480
yeah i was like living on my bathroom

703
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,720
floor going between like throwing up in

704
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,000
the hot bath for quite some time

705
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,480
and you know that just leads to more

706
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,480
dehydration which is not good for you

707
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,679
um which you know there have been a few

708
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,519
deaths from chs

709
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
from dehydration and organ failure

710
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:22,079
because people are throwing up so

711
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,280
excessively and they don't know what's

712
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,038
going on with them

713
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,960
and they are treated properly and then

714
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,879
ultimately you know they have died

715
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:31,120
so there's been five reported deaths

716
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,880
total on chs

717
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,239
wow and so i mean

718
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,760
and i think you kind of touched on it

719
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,279
before but i don't know maybe we could

720
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,640
talk about it again but

721
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:42,399
yeah i mean what is it about the hot

722
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,320
bath specifically that

723
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,640
is providing the relief if we even know

724
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:49,759
or if there's a theory behind that

725
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,038
yeah so there is a theory about trpv1

726
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:52,640
receptor which i mentioned and then

727
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:55,200
there's also a theory about

728
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,559
body temperature regulation blood

729
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,120
temperature regulation

730
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:00,879
and i'm not too privy on that one so i

731
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:02,639
can't really speak on it too much but

732
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,640
there's just a few theories around going

733
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,559
around that but i think the trp v1 the

734
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,080
trip one receptor one is the one that

735
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:08,798
makes the most sense out of everything

736
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:10,720
i've read

737
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:12,240
that the hot bath turns that receptor

738
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,440
back on temporarily

739
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,440
and then when you get out of the hot

740
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,200
bath that receptor gets shut back off

741
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,240
and your body goes haywire

742
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,080
wow wow and then one of the other things

743
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,079
that uh you mentioned on the panel that

744
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:27,359
some folks get some relief with is

745
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,720
running which um the first thing

746
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:30,639
and the first thing that came to my mind

747
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,240
when i heard that was anandamide

748
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,440
you know could anandam be playing a role

749
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:36,798
but then i think the doctor on the panel

750
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,038
mentioned more about the temperature

751
00:24:36,798 --> 00:24:41,759
regulation aspect of that but

752
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:43,119
i'll let you speak to it yeah so running

753
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,038
is something that has helped

754
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:46,558
in a survey that i did there was only a

755
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:47,519
small amount of people who got relief

756
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:50,879
from running

757
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:53,038
um only i think like i don't know

758
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,559
like 10 of people found relief from

759
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,720
running but that still is

760
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:57,839
a percent that's like 33 people who

761
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:01,278
found relief from running

762
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:03,199
um and there was one study um documented

763
00:25:01,278 --> 00:25:04,319
case of someone getting rhabdomyolysis

764
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,038
from running so much

765
00:25:04,319 --> 00:25:09,359
someone ran for like 17 hours straight

766
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,240
and just um did his body dirty by just

767
00:25:09,359 --> 00:25:13,119
running so much

768
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,519
and his body just you know shut down on

769
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:17,439
him um he didn't die thankfully but he

770
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,839
got rhabdomyolysis from it

771
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,360
and yeah we don't really understand the

772
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:24,319
why behind it

773
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,479
um with my second episode i the one that

774
00:25:24,319 --> 00:25:29,119
lasted four days i got up and went for

775
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,720
like extensive walks every day and i

776
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,798
don't know if that helped at all

777
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,798
but i know that my episode only lasted

778
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:35,918
four days that time instead of the 14 or

779
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:37,359
16 days

780
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:39,278
so that could have had some type of

781
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,798
impact the moving around the changing of

782
00:25:39,278 --> 00:25:42,558
body temperature

783
00:25:40,798 --> 00:25:44,798
that could have helped with my um

784
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:47,278
symptoms

785
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:49,200
and so i want to ask you um so what is

786
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:52,000
your relationship with cannabis

787
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,798
now um is it still that you cannot

788
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,640
tolerate

789
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,798
any at all or is there any um

790
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,080
are there any cases of folks who have

791
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,558
chs who

792
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:03,199
are able to reintroduce cannabinoids or

793
00:26:02,558 --> 00:26:07,200
is it just

794
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,919
you know it's done so um from what i've

795
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,400
seen

796
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:12,080
people who reintroduce cannabinoids if

797
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,798
they have chs they do end up getting

798
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,399
sick again

799
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,558
but it's a matter of time it's not

800
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,720
always like immediate it could be after

801
00:26:16,558 --> 00:26:21,678
years or it could be after weeks

802
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,038
um but it the symptoms do come back but

803
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,480
a lot of people don't want to give up

804
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:26,000
cannabis as their medicine so they

805
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,839
figure out ways to use it lightly

806
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,319
whether that be just using like one hit

807
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:30,480
a day

808
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,000
one toke a week or something like that

809
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,558
and there's a lot of people who still

810
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
consume

811
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:35,759
and they just listen to their body when

812
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,120
the nausea starts to creep up they take

813
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:40,079
a cannabis break

814
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:41,038
i personally um my endocannabinoid

815
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:42,798
system is so

816
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:44,960
overdone that i can't even handle

817
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:46,158
secondhand smoke now so my friends can't

818
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,960
even smoke around me

819
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,559
or i will start to throw up and so i

820
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,640
can't use cannabis at all

821
00:26:50,558 --> 00:26:54,158
but i still work in the industry i'm

822
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,679
still extremely passionate about the

823
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,480
plant um i do pr

824
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:59,840
marketing and social media and um i

825
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,759
promote the plant and all of its

826
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,519
benefits and i love it so much

827
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,400
and i want to cure so that way i can go

828
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:08,400
back to using my medicine

829
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,000
no and i think that's an important um an

830
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,960
important thing to bring up again

831
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,960
because um like you said you experienced

832
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,840
some backlash talking out

833
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,798
about against excuse me you experienced

834
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,398
some backlash

835
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:24,960
speaking out about this issue and

836
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,079
oftentimes people you know are very

837
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,519
black and white when it comes to

838
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:30,480
cannabis it's either

839
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:32,240
it's either all good or it's all bad and

840
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,720
i think you're a great example of

841
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,599
you know acknowledging the bad and the

842
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,399
good and

843
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:40,240
you know having a very um level-headed

844
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,839
perspective on that so

845
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,519
yeah and i think something else that we

846
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:45,439
should touch base on is what happens

847
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:47,119
when somebody stops using cannabis

848
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,960
because that's also not talked about at

849
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:50,398
all you think you stop using cannabis

850
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,759
and then you're all better and that's

851
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,000
not necessarily true

852
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:55,759
people go through withdrawals so i had

853
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,919
extreme nightmares when i quit using

854
00:27:55,759 --> 00:28:00,000
cannabis my anxiety heightened

855
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,000
um and you know that could be because i

856
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,679
had pre-existing anxiety um but

857
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,278
i've talked to plenty of people who

858
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,480
didn't have pre-existing anxiety and

859
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,319
they quit using and

860
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,480
they had anxiety afterwards they had

861
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:12,558
loss of appetite sleep issues

862
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,079
agitation so there's a lot of things

863
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:15,519
that can go on mentally and physically

864
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:16,000
with the body when you quit using

865
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,319
cannabis

866
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,079
so it's not as cut and dry as oh you

867
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,678
have chs just quit using it's like

868
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:23,359
somebody can go through a lot of really

869
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,880
gnarly withdrawals um

870
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:26,639
and the industry likes to say that there

871
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,159
isn't any withdrawals from cannabis but

872
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,759
that's simply not true your body is

873
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,760
going through some changes you know

874
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,359
your body can be so positively in fact

875
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,000
impacted by cannabis when you're using

876
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,000
it like

877
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,359
when you take it away can't you imagine

878
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,759
that some things could be going on with

879
00:28:37,359 --> 00:28:41,278
your body then as well

880
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:43,519
absolutely and if everything we know

881
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:44,398
about the endocannabinoid system is that

882
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,200
you know it's

883
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:48,239
it's to promote homeostasis if you're

884
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,798
constantly

885
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,000
supplementing with cannabinoids um and

886
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:54,319
then you take those away

887
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,759
then there's gonna have to be kind of a

888
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:56,398
readjustment period it makes all the

889
00:28:55,759 --> 00:28:59,038
sense

890
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:00,479
in the world and so there's been so many

891
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:01,599
people who go back to using cannabis

892
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,200
because they don't want to deal with the

893
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,678
nightmares and the anxiety and all that

894
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,519
stuff

895
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,759
and so then you know it's a never-ending

896
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:09,359
cycle of like getting sick and

897
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:10,879
having to quit getting sick having to

898
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:14,879
quit and it just

899
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,720
quite simply it sucks yeah absolutely

900
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,000
um but it is good to hear that you know

901
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:21,278
some people who experience

902
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,720
this can still um can still use cannabis

903
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:27,519
in small doses or more manageable doses

904
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,038
and again i've i've spoken to to doctors

905
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:30,960
here on the podcast who

906
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,200
who say that a lot of patients can get a

907
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:37,120
lot of benefits from from low doses

908
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:39,200
of cannabinoids still um so hopefully

909
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:41,599
if um if folks who are really using

910
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,240
cannabis to to treat a

911
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:45,439
severe condition or it's the only thing

912
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
that works for them

913
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,720
there's still some hope that they can

914
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,200
continue to use it

915
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,399
yeah totally and um you know anyone

916
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
listening to this who thinks they might

917
00:29:52,398 --> 00:29:55,278
have chs

918
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:56,959
just listen to your body i think that's

919
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:58,319
really important if you are throwing up

920
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,919
all the time then definitely cut

921
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:01,439
cannabis out of your life but if you're

922
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,799
only feeling some nausea

923
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,480
and you're able to take breaks and then

924
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:06,558
reintroduce it like just

925
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:07,519
tread carefully and be very careful with

926
00:30:06,558 --> 00:30:08,960
it because

927
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,278
you don't want to go into a 14 day

928
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,919
episode like i wouldn't do

929
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:14,640
yeah absolutely and i know we sort of

930
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,720
talked about it

931
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,200
when we were we're asking if there was

932
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,720
any kind of correlation between

933
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,558
the experiences of people who have gone

934
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,600
through this but um i don't think we

935
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,480
talked specifically

936
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:28,719
of you know are there certain

937
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:29,839
formulations or certain forms of

938
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,360
cannabis that

939
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:33,038
that seem to trigger this more than

940
00:30:31,359 --> 00:30:36,079
others for example

941
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,798
you know smoking versus eating or

942
00:30:36,079 --> 00:30:40,639
you know high thc versus high cbd or is

943
00:30:38,798 --> 00:30:43,519
it sort of all across the board

944
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,038
so with my survey only three people were

945
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:46,720
edible users only

946
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,398
so that was surprising that only three

947
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,480
people were just using edibles the

948
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:52,319
majority of people were using cannabis

949
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,480
as the flower itself and the majority

950
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,158
were using it out of bongs

951
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,319
there was you know some people are using

952
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,240
dabs and bongs

953
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:02,558
some people using vapes as well but

954
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:05,038
majority of people were smoking flour

955
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:06,240
as far as if it was high thc low thd i

956
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,359
actually don't know the answer to that

957
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,599
question

958
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,199
i'm not sure but as far as if it was

959
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,359
pesticide free or not

960
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:16,159
there is about half of people who grew

961
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:18,398
their own and it was pesticide free

962
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,519
so and they still develop chs symptoms

963
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:21,518
so um

964
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,599
but half the people didn't know what if

965
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,079
their flower was pesticide free or not

966
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:26,319
um

967
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:28,000
so you know with legalization we'll see

968
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,359
more people who are like having access

969
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,038
to pesticide free flour

970
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:33,119
and so then they'll actually know what

971
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,798
they're getting but for now a lot of

972
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:36,479
people don't have safe access so they're

973
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:38,558
getting whatever they're getting but

974
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,679
i don't believe that pesticides are the

975
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,440
issue here at all

976
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:43,440
um i think if it was a pesticide problem

977
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,600
we'd see this a lot more widespread

978
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,600
and this has could occur with people

979
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:50,319
with synthetic cannabinoid use at all

980
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,918
um as well so that shows that it's like

981
00:31:50,319 --> 00:31:53,599
something to do with cannabinoids is the

982
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:56,640
root cause of this

983
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:59,278
wow wow so

984
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:01,360
so what's next for you and your um in

985
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,880
your goal to try to raise awareness here

986
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,719
um what's next i'm just going to keep

987
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:08,640
doing interviews i'm trying to spread

988
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,278
the word you know my next goal is to be

989
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,038
new york

990
00:32:09,278 --> 00:32:12,398
be in new york times that's like the

991
00:32:11,038 --> 00:32:13,919
ideal goal

992
00:32:12,398 --> 00:32:15,518
i was speaking with them last year

993
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,440
before covet hit and then when covet

994
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,640
became a thing that like cut that story

995
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,720
out of the picture but

996
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,399
that would be um my ultimate goal is to

997
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,278
get in new york times because that is a

998
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,199
story that

999
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,720
that would just reach a lot of people

1000
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:28,399
and i want to just keep

1001
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,480
reaching out to people talking to people

1002
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:31,759
connecting and educating and letting

1003
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,919
