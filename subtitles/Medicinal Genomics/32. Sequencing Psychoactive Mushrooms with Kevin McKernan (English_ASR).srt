episode's guest

59
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,799
needs no introduction kevin mckernan of

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,878
medicinal genomics is back

61
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,120
to talk about psilocybin and the

62
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:31,919
mushrooms that create it

63
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
kevin and the team at mgc have published

64
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:34,958
a highly

65
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,039
contiguous reference genome for

66
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:39,280
philosophy cubensis

67
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,799
which some listeners may know is the

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,000
species of mushroom

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,319
often referred to as the magic mushroom

70
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,280
kevin and the team have also sequenced

71
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,679
several different

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,318
mushroom strains to try and better

73
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,719
understand

74
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:53,759
the genes of interest and pathways

75
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:56,719
responsible

76
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,840
for psilocybin production if you're new

77
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,400
to psilocybin

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,039
and mushrooms don't worry we cover the

79
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,959
basics

80
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:04,158
as well as new findings in our

81
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,120
conversation

82
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:09,519
including potential therapeutic

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,680
applications for psilocybin

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,759
what is fueling the rapidly growing

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
interest in psilocybin

86
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:19,759
psilocybin's path towards legalization

87
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,039
other psychoactive compounds found in

88
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:23,759
mushrooms

89
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:25,439
how mushrooms are cultivated and bred

90
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:27,039
and what that means for applying

91
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,199
genomics

92
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,798
the discovery that there is more than

93
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:34,238
one way mushrooms

94
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,159
synthesize psilocybin and more

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,480
before we get to my conversation with

96
00:03:36,158 --> 00:03:39,598

medicine

108

the campaign

110
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,239

126
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:51,279
good afternoon kevin thanks for joining

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,120
us thanks for having me i know it's

128
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,519
uh it's really odd to have such an

129
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,959
outsider on your podcast

130
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:59,439
well it's funny you say that you were

131
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,000
the first guest on the podcast

132
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:02,639
and now you are the first repeat guest

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,759
on the part

134
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,400
podcast so uh congratulations on making

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,360
history

136
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,399
yeah yet again i try hard speaking of

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639
making history

138
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,679
you recently published a highly

139
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,680
contiguous

140
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:20,720
reference genome for the cilla psilocybe

141
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,840
cubensis is that i think so i used to

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,199
say that as well but i

143
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:24,319
the way i've heard people who are more

144
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,400
familiar with space than i am is they

145
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:28,478
call it philosophy

146
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,560
but i used to call it psilocybe as well

147
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:30,879
because psilocybin is probably what

148
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,959
you've

149
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,319
heard of that's the compound it makes

150
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:36,879
right okay so that's good

151
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,079
i wanted to lay some groundwork here in

152
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,159
terms of uh

153
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:41,519
terms for people who might not be as

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,120
familiar here so

155
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:48,478
silasippy is the genus of mushroom

156
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,680
yes correct and then silas b cubensis is

157
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,758
a species

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,360
of mushroom that's typically referred to

159
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,240
as the magic mushroom

160
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,080
yes that produces psilocybin which is

161
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
the psychoactive compound

162
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,318
that makes you trip yes and now to make

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,280
things more confusing there's also this

164
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,680
compound called

165
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,719
salocin okay so now you can trip over

166
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,959
that one too

167
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,160
yeah that was good so that was going to

168
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:13,680
be one of my questions

169
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
you say all five things fast is there

170
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,079
compounds in addition to psilocybin that

171
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,600
can create the psychoactive

172
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,839
effect so there is a uh a suggested

173
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,879
um entourage effect if you will that we

174
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:26,719
don't know

175
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
much about at the moment so i don't know

176
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,240
how psychoactive they are

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,918
um but there are certainly tryptamines

178
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,439
so there's other tryptamines in the in

179
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:34,478
the mushroom that are in the pathway

180
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:37,360
just like

181
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:38,719
in in cannabis where there is a livital

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
and then you get cbg

183
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,919
and then cbg gets folded into a variety

184
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,439
of other cannabinoids there's a similar

185
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,560
thing going on in in making these

186
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,399
tryptamines

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,120
is that there are precursors to

188
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:50,959
psilocybin which is silocin

189
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,160
and then in the pathway there's also

190
00:06:50,959 --> 00:06:54,318
these other different

191
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,759
methylations on the molecule much like

192
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,039
maybe different tails you might have on

193
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,080
cannabinoids that are

194
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,959
baiocysteine and origination and then

195
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:04,000
there's

196
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:05,359
narcilocin and norvaocystin so

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,279
there's there's a spectrum of these

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,680
things and i'd say we we mostly know

199
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,119
about

200
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,800
psilocybin and we do know the mushrooms

201
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,160
make a variety of these different

202
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,319
compounds

203
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,199
and we don't yet know which mushrooms

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,080
make how much of

205
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,598
each of them and what the um

206
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:24,399
contributions are

207
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,839
to the psychoactive effects so um

208
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:28,000
there's a lot to learn there another

209
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,519
thing that came out very recently

210
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
that people may not fully appreciate on

211
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:33,279
these mushrooms is they also make

212
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,038
monoamine oxidase inhibitors

213
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:36,638
this changes the metabolism of these

214
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:40,079
compounds in your stomach

215
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
and your liver so um that's kind of rare

216
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:43,279
in that

217
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,560
when you look at the story of other

218
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:46,559
beans like dmt

219
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,839
is quite known from in ayahuasca but

220
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
they actually have to mix

221
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,159
ayahuasca with some other plant that

222
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
makes a monovinoxidase in it

223
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,680
because because dmt itself doesn't get

224
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,680
through the gut

225
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,038
so the mushrooms figured out a couple

226
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,959
different tricks here it's figured out

227
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,719
how to phosphorylate salocine into

228
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,839
psilocybin so that it can get through

229
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,319
your gi

230
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,839
uh it's also figured out um how to make

231
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,759
these other monoamine oxidase inhibitors

232
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:12,159
to alter your liver metabolism

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,759
so that more of these things get through

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
so there's there's there's a lot going

235
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,598
on

236
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,120
inside this tiny little genome and uh

237
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:21,120
that's what i think piqued your interest

238
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,680
it has shares a lot of the same

239
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,199
similarities to canvas and that uh one

240
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,400
molecule was getting all the credit when

241
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,639
there's probably more

242
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,918
and it looks like it's probably going to

243
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,918
be going medical soon

244
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,439
at least it's recreationally approved in

245
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,679
several jurisdictions including three

246
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,279
here in massachusetts

247
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,359
and we in order to understand

248
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:42,879
which mushrooms make these other

249
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
entourage effects

250
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:45,759
we wanted to just go do a huge survey

251
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,278
and all the mushrooms out there to

252
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,399
figure out if we could find genetics

253
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,439
that altered

254
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,759
the the expression of these things

255
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
so that's kind of where it started okay

256
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
and so it seems like interest in

257
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,760
psilocybin

258
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:02,640
is at an all-time high now so what

259
00:08:59,759 --> 00:09:05,278
what's what's fueling this interest well

260
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,879
there's several things i think um

261
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,720
the mo the best work on this is out of

262
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:11,838
johns hopkins looking at cancer

263
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,959
related depression um however at canmed

264
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
i kept meeting people

265
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:17,119
um that have also seen some remarkable

266
00:09:15,278 --> 00:09:18,720
effects in cancer like glioblastoma i

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,360
think bonnie goldstein told me about one

268
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
case that responded to psilocybin for

269
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,800
a glioblastoma that was not responding

270
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,480
to cannabis uh which is kind of

271
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,679
fascinating i don't i don't understand

272
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,360
the pathway and why

273
00:09:27,679 --> 00:09:33,359
but um they are neurogenerative so they

274
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,839
they do have the capacity

275
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,278
to uh you know reprogram this default

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,519
mode network in your brain

277
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,720
and uh they seem to have a lot of the

278
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,759
properties of cbd and that they're

279
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,399
neuroplastic they help

280
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:45,919
to help regenerate neurons so um they're

281
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,080
looking at this i think for beyond just

282
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:51,278
depression but probably ptsd

283
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,800
and maybe even brain injuries so um

284
00:09:51,278 --> 00:09:54,320
that works really exciting that when you

285
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,479
look at the work in depression

286
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
um it seems to be more promising than

287
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,759
cannabinoids in many ways in that and

288
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,360
and johns hopkins they're doing like

289
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:02,240
three treatments and getting like over

290
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,240
70

291
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,639
success rates and then it's like

292
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,440
permanent it's not like this chronic

293
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:11,679
you must be on cbd the rest of your life

294
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
type of thing for ptsd

295
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,239
or thc whatever it may be whatever can

296
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,159
happen but what you tend to see with the

297
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,560
cannabinoids is folks tend to be using

298
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,399
those

299
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:20,159
consistently to manage the effects

300
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,919
whereas the data that you're seeing

301
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:25,919
with um psilocybin is that three guided

302
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,120
treatments these are therapies that are

303
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,679
monitored with

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
we know the professionals and they have

305
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,159
a

306
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,159
massive success rate on turning around

307
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:35,600
uh depression so that's

308
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,519
that's unique you know you don't see

309
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,639
that in a lot of other antidepressants

310
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,278
it's kind of like you're on them for

311
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:42,159
life

312
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,360
and um i'm curious if that's one reason

313
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:46,958
why it's not getting a whole lot of

314
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:49,839
attention to the pharmaceuticals

315
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:52,000
but that said there was a recent article

316
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,040
in new england journal of medicine

317
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,039
that was comparing um psilocybin

318
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,480
with it wasn't fluoxetine but it was a

319
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,559
similar ssri

320
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,920
which is a cert selective serotonin

321
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,599
reuptake inhibitor so these are the

322
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:04,639
traditional tricycle antidepressants

323
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,079
that are out there

324
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:08,240
and there are some drawbacks to those

325
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:09,679
ones i some of my earliest work in

326
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,680
this field at emory was on those

327
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:13,039
compounds and they're not as serotonin

328
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:15,439
selective as you think

329
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:17,679
and they come with all types of labels

330
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,720
such as suicidal ideation so

331
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:21,278
those are a little frightening when

332
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,560
you're trying to treat suicidal ideation

333
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:24,240
and one of the

334
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:26,319
side effects and label is suicidal

335
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,759
ideation you're you're kind of

336
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,360
putting the patient a little bit of a

337
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,958
catch-22 there as to whether or not this

338
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,720
drug is going to work for them

339
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:36,159
so um that i i'm not seeing that with

340
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,160
psilocybin granted certainly we don't

341
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:40,078
have really these you know randomized

342
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:42,719
control trials that might that might

343
00:11:40,078 --> 00:11:43,278
find that but um there is certainly a

344
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,160
lot of

345
00:11:43,278 --> 00:11:47,759
um i think human population use of these

346
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:49,600
things at least like like cannabis

347
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:51,439
uh we have you know hundreds if not

348
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,959
thousands of years of human experience

349
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,360
dosing with these things that

350
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:57,439
um the the toxicology on this is

351
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,480
understood it's they're not toxic

352
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:02,000
uh in fact i've even seen some evidence

353
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
i'll have to find a good citation for

354
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,679
this but generally lsd

355
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,278
and psilocybin are thought to be less

356
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:08,719
toxic than even the cannabinoids if you

357
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:10,559
can believe that

358
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,920
like there's just not overdoses with

359
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:13,199
these things you might do stupid things

360
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,319
on them right but they're not

361
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
they're not chemically toxic um so what

362
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
about

363
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,240
what about lasting effects you hear

364
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,320
people who who trip and they're

365
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,680
never the same i know i know i don't i

366
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
don't have i'm not good

367
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,599
resource on that that's probably um i

368
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,079
bet johns hopkins has better data

369
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,519
on what some of these chronic conditions

370
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,399
and flashbacks and other things that you

371
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,200
hear about may

372
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,720
um may play a role in because there's

373
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,000
certainly the same type of

374
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,079
conundrum we have looking at

375
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,679
schizophrenia in cannabis and looking at

376
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:43,359
you know mental illness with with these

377
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:46,239
psychedelics is that

378
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,680
um they attract a lot of people who have

379
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,159
a mental illness and are seeking to

380
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:50,399
treat it

381
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,078
and oftentimes you don't know whether

382
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,958
the compound helped or accelerated it

383
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,039
right right

384
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,638
so um that though those need good

385
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:57,120
randomized control trials to really sort

386
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,240
out but

387
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,679
um uh that that's uh there's certainly

388
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,919
that issue with the current treatment

389
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:07,278
status that we have with ssris i mean

390
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:09,278
you see a lot of these uh unfortunately

391
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,200
when you hear about a lot of these um

392
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:12,559
you know gun effects in the united

393
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,959
states where there's you know kids that

394
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,479
are

395
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,159
running around shooting up schools it's

396
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:20,079
quite frequently they're on ssris

397
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,838
and so um there's there's a lot to be um

398
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,120
i think reckoned with here that that the

399
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,200
current treatments we have

400
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,799
aren't clean of those things either and

401
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,320
so we need to be looking at things that

402
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:30,240
are non-toxic and be giving these

403
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,200
alternatives a chance

404
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,720
yeah another thing that you had

405
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,600
mentioned there is when you were talking

406
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,240
about

407
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,040
three treatments that could kind of

408
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,240
eliminate

409
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:42,399
symptoms you mentioned guided um

410
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,440
treatments under the supervision of a

411
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,278
professional i was

412
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,399
wondering if you could do that i don't

413
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:47,439
know what those are i have not

414
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,278
experienced one so

415
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,040
um that's probably a better question for

416
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,958
um we'll have to find somebody uh

417
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:55,360
who has more experiences yeah and maybe

418
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,399
just in general like why is it

419
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:01,360
why is that more um

420
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,159
prudent in this type of therapeutic i i

421
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,440
think they're so

422
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:08,480
they're such powerful compounds um that

423
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,560
uh somebody who has a bad experience

424
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,000
with them probably needs a sober person

425
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,958
next to them to help talk them off the

426
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,120
ledge so to speak

427
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,039
uh and that's the intent there is that

428
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,078
the dosages that they're using for these

429
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:20,559
types of

430
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:21,198
um you know reversing depression almost

431
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,759
permanently

432
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,319
are up in the using one to three grams

433
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:25,919
of these

434
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,000
uh mushrooms which if they're one

435
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:30,639
percent uh psilocybin

436
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,320
these things get up into um what does

437
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,839
that put a set if it's three grams it's

438
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,040
one percent it's like 30 milligrams of

439
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,079
pure compound

440
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:38,719
um these uh you know there's also a

441
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:41,439
whole

442
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,879
um interest in microdosing these things

443
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,720
which is a completely different

444
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,838
scenario this is not putting yourself

445
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,800
into the point where you start to

446
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,560
hallucinate

447
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:50,319
this is just getting a you know a

448
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:51,919
serotonin agonist in your system

449
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,920
that is a bit more stimulant and many

450
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:55,439
people are reporting that they have

451
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,799
more productivity on these things that

452
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,240
they're better for computer programming

453
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:58,879
we have these waves out in silicon

454
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,360
valley where

455
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:02,879
there seems to be a you know this

456
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,120
popularity and and

457
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:06,720
and utilizing these things for for

458
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,399
almost as a performance-enhancing drug

459
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,680
not necessarily for sports but for

460
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,679
um for getting work done so i don't

461
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:15,198
think that's necessarily getting guided

462
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,638
yeah i think that's that's self-guided

463
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:18,159
but i think when you get into the stage

464
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,720
where you start getting dissociative

465
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,838
effects

466
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
um there it's as a safety side of the

467
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,760
equation they probably won't have

468
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,920
someone else around

469
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,078
yeah that makes sense and now in the

470
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,879
whole idea of micro dosing now is that

471
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,519
psilocybin um specifically or some of

472
00:15:30,879 --> 00:15:33,439
these other

473
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,600
psychoactive compounds i think i'm

474
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,480
hearing of it another with lsd and with

475
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,278
psilocybin

476
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,159
and um i think it probably spans the

477
00:15:39,278 --> 00:15:42,958
gamut but

478
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:44,399
um you know my dipping my toe in there

479
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:45,758
just to talking to people it seems as if

480
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,039
mushrooms are quite popular for that

481
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,159
just because of their

482
00:15:47,039 --> 00:15:50,000
uh there's some slightly different

483
00:15:48,159 --> 00:15:51,519
pharmacology to those in lsdl which is

484
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,879
externally potent

485
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,560
and the receptor biology there is i

486
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:58,159
probably need a refresher on but this is

487
00:15:56,559 --> 00:16:01,278
the civil side is mostly hitting

488
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:05,360
serotonin five it's 5ht2a

489
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:08,720
and lsd may tickle a few others

490
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,720
okay so we've talked a bit about the

491
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,560
you know therapeutic uses for for

492
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:15,199
psilocybin and you mentioned that you

493
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:17,599
know it's legalizing it in more states

494
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,039
how do you see the legalization of

495
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,440
psilocybin

496
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,439
um what's the path there and how similar

497
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,600
is it to what we've seen with cannabis

498
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040
i think it's going to proceed faster

499
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,480
than cannabis because it can go in the

500
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:30,480
wake of cannabis

501
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,920
it can follow the same model it can go

502
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,839
through and

503
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:35,360
effectively utilize the same all right

504
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,959
let's get medical out first and then

505
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,879
perhaps there'll be a recreational

506
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:40,239
component to this later

507
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:42,000
much of the legislation for doing

508
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,720
dispensaries is already in place and

509
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,399
people know how to

510
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,000
use that playbook so we've already seen

511
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,839
oregon go completely recreational i

512
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,039
should say recreation decriminalized on

513
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:52,560
an organ i think berkeley oakland denver

514
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,919
cambridge somerville and northampton

515
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:55,039
here in massachusetts have all done it

516
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:56,559
there's i think there's some rumblings

517
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,078
of other jurisdictions as well maybe in

518
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,638
dc and a few others

519
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,078
um so it seems as if it is moving at a

520
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,198
bit of a faster pace than cannabis

521
00:17:02,078 --> 00:17:04,879
originally did where we you know we

522
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:07,279
first saw cannabis

523
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,959
uh you know back when the hiv epidemic

524
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:10,558
just started with a medical campaign and

525
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,078
it took you know almost a decade for

526
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:12,558
more of that to spread whereas we're

527
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:15,198
seeing

528
00:17:12,558 --> 00:17:15,838
the psilocybin motion go rampant very

529
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,600
quickly i think

530
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,958
canada is probably taking the lead here

531
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,678
they seem to have moved

532
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,558
moved ahead much faster than anyone else

533
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
so

534
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:25,918
i'm hopeful it'll move much quicker now

535
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,600
exactly how it's going to roll in the

536
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,799
marketplace is a good question that

537
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,480
you know i i don't see the um

538
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:33,599
you know cannabis flour is still half

539
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,319
the market and you have all these other

540
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:35,839
edibles

541
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,359
and extracts and i don't think that's

542
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:39,199
going to go away because there's just

543
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,279
you know a connoisseur of people who

544
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,200
like terpenes and like the the

545
00:17:41,279 --> 00:17:44,319
experience of smoking flour

546
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,200
i don't know that we have that with

547
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:49,439
chewing these mushrooms

548
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,558
i think not it's not shiitake it's

549
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,840
probably going to go more into an

550
00:17:50,558 --> 00:17:55,440
extract mode

551
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:57,678
or capsules or teas who knows but

552
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,360
um there's certainly a different um

553
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,798
bearer to entry as it comes

554
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,839
when it comes to growing these things i

555
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:03,359
think if you want to get involved

556
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,798
growing cannabis

557
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:06,479
if it's indoor there's quite a setup

558
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:07,918
involved there to get lights and

559
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,519
everything and you know maybe a hydro

560
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,679
and everything else involved

561
00:18:09,519 --> 00:18:13,519
outdoors perhaps you know you set it and

562
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
forget it outside and hope for the best

563
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:16,558
but

564
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,240
um it certainly takes more like you know

565
00:18:16,558 --> 00:18:18,720
eight to twelve weeks to get something

566
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,798
off of

567
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,480
cannabis plant whereas these mushrooms

568
00:18:20,798 --> 00:18:24,960
can grow in like two months

569
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,240
in a tupperware bin in your basement you

570
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,880
know this is not something that

571
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
is the barrier to entry is much lower on

572
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,360
this so there may be more people trying

573
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,400
to homegrow these

574
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:36,000
much like beer than you might see with

575
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,038
cannabis that requires lots of lights

576
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,558
and you know the

577
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:40,400
growing cannabis in your house everyone

578
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:41,759
knows just stinks up your whole house

579
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,679
very hard to deal with that if you if

580
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:45,200
you want to keep it discreet

581
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,440
that's not the case with some of these

582
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,798
um folks who like to cultivate these

583
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:51,279
things on their own so i think there

584
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,200
still will be a homegrown market

585
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:54,798
and uh you know a dispensary based

586
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,000
market for these things and then there's

587
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,798
also progress moving

588
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,480
on the therapeutic side through the fda

589
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,679
many people are optimistic that we'll

590
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,599
see

591
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,440
mdma probably through through a

592
00:19:03,599 --> 00:19:07,439
successful trial this year and maybe get

593
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,840
some advancement the fda has designated

594
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,960
this as a breakthrough therapy

595
00:19:09,839 --> 00:19:12,798
so that means it's going to have an

596
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,558
accelerated path through the fda and i

597
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,599
think once the fda has some approved

598
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:17,918
versions of this

599
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,599
that will help guide the folks in the

600
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:20,720
nutraceutical side of what to do and how

601
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,399
to apply it now there'll probably be

602
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,279
some labeling constraints that fda is

603
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,120
not going to want to see the

604
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,558
dispensaries or the nutraceutical side

605
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:27,678
making medical claims on whatever

606
00:19:26,558 --> 00:19:30,798
they're selling

607
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,720
but um they're i think that's going to

608
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,240
very much

609
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,079
lead the charge that when you start

610
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
seeing the fda versions of these things

611
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,918
roll out it's going to give many of the

612
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,279
physicians a whole lot more comfort and

613
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:42,559
it's going to give i think better

614
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:43,359
guidance as to how these should be

615
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:46,480
handled in

616
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,959
um on the dispensary side of things i

617
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,400
was

618
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,919
hoping we could talk a bit more about

619
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,360
the cultivation of this because it like

620
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,360
you said it is very different

621
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:55,279
from cannabis and i'm thinking from a

622
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,918
genomic side too

623
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:59,519
um how does the difference in the

624
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,280
cultivation of

625
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:03,839
these mushrooms kind of affect how

626
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:05,279
genomics could be used for breeding or

627
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:06,639
purpose that's a really good question

628
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:08,240
that's one reason why we set about

629
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
sequencing all these genomes is just to

630
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,798
figure out like

631
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,480
how is this market going to be different

632
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:13,759
cannabis is so diverse that every time

633
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,038
you make a cross you're kind of

634
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:16,480
you're playing you're gambling with a

635
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:18,960
new game which is kind of fun you get

636
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,000
new genetics of your cross

637
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,038
most of the market here seems to be

638
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
propagating asexually derived spores so

639
00:20:25,038 --> 00:20:28,158
there's actually a little bit more

640
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,159
clonal consistency so when when we

641
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:32,720
when we sequence the first 80 genomes

642
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,720
here um we did it all with spores

643
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,759
so don't so you can ship spores legally

644
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,600
which is really bizarre because you

645
00:20:35,759 --> 00:20:39,038
can't ship cannabis seats likely

646
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,798
uh well maybe you can do the hemp seeds

647
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,200
now but but in the past there

648
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:43,839
you couldn't you know and now with

649
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,840
spores

650
00:20:43,839 --> 00:20:47,199
they're legal for taxonomic purchase

651
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:49,519
because there's no um

652
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,640
you can't detect any silicon in them so

653
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:52,158
you know if anyone gets caught with

654
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,520
spores they ultimately test to see

655
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,720
there's if there's scheduled compounded

656
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:57,839
and there isn't

657
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,440
um so i've heard from some people though

658
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,079
this is an illegal opinion so don't bank

659
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,279
on this but from

660
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:03,519
some people that you can actually

661
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:05,359
culture them with

662
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:06,798
minimal mediums they don't express any

663
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:08,798
stylus item if you want to do like you

664
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:10,639
know some mycology stuff but

665
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:12,960
for our purposes we don't need to we can

666
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,960
we can get enough dna out of spores and

667
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,558
sequence their whole genome from them

668
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,798
so typically what happens is people will

669
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:21,200
get spores from either a spore print or

670
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,879
from a syringe where they'll put the

671
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,440
spores in some kind of liquid media so

672
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,159
they're in

673
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,798
a 10 10 ml syringe and then they'll

674
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,000
inject that

675
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:32,400
into a sterilized bag of grains these

676
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:35,279
things love to grow in grains

677
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,960
and that has to be a very very pure

678
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:38,639
injection if there's any bacteria around

679
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
the bacteria like we experienced

680
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:43,919
doing all this plating and stuff with

681
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,440
on the cannabis microbial detection

682
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,038
front if there's any bacteria around it

683
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,759
doubles every like 30 minutes and the

684
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:50,000
mold can

685
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,359
can take you know a month to grow so the

686
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240
bacteria can like take over the thing

687
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:54,639
and destroy it

688
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,640
but the goal is to get a spawn bag that

689
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,679
is grown with mycelium from this thing

690
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,520
from the spores

691
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,798
and that takes maybe a month and then

692
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:03,440
once that's done

693
00:22:00,798 --> 00:22:04,319
you immerse that grain that's got a full

694
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
mycelium

695
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:08,240
grown throughout it you dunk it in water

696
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,000
for 24 hours to simulate like a

697
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,759
rainstorm

698
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,759
pull it out and put it in a humidity

699
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,359
chamber for in a few weeks you have lots

700
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:17,200
of mushrooms

701
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:18,719
so i think the key the key aspects are

702
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,200
making sure that there is

703
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:22,558
absolutely clean spores going in and

704
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,679
that's one thing we did notice we did

705
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:25,599
use some of our

706
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,038
pcr tools that we have here to look for

707
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,678
total aerobic count inside of these

708
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,759
things

709
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,960
and we saw many of the different spores

710
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,879
that were provided had

711
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,558
high levels of attack and those tended

712
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,280
to have you know they gave us more

713
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:37,038
sequencing

714
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,798
i don't know how well they grow but i've

715
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:40,480
heard from people that growing those can

716
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,679
be complicated if there's any bacteria

717
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,679
around

718
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,360
but we can gauge which ones that we can

719
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,720
get clean genomes from just

720
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,439
up front by looking at how much

721
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,640
bacterial to fungal dna is around and by

722
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
looking at that ratio

723
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
we can say okay this one's got a lot

724
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,240
more with dna and bacterial dna use that

725
00:22:54,798 --> 00:22:57,599
one for sequencing this one's got too

726
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,798
much bacteria don't sequence it or

727
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:00,480
you'll get a metagenome

728
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,720
but that was probably in like 20 to 30

729
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
percent of the spores that we collected

730
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,079
we threw out or or when we sequenced it

731
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,400
we realized that they were dirty

732
00:23:06,079 --> 00:23:09,759
and they gave us dirtier results so um

733
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,919
now would that be like in

734
00:23:09,759 --> 00:23:13,038
a beneficial upfront screening tool for

735
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
whether or not you were going to it

736
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:16,879
might be yeah

737
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,599
it might be i would imagine um as you

738
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,360
scale this

739
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:22,079
up a lot of people are growing these in

740
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,399
compartmentalized um

741
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,839
boxes for that reason because if they

742
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,880
get a bacterial contaminant they don't

743
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,480
want it to go everywhere

744
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,480
and so they break them up into small

745
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,759
bins but um

746
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,000
even so how they're how they're mad

747
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,200
getting those spores i i would imagine

748
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,640
to scale this up

749
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,840
syringes probably don't scale they

750
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,278
probably have to put the syringes into

751
00:23:39,839 --> 00:23:42,399
some type of liquid culture and grow a

752
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,679
huge culture and then spread that

753
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,038
everywhere but you would want to monitor

754
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,919
that large culture to make sure that

755
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:47,759
there's no

756
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,120
bacterial contamination in there there

757
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:50,640
are some folks a little concerned about

758
00:23:49,119 --> 00:23:51,839
putting antibiotics in the mix too

759
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
because the antibiotics

760
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:55,519
sometimes slow down the growth of the

761
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,798
mycelium and at the same time they don't

762
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,440
want it to get absorbed into the

763
00:23:56,798 --> 00:23:58,960
mushrooms

764
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,360
and then people start eating you know

765
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,720
gentamicin labeled uh

766
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:05,119
mushrooms so they're trying to do this

767
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,919
without adding any antibiotics which is

768
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,439
it means you probably have to be very

769
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,840
very sterile in the process

770
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,840
and maybe even monitor for bacterial

771
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,119
load throughout the process

772
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,038
you you brought up an interesting point

773
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:19,278
in the genomics of this which is

774
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:21,278
um this works really well in cubensis

775
00:24:19,278 --> 00:24:22,640
but cubensis isn't the only species that

776
00:24:21,278 --> 00:24:24,558
makes these things there's about 200

777
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,640
different mushrooms that make psilocybin

778
00:24:24,558 --> 00:24:28,480
there's even one that infects cicadas

779
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,278
that makes them hypersexual and spread

780
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,319
the spores

781
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,640
every 16 years um and yeah yeah so

782
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:34,079
there's

783
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,000
it's called masapora which is really

784
00:24:34,079 --> 00:24:38,558
interesting one it infects the cicada

785
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,119
and then starts making um psilocybin

786
00:24:38,558 --> 00:24:41,440
inside

787
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:42,239
the cicada so that it goes crazy and and

788
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,000
ends up getting

789
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,359
bisexual and hypersexual and starts

790
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,839
spreading its spores everywhere instead

791
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:50,558
of like an orgy fashion

792
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:52,399
and that's a that one's a really bizarre

793
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:54,480
genome it's like 600 megabases which is

794
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,960
much larger than the 45 megabase genomes

795
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
we see

796
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,880
with cubensis but what we're trying to

797
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,919
look at by

798
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,799
by sequencing outside of the cubensis

799
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,799
species uh is to see do they all make

800
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:08,158
psilocybin in the same way

801
00:25:06,798 --> 00:25:10,720
there's been some great work out there

802
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:13,760
by jason slaat's lab and

803
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,880
reynolds and frick and huffmeister

804
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:17,038
these are all folks who have published

805
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,039
in this area um

806
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,319
that have noticed that a lot of the

807
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:22,879
psilocybin

808
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:24,000
um synthesis genes are all clustered

809
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,679
together they're all in this tight

810
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,319
little 20 kb region in the genome and

811
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,960
that seems to

812
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:30,319
horizontally transfer to other mushrooms

813
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,440
there's also been some

814
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:33,119
evidence that they're not always

815
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,720
clustered together and and some of these

816
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,439
other mushrooms that the the pathway is

817
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,079
a little bit more

818
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:39,600
separated and we don't know why um but

819
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:41,119
they're also diverged enough from a

820
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,278
sequencing standpoint that the primers

821
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:44,239
that we use in the juventus front

822
00:25:43,278 --> 00:25:46,159
probably aren't going to work really

823
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,038
well when you go into tampanensis or

824
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,159
when you go into a

825
00:25:47,038 --> 00:25:52,000
xero sense or mexicana

826
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,520
these are all these other types of

827
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,119
mushrooms that make

828
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,158
they're all philosophy and there's a

829
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:56,879
couple that are even outside of

830
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,760
philosophy

831
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
that make psilocybin but they are

832
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,240
sequent from a sequence standpoint

833
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,079
they're diverged enough

834
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,359
that the primaries we use to target

835
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:07,038
these genes in the

836
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:08,959
cubensis are probably not going to work

837
00:26:07,038 --> 00:26:10,319
on those so

838
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,000
that's different than the cannabis run

839
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:13,678
the canister we can pretty much although

840
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,759
it's very polymorphic we can make

841
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,519
primers that hit thc and cbd

842
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:19,200
and and these genes pretty readily once

843
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:20,720
we have a good map of like 40 or 50

844
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,240
genomes we can target that throughout

845
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
the population without tripping over too

846
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,558
many

847
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,159
the differences but the differences that

848
00:26:24,558 --> 00:26:28,399
we're seeing even amongst the cubensis

849
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,520
lines is probably a variant every 150

850
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,320
bases

851
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:33,599
what we see in the hemp front is you get

852
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:35,119
about a variant every

853
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,959
50 bases if you compare it to something

854
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:38,479
like jamaican lion it's probably about

855
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,278
every hundred bases when you compare it

856
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,759
amongst uh

857
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:43,278
drug-type cultivars like all type ones

858
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:44,558
so there's more polymorphism there's

859
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:46,640
more it's more repetitive in the

860
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,798
cannabis front but the genes that are

861
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,240
responsible for making cannabinoids are

862
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,759
really conserved

863
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,278
whereas you get into the philosophy

864
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:55,519
front and it is

865
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,200
not just stuck into cannabis sativa that

866
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,839
makes it it's you see this like

867
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,519
philosophy multiple different species of

868
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:03,278
philosophy that actually make this and

869
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:04,798
so they're much more diverse than what

870
00:27:03,278 --> 00:27:06,640
we see in cannabis

871
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:07,839
which means the genomics in many ways is

872
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,840
more complicated

873
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:10,959
but the propagation of it is much more

874
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,158
simple they're not there aren't people

875
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
doing these crosses

876
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,840
not yet it can be done but most people

877
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,960
are just asexually reproducing these

878
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:19,278
spores

879
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,960
and um and and then when they see one

880
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,679
particular mushroom that produces a

881
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,558
really like

882
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:25,840
large mushroom cap it grabs wars from

883
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:27,200
those and try and repeat the process

884
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,959
because maybe there's a mutation in that

885
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,080
one that that means it produces a lot

886
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
more yield

887
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:33,199
that's kind of how the game is going now

888
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,558
but there isn't this like i'm not seeing

889
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,120
a lot of people take different mushrooms

890
00:27:34,558 --> 00:27:36,240
and cross

891
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,479
them very much to try and get new

892
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,759
varietals that seems to be um

893
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,519
probably only very few people in the

894
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,000
world that know how to do it right and

895
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:44,000
so

896
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,159
it's not uh most people are just hoping

897
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,720
for for mutations inside the batch that

898
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:49,278
they have

899
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,240
and then try to propagate those so it's

900
00:27:49,278 --> 00:27:51,919
it's a different game

901
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,880
um but i think genomics is going to play

902
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,840
a role we're already seeing some

903
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,520
benefits uh

904
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,879
in and that we're finding variants that

905
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,398
are in the pathway that we think are

906
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:01,120
responsible for certain

907
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,000
cultivars or strains i should say um

908
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,158
having

909
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,798
um and there's there's a complicated

910
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,880
word it is a strain in this strategy

911
00:28:06,798 --> 00:28:12,798
yes not cultivars uh and varietals they

912
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,360
don't think are yet appropriate because

913
00:28:12,798 --> 00:28:16,639
varietals kind of um imply you've

914
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:17,759
stabilized the genetics and no one's

915
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:19,360
doing that yet

916
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:22,079
uh what is kind of interesting about

917
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:24,719
them is is if you read about how people

918
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,759
do cross them as they put different

919
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,880
things down on plates and grow maybe we

920
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:30,000
can back up for a second here because

921
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:33,039
i'm not sure i fully

922
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,599
understand it so explain how

923
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:36,720
a mushroom does reproduce asexually

924
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,558
first

925
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,798
it's got two life cycles one life cycle

926
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:41,678
is um when it makes a fruiting body it's

927
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:42,960
making a cap

928
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:45,360
like the mushroom that you see and those

929
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,640
are asexually reproduced spores

930
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,519
however there is a part of the life

931
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,080
cycle where these things form

932
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:54,158
clamps so when two mycelium grow into

933
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:55,918
each other from two genetically unique

934
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,399
uh mushrooms and then they're all the

935
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,120
same species us

936
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:01,759
essentially it's like the root system

937
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:03,759
yeah okay

938
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,359
so these things if they have compatible

939
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:07,200
mating types which is

940
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:08,959
and something that we have not yet

941
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
identified we have some hunches as to

942
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,399
where the genome the mating type is but

943
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,558
this is kind of like in cannabis there's

944
00:29:12,398 --> 00:29:16,639
an x and y chromosome well in fungi they

945
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,079
have mating mating types which aren't

946
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,159
limited there's there could be a much

947
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,000
bigger spectrum of gender if you will

948
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:23,679
right so you can have many you have more

949
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,440
than just a versus be mating type some

950
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,080
fungi have you know thousands of mating

951
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,519
types

952
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:29,278
if they're compatible mating types

953
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,278
they'll form a clamp connection which is

954
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,880
two mycelium that kind of like

955
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:34,319
um kind of it's kind of like a usb port

956
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,039
coming together and they can trade a

957
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:37,759
nuclei

958
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:39,359
and when they do that you end up with a

959
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,599
a new part of the mycelium which is

960
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,439
dikaryotic it has two nuclei in it which

961
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:44,798
are now two different genomes together

962
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,640
and then there can be a stage of its

963
00:29:44,798 --> 00:29:47,359
life cycle where those things go through

964
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
meiosis

965
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,119
and they exchange most people aren't

966
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,480
doing that they're not

967
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,398
taking two different things putting

968
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,159
together and using a microscope to find

969
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:57,519
if they make clamp connections

970
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,200
when they don't have compatible mating

971
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:00,639
types they usually will grow

972
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,319
and then they'll be like you can see a

973
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,000
visual barrier between the colonies like

974
00:30:02,319 --> 00:30:05,759
they won't grow into each other as it's

975
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,798
the mating types are usually pheromones

976
00:30:05,759 --> 00:30:08,398
and the pheromones

977
00:30:06,798 --> 00:30:09,839
are usually if they're compatible

978
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,359
pheromones then they'll grow into each

979
00:30:09,839 --> 00:30:12,558
other and you'll get clamps and

980
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,398
clamp connections and if they're not

981
00:30:12,558 --> 00:30:16,079
they'll kind of grow and they'll be like

982
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:16,479
a colony exclusion zone there where they

983
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:20,158
don't

984
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,558
actually dmz or dmz or they don't touch

985
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,679
and so um there are there are a few

986
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:24,558
people out there that know how to do

987
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,960
this they're rare

988
00:30:24,558 --> 00:30:28,398
but um that they're they're some are

989
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,519
even trying to cross things across

990
00:30:28,398 --> 00:30:30,319
species lines because there's some

991
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:31,440
debate that

992
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,558
maybe these things will even cross

993
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
between species which would be

994
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,519
interesting but

995
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:38,720
um so unlike cannabis breeding i there's

996
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,918
there's far more people in the world

997
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,759
that know how to breed cannabis

998
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,679
and do crosses i think in the in the

999
00:30:41,759 --> 00:30:45,038
mycology side at least with philosophy

1000
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,200
you can probably name the people on your

1001
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:48,798
hand that not do it and and most people

1002
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,798
aren't resorting to it because it's just

1003
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,480
it's just easier to like pick the

1004
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,158
biggest mushroom out of a particular box

1005
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,839
and see if you can grab those spores and

1006
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,278
and keep propagating and selecting for

1007
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,000
things that make very large fruits and

1008
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,798
have high

1009
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,319
high potency so um where exactly where

1010
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:03,679
do the spores actually come from oh they

1011
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:04,798
come out of the cap of the mushroom okay

1012
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,519
yeah yeah so when the

1013
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:09,440
when the mushroom the mycelium is almost

1014
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,519
just like a network of roots

1015
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,120
um it's not technically correct but what

1016
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,599
it looks like inside of some of these

1017
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,079
grain

1018
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:17,599
or spawn bags uh and then once you

1019
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:18,879
heavily soak and wet it

1020
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:21,038
that's a trigger that hey we've got

1021
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,480
enough water content here start making

1022
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,319
fruiting bodies and they pop out

1023
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,679
mushrooms and then when the cap unfolds

1024
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:27,759
those gills that are in the cap just

1025
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,480
dump spores

1026
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:32,480
and that's something that is uh that

1027
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,599
people can collect and they can either

1028
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,319
put those into

1029
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,359
you know uh culture and solution or or

1030
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,960
just collect them

1031
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,558
on a piece of tin foil and you get like

1032
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,600
a sport print on tin foil and they can

1033
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:43,278
store that

1034
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,719
and then and then inoculate something

1035
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,240
with that later

1036
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:50,000
um so uh we were that's something we

1037
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,519
set out to do is to see what was the

1038
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,200
diversity if you collect

1039
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,640
we're not sequencing a single four when

1040
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,000
we do this we're seeing collections of

1041
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,120
spores so initially we're worried that

1042
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,880
when you did that you might have so much

1043
00:31:57,119 --> 00:32:00,158
genetic variation it'd be a mess but it

1044
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,519
turns out you can do it and

1045
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,519
and it's not too messy and you can

1046
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,079
sequence the genomes and assemble them

1047
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,558
and

1048
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:07,278
um and count the variants that you see

1049
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,678
yeah so

1050
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:10,798
are the spores that the that it the cat

1051
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,759
produces are they

1052
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,000
clonally identical or they are they

1053
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,440
should

1054
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,440
be haploid and they should be um

1055
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,519
not 100 identical in that they should

1056
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,519
represent two different copies of the

1057
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:25,919
diploid parent genome

1058
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,399
uh so there is a stage where the diploid

1059
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,278
genome starts making haploid copies

1060
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,719
uh and so you can get you get a good

1061
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,319
representation when you do a spore prep

1062
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,319
of both

1063
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,240
the mother and the father if you will uh

1064
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:40,558
in the original diploid dikaryotic

1065
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,679
genome uh it goes to this weird stage i

1066
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:43,440
have to point you into a video because

1067
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,200
it's unlike anything you've seen in like

1068
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,320
mammalian genetics or plant genetics

1069
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,399
with these they have these two different

1070
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,519
life cycles of asexual and

1071
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:52,558
and meiotic reproduction okay um but uh

1072
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:54,159
there's a video that we

1073
00:32:52,558 --> 00:32:55,440
have here we can link to this podcast

1074
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,399
that kind of walks people through this

1075
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,080
but um

1076
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,678
and when you do sequence a whole

1077
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,918
collection of them uh

1078
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
you end up getting enough haploid copies

1079
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,120
from the mother enough haploid copies

1080
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:07,439
from the father if you will that you can

1081
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,158
you can effectively see both versions of

1082
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,000
the genome

1083
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,000
there probably are some unique mutations

1084
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,038
on any given spore level

1085
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,720
but we probably can't see those types of

1086
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,000
that level of resolution of mutations

1087
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,880
unless we sequence really really

1088
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,240
differently

1089
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,919
deeply because we're we're collecting

1090
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,000
like a million spores at once

1091
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,960
so we get kind of an average picture of

1092
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,159
what the

1093
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,079
the the the diploid genome look like uh

1094
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:32,080
when we sequence a collection of spores

1095
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:33,839
uh but we're not going to see those like

1096
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,398
tiny mutations that might make each

1097
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:36,240
spore

1098
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,000
itself individually unique just because

1099
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:39,440
they're so small and it would be kind of

1100
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,880
there's just such a small number of them

1101
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
yeah there's like in any sport prep we

1102
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,120
might be

1103
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,640
peppering a million of them and if and

1104
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:46,479
if every one of those had

1105
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,919
one unique mutation in them they'd be

1106
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,558
drowned out because they'd be one in a

1107
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,038
million

1108
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:52,798
but the real true differences in the

1109
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,398
parental lines that make them different

1110
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:55,038
well those are going to be 50 50 in all

1111
00:33:54,398 --> 00:33:56,879
the reeds

1112
00:33:55,038 --> 00:33:58,079
that we see and so we can call those but

1113
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,679
the actual

1114
00:33:58,079 --> 00:34:01,359
uh really rare events we're not going to

1115
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,640
see but you said there's two different

1116
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:04,639
types of

1117
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:06,399
reproduction right there's asexual as

1118
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,159
well yes there's asexual which is what

1119
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:08,480
comes out of the spore generation from

1120
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,280
the

1121
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,639
um from the fruiting bodies but there's

1122
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,560
another stage

1123
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,800
that goes through meiosis after these

1124
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:18,159
things have formed a clamp junction you

1125
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,240
have two nuclei they're together

1126
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,760
eventually those nuclei fuse and then

1127
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,638
you go through a meiotic stage where

1128
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,159
they split again

1129
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,240
and that's where you can get some of the

1130
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,599
genetic recombination very few people

1131
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,878
are collecting spores at that stage

1132
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,039
right collecting the ones out of the

1133
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:34,398
that are really easy to get

1134
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:36,239
and so for the for the purposes of

1135
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:38,480
sequencing i think we're

1136
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:40,479
just based on the way the law is today

1137
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,918
you can legally sequence the spores you

1138
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,639
can't legally go sequence the other

1139
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,918
stuff

1140
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,240
so we don't know what that does at the

1141
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,719
moment uh we've seen some models of what

1142
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,759
it does

1143
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,480
but um you uh the spores are the one

1144
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,480
thing that

1145
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,079
that don't have tissue don't express any

1146
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:55,519
of the compound and so those are

1147
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,359
those things are legal for taxonomic

1148
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:57,838
purposes and genomics is like the

1149
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,960
ultimate

1150
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:02,000
taxonomic classifier so we're good on

1151
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,639
handling the spores that come

1152
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,400
out of the fruiting bodies but uh it's

1153
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:07,759
unclear if we're ever gonna be able to

1154
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
until it legalizes more whether we can

1155
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,720
go and investigate some of the questions

1156
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,519
that you're asking

1157
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,799
so kind of getting towards the end here

1158
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,800
what is sort of the

1159
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,880
most surprising thing that has come from

1160
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,880
the work that you've done

1161
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,200
um i think what stunned me about it is

1162
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,920
the um the work that's coming out in

1163
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:26,480
in the sars kobe 2 space where they're

1164
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,119
seeing

1165
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,880
these drugs not exactly psilocybin but

1166
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,800
fluoxetine in particular

1167
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,400
is being is very promising for shutting

1168
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,760
down the virus replication that that was

1169
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,480
a shocker to me i didn't even know about

1170
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
that until i

1171
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,760
read or saw peter mccullough's work on

1172
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,920
that um

1173
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:44,079
but people who are on tricyclics have

1174
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,440
less likely infected with sars

1175
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,240
so there's a whole pathway in the ace2

1176
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,320
receptor when

1177
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,279
when you're expressing ace2 it

1178
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,200
co-expresses

1179
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,800
um dopa decarboxylase which is involved

1180
00:35:53,199 --> 00:35:55,279
in the serotonin pathway and so they're

1181
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,280
finding

1182
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,280
serotonin you know giving people

1183
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,720
serotonin agonists or serotonin

1184
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:02,640
selective reuptake inhibitors which

1185
00:36:00,719 --> 00:36:05,118
accomplish very similar ends

1186
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:06,000
uh is fighting off the virus i had no

1187
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:08,720
idea these things

1188
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,199
play a role there um so there's a whole

1189
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,039
focus

1190
00:36:09,199 --> 00:36:12,319
in the field on antidepressants which is

1191
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:14,639
great but

1192
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,800
if they're antiviral to some extent at

1193
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,838
least viruses that are coming in through

1194
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,760
ace two

1195
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:21,519
um that's a whole other interesting side

1196
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,520
of of this story so

1197
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,559
um so that was kind of exciting to to

1198
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,559
read about

1199
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:28,000
what we're finding on the genomics front

1200
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:30,799
is that the pathway that

1201
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,239
makes these um compounds is far more

1202
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,519
complicated than we than initially

1203
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,279
hypothesize it was initially thought

1204
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,759
that there's this 120 kb cassette that

1205
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,519
was

1206
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,359
horizontally transferred everywhere we

1207
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:40,400
can now see when we start sequencing

1208
00:36:39,358 --> 00:36:42,400
outside of cubensis

1209
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,838
that's not the same it's there's a the

1210
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,519
the genes aren't clustered they're

1211
00:36:43,838 --> 00:36:46,880
scattered throughout the genomes and

1212
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,358
there's and they're very different

1213
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,079
so we already have a really nice picture

1214
00:36:49,358 --> 00:36:52,000
of variants

1215
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,320
in all of these genes across 80

1216
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,639
different cubensis genomes including

1217
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,760
outside of cubensis in azura sense and

1218
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,879
in tamponensis

1219
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,320
and in galindois that we're now starting

1220
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,920
to see

1221
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,440
other ways these mushrooms have figured

1222
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,639
out how to make these things so

1223
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,320
there's an argument for convergent

1224
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,159
evolution going on simultaneously to

1225
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,519
this horizontal gene transfer

1226
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,559
and that's going to be interesting

1227
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:16,320
because some of the other

1228
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:18,480
non-cubensis species like azure sends

1229
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,200
are reportedly make more psilocybin than

1230
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,880
cubensis

1231
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:22,799
they're just really hard to find they're

1232
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,240
mostly in the pacific northwest i think

1233
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,320
paul stamets is the person who figured

1234
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,399
that out or found those

1235
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:29,680
and we don't sequence those very much

1236
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,599
and you don't see them much in the

1237
00:37:29,679 --> 00:37:34,239
underground markets for growing although

1238
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:36,240
people do sell the spores

1239
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:37,759
the fact that they're making psilocybin

1240
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,879
in a kind of a unique way is very

1241
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,000
interesting to us because that might

1242
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,838
help guide

1243
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,679
all right what properties that those

1244
00:37:41,838 --> 00:37:45,519
mushrooms have can we breed into the

1245
00:37:43,679 --> 00:37:47,039
more commercial lines because mostly

1246
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:47,838
people for commercial purposes are

1247
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:49,759
growing

1248
00:37:47,838 --> 00:37:51,599
cubensis and maybe five or six of those

1249
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,160
strains it's mostly b plus golden

1250
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,800
teacher

1251
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:56,719
penis envy another another you know

1252
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,720
enlightening name we have in the

1253
00:37:56,719 --> 00:38:00,000
mushroom space you think cannabis strain

1254
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,879
names are bad we can get into mushroom

1255
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:03,280
space right

1256
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
um those are really probably the three

1257
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,839
maybe the albinos as well

1258
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:11,199
are maybe four the most commonly used

1259
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:13,838
because they grow very large fruits but

1260
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:14,480
size isn't everything sadly to use that

1261
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:16,159
pun

1262
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:18,159
because some of the smaller ones are

1263
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,559
more concentrated in the compound so

1264
00:38:18,159 --> 00:38:22,000
there might be a way to intercross those

1265
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:23,759
or or learn what we can learn from

1266
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,719
reserve sense to get the production up

1267
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,480
on the other ones

1268
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:28,399
likewise there are some that are named

1269
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,480
beosysten which i assume is because they

1270
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,079
make more of that one compound so

1271
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,639
now that we have this pathway mapped out

1272
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,240
we can begin to look at the variation we

1273
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:38,078
see between all these different

1274
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:40,000
types of mushrooms to try to custom

1275
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,079
breed them in one direction another or

1276
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,519
there's already people doing work on

1277
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,560
cloning these things into yeast and

1278
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:48,239
getting beer to make it

1279
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:50,159
right so um right that's uh

1280
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:51,838
that might be the ultimate way to make

1281
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,920
some of the more rare versions of these

1282
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:55,759
things right just like in cannabis

1283
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,280
we're not seeing people wanting to clone

1284
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,760
cbd into yeast i mean

1285
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,920
they do it as a control but you can get

1286
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,720
cbd road cheaply out grown outdoors

1287
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,559
but cbdv and maybe uh well maybe seth

1288
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:07,838
crawford has that one nailed but

1289
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:09,199
some of these really rare esoteric

1290
00:39:07,838 --> 00:39:10,400
cannabinoids that we don't yet know how

1291
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:11,919
to breed into the plant people will

1292
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,358
probably be very successful brewing

1293
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,358
those i think that might be the case

1294
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,039
with some of these compounds out of

1295
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,440
cubensis as well that some of the rare

1296
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,279
ones get moved get shuttled into yeast

1297
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,480
um and since it's fungi to fungi that

1298
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,280
transfer will probably happen really

1299
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,760
readily

1300
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,800
um but maybe the more popular ones you

1301
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,800
want to breed for

1302
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,400
mushrooms that just grow very

1303
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,920
productively and then that might beat

1304
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,079
the east out so

1305
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,280
um yeah that's uh it's been a really fun

1306
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,400
project and i have to give

1307
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,760
actually credit speaking of seth

1308
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,039
crawford their team actually helped us

1309
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,119
get that first reference out

1310
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:43,519
um so they they played a pivotal role in

1311
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:45,119
getting some of the sequencing done

1312
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:46,719
and since then we've now tacked on

1313
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,838
another 80 genomes against that

1314
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,358
reference

1315
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,838
using illumina sequencing and that's

1316
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,440
giving us a really nice perspective on

1317
00:39:51,838 --> 00:39:55,119
every variant the pathway that might be

1318
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,679
playing a role in how these genes are

1319
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,838
behaving

1320
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,799
so um it's a it's really an exciting

1321
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:00,799
time for the field because

1322
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,839
suddenly there's like this mountain of

1323
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,280
data to come through

1324
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:04,559
and we can't comb through it all

1325
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,040
ourselves so we've been putting a lot of

1326
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:08,000
it uh

1327
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,119
into ncbi uh and you'll see another

1328
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,719
pre-print

1329
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,800
our first paper in the reference is out

1330
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:14,159
published and peer viewed and we're now

1331
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,680
just submitting another one that has

1332
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:17,519
another 80 genomes

1333
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,358
that we're playing with to kind of paint

1334
00:40:17,519 --> 00:40:21,599
a picture of how complicated this

1335
00:40:19,358 --> 00:40:24,639
particular pathway is

1336
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:26,318
what's next um after that

1337
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:28,239
um i don't know i think after that we

1338
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,599
have to have reach out to the field a

1339
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,719
little bit more and find out okay what

1340
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,880
are the real pain points

1341
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:34,480
um what does the market actually need

1342
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:37,760
it's such an early market that

1343
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,559
um we don't know where to move with this

1344
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,079
data i think

1345
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:44,159
what might be next is understanding

1346
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,839
which variants in each of these genes

1347
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:47,838
are connected to the chemotypes

1348
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,119
right we we can't do the chemotypes

1349
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:50,078
right so we have to partner with people

1350
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,440
there's people out there

1351
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:53,280
that are really good at chemotyping

1352
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,880
these things we want that dna to

1353
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:56,240
sequence it so we can correlate what

1354
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,160
variants we're finding

1355
00:40:56,239 --> 00:41:00,000
that might predict what chemotype you're

1356
00:40:58,159 --> 00:41:01,519
getting that's probably the next phase

1357
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,800
um so we've got to team up with people

1358
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,239
who who do that there's there's an

1359
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,079
equivalent of a cannabis comp i heard

1360
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:07,759
out in oakland

1361
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,800
that that may be able to help out there

1362
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,079
so we're probably going to reach out to

1363
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,200
some of those folks and say hey whatever

1364
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,800
you're chemotyping

1365
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:14,078
if it's if it's one of these oddballs

1366
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,280
that makes a really different compound

1367
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,079
or makes a lot of one particular

1368
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,480
compound

1369
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:20,160
let's get sequence pop it onto the map

1370
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:21,358
there will be a version of canopedia

1371
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,159
that we're gonna fork

1372
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,679
uh into being a phylogenetic tree or

1373
00:41:24,159 --> 00:41:26,960
mycelium if you will that will

1374
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,000
kind of display these things that we're

1375
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,599
working on so we'll have some of the

1376
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,760
same functionality there

1377
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,960
um so that people can get their um their

1378
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,640
stuff sequenced with us

1379
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,079
get it compared get a list of variants

1380
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,799
people can start tracking these things

1381
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:39,920
to see if they're

1382
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,880
you know if they're predicting the the

1383
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,838
patterns that they're seeing on the

1384
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,960
chemotype front

1385
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:45,920
so all of that uh is soon to come needs

1386
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,480
to be built

1387
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,599
well excellent it's very exciting a lot

1388
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,240
of work to be done

1389
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:53,838
um before i let you go is there any

1390
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:55,439
social media or

1391
00:41:53,838 --> 00:41:57,599
websites that you want to plug to make

1392
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:00,159
sure that people can keep up with you

1393
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:00,640
uh well obviously medicinal genomics uh

1394
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,480
has

1395
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:04,719
a lot of what we're doing um you can

1396
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,358
follow us on either facebook instagram

1397
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:08,480
twitter

1398
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:10,559
um i'm occasionally on linkedin but

1399
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,920
um those are the areas that uh that

1400
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,559
we've been posting a lot of this content

1401
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,280
on

1402
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,159
um a lot of credit obviously going to

1403
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,359
seth's group for

1404
00:42:16,159 --> 00:42:19,358
helping us get to get the initial

1405
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,639
reference sequence and then um there's a

1406
00:42:19,358 --> 00:42:20,960
lot of the sport providers have been

1407
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:22,960
that

1408
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,318
been helping as well the group at uh

1409
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,760
inoculate the world has

1410
00:42:24,318 --> 00:42:27,679
been very supportive in getting us

1411
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,119
information on this um

1412
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:30,879
and you'll probably see more of this

1413
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,440
getting

1414
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,039
some attention with the high science

1415
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,480
group that's going to be

1416
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:38,318
coming through here to take a look at

1417
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,280
canmed and all the work that we're doing

1418
00:42:38,318 --> 00:42:40,960
here so

1419
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,160
that's another another plug for those

1420
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:45,838
folks it's safe to assume that your kmid

1421
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,279
presentation this year will be on this

1422
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:48,480
topic yeah we'll have some detail on

1423
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,240
this as well yes we're going to probably

1424
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,199
go through these 80 genomes and whenever

1425
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:54,318
we've discovered by

1426
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:55,279
uh september and um you know we're also

1427
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:56,800
doing some very interesting

1428
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,560
stuff on the cannabis front so they'll

1429
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,560
probably be some some

1430
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:02,078
virus material there that we're working

1431
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:02,880
toward and a lot of the work we're doing

1432
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:06,160
with aoc

1433
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,440
all of this actually was a project um

1434
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:09,838
that got kick-started because we were

1435
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:11,679
sequencing so many genomes for aoec

1436
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:13,759
to look at these yeast mold tests like

1437
00:43:11,679 --> 00:43:14,879
what's actually growing on these things

1438
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,319
and we got kind of depressed because

1439
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,838
we're constantly focused on like the

1440
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:18,318
pathogens the things that hurt people

1441
00:43:17,838 --> 00:43:19,838
and

1442
00:43:18,318 --> 00:43:21,838
that's giving fungi a bad rap they're

1443
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,440
not always hurting people so we said why

1444
00:43:21,838 --> 00:43:24,559
don't we throw on the same aluminum runs

1445
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,400
some uh

1446
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:27,838
some of these things that help people um

1447
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,559
just so we're not always running out

1448
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:29,920
there yelling

1449
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,599
you know chicken little in the field

1450
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:33,200
with with dangerous pathogens the world

1451
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:34,480
needs to remember that actually a lot of

1452
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:36,000
these fungi are beneficial

1453
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,358
and particularly for growing cannabis

1454
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,639
getting the root systems like

1455
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,159
interacting with some of these things is

1456
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,440
really important so

1457
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,639
just to spice it up a little bit we

1458
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,639
wanted to make sure we weren't out there

1459
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:46,318
being chicken little and fungi and that

1460
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:47,039
there's a fungi in the same runs that

1461
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,079
were

1462
00:43:47,039 --> 00:43:51,519
quite beneficial so these ended up being

1463
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,039
fillers for aluminum runs

1464
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:57,199
and so you'll see kanmed um

1465
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,679
we will be equal opportunity in fungi

1466
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:02,000
we'll show the bad ones in the good ones

1467
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:03,919
excellent well looking forward to seeing

1468
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,119
