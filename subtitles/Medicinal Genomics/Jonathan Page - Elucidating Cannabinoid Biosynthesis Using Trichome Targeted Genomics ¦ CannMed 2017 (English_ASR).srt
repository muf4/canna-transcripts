1
00:00:04,509 --> 00:00:10,599
thanks to the Koreans collectively and

2
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:12,099
especially Kevin for the invitation I

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:14,080
missed this event last year and it

4
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:18,910
looked really great and obviously when

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:23,399
you'd say I'm I think I'm miked up is it

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:27,310
being turned on no can you hear me now

7
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:29,229
okay so to repeat thanks to the mckernon

8
00:00:27,309 --> 00:00:31,719
x' and kevin especially for organizing

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,359
this is great a really nice mix of you

10
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:35,469
know chemistry biomedical science and

11
00:00:34,359 --> 00:00:38,679
what i'm going to talk about which is

12
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:40,058
plants I changed my title a little bit

13
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:42,789
because we had a paper come out in the

14
00:00:40,058 --> 00:00:44,169
last week on terpenes and cannabis so I

15
00:00:42,789 --> 00:00:47,170
won't just talk about cannabinoids and

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:49,929
trichomes but before that I thought I'd

17
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:53,350
show this slide this is um Richard Evans

18
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:56,440
shultiess who's who was a professor at

19
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:57,999
Harvard at the Botanical Museum sort of

20
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:59,678
just across the river obviously from

21
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:02,499
here this is a picture of Richard Evans

22
00:00:59,679 --> 00:01:04,750
all teas in 1972 in Kandahar and

23
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:06,969
Afghanistan he was investigating the

24
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,620
differences between the species of you

25
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:09,849
know cannabis indica and sativa or

26
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,980
what's purportedly that those

27
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:13,089
differences and so it's you know it's I

28
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:15,939
think it's really cool that there's a

29
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:19,150
there was a pioneer of cannabis right

30
00:01:15,939 --> 00:01:21,759
here in Boston he's he passed away in

31
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,830
2001 but was really the father of the

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,080
field of ethnobotany and and really got

33
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:29,349
a lot of people excited about medicinal

34
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:31,840
plants and and psychoactive plants and

35
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:34,809
hallucinogenic plants even though he was

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,310
extremely sort of conservative a Harvard

37
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,170
faculty member he went down to the

38
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:41,140
Amazon and used ayahuasca and all this

39
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:44,049
kind of thing so and in in 1972 he

40
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,700
quoted someone else to say the story of

41
00:01:44,049 --> 00:01:47,259
marijuana is not yet written and I think

42
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,269
we're still seeing that we're still

43
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:52,390
writing that story and conferences like

44
00:01:49,269 --> 00:01:55,239
this are really moving things along so

45
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,189
I'm interested in in cannabis as a

46
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:59,289
medicinal plant and and as others have

47
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,599
said this morning it's really a

48
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:06,159
metabolic factory it's a it's a factory

49
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:09,549
for compounds such as such as THC and

50
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,560
CBD cannabidiol other cannabinoids

51
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,689
there's a potentially a hundred and ten

52
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,938
or over a hundred of the cannabinoids

53
00:02:13,688 --> 00:02:17,979
and then terpenes like mere scene and

54
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:20,019
Linna Luol and and

55
00:02:17,979 --> 00:02:22,060
baby cart betta carry off leaning and

56
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:24,069
together they form this mixture of

57
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:26,229
bioactive metabolites that really

58
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:27,969
produce the effects of the plant that

59
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:30,518
people get when they consume it either

60
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:32,199
orally or in inhaled so you know those

61
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:34,030
effects of course are psychoactivity

62
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:36,280
pain relief and all the you know

63
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:39,759
potentially useful medical properties we

64
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,189
see and then when we look at that plant

65
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:43,870
on a you know chemical analysis and the

66
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:46,359
lab that I founded in Vancouver both

67
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,700
does genomics as I'll talk about in this

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,040
talk but we we do a lot of in-depth

69
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:54,759
chemical profiling this is sort of a

70
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:57,370
maybe a typical and analytical profile

71
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:59,919
of a cannabis plant

72
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:03,370
so the cannabinoids such as CBD a the

73
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:05,559
acid form of CBD and THC a in this plant

74
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:07,269
essentially you know sort of one-to-one

75
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,420
ratio so what would be called a chemo

76
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:12,310
type 2 plant and then we see like CBG a

77
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,108
candidature aaalac acid and can of

78
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,909
achromatic acid also present in that

79
00:03:14,109 --> 00:03:17,739
plant so that you know there's a kind of

80
00:03:15,909 --> 00:03:19,568
death although there's a hundred and

81
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,849
five cannabinoids them the major ones

82
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:23,918
are what what we see typically there's

83
00:03:21,848 --> 00:03:26,589
sort of you know six or eight of the big

84
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,840
ones and then within the the terpenes we

85
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,848
see monoterpenes Mir seen typically

86
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,680
dominate and then that squirter pee and

87
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:35,429
things like beta-carotene and those are

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,959
all combining in that that mixture and

89
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,269
what my research program has really been

90
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,009
doing over the last decade or so I was

91
00:03:40,269 --> 00:03:43,959
trying to figure out how cannabis makes

92
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:45,548
those compounds so what are the enzymes

93
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,739
what are the genes for the enzymes that

94
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,069
put these complex metabolites together

95
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:53,230
and the secret of that experimental

96
00:03:51,068 --> 00:03:56,199
approach has been the focus on glandular

97
00:03:53,229 --> 00:03:58,598
trichomes so this is a funky picture I

98
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:01,418
took of a strain called skunk number one

99
00:03:58,598 --> 00:04:04,568
when I was a postdoc in Germany around

100
00:04:01,419 --> 00:04:06,430
2000 or 1999 back you know that long ago

101
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:08,708
I started working on this plant we look

102
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,540
at those those female floral tissues we

103
00:04:08,709 --> 00:04:12,009
see the stigmas where this you know that

104
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:14,198
receive the pollen as these white hairs

105
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,689
but those crystally kind of structures

106
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:18,098
on the floral tissues are trichomes we

107
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:20,259
look a little bit more closely and we

108
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:22,269
see those stalked trichomes

109
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:24,250
and then we look even more closely this

110
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:26,468
is actually these are hemp trichomes but

111
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,750
hemp is still cannabis after all we can

112
00:04:26,468 --> 00:04:31,089
see that nice stalk and then a secretor

113
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,689
e disk of cells these are the cells that

114
00:04:31,089 --> 00:04:33,338
are out

115
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:43,419
Ashley making cannabinoids and

116
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:45,639
terpenoids elzar the kind of the

117
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:48,579
cellular factories for cannabinoids and

118
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,199
then there's that storage site in that

119
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,658
that secrete re cavity

120
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:53,649
you know as consumers they would talk

121
00:04:52,658 --> 00:04:56,408
about you know people talk about

122
00:04:53,649 --> 00:05:00,338
crystals and and resin droplets they're

123
00:04:56,408 --> 00:05:02,319
really like a balloon of chemicals or a

124
00:05:00,338 --> 00:05:05,860
Safeway bag you know it's got a sort of

125
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,598
a thin almost plastic waxy skin on it to

126
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,329
contain the metabolites in there and you

127
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:13,478
can open them up just by you know poking

128
00:05:10,329 --> 00:05:15,369
them or prodding them so what we did has

129
00:05:13,478 --> 00:05:16,808
biochemists and Janome assist was saying

130
00:05:15,369 --> 00:05:18,189
well you know those secretor e-cell

131
00:05:16,809 --> 00:05:20,199
discs or where all the action takes

132
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:23,199
place that's where the factory is if we

133
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,848
can isolate them and then start probing

134
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,579
their biochemistry and specifically

135
00:05:24,848 --> 00:05:29,978
looking at what genes are expressed we

136
00:05:27,579 --> 00:05:31,598
can figure out how the metabolites that

137
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:35,978
are produced and then secreted their

138
00:05:31,598 --> 00:05:38,978
cannabinoids interpreting the plant and

139
00:05:35,978 --> 00:05:41,498
so that and that process and they go

140
00:05:38,978 --> 00:05:44,618
back one slide shows you what we did was

141
00:05:41,499 --> 00:05:48,219
we took female floral tissues of a high

142
00:05:44,619 --> 00:05:51,699
THC strain put it in a bead beater which

143
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:53,738
is a glorified glorified blender cost a

144
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:56,468
lot more than your typical blender knock

145
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:59,678
the stuff apart the bag of goop opens up

146
00:05:56,468 --> 00:06:01,209
that the discs separate from the top of

147
00:05:59,678 --> 00:06:03,488
the stalk and then you can filter them

148
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:06,129
off and purify them into a relatively

149
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:08,408
pure form there kind of a sort of a

150
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:10,149
creamy color they're not even

151
00:06:08,408 --> 00:06:12,658
photosynthetic and then we can isolate

152
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:15,369
RNA ribonucleic acid which is the

153
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:18,368
messenger from the genome through to the

154
00:06:15,369 --> 00:06:21,550
protein it's kind of it's it's the

155
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:23,619
active form of gene expression so we got

156
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:27,459
RNA and then we started sequencing it

157
00:06:23,619 --> 00:06:30,279
and then we had a gene expression

158
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:32,019
catalog so that gene expression catalog

159
00:06:30,278 --> 00:06:34,238
from the glandular trichomes of high THC

160
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:36,848
cannabis was enriched for cannabinoid

161
00:06:34,238 --> 00:06:39,488
pathway enzymes and the reason we knew

162
00:06:36,848 --> 00:06:41,139
it was enriched was initially we only

163
00:06:39,488 --> 00:06:44,018
had one enzyme in the pathway

164
00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:45,490
identified it was done by the professor

165
00:06:44,019 --> 00:06:47,889
show Yama's group and cue

166
