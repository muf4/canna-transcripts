1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,179
I'm a basic scientist I'm a

2
00:00:06,378 --> 00:00:10,518
neuroscientist I've been interested in

3
00:00:08,179 --> 00:00:12,980
brain degeneration for many years and

4
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:15,379
I've recently become interested in the

5
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:17,019
utility of cannabinoid directed drugs in

6
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:19,399
the treatment of traumatic brain injury

7
00:00:17,019 --> 00:00:20,509
alright so I'm gonna do my talk a little

8
00:00:19,399 --> 00:00:23,538
bit I guess I can walk around a little

9
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,000
bit so I'm gonna do my talk a little bit

10
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:28,189
backwards in case I get one at a time

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,539
I'm gonna start with the introduction of

12
00:00:28,189 --> 00:00:30,800
the people involved in the research I'm

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:32,359
not going to go through all of these but

14
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,710
just going to say that we couldn't do

15
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:35,000
this research without a big team of

16
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:37,728
collaborators and also without the

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,899
funding sources I will mention Tonya Rex

18
00:00:37,728 --> 00:00:43,609
I use a focal blast air-pressure blast

19
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,588
model of traumatic brain injury

20
00:00:43,609 --> 00:00:47,509
Tonya first designed the system for use

21
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:49,728
in ocular blast injury and I modified it

22
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,768
for traumatic brain injury this is

23
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:53,929
Marsha Hoenig my major collaborator and

24
00:00:51,768 --> 00:00:55,820
all of this TBI research and this is Bob

25
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:56,689
Moore who made the compound that I'll be

26
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,408
talking about today

27
00:00:56,689 --> 00:01:04,250
the cb2 receptor inverse agonist all

28
00:01:00,408 --> 00:01:05,780
right there so in keeping with this

29
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,188
backward idea I'm gonna give you the

30
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:08,390
summary of what my talk is going to be

31
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:12,828
about that I'm gonna actually gonna go

32
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:16,099
into the data so we use the cb2 drug and

33
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:20,328
we target might whoops got to I want to

34
00:01:16,099 --> 00:01:22,099
do come on back there I wanted to okay

35
00:01:20,328 --> 00:01:23,868
when to use my pointer we target

36
00:01:22,099 --> 00:01:25,908
microglial activation to treat TBI

37
00:01:23,868 --> 00:01:28,670
microglia become activated in traumatic

38
00:01:25,909 --> 00:01:30,950
brain injury they perpetuate and

39
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:33,769
exacerbate the harm that's done and so

40
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,749
by targeting them we hope to improve the

41
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:38,239
outcomes from TBI no microglia make a

42
00:01:35,748 --> 00:01:40,548
lot of cb2 receptors as it turns out so

43
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:45,408
that makes them easy to target with cb2

44
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:48,079
drugs and any way we use a drug called

45
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,639
SMM 189 i'll typically call it s mm it's

46
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:51,379
a funny category of drug it's not an

47
00:01:49,638 --> 00:01:53,478
agonist it's not an antagonist it's

48
00:01:51,379 --> 00:01:55,248
inverse agonist so it does the opposite

49
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:59,688
of an agonist I'll show you exactly what

50
00:01:55,248 --> 00:02:01,818
that means in a future slide now we use

51
00:01:59,688 --> 00:02:04,578
a focal cranial blast model so only a

52
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:07,039
small part of the closed skull - shaved

53
00:02:04,578 --> 00:02:09,530
head the skull is closed the skin is

54
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,939
intact the animal gets shaved and we put

55
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,110
a high-pressure air blast against the

56
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:14,210
side of the animal's head to produce

57
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:16,400
traumatic brain injury that results in a

58
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,569
lot of functional outcomes and there are

59
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,950
pathological outcomes there

60
00:02:17,568 --> 00:02:21,169
simple what you get and mild traumatic

61
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:23,688
brain injury and people including visual

62
00:02:21,169 --> 00:02:25,518
motor and emotional deficits we treat

63
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:27,169
them for two weeks the animals for two

64
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:30,139
weeks beginning just after the traumatic

65
00:02:27,169 --> 00:02:31,899
brain injury event and that turns out to

66
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:34,250
have a lot of benefit because it rescues

67
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,920
greatly improves the outcome the

68
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:39,259
deficits are reduced and the neuron loss

69
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:40,578
and axon injury in the brain is reduced

70
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:42,048
as well

71
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:44,120
we have preliminary evidence as well

72
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:46,370
that semi daily delivery it with the

73
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,810
same compound in a mouse model of

74
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:52,188
Alzheimer's disease called the j-20

75
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:54,859
mouse model slows memory loss and helps

76
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:58,519
maintain connectivity between neurons in

77
00:02:54,859 --> 00:02:59,900
the brain all right so traumatic brain

78
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:03,139
injury has been in the news a lot

79
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,699
concussion for a variety of reasons it's

80
00:03:03,139 --> 00:03:07,099
been very prominent issue in the sports

81
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:09,049
world this is Alan Schwartz a writer for

82
00:03:07,098 --> 00:03:10,759
the New York Times wrote a lengthy

83
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:13,968
series of articles in New York Times

84
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:16,098
about the dangers of repeated head

85
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:18,560
injury in football and what this can do

86
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:20,358
in the long term to the players even

87
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,389
when the injury that's repeated is

88
00:03:20,359 --> 00:03:24,919
what's called sub-concussive so this is

89
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,459
now Bennet Omalu who was portrayed by

90
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:29,689
Will Smith in the movie concussion

91
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:31,938
Bennet Omalu was the first one to

92
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:34,280
discover this syndrome and athletes he

93
00:03:31,938 --> 00:03:36,590
first discovered it by doing a autopsy

94
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:38,030
on the brain of Mike Webster this

95
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:40,848
football player here who suffered from

96
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:43,250
profound dementia later in life

97
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:45,589
and it turns out that you don't have to

98
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,299
play for 15 years as a center and get

99
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,009
repeated head butts to the people that

100
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:50,810
are charging at you you don't have to

101
00:03:49,008 --> 00:03:52,279
wait till you're 50 60 years old it also

102
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,639
helps in younger players this is Chris

103
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:56,688
Henry who because of his career in

104
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,879
football it would seem

105
00:03:56,688 --> 00:04:00,530
suffer to progressive degenerative brain

106
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:01,728
disease like Mike Webster that's now

107
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,430
called chronic chronic traumatic

108
00:04:01,729 --> 00:04:06,829
encephalopathy CTE his symptoms were

109
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,769
different he lost control of his

110
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:11,299
emotions and he died due to an accident

111
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:12,829
brought on by that loss of emotional

112
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:14,269
control this is Ann McKie who's

113
00:04:12,829 --> 00:04:16,788
extensively studied chronic traumatic

114
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:18,858
encephalopathy as well and this is what

115
00:04:16,788 --> 00:04:20,870
you get with repeated concussion normal

116
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:23,418
brain and you can see a badly shrunken

117
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,538
brain now the problem doesn't only exist

118
00:04:23,418 --> 00:04:28,158
for athletes the problem also is very

119
00:04:26,538 --> 00:04:30,259
prominent in the military where soldiers

120
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:31,608
get explode - exposed to explosive

121
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:33,738
blasts once

122
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:35,149
many times but even if it's only once

123
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:38,118
they wind up suffering the consequences

124
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:39,798
of that they have mood changes memory

125
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:42,199
loss so on and so forth so it's a it's

126
00:04:39,798 --> 00:04:46,098
an issue of concern and this is why we

127
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:48,889
ourselves got into the research so this

128
00:04:46,098 --> 00:04:51,199
is the compound we use and I won't say

129
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:53,119
too much about it except that again it

130
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,759
was developed at UT by Bob Moore Bob

131
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,519
Moore research group it has a not a

132
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,379
fantastic selectivity for cb2 by ligand

133
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:02,899
binding but in terms of a functional

134
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:05,360
assay for cb2 receptors it seems to be

135
00:05:02,899 --> 00:05:07,879
highly selector for cb2 receptors and it

136
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,179
acts as an inverse agonist in a cyclic

137
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:13,338
A&amp;P reporter assay and from in vitro and

138
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:16,638
in vivo studies we know what it does is

139
00:05:13,338 --> 00:05:19,189
it converts microglia from this harmful

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,228
state called the m1 state in which they

141
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:23,509
exacerbate the injury it converts them

142
00:05:21,228 --> 00:05:25,548
to another state of microglial behavior

143
00:05:23,509 --> 00:05:26,989
that's more beneficial and helpful them

144
00:05:25,548 --> 00:05:28,668
but in doing so we think that's what's

145
00:05:26,988 --> 00:05:31,338
mediating or benefit with the compound

146
00:05:28,668 --> 00:05:33,468
that we use all righty now this is a

147
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:36,048
what inverse agonism looks like so this

148
00:05:33,468 --> 00:05:38,899
is an assay called the cyclic AMP II

149
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:42,558
reporter assay a certain kind of cell

150
00:05:38,899 --> 00:05:44,598
line called the HEC cells are transduced

151
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:47,509
with this reporter construct that allows

152
00:05:44,598 --> 00:05:49,158
you to see how much cyclic A&amp;P the cells

153
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:51,288
heck cells are making you also then

154
00:05:49,158 --> 00:05:53,629
transduce the cells with UCB to or cb1

155
00:05:51,288 --> 00:05:55,818
receptors and then you expose these

156
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:58,369
cultures different cultures to

157
00:05:55,819 --> 00:06:00,709
increasing concentrations of this bought

158
00:05:58,369 --> 00:06:02,989
broad spectrum cb1 and cb2 receptor

159
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:05,538
agonists and you get what you expect you

160
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:07,698
you should produce a reduction in cyclic

161
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:09,738
a.m. P because that's what cannabinoids

162
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:11,778
they do when they active cb1 are cb2

163
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:13,968
receptors they reduce cyclic A&amp;P

164
00:06:11,778 --> 00:06:15,978
production so this is normal but what

165
00:06:13,968 --> 00:06:18,709
SMM does instead of reducing it or

166
00:06:15,978 --> 00:06:20,688
producing no effect what SMM does is it

167
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:22,309
increases cyclic A&amp;P so does the

168
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:24,528
opposite of agonist so we call it an

169
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:27,709
inverse agonist it doesn't do anything

170
00:06:24,528 --> 00:06:30,048
however of note at cb1 receptor so seems

171
00:06:27,709 --> 00:06:33,918
to be selective for cb2 receptors and

172
00:06:30,048 --> 00:06:36,078
therefore non psychoactive all right so

173
00:06:33,918 --> 00:06:37,368
we've tested it in vitro to find out how

174
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,559
it acts and this is the reason I got

175
00:06:37,369 --> 00:06:41,989
into the TBI research because it has a

176
00:06:39,559 --> 00:06:44,088
sort of anti-inflammatory profile so

177
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,688
what we did here now is we have primary

178
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:47,269
human

179
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:49,059
microglia cells in a dish what we do is

180
00:06:47,269 --> 00:06:51,408
we expose them to a stimulant called

181
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,059
lipopolysaccharide LPS and what that

182
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:54,889
stimulant does is it converts them to

183
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:57,169
the m1 state in which they express a

184
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:58,848
bunch of chemicals called cytokines so

185
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:01,188
in all these cases you see the cytokines

186
00:06:58,848 --> 00:07:02,778
going up with LPS production this means

187
00:07:01,189 --> 00:07:06,079
these microglia now have been converted

188
00:07:02,778 --> 00:07:08,718
to the harmful inflammatory State and so

189
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,459
what our drug SMM does in all cases it

190
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:13,129
reduces the expression of this harmful

191
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:16,668
stuff and is combating the inflammatory

192
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:19,069
State well we can also look at other

193
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:21,618
markers when microglia go into the

194
00:07:19,069 --> 00:07:23,689
harmful m1 state they increase

195
00:07:21,619 --> 00:07:26,959
expression of various proteins on their

196
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:28,369
cell surface called C D 11 B cd45 cd68

197
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,139
those are three different cell surface

198
00:07:28,369 --> 00:07:32,119
markers they all go up with a

199
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:34,429
polysaccharide stimulation and in all

200
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:35,929
cases when you're supposed to SMM those

201
00:07:34,428 --> 00:07:37,728
go down now we have additional studies I

202
00:07:35,928 --> 00:07:39,558
don't have time to show you in which we

203
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:42,558
looked at cell surface markers

204
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:46,039
characteristic of m2 microglia in vivo

205
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:48,319
and in vitro those go up so m2 markers

206
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:50,868
go up and one markers go down we think

207
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,519
that's good so this is now the mouse

208
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,449
model of TBI that I just want to walk

209
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:56,300
you through so you know what it looks

210
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:58,278
like so we take the mouse we anesthetize

211
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,709
the mouse and this mouse is knocked out

212
00:07:58,278 --> 00:08:02,988
we shave the left side of its head and

213
00:08:00,709 --> 00:08:05,389
put a little white dot over the shaved

214
00:08:02,988 --> 00:08:08,058
area that's our targeting spot for the

215
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:10,848
blasts the mouse then goes into this

216
00:08:08,059 --> 00:08:12,050
sled with a sort of a foam cushion

217
00:08:10,848 --> 00:08:13,878
insert there where its head gets

218
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,619
cushioned there's a very tight fit he

219
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:17,179
goes into a very tight tube and so he's

220
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:20,209
very snug in there but he's cushioned as

221
00:08:17,178 --> 00:08:22,488
well this tube with this big tube

222
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:24,918
centimeter opening this tube goes into

223
00:08:22,488 --> 00:08:26,418
this wider tube here and this wider tube

224
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:28,399
is this one here and it has a seven

225
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,049
point five millimeter opening at seven

226
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:31,338
point five millimeter opening we Center

227
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,198
the mouse we can see the white dot

228
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:35,328
centered in front of there and then we

229
00:08:33,198 --> 00:08:36,948
Center this contraption in front of this

230
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:38,598
which is a paintball gun

231
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:41,389
it's been modified to put out a higher

232
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,129
pressure blast and we bring the mouse a

233
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:44,899
couple millimeters away from the barrel

234
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:47,300
of paintball gun and we fire at once and

235
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:48,470
the mouse winds up then showing a lot of

236
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,870
different kinds of symptoms of traumatic

237
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,459
brain injury this is the blast area it

238
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,959
encompasses the entire forebrain of the

239
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:55,518
mouse you can see the forebrain behind

240
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,899
there in silhouette if you know any

241
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,639
mouse brain anatomy and this is the

242
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,970
family of blasts

243
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,620
that we use this is the peak and well

244
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:05,389
it's the peak for different blasts that

245
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:11,269
we use and the duration of each of those

246
00:09:05,389 --> 00:09:12,620
peak blast pressures already so then now

247
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:15,009
we want to model mild traumatic brain

248
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:18,649
injury so this is just a single blast

249
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:20,330
and we even mild traumatic brain injury

250
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:21,649
and people has consequences one of the

251
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:23,810
characteristics of mild traumatic brain

252
00:09:21,649 --> 00:09:26,360
injury and people is like if a physician

253
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:28,819
does an MRI of the brain somehow

254
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,320
visualizes the brain looks just fine and

255
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,550
the physician is inclined to say like

256
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,510
you're fine there's nothing wrong with

257
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:34,250
your brain go home

258
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:36,740
but what's underlying that though is

259
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,330
that the the forces of the blast or

260
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,399
whatever the impact was that caused the

261
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:41,509
concussion have wiggled and disrupted

262
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,980
the brain and cause stretching

263
00:09:41,509 --> 00:09:44,600
compression compressive injury

264
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:46,279
throughout the brain and a manifestation

265
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,500
of that will be axons will be injured

266
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:51,159
and will break so this is what broken

267
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,570
axons look like oops I keep doing that

268
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,549
so this is what broken axons look like

269
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,840
so these axons here in the brain of

270
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:59,269
humans who've suffered a concussion

271
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:01,420
shortly after concussion they died this

272
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:03,529
is what broken axons look like even in a

273
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:05,389
mild traumatic brain injury

274
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:06,769
these are label for different kinds of

275
00:10:05,389 --> 00:10:08,120
markers doesn't matter what they are but

276
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,039
what happens is the axon should be this

277
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:11,810
long smooth thing instead you see this

278
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:13,309
beads on a string kind of phenomena with

279
00:10:11,809 --> 00:10:15,109
the accident those axons are damaged

280
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:17,000
what's happened to them is axons

281
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,830
normally look like this schematically

282
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,570
they have inside them things called

283
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,730
microtubules that they use to transport

284
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:24,230
proteins back and forth between the

285
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:25,550
neuron cell body and the terminal and

286
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,180
from the terminal back to the cell body

287
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:31,759
when axons get stretched those oops I'm

288
00:10:29,179 --> 00:10:33,529
never gonna stop doing that so anyway

289
00:10:31,759 --> 00:10:35,509
they break they break into different

290
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:37,819
spots now they're transporting stuff so

291
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,529
it's like breaking a hose so the fluid

292
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:41,570
or the proteins that are collecting at

293
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:43,279
those spots now it can't be transporter

294
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,770
anymore what happens as they pile up and

295
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,689
so those parts of the axon swell and

296
00:10:45,769 --> 00:10:52,549
then they can even break and the axon is

297
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:54,710
dead okay so we see that in our animal

298
00:10:52,549 --> 00:10:57,469
model which verifies that it is a model

299
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,870
of mild traumatic brain injury so we

300
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:01,490
blast on the left side this is the optic

301
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,929
tract that I'm going to be showing you

302
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:04,850
be showing you so we're going to focus

303
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:07,370
on this because this is a schematic of

304
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:09,409
the optic tract the left eye here which

305
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:11,419
is the cyber blast from this is the left

306
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,000
optic nerve which at the level the optic

307
00:11:11,419 --> 00:11:13,979
chiasm

308
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,899
mixes together with the optic nerve from

309
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:18,870
the right eye mixed together and then

310
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:20,579
what happens is in mice at least most of

311
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,019
the left optic nerve continues as the

312
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:23,580
right optic tract so the important point

313
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:25,919
is I'm showing you the right optic tract

314
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,629
so in the right optic tract here we've

315
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,969
stained the axons now and these brown

316
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:31,980
straight but wiggly things those are

317
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,170
normal axons notice there's no bumps in

318
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,930
them so this is the marker we used if we

319
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,909
look after three days after TBI you see

320
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:41,189
that we have some nice smooth axons as

321
00:11:38,909 --> 00:11:42,990
well we have these dark bumps the axons

322
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,850
are broken they're torn this is a

323
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:46,740
different marker now for visualizing

324
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:48,509
those axons as well it doesn't visualize

325
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:50,220
as many but this is a mouse engineered

326
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,379
so some of the axons Express this

327
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,180
fluorescent protein and again this case

328
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,470
seven days after TBI you can see broken

329
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:57,629
axons so we can look throughout the

330
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:59,310
brain and we see these broken axons so I

331
00:11:57,629 --> 00:12:01,799
need to check my time I got seven

332
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:05,519
minutes left all right

333
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:07,379
so important point of note is that here

334
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,269
in the optic tract here here are

335
00:12:07,379 --> 00:12:11,100
microglia these things these cells you

336
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:14,279
can barely see are the microglia they're

337
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,019
fine looking they're wispy slender but

338
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,220
after TBI in the optic tract when

339
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:20,819
they're surrounded by all these damaged

340
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:23,310
axons the microglia go into room destroy

341
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:25,170
and remove mode and so they they shrivel

342
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:27,750
up they come darker they extend these

343
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:29,490
thick chunky processes they change so

344
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,720
they're in the m1 state now I'm going to

345
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:33,720
move it along here and not talk about

346
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,330
these other slides here so we then start

347
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:38,129
to look at functional deficits after TBI

348
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:39,810
and the benefit of our drugs the next

349
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:42,419
series of slides are going to show you

350
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:45,149
deficits and functional benefit from

351
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:47,819
drug the drug being a cb2 receptor

352
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:49,439
inverse agonist this thing called SMM so

353
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,020
visual acuity you can actually measure

354
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,570
visual acuity in a mouse there are tests

355
00:12:52,019 --> 00:12:56,279
for doing that and if we normalize to a

356
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:59,070
hundred percent as normal and the

357
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,049
animals that got no blast injury and got

358
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,700
vehicle instead of drug we call that a

359
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:05,729
hundred percent you can see then for the

360
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:09,089
left eye those animals are down there QT

361
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:11,250
is reduced by about 30% as a significant

362
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,870
reduction in the animals that we gave

363
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:14,669
drug to after a blast there is a

364
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,350
significant improvement their acuity is

365
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,789
significantly better there's another

366
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:19,529
visual thing that we look at called

367
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,599
contrast sensitivity is very important

368
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:23,309
in human vision and that's improved as

369
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,800
well and if we look to see what's the

370
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,989
underlying basis of this deficit and the

371
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:30,870
with drug we find that the retina is

372
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:33,209
about 10% thinner after the blast injury

373
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:35,220
and that thinness is much alleviated by

374
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:37,139
drug and in the inner retina there's

375
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,028
especially a lot of thinning that goes

376
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,409
on that's correct at the inner vent is

377
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:43,860
the part of the retina that has the

378
00:13:40,409 --> 00:13:46,799
retinal ganglion cells all right so now

379
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:48,389
we also look at motor function to take

380
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:49,979
you through some of this and just make

381
00:13:48,389 --> 00:13:51,720
the overall point I'm just going to

382
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,860
focus on this particular illustration so

383
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:55,829
I can get through the rest of my stuff

384
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,690
so anyway so this is a spinning rod task

385
00:13:55,828 --> 00:14:00,109
you can put a mouse on a spinning rod a

386
00:13:57,690 --> 00:14:02,550
rod that increases its spin rate

387
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:03,899
second-by-second and mice kind of like

388
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,299
that it's kind of a challenge for them

389
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:08,370
and normal mice if you test them before

390
00:14:06,299 --> 00:14:10,740
blast you know normalize that to 100%

391
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:12,690
and then testing the day after blast one

392
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:14,370
week and two weeks after blast they

393
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,380
progressively get better at the spinning

394
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:18,750
rod task and the task is to stay on the

395
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:20,879
rod and not fall off so they get better

396
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:24,509
at that and the animals however that I

397
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,659
received TBI they don't do as well as

398
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:30,299
the animals that received a Cham blast

399
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:31,980
however the animals with drug they do a

400
00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:34,169
whole lot better than the blasted

401
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:36,839
animals alone so underlying this we

402
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:38,879
found that there is a rescue of some of

403
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:41,010
the motor structures of the brain and

404
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,139
these are other functional tests of

405
00:14:41,009 --> 00:14:45,509
motor function here we put the animals

406
00:14:43,139 --> 00:14:47,639
in arena they run around fast or slow

407
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:50,519
depending on who they are but the bottom

408
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:53,100
line here is that after TBI animals run

409
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:54,689
around more slowly drug fixes that after

410
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,870
TBI animals have trouble navigating

411
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:59,700
turns and the drugs this is the

412
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:02,089
difficulty there and the drug seems to

413
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,500
improve their ability to navigate turns

414
00:15:02,089 --> 00:15:07,200
we can also measure depression in a

415
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,698
mouse so I won't bother with saying how

416
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:11,040
we do that and just get to the bottom

417
00:15:08,698 --> 00:15:13,439
line here we measure depression over a

418
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,838
five-minute period and our test test is

419
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,730
called a tail suspension test the fact

420
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,040
that this red line here is higher than

421
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,379
the blue line indicates the animals with

422
00:15:20,039 --> 00:15:24,719
blasts are depressed and you can see the

423
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:28,139
green the drug normalizes the animals in

424
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,180
terms of depression we can also look at

425
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:33,838
fear just want to see I'm doing on time

426
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:36,000
okay so I can slow it down a tiny bit so

427
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,860
we also can look at fear in mice this is

428
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,089
an important thing for the PTSD like

429
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,759
outcome from TBI

430
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,440
so

431
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,759
we do is we put a mouse in a chamber a

432
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,350
mouse is sitting in the chamber he

433
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,059
sniffs around he explores the chamber

434
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,430
and he's relaxed about being in the

435
00:15:46,059 --> 00:15:50,559
chamber then he hears a tone hears the

436
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:53,069
tone okay it tones not very disturbing

437
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:55,299
it's not loud it's kind of you know

438
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:56,860
innocuous but then at the end of the

439
00:15:55,299 --> 00:15:59,079
tone there's a very mild shock that's

440
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,909
not hurtful but it's nonetheless a shock

441
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,280
he wouldn't want experience so that

442
00:16:00,909 --> 00:16:05,769
happens five times now and what happens

443
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,589
is the mouse becomes afraid when he

444
00:16:05,769 --> 00:16:11,259
hears the tone he shows a mouse fear

445
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:13,120
behavior called freezing so after five

446
00:16:11,259 --> 00:16:15,549
trials of training the next day we bring

447
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,500
the mouse back in and we test to see how

448
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:21,009
well he remembers the fear how fearful

449
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:24,279
he is in response to either the context

450
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:26,830
alone or the tone so in response to the

451
00:16:24,279 --> 00:16:28,389
context alone mice actually generalize

452
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:31,570
the fear to the chamber where they got

453
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:34,750
shocked the animals that got blast

454
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:36,670
injury TBI but know no drug just vehicle

455
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,799
they are more fearful of just being in

456
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:40,479
the chamber over the first 30 seconds of

457
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,609
the test and this somewhat reduces over

458
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,550
the second 30 seconds of the contextual

459
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:47,409
fear assessment and then we play the

460
00:16:45,549 --> 00:16:49,179
tone all by itself with no further

461
00:16:47,409 --> 00:16:51,219
shocks we look to see how the animal

462
00:16:49,179 --> 00:16:53,349
responds to that we do that fit twelve

463
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:56,320
times and so over the course of 12

464
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,330
repetitions of this what's called the CS

465
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,390
the conditioned stimulus the animal

466
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:03,490
initially shows fear if it's a non

467
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,170
blasted animal receiving vehicle and

468
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:07,088
eventually stops showing an a

469
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:08,470
significant fear altogether the animals

470
00:17:07,088 --> 00:17:10,480
like out blast show a lot of fear that

471
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,940
does not extinguish the animals that got

472
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,730
drugs show intermediate fear but they do

473
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:20,110
extinguish so this drug has alleviated

474
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:22,240
the fearfulness after TBI all right now

475
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:24,338
this is the part of the brain that's

476
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,230
responsible for regulating fear it's

477
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:27,639
called the basal lateral amygdala this

478
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:30,670
is the left basal lateral amygdala the

479
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:32,320
basal lateral amygdala in people too we

480
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:35,019
assume but certainly in mice contains

481
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:37,389
neurons that are fear increasing and

482
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,089
fear reducing so this is an engineered

483
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:42,220
mouse where the anti fear narrow neurons

484
00:17:40,089 --> 00:17:45,279
are visualized with this green

485
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:47,049
fluorescent compound as it turns out we

486
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:49,240
serve and dipp'd ously discovered that

487
00:17:47,049 --> 00:17:51,339
after TBI the anti fear neurons were

488
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,440
reduced in abundance it seems like blast

489
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,730
kills the anti farriner

490
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,789
so therefore the animals are more

491
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:59,980
fearful our drug however rescued many of

492
00:17:57,789 --> 00:18:02,289
the anti fear neurons and so fear was

493
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,990
reduced now we've also looked at

494
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:07,869
electrophysiology to see how well brain

495
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,359
connectivity is maintained after our

496
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:11,949
drug is given after TBI so this

497
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,990
complicated looking thing here is

498
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:16,420
showing a communication between the

499
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:18,910
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex this

500
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,890
is showing you sort of a simulation of a

501
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:22,840
memory transfer system between two brain

502
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:24,820
regions important in memory the

503
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:28,240
noteworthy thing is that when there is a

504
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:30,939
moment of firing activity in the

505
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:35,140
hippocampus there is in a normal animal

506
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,880
a a co-occurring moment of activity in

507
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,960
the prefrontal cortex and that's what

508
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,270
that blue peak shows after TBI that's

509
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:46,120
gone you don't see the prefrontal cortex

510
00:18:43,269 --> 00:18:48,730
does not follow the firing activity in

511
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:51,069
the hippocampus after drug however that

512
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:52,860
is restored so we found that the drug

513
00:18:51,069 --> 00:18:55,000
also is beneficial in terms of this

514
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:58,298
electrophysiological readout of brain

515
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,919
activity finally now switching gears I'm

516
00:18:58,298 --> 00:19:01,660
going to tell you very briefly about the

517
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,370
work we've been doing an Alzheimer's

518
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:05,529
disease an Alzheimer's disease model

519
00:19:03,369 --> 00:19:07,599
here we treat the animals for about two

520
00:19:05,529 --> 00:19:09,460
months every other day with this

521
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:11,980
compound the lower dose that we use for

522
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:13,690
TBI and then we have been looking at a

523
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:15,490
number of parameters memory parameters

524
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:18,610
as well as electrophysiology parameters

525
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:21,669
it improves memory mice show less memory

526
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:22,899
loss and this also shows a connectivity

527
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:24,580
is improved so this complicated

528
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,610
electrophysiology thing is again showing

529
00:19:24,579 --> 00:19:30,519
you activity linked between hippocampus

530
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:31,928
and prefrontal cortex and if it's high

531
00:19:30,519 --> 00:19:34,058
here that means there's linkage of

532
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:36,370
activity when hippocampus fires

533
00:19:34,058 --> 00:19:37,569
prefrontal cortex fires at different

534
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:39,159
frequencies here we're looking at

535
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:43,089
different frequency bands for where the

536
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:44,470
matching occurs so in a normal j-20

537
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,359
Mouse which is somewhat of an oxymoron

538
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:49,230
it's an Alzheimer's model so it's not

539
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:52,269
really a normal Mouse but in a typical

540
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,490
j-20 mouse that has disease but no drug

541
00:19:52,269 --> 00:19:56,440
benefit there's very poor communication

542
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,700
between these two brain areas one of the

543
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,710
problems and Alzheimer's is that

544
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,870
synapses are lost and brain areas don't

545
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:04,419
communicate anymore and so with drug

546
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:05,409
that connectivity is apparently

547
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:08,950
maintained

548
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:11,230
as functionally the prefrontal cortex is

549
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,420
following hippocampus so that's it I

550
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,420
made it through everything and thank you

551
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,309
you
