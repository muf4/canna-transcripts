1
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:13,089
hi everyone I am very happy and honored

2
00:00:10,628 --> 00:00:16,058
to be here today to speak to you about

3
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:18,640
an observational study I'm doing looking

4
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,859
at the effects of cannabinoids on

5
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,768
seizures in adults with medically

6
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:25,419
refractory epilepsy what I'm gonna do

7
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:28,118
first is go through a little bit of

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:30,368
background information and then I am

9
00:00:28,118 --> 00:00:32,618
going to show you some preliminary data

10
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:34,960
which essentially shows the effects that

11
00:00:32,618 --> 00:00:37,750
seizures have on autonomic nervous

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,908
system and this is coming from a pre

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:43,929
cannabinoid baseline period for my

14
00:00:39,908 --> 00:00:45,820
participants so epilepsy is a central

15
00:00:43,929 --> 00:00:48,719
nervous system disorder characterized by

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,488
abnormal neuronal activity and seizures

17
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,058
signs and symptoms of seizures include

18
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:58,088
everything from a staring spell to

19
00:00:55,058 --> 00:01:00,820
convulsions seizures also produce

20
00:00:58,088 --> 00:01:03,850
autonomic symptoms so things like pallor

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:06,969
and sweating and pilo erection and in

22
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:08,920
fact autonomic changes may be among the

23
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:12,938
most common and least recognized

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,710
symptoms of seizures seizures are

25
00:01:12,938 --> 00:01:19,118
typically classified as being either

26
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:22,478
focal or generalized depending on where

27
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:25,959
the abnormal brain activity begins focal

28
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:27,789
seizures can also become generalized and

29
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:32,019
people can have multiple types of

30
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:35,468
seizures and seizures can occur with or

31
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:38,228
without a loss of consciousness both

32
00:01:35,468 --> 00:01:40,780
focal and generalized seizures can alter

33
00:01:38,228 --> 00:01:42,789
autonomic nervous system function the

34
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,890
probable path is through the limbic

35
00:01:42,789 --> 00:01:47,259
system and if there is seizure

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,899
activation or inhibition of the

37
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:52,629
autonomic Network it can result in

38
00:01:49,899 --> 00:01:57,429
effects on all of the systems that you

39
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:59,589
see listed there so despite the

40
00:01:57,429 --> 00:02:02,319
availability of all different kinds of

41
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:04,299
anti epileptic drugs for about 30

42
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:07,118
percent of people with epilepsy their

43
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:08,590
seizures are not well controlled this is

44
00:02:07,118 --> 00:02:11,259
a condition that's called medically

45
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:14,409
refractory epilepsy and it's associated

46
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:17,848
with severe morbidity and also increased

47
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:19,889
mortality in the form of a condition

48
00:02:17,848 --> 00:02:24,149
that's called SUDEP which stands for

49
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:27,899
sudden unexpected death in epilepsy so

50
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:30,718
this gap in treatment that exists is

51
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,430
what has led people to seek alternatives

52
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:38,759
such as cannabinoids the endocannabinoid

53
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:41,968
system makes sense both as a potential

54
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:45,418
site of impairment in epilepsy and also

55
00:02:41,968 --> 00:02:48,358
as a potential target for treatment in

56
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,969
epilepsy and that has mainly to do with

57
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:56,389
its role in the regulation of synaptic

58
00:02:50,968 --> 00:02:59,908
activity and also homeostasis so we have

59
00:02:56,389 --> 00:03:02,129
all different types of studies using a

60
00:02:59,908 --> 00:03:04,108
whole variety of different types of

61
00:03:02,128 --> 00:03:06,179
cannabinoids which point to the

62
00:03:04,109 --> 00:03:09,150
potential usefulness of cannabinoids as

63
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,280
a treatment for epilepsy including the

64
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,459
two recent randomized control trials

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,169
which showed that epileptics was

66
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:18,989
effective in decreasing seizure

67
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:23,189
frequency in children with two really

68
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:24,599
severe forms of epilepsy and so we have

69
00:03:23,188 --> 00:03:27,239
many studies that have pointed to

70
00:03:24,598 --> 00:03:30,658
cannabinoids as being potentially useful

71
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:32,938
in epilepsy and the types of

72
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:35,878
cannabinoids being used are CBD

73
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:37,039
combinations of CBD and THC and even

74
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,539
whole plant products

75
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:42,628
unfortunately recommendations about

76
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:43,530
these specific cannabinoid types and

77
00:03:42,628 --> 00:03:47,008
dosing and routes have been

78
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:51,090
administration except etc are lacking

79
00:03:47,008 --> 00:03:52,978
particularly for adults and so not

80
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,109
everybody has a dr. Goldstein available

81
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:57,120
to them unfortunately

82
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:59,159
and so adults are basically sort of

83
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:03,359
taking their treatments into their own

84
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:05,578
hands so that leads me to of my study

85
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:07,919
the study that I'm doing is an

86
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,500
observational study of the effects of

87
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,299
cannabinoids on seizures in adults with

88
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:16,108
medically refractory epilepsy

89
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:19,379
it has a within subjects design where we

90
00:04:16,108 --> 00:04:22,288
are following participants for one month

91
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:24,478
prior to their initiating the use of

92
00:04:22,288 --> 00:04:26,819
cannabinoids and then for five months

93
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,089
after they began using cannabinoids and

94
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,360
I have to

95
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:33,909
though that no cannabinoids are provided

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,069
to the participants of this study by the

97
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,020
researchers and that's because it's an

98
00:04:36,069 --> 00:04:40,029
observational study legally the only

99
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:43,209
thing I can do is observe what these

100
00:04:40,029 --> 00:04:47,589
people are doing to treat themselves in

101
00:04:43,209 --> 00:04:50,138
fact participants support for medicinal

102
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:52,449
cannabis use is provided by the realm of

103
00:04:50,139 --> 00:04:55,900
caring and you will be hearing from

104
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:57,939
Heather Jackson in just a few minutes so

105
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,219
the main objectives I have for this

106
00:04:57,939 --> 00:05:02,379
study are to characterize the effects of

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,430
cannabinoids on seizures in adults with

108
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:07,800
medically refractory epilepsy using both

109
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:10,629
physiological and behavioral measures

110
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,270
but I also have a very important second

111
00:05:10,629 --> 00:05:14,889
objective which is basically to enhance

112
00:05:13,269 --> 00:05:17,199
our understanding of medically

113
00:05:14,889 --> 00:05:19,360
refractory epilepsy in general as well

114
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,750
as the effects of cannabinoid use

115
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:25,960
through the daily wireless recording of

116
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:29,470
participants autonomic physiology using

117
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:33,009
a device called the e4 wristband which

118
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,690
is produced by the company in Pataca the

119
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:36,939
main outcome measures I have for the

120
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:39,038
study our seizure frequency quality of

121
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:40,870
life and I also have a particular

122
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:45,399
interest and hypothesis around

123
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:48,639
electrodermal activity here are the

124
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:49,719
inclusion and exclusion criteria for my

125
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,659
study

126
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:56,020
they are pretty standard for people with

127
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,590
medically refractory epilepsy the

128
00:05:56,019 --> 00:06:01,509
highlight by the Colorado resident is

129
00:05:58,589 --> 00:06:04,239
there because I recently received IRB

130
00:06:01,509 --> 00:06:06,009
approval to extend the study to people

131
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,110
who are residing in states where

132
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:11,259
cannabis is legal for the treatment of

133
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:14,800
epilepsy the main thing that we are

134
00:06:11,259 --> 00:06:19,240
looking for is that people have not used

135
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,939
cannabinoids within the last month so

136
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:24,519
over the six months course of the study

137
00:06:21,939 --> 00:06:26,918
participants make three visits to the

138
00:06:24,519 --> 00:06:29,949
lab or I make three visits to their home

139
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:33,549
and at each of these visits participants

140
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:36,069
fill out a whole battery of standardized

141
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,280
questionnaires and they also provide us

142
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,909
with urine samples and then about a

143
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:43,639
month after visit

144
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:48,530
one participants are free to begin using

145
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:51,349
cannabinoids so here is a list of the

146
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:54,219
behavioral questionnaires that we give

147
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:57,860
to people at each of those visits and

148
00:06:54,220 --> 00:07:00,230
here's the list of the cannabinoids and

149
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:04,370
metabolites that are being tested for in

150
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:08,540
participants urine and that brings me

151
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,540
finally to the e4 wristband the e4 is

152
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:15,370
the device that we are using for daily

153
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:19,460
Wireless physiological recording it was

154
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:21,920
made or developed by Roslyn Picard and

155
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:24,680
her colleagues at the Media Lab at MIT

156
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,080
and it records a whole bunch of

157
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,530
different autonomic variables which you

158
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:33,109
see listed here it also includes an

159
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:35,659
event marker and participants in this

160
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,910
study are instructed to press the event

161
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,610
marker once if they have a seizure if

162
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:44,090
they're able and then twice when they

163
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:46,129
use cannabinoids and I have again the

164
00:07:44,089 --> 00:07:47,569
electrodermal activity highlighted there

165
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:50,269
because that's a variable that's of

166
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:52,639
particular interest to me electrodermal

167
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:54,799
activity is basically sweating activity

168
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,699
that's elicited by activation of the

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:03,168
sympathetic nervous system so in

170
00:07:58,699 --> 00:08:05,599
addition to developing the e for dr.

171
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:07,819
Picard and her group also developed an

172
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:11,689
algorithm for seizure detection that's

173
00:08:07,819 --> 00:08:15,129
based on the variables that the e4

174
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:17,509
collects and they published a study

175
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:20,300
where they found for example that

176
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,509
electrodermal activity plus motion is

177
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:26,990
better than motion alone for automated

178
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:35,240
grandma generalized tonic-clonic seizure

179
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:38,080
detection empathic ax is actually

180
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:41,629
producing seizure reports for this study

181
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,509
so this group has also made a number of

182
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:46,549
other important contributions so for

183
00:08:44,509 --> 00:08:50,838
example in a case study they

184
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:52,439
demonstrated that a signature of a G TCS

185
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:56,750
seizure in

186
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,160
G was associated with a spike in

187
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:01,679
electrodermal activity that's measured

188
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:05,360
at the wrists they have also done some

189
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:08,699
other work which essentially points to

190
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:12,740
autonomic dysfunction as being a

191
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:15,810
potential contributing factor to suit up

192
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:18,389
so I've had a whole number of people

193
00:09:15,809 --> 00:09:20,549
contact me that are interested in

194
00:09:18,389 --> 00:09:23,250
participating in the study many of them

195
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:25,199
have had to be excluded or not enrolled

196
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:29,009
because they don't meet the study

197
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,200
criteria currently I have four

198
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:33,840
participants enrolled in the study and

199
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,840
here is some background information on

200
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,269
those participants so for our male and

201
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:42,509
one is female all four of the

202
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:45,360
participants have focal complex seizures

203
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:49,529
for three of these participants those

204
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:51,779
can progress to G TCS seizures and two

205
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:54,659
of these participants actually have V NS

206
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:56,159
I wish I could share more about the

207
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:59,009
participants in the study because they

208
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,469
are really truly amazing people what I'm

209
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:05,669
gonna do is to show you some data from

210
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:07,649
each of these four participants and the

211
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:09,629
first two participants I'm going to show

212
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:11,970
you are actually under the care of the

213
00:10:09,629 --> 00:10:16,439
epileptologist on my research team his

214
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:19,350
name is dr. Joshi and so I'm going to go

215
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,650
ahead and show you that data some of

216
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:24,930
which he has refueling with me as well

217
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:26,879
so first up is participant one five

218
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:29,639
eight zero what you're looking at here

219
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:33,539
is an e for recording that lasts for

220
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:35,490
approximately 16 hours the top trace is

221
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:38,309
electrodermal activity followed by blood

222
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:41,039
volume pulse motion acceleration heart

223
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:42,299
rate and then temperature there are a

224
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:44,579
number of things that I want to point

225
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:47,969
out to you on this slide so first is

226
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:50,580
that at about 4:30 p.m. on this day in

227
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,680
Pataca detects a seizure and you can see

228
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:55,589
that autonomically this is associated

229
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:57,929
with a spike in movement activity as

230
00:10:55,589 --> 00:11:01,620
well as a spike or some erratic heart

231
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:03,879
activity next what you can see is that

232
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,159
there is a red line through the data

233
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:09,578
and this indicates that a caregiver

234
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:13,629
pressed the event marker indicating that

235
00:11:09,578 --> 00:11:15,489
they also identified the seizure so

236
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:17,379
following those spikes in activity you

237
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:19,690
see sort of a quiet period which is

238
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:22,269
likely a recovery period and then about

239
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,040
6:30 p.m. or so the participant seems to

240
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:27,730
kind of resume their normal daily

241
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:29,289
activities until about 9:00 p.m. what

242
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,819
you see in the data there that circled

243
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:33,730
is an artifact that's due to the

244
00:11:30,818 --> 00:11:36,399
participant taking off his efore and

245
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:38,379
leaving it on he ultimately puts it back

246
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,870
on and it looks like he probably goes to

247
00:11:38,379 --> 00:11:46,809
sleep maybe around 10:30 p.m. and so it

248
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:48,578
turns out that these event markers are

249
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,189
really incredibly important for the

250
00:11:48,578 --> 00:11:53,919
research and that's because it allows me

251
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:57,459
one to verify the seizure that was

252
00:11:53,919 --> 00:12:00,639
detected by impecca it also allows me to

253
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:02,859
see what's going on autonomically for

254
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,839
the person when they have a seizure and

255
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,089
it also gives me a little bit of insight

256
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,360
into what the algorithm developed by an

257
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:13,899
Pataca might be picking up on what's

258
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:16,269
unfortunate is that I don't often see

259
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:18,578
many of these marks in the data and

260
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:21,250
that's because most of my participants

261
00:12:18,578 --> 00:12:23,318
are not aware of when they've had a

262
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:27,009
seizure and caregivers can't necessarily

263
00:12:23,318 --> 00:12:29,078
catch everything here's a file from that

264
00:12:27,009 --> 00:12:31,360
same participant this particular file

265
00:12:29,078 --> 00:12:33,188
lasts about 42 hours long and you can

266
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,470
see that right about one o'clock in the

267
00:12:33,188 --> 00:12:38,379
morning and Pataca detected a seizure

268
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:40,540
again it seems to have that pattern

269
00:12:38,379 --> 00:12:42,730
where there's a spike in the movement

270
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:45,039
activity as well as a spike in the heart

271
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:48,490
activity this particular seizure was

272
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,990
also marked by a caregiver and again

273
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:53,799
after the seizure you can see sort of

274
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:55,990
that quiet potential recovery period and

275
00:12:53,799 --> 00:12:58,299
then in Pataca also detected two

276
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,519
additional seizures and for those

277
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:02,919
seizures the pattern is not quite as

278
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:06,310
clear as the pattern in some of the

279
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:08,019
previous files that I've shown you and

280
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:11,438
neither of these was marked by a

281
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:13,419
caregiver just for context what you're

282
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:15,929
looking at here is a plot of the mean

283
00:13:13,419 --> 00:13:17,969
and the median elected dermal values

284
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:19,799
across all of the recordings that I have

285
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,200
for this it's meant at least at the time

286
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:24,449
I made the presentation overlaid with

287
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,820
this are those orange circles and those

288
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:28,470
are indications of a caregiver pressing

289
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:30,450
the infant marker to mark for a seizure

290
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:33,320
the two that are circled are the two

291
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,129
that I showed in the previous files

292
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,500
unfortunately at this point I'm not

293
00:13:35,129 --> 00:13:38,789
really seeing anything consistent in

294
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,940
terms of the relationship between

295
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:46,259
electrodermal activity and seizure

296
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:49,320
activity next up is participant 1 for 8e

297
00:13:46,259 --> 00:13:51,450
he is a 28 year old man the recording

298
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:54,510
that you're looking at is about 26 hours

299
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:57,480
long and it's pretty unremarkable until

300
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:00,259
the very end when a seizure was detected

301
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:03,300
and was also reported by the caregiver

302
00:14:00,259 --> 00:14:04,799
what's unfortunate is that when the

303
00:14:03,299 --> 00:14:06,959
caregiver detected the seizure she

304
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:10,979
pressed the event marker so hard that

305
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,960
she actually turned off the wristband so

306
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,500
that's just the nature of working with

307
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:18,570
human subjects and so here what you're

308
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,610
seeing is a blow-up of the last two

309
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,200
hours of that recording so you can see

310
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,990
what's going on autonomically a little

311
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:27,240
bit more clearly so again you see a

312
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:29,700
spike in the movement activity you can

313
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:31,379
also see a spike in the heart rate and

314
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:34,160
in this particular case you can see a

315
00:14:31,379 --> 00:14:39,450
little bit of a dip in temperature and a

316
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:42,750
peak in the electrodermal activity next

317
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:46,740
you're looking at data from the same

318
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:50,250
participants and in this participant you

319
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:53,730
can see that around 8 p.m. in Pataca

320
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,740
detected a seizure sorry this is a new

321
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,240
new participant this is a 34 year old

322
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,250
female I should have mentioned that so

323
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,669
this is her file it's about 24 hours

324
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:04,950
long and again at about 8 p.m. and patek

325
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:06,599
had detected a seizure subsequently the

326
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:09,450
seizure was also reported by the

327
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,330
caregiver in this particular case the

328
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,610
data does not fit most necessary the

329
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:16,139
pattern that I showed you previously

330
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,480
this might be the case because this

331
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:19,889
particular person has more of an absence

332
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,500
type seizure than a generalized

333
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:25,409
tonic-clonic seizure here's the file

334
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:27,149
from her and in this case the caregiver

335
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:28,100
reported the seizure but nothing was

336
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:31,579
detected

337
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,440
and Pataca and then again for context

338
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:35,480
you're looking at the mean and median

339
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,640
elected dermal values over all of the

340
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:40,850
recordings that I have for this person

341
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:42,710
the asterisks are marking the time

342
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,629
frames when seizures were detected and

343
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,340
the two that are circled are the ones

344
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,139
that I showed you one where in Pataca

345
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:51,320
did detect and one where they did not

346
00:15:48,139 --> 00:15:53,929
you can also see other tags in the data

347
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,870
which are these blue circles and those

348
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:59,839
tags are indicative of time frames when

349
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:02,450
the person is taking CBD so they have

350
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,879
moved out of their baseline period into

351
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,320
the time frame where they're taking CBD

352
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:08,389
this is going to be extremely useful

353
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,980
both in the short and the long term to

354
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,939
help us see how CBD is affecting people

355
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,519
autonomically and also affecting

356
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:19,640
seizures and then last but not least

357
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,829
this is participant 1 194 he's a 42 year

358
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,100
old male the recording you're looking at

359
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:27,320
is about 27 hours long during this

360
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:29,509
timeframe and Pataca detected two

361
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:31,879
seizures the second seizure in

362
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:33,679
particular seems really close in pattern

363
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:36,649
to some of the seizures I showed you

364
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:39,289
previously the first one looks similar

365
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:41,689
as well it just happens to occur that

366
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,129
that recovery period happens to occur

367
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:46,220
during a time frame and the person would

368
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:51,500
normally be asleep and so I can tell you

369
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:54,710
that empathic has reported many more

370
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,159
seizures than our blue marked by these

371
00:16:54,710 --> 00:17:00,860
participants and so it may well be that

372
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:02,659
they're having more seizures than the

373
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,549
participants or their caregivers are

374
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:07,789
aware of but one of the things I'm doing

375
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:09,500
is working with dr. doe she and in

376
00:17:07,789 --> 00:17:11,420
Pataca to make sure that our seizure

377
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,029
beric a verification is as accurate as

378
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:15,800
possible what we hope to learn is

379
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:17,328
overarching what we hope to learn is

380
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:19,759
whether cannabinoid use this beneficial

381
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,930
for adults with MRI we also want to

382
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:22,849
learn whether it affects seizure

383
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:24,709
frequency by looking at those three

384
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,569
things that you see here and also

385
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:30,200
quality of life I have a particular

386
00:17:26,569 --> 00:17:32,240
interest in ETA and temperature moving

387
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,430
forward with the next 30 participants

388
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,650
what I'm going to do to address some of

389
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,200
these issues is when possible verify the

390
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:40,950
seizures using video EEG I'm also going

391
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,259
to send some control data through

392
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,840
Pataca to get a report on the false

393
00:17:43,259 --> 00:17:47,460
positives and try to motivate caregivers

394
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,409
to keep really consistent detailed

395
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:51,000
seizure records and connect more

396
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:54,960
frequently with participants in

397
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:57,140
caregivers let's give it up for Barbara

398
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,140
