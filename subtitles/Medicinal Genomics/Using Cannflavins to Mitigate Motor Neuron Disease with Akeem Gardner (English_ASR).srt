Ontario during our conversation we

51
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,079
discuss the minor molecules found in

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,959
cannabis that canera is investigating

53
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,239
for

54
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,759
Therapeutics cana's process for

55
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,759
evaluating indications for can flavens

56
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:31,719
and

57
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:34,159
polyphenols how the diverse molecules in

58
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:37,159
cannabis make it a great therapeutic for

59
00:02:34,159 --> 00:02:40,199
a multifactoral disease like

60
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:42,759
ALS the potential for can flavens and

61
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:45,878
polyphenols to be used as an

62
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,479
anti-inflammatory neutraceutical and

63
00:02:45,878 --> 00:02:50,719
more before we get to my conversation

Garder good afternoon AE thanks so much

83
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,399
for joining us on the podcast oh thank

84
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:57,959
you for having me here Ben excited to be

85
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,039
back looking forward to canmed 2024 as

86
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,120
well yeah it yeah no it is great to have

87
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:06,679
you back on the podcast and as you

88
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,719
mentioned you're returning for canmed 24

89
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:11,599
you did give a great presentation at

90
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:15,000
canmed 23 about the researcher team

91
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:17,159
performed on using can flavens to treat

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,399
gleo blastoma and I'll put a link in the

93
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:22,520
show description so people can can check

94
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:24,439
that out and as we said you're coming

95
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:27,000
back again this year to share data

96
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:29,079
related to how can flavens again may

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,959
help treat patients with motor neuron

98
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,560
disease but before we dive into that I

99
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:35,758
was checking out your website at

100
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,000
cana.com before we jumped on and it

101
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,639
seems like there's a lot of activity

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,478
going on there so why don't you catch us

103
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,720
up on what you've been working on since

104
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:47,319
last we

105
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:50,160
spoke awesome awesome awesome yes as you

106
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:52,519
can see we are very very busy bees up

107
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,720
here in Toronto doing a lot of research

108
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,120
on these minor molecules found in the

109
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,320
plant not only the can Flavin but other

110
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,038
penol flavonoids still beans Spenzo

111
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:04,918
that are there in cannabis Industrial

112
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,120
Hemp as well and as you know and as we

113
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,680
know with right with all Botanicals with

114
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,120
the cannaboids all these molecules they

115
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,918
have um um multi-targets they work on

116
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,639
different aspects of the body to do

117
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:19,318
different things in various diseases so

118
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:21,600
over the last year we've been really

119
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,039
really trying to narrow down in on our

120
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,960
research on the applications of what

121
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:28,478
these molecules and ingredients can do

122
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:31,120
on their own and in different

123
00:05:28,478 --> 00:05:34,360
combinations and how do you actually get

124
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:37,038
products out of these Botanical uh

125
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,280
Botanical drug candidates but also

126
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,719
neutral that can go to the market much

127
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:44,559
sooner and help people out in a quicker

128
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,960
in a quicker period of time excellent

129
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,879
okay so I heard you mention there's some

130
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:51,159
additional molecules that you're looking

131
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:53,839
at because last time we we we focused on

132
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:56,560
the canned flavens A and B last we spoke

133
00:05:53,839 --> 00:06:01,359
so I'm curious what these what these new

134
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,839
molecules are we did and and um but I

135
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,400
yeah I can't remember if I said it last

136
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:07,638
time probably didn't but at canera we

137
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,679
really want to be the company that you

138
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,598
go to when you think anything cannabis

139
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:15,160
hat polyphenol related so in these

140
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:17,159
polyphenols and in minor concentrations

141
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:18,880
in the plants there are groups of

142
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,599
crenelated flavonoids which would

143
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:24,439
include the can Flavin a can Flavin B

144
00:06:21,598 --> 00:06:27,680
and others it would include still beans

145
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:30,360
b benzil b benzil are ingredients like

146
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,160
canine cannabis still beans

147
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,080
um so still Beam with benzil and other

148
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:37,199
ingredients as well that have yet to be

149
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:39,918
characterized all in all I think there's

150
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,160
about seven or eight molecules that have

151
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,240
been identified in literature but

152
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,639
there's no validated standards to be

153
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,918
able to identify these at a consistent

154
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,560
basis and they are very very small and

155
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:54,279
very very small concentrations in the

156
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:57,720
planet so we are working on multiple

157
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:59,758
ways of um enriching xats for these

158
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,319
ingredients then being able ble to

159
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,759
isolate them purify them and then test

160
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,439
them all out for their bioactivity that

161
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,000
way when we're putting combinations

162
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:12,759
together we're sure we can be or make

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,279
better um guesses or

164
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,919
hypothesis

165
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,519
hypothesises about what these

166
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:19,598
ingredients can do when it comes to

167
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,918
treating both humans and animals in a

168
00:07:19,598 --> 00:07:23,038
variety of different health conditions

169
00:07:21,918 --> 00:07:25,758
excellent so you say small

170
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,918
concentrations how small are we talking

171
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,960
well if we look at the can flins the the

172
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:31,959
lead ones these ones are the ones that

173
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:33,918
we can get most reliably and these ones

174
00:07:31,959 --> 00:07:37,399
are found in under

175
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:39,639
0.014% of the plant biomass on average

176
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:44,758
everything else is less than

177
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:48,000
that wow y so we we really have to and

178
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:50,080
the first patent that we designed or the

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,759
researchers at the University designed

180
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:55,120
was a way of specifically concentrating

181
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:57,479
then identifying isolating and then

182
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,478
purifying all of these molecules so that

183
00:07:57,478 --> 00:08:03,519
when we're doing hlcr NM or whatever or

184
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,399
whatnot um Mass speec we actually know

185
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,839
what's there we can identify the various

186
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:10,000
molecules that are there and then we can

187
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:13,119
develop standards for these molecules um

188
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,560
with our biosynthesis technology as well

189
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:19,360
awesome so with the plant making such

190
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:23,158
small concentrations is that the best

191
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,879
way to produce these um molecules or do

192
00:08:23,158 --> 00:08:29,439
you have some other sort of uh process

193
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:31,319
for that well the best way for us to at

194
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:33,719
these molecules right now is extraction

195
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:36,839
the beauty of our extraction process is

196
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,080
it's a commercially feasible way of

197
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,719
again concentrating isolating and

198
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,000
purifying so that we can get these

199
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,120
molecules in the future there may be

200
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,039
another way that we um come up with we

201
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,399
have a couple of other methods under

202
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,319
investigation right and again like I

203
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,360
said this is what we ultimately want to

204
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,320
be known at known for ater being the

205
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,320
ones that can get these molecules in a

206
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:02,160
reliable fashion at the standards or at

207
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,120
the level with the characterization that

208
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:07,958
the FD or any other regulator around the

209
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:10,879
world wants for Botanical ingredients

210
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:13,199
Botanical great no and I know a big part

211
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:16,919
of what you do at canera is you

212
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:19,240
investigate different um indications um

213
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:22,000
that might be a good a good Target for

214
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,360
these molecules um and again like I said

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,759
I was looking at the website and there

216
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,800
looks like there's a lot of different

217
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:29,799
things you're looking at so I'm curious

218
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,799
how do you decide which condition

219
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:34,120
um you want to investigate and sort of

220
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,199
what's your process for sort of um

221
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:40,639
evaluating

222
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:43,839
these well as a halfway joke right

223
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:46,480
partly ask chat GPT hey we have these

224
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,959
molecules they have these sort of um um

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,600
end PLS in activity how might they be

226
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:54,039
able to help right that's a halfway joke

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,440
because um we do use AI environment

228
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:58,519
informaticians to help screen our

229
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,680
molecules and give uh um us information

230
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,759
for where we think this might be most

231
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:04,679
applicable um one of the things that we

232
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:06,799
know that our ingredients do very well

233
00:10:04,679 --> 00:10:08,838
is they target the inflammatory related

234
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,838
path and we know that chronic

235
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:12,720
inflammation um systematic chronic

236
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:14,680
inflammation is related to a wide

237
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:17,839
variety of diseases usually everything

238
00:10:14,679 --> 00:10:19,799
starts as that slow burning continuous

239
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,920
inflammation goes undetected then it can

240
00:10:19,799 --> 00:10:23,120
turn into cancer into neurod

241
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,159
degenerative problems into

242
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:28,720
cardiovascular problems so on and so

243
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:31,480
forth so where we start is we look at

244
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:34,240
okay um what areas of disease or what

245
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,839
other indications are related to a

246
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:40,959
inflammation um even if inflammation is

247
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:43,200
the primary um driver of that disease do

248
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:45,359
our molecules hit other targets that are

249
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,639
related to that disease for example in

250
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,519
our cancer program for Goma we found

251
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,839
that our molecules also hit Tre B so

252
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:54,278
that we were able to go down that

253
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,920
pathway but then really what I try to do

254
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,360
is I try to find a key opinion leader

255
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,399
someone who's used to doing the AC mic

256
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,720
or pre-clinical or Discovery work

257
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,399
required to be able to validate the

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,200
ideas the hypothesis that we have so in

259
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,278
Canada we are very fortunate to have a

260
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,440
wide variety of um

261
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:16,600
universities um with a lot of

262
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:19,560
investigators with the government

263
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:21,959
programs that can fund um student

264
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,879
research so that professors with the

265
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:27,919
oversight can lead a PhD or a master

266
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:30,039
student or even sometimes undergrad stud

267
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:32,759
students to do a series of experiments

268
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,879
for us proof of concept experiments for

269
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:38,039
us that will give us the information we

270
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,159
need to deductively reason and say yes

271
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:41,480
this is what we want to do or this is

272
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:43,838
where we think we have the highest

273
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:46,360
chance of success or we can turn this

274
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,440
around in a reasonable time because from

275
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:50,879
this batch of experiments and work

276
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,000
previously done we can FastTrack this

277
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,120
into the clinic which we're trying to do

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,759
with our first asset our lead asset for

279
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,039
motor neuron dises ALS great okay so

280
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,639
that was was going to be sort of my next

281
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:03,240
question is you know which one of these

282
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,879
indications is sort of the furthest

283
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,839
along or closest to actually doing

284
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,519
clinical trials and it sounds like it's

285
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,120
um this ALS motor neuron um application

286
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:14,720
mot neuron dise I I think so right EXC

287
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,759
over the last year we've learned a lot

288
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,920
about ALS monor neuron disease we've

289
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:22,078
learned a lot about how the cannabis

290
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:25,599
plant has helped people suffering from

291
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:27,679
neurological ailments um um since the

292
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,920
beginning of time in a variety of

293
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:33,519
different cultures and again leaning on

294
00:12:30,919 --> 00:12:35,399
the experience of Dr Ethan Russo our

295
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,679
senior medical

296
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,958
advisor and what the work that they did

297
00:12:37,679 --> 00:12:42,799
formerly at GW Pharma we know that

298
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:45,439
cannabis can help in severe neurological

299
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,759
diseases neurod degenerative diseases

300
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,000
and ALS BTO neuron disease is an area

301
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:53,319
where these patients they need help a

302
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,159
lot of them use cannabis right now to

303
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,800
help manage their symptoms but they

304
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:58,639
don't have something standardized and

305
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,000
the practitioner doesn't always know

306
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,560
what the patient is using even though

307
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,759
they can come into the clinic and say

308
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,198
hey we're using cannabis we feel better

309
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,480
we're eating more so on and so forth so

310
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:11,799
our goal is to be able to leverage all

311
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:14,120
the work previously done along with some

312
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:16,278
of the new work that we're doing right

313
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:18,320
now to be able to move this forward into

314
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:20,600
the clinic and really help a patient

315
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,800
population that's looking for answers

316
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,920
that's looking for um help that's

317
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:28,319
looking for a better quality of life and

318
00:13:24,919 --> 00:13:30,479
really deserves to have it excellent and

319
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,879
now

320
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,159
um the therapeutic that you're sort of

321
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:39,759
evaluating is that a like a single

322
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:42,679
molecule um therapeutic or is it sort of

323
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:45,720
a combination of of different compounds

324
00:13:42,679 --> 00:13:50,078
what does that look like so generally

325
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:53,000
speaking when we evaluate um our Assets

326
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,120
in any indication we put a series of

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,440
different candidates in there so we will

328
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:02,198
put like um highly purified single can

329
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:04,040
can Flavin cany we'll put cany extract

330
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,078
and then we can put combination extract

331
00:14:04,039 --> 00:14:09,240
in there and see what performs best um

332
00:14:07,078 --> 00:14:11,958
based on the mixture the cocktail

333
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,240
mixture the um almost Entourage or

334
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:17,399
synergistic approach right now based on

335
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:20,320
the work previously done and based on

336
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:23,039
again being a student of Dr REO we know

337
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,440
that in the clinic for humans it's

338
00:14:23,039 --> 00:14:27,879
probably not going to be a single

339
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,199
mixture a single ingredient that has the

340
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,039
best opportunity to help these patients

341
00:14:30,198 --> 00:14:34,719
it's going to be a cocktail mixture a

342
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:36,480
cocktail approach not dissimilar to how

343
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,160
these patients are getting treated right

344
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:42,000
now but we can talk about that a little

345
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:44,159
bit later um as I was saying we put

346
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,720
together a series of um different

347
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:49,198
molecules found in the plant at various

348
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,399
concentrations at safe concentrations

349
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:53,559
that we believe can be delivered to

350
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,360
patients chronically on an everyday

351
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,559
basis that can help them manage their

352
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,360
symptoms that can improve their quality

353
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:02,159
of life and might also be

354
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,039
neuroprotective as well um and help them

355
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:05,759
with survival so we think that we have

356
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:08,000
something that can be disease modifying

357
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,519
now we just have to continue to go andov

358
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:14,120
it great and so and so where are we at

359
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,519
now and I mean maybe let's how about a

360
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,159
little preview I don't want you give

361
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,320
away too much because we want people to

362
00:15:17,159 --> 00:15:21,278
come out to the event but um what what

363
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,839
are you looking to present at at

364
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:26,838
caned so I CED I we have a series of

365
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,120
again previous literature that's been

366
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,319
done but also some unique exper

367
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,440
experiments that we've recently done to

368
00:15:32,318 --> 00:15:35,958
validate that our combination actually

369
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:38,240
does work how we think it's going to

370
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:40,758
work so I'm really excited to share some

371
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:43,198
of this information share again the

372
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,120
process that we went through from

373
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,479
looking at all the things previously

374
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,240
done to adding our unique twists on it

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:54,079
and then showing uh what the result is

376
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:55,759
and how we got it to work in our favor

377
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,000
excellent excellent and now you touched

378
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,278
on it before um when you were talking

379
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:05,039
about ALS like what are sort of the

380
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:09,240
Therapeutics that ALS patients are using

381
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:10,838
now um and you know why is yours

382
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:14,440
potentially a better

383
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,360
solution so um well I'll start first

384
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:19,399
really quickly with what is ALS right

385
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:22,159
sure yeah and ALS is a pretty severe

386
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:24,120
neurodegenerative disease right it comes

387
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:26,360
in a variety of different forms it's a

388
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,879
really complex disorder where a lot of

389
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:31,680
things are going are going on people

390
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,039
don't really understand why um patients

391
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:36,679
get it why they um as soon as they get

392
00:16:34,039 --> 00:16:40,919
it they're two to three years usually

393
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:43,278
until uh to mortality um they usually

394
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:45,799
assum when they get it they end up in a

395
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:47,720
wheelchair they have to have tubes to

396
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,198
help with their feeding right really

397
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,839
really rapid progression and debil

398
00:16:50,198 --> 00:16:54,838
dehabitation U motor neuron disease um

399
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,800
right

400
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:59,560
now because of the complexity of ALS

401
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,838
again

402
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:04,918
even though it was first discovered 150

403
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,798
years ago there's no cure to me still

404
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:09,360
right and it's because of the complexity

405
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:10,240
of what's going on in the CNS and in the

406
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,078
motor

407
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:15,318
neurons

408
00:17:12,078 --> 00:17:19,159
so most recently um and I think as of

409
00:17:15,318 --> 00:17:22,798
today there's four slash I think and uh

410
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,519
metosin becomes the fifth um drug that's

411
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,879
approved for the treatment of this

412
00:17:24,519 --> 00:17:29,119
disease but the thing about all these

413
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,559
different treatments is none of them

414
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,119
extend survival in a meaningful way none

415
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,839
of them cure the disease none of them

416
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:39,479
help manage the symptoms and because ALS

417
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:42,319
is so complex between Patient to Patient

418
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:44,038
there's so many different gen IR

419
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:47,038
irregularities and different things

420
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:49,119
going on um right now practitioners they

421
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:51,400
sort of prescribe to the patient in this

422
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:54,038
cocktail approach here take all four

423
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:56,320
treatments right and all four will maybe

424
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:58,879
help you um on your

425
00:17:56,319 --> 00:18:01,599
journey so what we aim to do do instead

426
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:03,400
of having to have the patient have um

427
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,439
four or five different treatments to

428
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,159
help them we aim to put all the benefits

429
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,679
of the cannabis plant and the various

430
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:11,720
different ingredients in the cannabis

431
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,038
plant into a single or a monotherapy

432
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,960
that they can take on a day-to-day basis

433
00:18:14,038 --> 00:18:17,839
that will not only help them address

434
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,000
their various different symptoms their

435
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:21,519
pain help them sleep better help them

436
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,279
with their hunger and their appetite

437
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:27,759
help them with um um keeping on muscle

438
00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:29,879
mass um but also improve their quality

439
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,879
of life and then potentially be neur

440
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,400
protective as well and extend their

441
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:37,320
survival we think we have a sort of

442
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:41,440
all-in-one approach and this is where we

443
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:43,319
get to benefit from the multi the

444
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,679
multiple applications of the cannabis

445
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:48,000
plant and all various indications we

446
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,159
don't need one thing to do one thing

447
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,038
very well when you're dealing with a

448
00:18:50,159 --> 00:18:55,640
complex disease like ALS you sort of

449
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,960
need the poly phological approach and

450
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,600
this is where we get disadvantage plus

451
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,720
the an advantage of having our superp

452
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:05,439
poent anti-inflammatories and our C

453
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,279
flins in this m stream excellent

454
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,880
excellent no and you mentioned so the

455
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:12,720
current medications they they don't

456
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,640
relieve symptoms they don't extend

457
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,960
lifespan there I think there was another

458
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,840
thing you said they that they're not

459
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:23,159
doing so what are they

460
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:25,839
doing well they help right um um but

461
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:27,280
they don't cure there's no cure for alsc

462
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:30,119
right we don't really understand what's

463
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,480
going on and again each of these

464
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:35,798
medicines they're designed to

465
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:38,599
specifically do one or another thing um

466
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:41,480
help with patient um subpopulations of

467
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:44,359
ALS patients that have um one disease

468
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,200
modification off or another right but

469
00:19:44,359 --> 00:19:49,000
they don't help in

470
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:51,679
a broad spectrum if you would call it to

471
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,919
the broader population right and none of

472
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,440
them none of them address the symptoms

473
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,679
like we know we can address the symptoms

474
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:59,558
with cannabis that's why ALS patients

475
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,720
even if they're taking a medicine one or

476
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:04,558
the other they'll still often smoke

477
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:06,640
cannabis or have a A tinure or have a

478
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:08,519
topical or something like that to be

479
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,360
able to help them with the symptoms that

480
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:13,079
they're also suffering

481
00:20:10,359 --> 00:20:14,879
from EXC so this is where yeah this is

482
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:17,158
where we think we can come in and we can

483
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,039
really help because again we know things

484
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:21,840
like cannabis helps with spasticity it

485
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:24,240
helps with muscle spasms cramps the pain

486
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:27,119
the fatigue depression nausea so on and

487
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,279
so forth um and we know that with

488
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:31,319
cannabis you can have these benefits

489
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:33,879
have an improved quality of life without

490
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:36,279
a host of a whole bunch of other adverse

491
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:39,000
effects excellent yeah and it sort of

492
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:41,440
seems to kind of illustrate you know the

493
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,480
difference between cannabis medicine

494
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,640
approach and a traditional farmer

495
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:48,319
approach right is like Pharma is is like

496
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:51,038
you said typically focused on you know a

497
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:53,480
single molecule for a single um

498
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:55,679
indication um which it sounds like is

499
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,558
what's being used for ALS now but it's

500
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,080
not really effective because it is such

501
00:20:57,558 --> 00:21:00,839
a

502
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:03,240
um a

503
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:05,000
broad uh disease where it's it's not

504
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:07,759
sort of a one-sized fits-all and that's

505
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,599
where something like a a cannabis might

506
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:14,119
actually be a better approach because it

507
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:17,119
it can help in so many different ways it

508
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:20,359
can be if you can deliver it with the

509
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,639
CMC and the pharmaceutical standard

510
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:24,479
right um in Pharma they do do

511
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,278
combination therapies like I mentioned

512
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,880
they still use the cocktail approach for

513
00:21:26,278 --> 00:21:32,519
ALS they have four proved diseases a for

514
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,919
ped medicines sorry that can help treat

515
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:36,519
one aspect or another of the disease and

516
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:38,240
then they deliver it together together

517
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:41,879
in the combination approach but the

518
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,319
easier way to get it approved um because

519
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,080
you have to do the clinical trial

520
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,798
because you have to have the CMC and be

521
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:49,558
able to produce it consistently every

522
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:51,278
single time right it's to have one thing

523
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:53,359
that does one thing very well get it to

524
00:21:51,278 --> 00:21:55,720
Market and then let the practitioners

525
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:58,439
prescribe it or use it to help their

526
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:00,640
patients this is where again um our

527
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,440
learnings from those that have done it

528
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,759
before those that have done it at the

529
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,840
pharmaceutical standard with satex and F

530
00:22:04,759 --> 00:22:09,679
dialect we get the benefit of

531
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:11,399
understanding how do you make this

532
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,240
happen how do you make this happen with

533
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,320
Botanical mixtures how do you make this

534
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:20,278
happen with Canabis and how do you and

535
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:22,119
once you can do that from a a production

536
00:22:20,278 --> 00:22:24,599
weight from a clinical trial weight from

537
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,879
a bat toat repeatability rate then the

538
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:29,319
patients get all the real benefits that

539
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,440
cannabis can offer in a standardized

540
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:34,558
consistent method yeah I mean the whole

541
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,000
consistency thing that is one of the

542
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:38,119
greatest challenges with cannabis

543
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,640
medicine for sure

544
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:44,038
um so another but another challenge with

545
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:46,159
cannabis medicine is of course the cost

546
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,200
um so I'm curious and maybe it's way too

547
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,760
soon to tell but like how would the you

548
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,600
know the cost of this type of

549
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:55,278
therapeutic sort of compare to uh kind

550
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:57,519
of the standard uh ALS

551
00:22:55,278 --> 00:22:59,400
treatment probably a little bit soon to

552
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:02,759
tell right yeah a lot of that's going to

553
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,000
come uh come after we finish our full

554
00:23:02,759 --> 00:23:07,079
scale up our CMC and have the cost of

555
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,119
good Souls but the thing is is once you

556
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:11,678
get it through the clinical trials once

557
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,319
you get it uh approved by Regulators

558
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:16,080
then the payers the insurance will pay

559
00:23:13,319 --> 00:23:18,119
for it right and the nice thing about

560
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:20,918
this is that it's not just res

561
00:23:18,119 --> 00:23:22,479
restricted to a medical cannabis program

562
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,440
when you get it approved as a drug you

563
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:28,000
can cross Interstate lines and the big

564
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
insurance companies um can pay for it

565
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,679
not only in the US but also this is the

566
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,439
approach that will take in targeting the

567
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:36,679
payers and getting the payers to approve

568
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,320
reimbursement all over the

569
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:40,798
world excellent no I know you're up

570
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,200
there in Canada which is a little bit

571
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,798
different than the us because you do

572
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,558
have a federal medical cannabis program

573
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:51,480
up there um so with the path to getting

574
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:55,000
the payers to um reimburse or or pay for

575
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,360
um this therapeutic is it an easier path

576
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,839
up there than the

577
00:23:56,359 --> 00:24:00,439
US probably I'm not going to say easier

578
00:23:58,839 --> 00:24:02,720
because again we're not going to go down

579
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:05,038
the medical cannabis route to start

580
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
we're going after pharmaceutical right

581
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,558
got it so we'll go the same route as

582
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:13,759
traditional Pharmaceuticals like GW uh

583
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:16,399
Fara did with epid and satex to get full

584
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:19,558
reimbursing but that's not to say that

585
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,159
we don't have a fallback plan if we have

586
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:25,359
to go to a fallback excellent always

587
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,039
good to have a fallback plan ex um and

588
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:29,879
in what concent you we mentioned before

589
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:32,960
um that these are in very low

590
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:36,039
concentrations in the plant um at what

591
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,440
sort of concentrations are these um

592
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,319
these compounds effective is it um a

593
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:44,000
little goes a long

594
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:46,960
way well again

595
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,919
different dosages for different

596
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,558
indications and our ALS formulation is a

597
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,880
combination of a variety of different

598
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:57,759
things including our can FS so in the

599
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,278
ALS formulation we don't need a lot of

600
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:03,679
can Flavin a to or B to work um to help

601
00:25:02,278 --> 00:25:06,919
the patient because it's not working

602
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:09,559
alone right versus another indication we

603
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:12,880
may want more of it because the can

604
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:15,000
flavins might do something better than

605
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,840
uh a tarpine or another cannaboid for

606
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:20,440
that example right or the can fibs might

607
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:22,240
even just work better all alone instead

608
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,558
of in combination for a different type

609
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,319
of disease so it really depends on what

610
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:29,879
we're talking about and who we're aiming

611
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:31,798
to help and and I'll also say it also

612
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,799
depends on the physical makeup of the

613
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:37,359
person for example um we have some of

614
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,038
our extracts right now um are pilot

615
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,359
skill extracts they're not on in the

616
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:46,519
market yet but I consume them right but

617
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:50,158
I'm 65 240 my mom isn't 65 240 so where

618
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:54,240
my mom takes one one um tincture one

619
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,720
droplet one tincture full of our extract

620
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,038
I have to take two or three to get equal

621
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,839
therapeutic dose so this is some of the

622
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:03,079
complexities about cannabis and about

623
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:04,759
humans and about making Pharmaceuticals

624
00:26:03,079 --> 00:26:07,918
because all of us have different genetic

625
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:09,839
makeups different physical makeups right

626
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,520
what works for one person might not work

627
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:14,158
for the other so sometimes you may have

628
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,599
to titrate up to your dose find your

629
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:21,039
maximum tolerable dose

630
00:26:16,599 --> 00:26:23,678
and do what works for you yep absolutely

631
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:27,079
yeah that's it's the standard that's

632
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,120
that's what um Bonnie Goldstein and

633
00:26:27,079 --> 00:26:31,119
Dustin

634
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:32,439
and Ethan Russo of course talk about and

635
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:33,918
they'll be talking about again this year

636
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:36,159
at the medical practicum so we're

637
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,799
excited about that so so you said that

638
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,278
you you take um one of your extracts um

639
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:43,278
daily or is that just for kind of

640
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:46,919
General Wellness

641
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:48,558
or well for General Wellness and I can't

642
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:50,759
put something on the market that I

643
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:53,519
haven't put through the ringer myself Me

644
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:56,759
and My Husky Sky we're conera 1.0 taste

645
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:59,558
testers if Sky loves it if I'm okay then

646
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:01,919
I feel good with everyone else so um I

647
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:05,639
do take it right now for general for

648
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:08,600
General Wellness also um I'm currently

649
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,360
our longest um safety study our

650
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:13,398
long-term safety study because I've been

651
00:27:10,359 --> 00:27:15,038
taking it since day one right and wanted

652
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:18,719
to make sure that again no stomach

653
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:21,480
issues no nausea no Adverse Events right

654
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:23,278
I feel really really fine the other

655
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,798
thing that I can say about our extract

656
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,278
one of the things that I've come to

657
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,879
found is um the other day I hurt my back

658
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:32,240
in the gym and it was a crazy day I was

659
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:33,760
deadlifting I was deadlifting angry you

660
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,359
should never deadlift angry because

661
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:37,879
that's when injuries happen and I

662
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:41,000
learned it the hard way but it was very

663
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:43,760
interesting because when I tweaked my um

664
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,319
the muscle in my back um I still had

665
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:48,119
range of motion I knew I was hurt I felt

666
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,960
that I was hurt but I could still move I

667
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:53,839
could still get through my workout

668
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:56,000
versus traditionally um or if I well

669
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:58,558
traditionally I'll say my back would

670
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,319
lock up so

671
00:27:58,558 --> 00:28:02,599
after that injury happened I remember

672
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:04,839
the next day the next two days I was

673
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:07,000
taking my extract again I was like I

674
00:28:04,839 --> 00:28:09,398
slept okay I woke up my back didn't lock

675
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,919
up I wasn't super sore I'm like this is

676
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:13,558
weird but is this in my head right

677
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,080
because I want our extract to work more

678
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,398
than anyone but I'm like I definitely

679
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:19,519
know I'm

680
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:21,239
injured um and then u i remember me and

681
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:22,798
my mom we were sharing a bottle at that

682
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:25,839
time so I left the bottle at home and I

683
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:29,158
went to my fiance I st spent the weekend

684
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,879
at my fiance I woke up Saturday morning

685
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:32,399
and I hadn't had the extract and I'm

686
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,600
like okay I'm starting to feel a little

687
00:28:32,398 --> 00:28:36,319
bit more tightness in my back right but

688
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,319
I'm okay right I still have my range of

689
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:41,038
motion I can get in and out of my car

690
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:43,200
stand up sit down okay but then the

691
00:28:41,038 --> 00:28:45,759
Sunday when I woke up my back was locked

692
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,278
I was like this is completely messed I

693
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,440
can't believe this is what my back was

694
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:51,599
going through this whole time I don't

695
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,399
know what's going on I called my mom

696
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:55,480
immediately M I'm coming home to take

697
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:58,199
the rest of the bottle right now sorry

698
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,038
you can get from the next batch because

699
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:02,640
there's no like I couldn't every time I

700
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:04,519
was getting up sitting down it was so

701
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,880
tight I had to like you know you know

702
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:08,399
when you're injured and it's really

703
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:11,919
tight you have to like slowly but surely

704
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:14,079
bring yourself down and then um no lie I

705
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:17,440
started to take my extract again at the

706
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,720
usual dose and then again the next day

707
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,200
and the day after I was still hurt but I

708
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,519
had my range of motion I can get in and

709
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,159
out of my car without thinking twice

710
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:29,720
about it I was like this is actually

711
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,440
like really Illuminating because if um

712
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,200
I'm 33 right now but we know that as

713
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,919
people age as um they get more chronic

714
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,519
elments more arthritics so on and so

715
00:29:36,919 --> 00:29:41,480
forth that they're going through things

716
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:43,558
like this I think that an extract like

717
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:46,319
this can really help really help improve

718
00:29:43,558 --> 00:29:48,038
quality of life really help them just

719
00:29:46,319 --> 00:29:51,038
manage the symptoms of whatever they're

720
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:54,679
going through and that was um the first

721
00:29:51,038 --> 00:29:56,278
real time where I was like okay I know

722
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,679
what I read I know what I'm seeing in

723
00:29:56,278 --> 00:30:01,440
the experience exper experiments but now

724
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:03,240
I actually felt it in my own body about

725
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,320
the power of this extract the power of

726
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:07,599
the enriched extracts and what it can do

727
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:11,119
wow no so that's that's some power

728
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:13,639
powerful anti-inflammatory there huh it

729
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,479
was it was definitely helpful and again

730
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,880
ever since then I'm like nope Mom we

731
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,000
have to wait for the second I have to

732
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,679
have a bottle with me at all times

733
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,880
excellent all right um so in in kind of

734
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,919
winding down here I did want to kind of

735
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,200
check in with you too because we

736
00:30:26,919 --> 00:30:32,360
mentioned at the top that you spoke last

737
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,360
year about using can flavens for G

738
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:37,759
blastoma um I'm wondering what's

739
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:39,798
happened uh on that front since then um

740
00:30:37,759 --> 00:30:43,319
is that is that also kind of moving

741
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:46,720
along the uh um the

742
00:30:43,319 --> 00:30:49,720
pipeline so slowly but surely cancer is

743
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,079
very difficult and tricky sure alss

744
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,159
complex as well cancer even more right

745
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,839
um we're still continuing that project

746
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,960
is still going on at the the University

747
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:03,158
of walf we're actually getting ready to

748
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:06,000
do a series of organoid studies and not

749
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,880
only for G blastoma breast cancer and

750
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,638
breast cancer metastasis studies as well

751
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,278
because again we know that our molecules

752
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:16,079
have the track B activity plus their

753
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:17,798
antiinflammatories these are still being

754
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,398
done at a pre-clinical phase the

755
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:21,798
challenge that we are going to have

756
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:24,239
right now is I really need key opinion

757
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,440
leaders and people who can help us do

758
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,839
the work at the next phase I'm not a

759
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,159
practitioning doctor

760
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,158
uh a practicing doctor I'm not a

761
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,200
principal investigator in the

762
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,159
traditional right right and I don't see

763
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,639
these patients so really for us U the

764
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,840
next phase of work that we need to do

765
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:45,319
once these sets of experiments um are

766
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:48,798
complete is finding someone who's

767
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:50,759
interested in looking at uh future

768
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,079
alternatives to cancer treatments small

769
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,839
molecule cancer treatments and taking a

770
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:57,359
look at the data that we have and having

771
00:31:54,839 --> 00:32:00,038
the experience and the knowhow to be

772
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:02,119
able to help us take this forward

773
00:32:00,038 --> 00:32:04,759
excellent we have some we have yeah we

774
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:07,199
have some ideas about about um other

775
00:32:04,759 --> 00:32:09,038
areas of cancer that we might be able to

776
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,159
help in like things like cancer pain

777
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,960
which are inflammation related but when

778
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:17,440
it comes to things like again Leo blast

779
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,120
brain cancer um breast cancer we really

780
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,558
need people um from the community from

781
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:24,119
out there in the rest of the world to

782
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:26,240
help us Mo those things from excellent

783
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,439
well I do know an of an event that's

784
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,558
happening in May where there's a lot of

785
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:34,759
uh clinicians uh who might be able to

786
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:36,278
help you out so oh 100% for sure last

787
00:32:34,759 --> 00:32:40,960
year all the feedback and the people

788
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:44,278
that I met at canmed were awesome um and

789
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:47,120
a lot of interesting leads that I am

790
00:32:44,278 --> 00:32:49,000
very excited to follow up on this year

791
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:52,479
to be able to show okay now we know that

792
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,159
we can actually do x y and z now can we

793
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,278
actually and we can actually produce

794
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,399
more now what are the next steps to

795
00:32:56,278 --> 00:33:01,558
actually getting this one step further

796
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:04,759
down the line excellent oh happy to

797
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,519
Foster those relationships for sure um

798
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:09,000
no I do actually want to Circle back

799
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:10,798
about you know your story about sort of

800
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,759
using the extract as a as an

801
00:33:10,798 --> 00:33:14,599
anti-inflammatory and sort of as almost

802
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,919
like a a preventative or General

803
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:19,359
Wellness now is that another line that

804
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,600
you're pursuing as well as um sort of

805
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:25,638
making this available to uh to folks to

806
00:33:22,599 --> 00:33:28,079
to take regularly or when they deadlift

807
00:33:25,638 --> 00:33:31,199
angry yes

808
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:34,439
so hopefully this year um sometime

809
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,480
between Q2 and Q3 we will have an

810
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,558
extract ready for launch in the US

811
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,440
markets we have a group that we we've

812
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:43,960
been working with in Oregon shout out to

813
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,720
F soil um they we've been able to

814
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,960
transfer our technology to them they've

815
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,679
been working on scaling it up um now

816
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:53,240
we're at the last step on making sure

817
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,880
that um our excipients uh our excipients

818
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,919
and our ingredient stays in excipients

819
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,960
in the carrier oil that we have our B

820
00:33:56,919 --> 00:34:00,600
moding and our labeling all worked out

821
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,038
and then we will be launching this in an

822
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:05,959
e-commerce type of a way so very very

823
00:34:04,038 --> 00:34:09,960
soon we're right around the corner this

824
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:12,240
isn't a high concentration can Flavin um

825
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:14,320
extract product but it is an enriched

826
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:16,918
polyphenol product the camp flavens are

827
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,838
in it in more of an amount than any

828
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:21,559
other product that's on the market as of

829
00:34:18,838 --> 00:34:23,918
today it's not at our full Botanical

830
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:26,039
drug characterization level yet but it

831
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:27,598
doesn't have to be as a neutral and as a

832
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:29,599
health and Warmness prodct

833
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,039
so for us again the most important thing

834
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:33,480
is going to be getting this into the

835
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:35,320
hands of people who need it the most

836
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,878
allowing these ingredients to start to

837
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:40,399
get into their um daily consumption

838
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:42,679
patterns um allow to start to accumulate

839
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:45,000
in the body and do what it does well

840
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,000
even if could be at a more of a

841
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,679
nutriceutical health and wellness

842
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,960
everyday level and for those suffering

843
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:53,760

871

usually goes on Lin but what I would

872
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:09,159
ultimately say is to come to canmen 2024

873
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:11,199
canmen 2024 was very important for me

874
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:13,598
last year I'm learning about where the

875
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:15,199
state of cannabis research is meeting

876
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,039
all the different key opinion leaders

877
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:18,679
and the P people who are treating

878
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:20,960
patients suffering from a variety of

879
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:23,679
different things of cannabis and also

880
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:25,800
allowing us to tell our story so I was

881
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:27,559
very happy to be able to get on that

882
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:31,200
