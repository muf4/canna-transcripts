00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,120
hi

2
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:08,240
i'm oren davinsky from the nyu school of

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,719
medicine

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,759
and i'm here to present on the gw

5
00:00:10,718 --> 00:00:16,000
pharmaceuticals epidialex trials

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,839
now these trials have occurred over the

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,399
course of several years

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,600
and have now included both open label

9
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:24,959
trials

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,599
and randomized phase three double-blind

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,000
trials

12
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:29,759
i'm going to summarize mainly the data

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,920
from the open label trials

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,359
and then give a bit of data from the

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
newly released

16
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:36,719
drive a syndrome study which was a

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
double blind

18
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
randomized placebo-controlled trial so

19
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,000
to begin with

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,120
this second slide summarizes our open

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,399
label experience with cannabidiol or

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:50,479
epidialex

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,000
which was presented at the american

24
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:55,198
epilepsy society meeting

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,679
in december of 2015 in philadelphia

26
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,519
and i should start out by just saying

27
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:02,399
that epidiolex

28
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,280
is a commercial product produced by gw

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,599
pharma

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:10,960
which contains 99 cannabidiol

31
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,359
in an oil base this is cannabidiol is a

32
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:14,319
very

33
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:14,959
lipophilic molecule so it needs to be

34
00:01:14,319 --> 00:01:18,879
dissolved

35
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:21,679
in an oil and that is the way it was

36
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:22,719
given to these children and young adults

37
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,320
so for this

38
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:26,400
first set of data that i'll be

39
00:01:24,319 --> 00:01:29,118
presenting it is the

40
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,040
largest and most complete set and

41
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:33,599
included

42
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,759
313 children treated at 16

43
00:01:33,599 --> 00:01:37,599
epilepsy centers over a little over a

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,118
two year period

45
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,239
these children and young adults included

46
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:45,599
261 individuals

47
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:48,078
who received the epidiolex for at least

48
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,519
three months of continuous therapy and

49
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,879
that's important because that's the

50
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:52,798
standard

51
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,000
time duration that we look for in the

52
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,280
fda trials

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,078
for both safety and efficacy in the

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,759
trials

55
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:01,759
that i'm presenting here on the open

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
label data there was a wide

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,159
range of patient ages between four

58
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,360
months and 41 years of age

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,560
with a mean age of 12 years old

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,200
the doses that were used varied widely

61
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,959
from a low of 2 milligrams per kilogram

62
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:19,359
to a maximal dose

63
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,439
in some sites that got approval from the

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
fda to go to higher doses

65
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:24,800
of up to 50 milligrams per kilogram per

66
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:26,560
day

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,719
but i should emphasize for the vast

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,598
majority of patients the maximal dose

69
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:35,039
was 25 milligrams per kilogram per day

70
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,318
or lower of the epidialex and for this

71
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:39,519
group of the

72
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:43,518
overall 313 patients

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:47,039
epilepsy diagnoses was unknown in 19

74
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,080
was drive a syndrome in 17

75
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:53,120
and was lenox gastow syndrome in

76
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,080
a few percent lower the median

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,480
convulsive

78
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:02,800
seizure frequency in patients

79
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:07,280
across this study was 48.8 percent

80
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,560
and in dravet syndrome patients 52.3

81
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,959
percent

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,318
in lennox gastow syndrome patients the

83
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,519
median reduction of

84
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:18,079
atonic seizures the most paradomatic and

85
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:21,200
signature seizure type for that syndrome

86
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,360
was 71.1 percent

87
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:24,878
now the big caveat with this study and

88
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,519
i'll repeat it again

89
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:28,639
is that it was an open label study the

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,120
physicians knew what they were

91
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,759
prescribing and giving to the patients

92
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,560
the parents and patients who were aware

93
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:35,919
of it

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,479
knew what they were getting they were

95
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,119
getting the actual labeled compound

96
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:42,959
in a jar that set up a dialects so they

97
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,439
everyone knew what was being given

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,080
and what was being received we had no

99
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:48,400
placebo

100
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,560
group in this and there was no blinding

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,599
so we have no idea from this

102
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,479
data set what the placebo response was

103
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:58,238
in this group of patients among all the

104
00:03:56,479 --> 00:04:00,639
patients that we treated

105
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,080
and that we had the duration of time of

106
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:05,518
three months or longer

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:08,719
47 of them had a greater than 50

108
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,759
reduction in seizures as far as seizure

109
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:13,199
freedom

110
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:15,759
nine percent of patients overall and 13

111
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:16,478
of patients withdrav a syndrome did

112
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,319
obtain

113
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,319
seizure freedom during the study

114
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,879
now one of the things that emerged from

115
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,759
this open label experience

116
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,240
is that patients who are on clobazam and

117
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,759
then epidiolex or cannabidiol was added

118
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,600
to the therapy

119
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,759
we did see increases in sedation

120
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,680
and in select patients for whom we don't

121
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,520
have enough to say this definitively but

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
we've seen this dr elizabeth thiel

123
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,120
published this in epilepsia

124
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:47,039
dr dan friedman one of my colleagues

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
here at nyu published this as an

126
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,439
abstract and presented it the american

127
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,800
epilepsy society meeting a year before

128
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:57,040
is that when cannabidiol is added

129
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,560
to clobazam in a patient who's already

130
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,840
taken clobazam

131
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,918
we see elevations in the endes methyl

132
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:06,638
metabolite of clobozam

133
00:05:03,918 --> 00:05:08,079
and that metabolite we believe is

134
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,280
biologically active

135
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:14,240
with regards to both efficacy

136
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:15,839
and toxicity so if a child or young

137
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,639
adult is on clobazam

138
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,119
and we add epidialex to that child's

139
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:24,160
regimen or young adult's regimen

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:27,519
we expect that in some cases we may

141
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,600
we likely may see an elevation in that

142
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,439
endes methyl metabolite

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
and that could lead to more tiredness

144
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:35,038
for example as a side effect

145
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
and potentially could lead to greater

146
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:39,199
effectiveness

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
of the cbd through this drug interaction

148
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,639
mechanism

149
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,479
there are some additional caveats about

150
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,560
this there are other drugs

151
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:52,319
that can also inhibit the metabolism

152
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:54,478
of this enzyme that converts

153
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:55,599
that degrades the endos methyl

154
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,918
metabolite

155
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,199
and so other drugs that may inhibit that

156
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,839
include

157
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,919
steropental which is also used in dravet

158
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:06,318
syndrome especially in european patients

159
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:09,359
but some american patients and

160
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,560
felba made as well so it may be patients

161
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,160
with dravet

162
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,839
who are on clobazam and stereopental

163
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,400
and potentially felt made as well we

164
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,799
don't have the data yet to confirm this

165
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:22,638
but we've seen instances where we have

166
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
not seen an elevation

167
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:26,400
in the endes methyl metabolite when

168
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,720
cannabidiol

169
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:30,000
is added to clobazam therapy and that

170
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,160
may simply be

171
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
because in those patients their

172
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,680
endesimal metabolite levels

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
are already quite high because of the

174
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,439
co-therapy with a drug

175
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,240
like steripental so that's an evolving

176
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:43,120
story

177
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,720
we need much more data to define it but

178
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,959
it is something to be aware of

179
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,080
in clinical practice and also in

180
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,680
research methodology

181
00:06:48,079 --> 00:06:53,359
studies so in the presentation of the

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,120
data at the american epilepsy society

183
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,280
meeting we did look at those patients

184
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,879
who are on clove exam co-therapy

185
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,559
because we think that's an important

186
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:03,199
group to look at

187
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,959
and indeed there was a somewhat higher

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:07,520
rate of treatment response

189
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:08,959
a median reduction in the convulsive

190
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:10,240
seizure frequency

191
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,439
which for those who were already on

192
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:16,478
clobazen was 56.4 percent

193
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:18,719
versus 35 at week 12

194
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:20,240
for those who are not on clove exam

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
co-therapy

196
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,840
and as i said this we think may be in

197
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,639
large measure because

198
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,560
the cbd or cannabidiol induces an

199
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,639
elevation of that metabolite which is

200
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,759
biologically active

201
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:36,560
however clobizam co-therapy effect

202
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,720
did not seem to influence the efficacy

203
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,598
results in either the dravae

204
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,199
or lennox gasto syndrome groups and it

205
00:07:41,598 --> 00:07:46,240
may be because some of these patients

206
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:48,879
were already on medications that induced

207
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,000
that were inhibited that conversion of

208
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,160
that metabolite

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,839
or other mechanisms so again larger data

210
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
sets will be needed and we hope

211
00:07:53,839 --> 00:08:00,000
the randomized trials will shed light on

212
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:02,079
this as well with regards to the safety

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,279
of cannabidiol the open label studies

214
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,800
also provided some

215
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:07,598
some signals that we think were very

216
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,400
helpful among the adverse events

217
00:08:07,598 --> 00:08:10,719
that were seen in at least 10 percent of

218
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,719
the

219
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:18,560
treated patients were somnolence in 23

220
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,919
fatigue in 17 diarrhea

221
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:25,360
23 decreased appetite

222
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:28,478
17 vomiting in 10 percent

223
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,120
and convulsions in 17

224
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:33,199
the convulsion is an interesting one in

225
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,599
that it's hard to know because we did

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,719
not

227
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,560
have placebo-controlled data

228
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,719
we don't know what the natural history

229
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,838
of the epilepsy is in this specific

230
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,159
patient group

231
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
and so we know for many of the children

232
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:48,080
and young adults who were entered

233
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,839
essentially all of them had very severe

234
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,000
treatment-resistant epilepsies and for

235
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,000
those of us of us in practice

236
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,159
we know these patients have bad days and

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
bad weeks and bad months and good days

238
00:08:56,159 --> 00:09:00,559
and good weeks and good months

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,639
and for some of these patients what was

240
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,278
listed as a convulsion as a side effect

241
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,720
in many of the investigators views we

242
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,080
didn't list that as a side effect

243
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,278
because we thought that was the natural

244
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
history of the disorder

245
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:12,799
whereas other investigators felt that

246
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,560
any difference

247
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,319
from the baseline period should be

248
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,239
listed as an adverse event

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,480
so there's a lot of variability in how

250
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,240
different investigators interpreted

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
the same observations and again i don't

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,639
think any of us know what the right

253
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,160
answer is this is

254
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:28,319
clinical medicine and how we best

255
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:31,679
attribute things we see

256
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,800
to potential causes with regards to the

257
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:37,120
adverse events there were 14 patients or

258
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:39,120
4 percent of the overall study group

259
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,639
who had an adverse event leading to

260
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,679
discontinuation

261
00:09:40,639 --> 00:09:44,879
and there were 36 patients or 12 percent

262
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,799
of those treated

263
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:48,320
who withdrew because of a lack of

264
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,120
efficacy

265
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,160
in addition 16 patients or 5 percent of

266
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
the cohort

267
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:56,240
reported serious adverse events that the

268
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,959
investigator

269
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,680
considered to be treatment related these

270
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,319
included

271
00:09:59,679 --> 00:10:05,120
altered liver enzymes in four patients

272
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,760
all four of those were on valproic acid

273
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,600
status epilepticus or convulsion in four

274
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:09,838
patients and i discussed the challenges

275
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,680
of

276
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:13,440
understanding what their true

277
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:14,799
relationship is i don't think we can say

278
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,760
definitively

279
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:18,958
diarrhea in four patients weight loss in

280
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:22,000
four patients

281
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:22,719
and thrombocytopenia in one patient and

282
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,720
that patient

283
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:29,120
was also on co-therapy with valproate

284
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,120
now i'm going to turn in the next set of

285
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,240
slides to discussing the open label

286
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,480
experience

287
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,039
that was published in lancet neurology

288
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,680
in december of 2015.

289
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,319
this represents a smaller group of

290
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,359
patients

291
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,240
and a smaller number of centers and

292
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,680
this was the first set of data that was

293
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,839
really curated

294
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:51,199
and annotated that we could go through

295
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,519
very carefully

296
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,920
make sure it was highly accurate that

297
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:59,120
the methodologies were consistent

298
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:00,000
and so it was able to be combined for

299
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
publication

300
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,759
in a high impact journal this was 11

301
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,480
centers beginning

302
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:10,240
january of 2014 and going through 2015

303
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,159
214 patients with treatment resistant

304
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,639
epilepsy were enrolled and this

305
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:16,399
overlaps entirely with the other set of

306
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,120
data that i just presented

307
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,120
there were 162 patients who had at least

308
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,720
three months of continuous therapy for

309
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,839
which we could derive good safety and

310
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
efficacy

311
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
uh or i should say for here safety data

312
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,159
and 137

313
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:31,919
of whom we had sufficient data for the

314
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,159
efficacy analysis

315
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:37,679
the mean age in this group of patients

316
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:40,958
was 10.5 years with a range of 1

317
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,599
to 30 years they started typically at 2

318
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:46,239
to five milligrams per kilogram per day

319
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,000
and then were increased mainly to 25

320
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,799
migs per kilo per day

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,159
but in a few centers up to 50 megs per

322
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:55,199
kilo per day

323
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:58,078
and this flow diagram just shows the

324
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,839
group of patients who are enrolled some

325
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,559
were enrolled but did not have

326
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,399
12 weeks of follow-up after their first

327
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,119
dose of cannabidiol

328
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,120
11 stopped before that one due to an

329
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,519
allergy from the oil

330
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,560
one had elevated liver enzymes that

331
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,959
individual was on valproic acid

332
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:19,039
one had somnolence and you can see four

333
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,559
had worsening seizures and poor efficacy

334
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:22,000
and the family decided

335
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:24,000
instead of waiting they really just

336
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,679
wanted to exit the trial

337
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,240
so there were 162 left for the safety

338
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:31,039
and tolerability analysis and then we

339
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,799
excluded

340
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:38,000
25 of those from the efficacy analysis

341
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:39,599
for various predetermined criteria so at

342
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
the outset we said we'd be studying

343
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,240
children one year of age

344
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,360
and older there were several children

345
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,159
with progressive

346
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,079
disorders which were again an exclusion

347
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:52,399
criteria for the main protocol and they

348
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:54,399
were included for compassionate reasons

349
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,720
and then there were 21 patients who had

350
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:59,200
no convulsive or motor seizures

351
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:00,639
as we defined them in the methodology

352
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,759
for both the protocol and the lancet

353
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,959
neurology

354
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,958
paper and you can read that in the

355
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:06,159
methods and so they were excluded from

356
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,399
the efficacy analysis

357
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,480
because they didn't meet the criteria of

358
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:13,440
the seizure type that we wanted to count

359
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,959
and that left 137 for whom we did

360
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,040
analyze

361
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:21,679
so this is a breakdown of the groups by

362
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:22,958
sex and you can see it was fairly evenly

363
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,838
distributed

364
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:27,599
between males and females the number of

365
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
background drugs which ranged in

366
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,399
anti-epileptic drugs from one to seven

367
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,120
but averaged

368
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,440
three and again quite similar in the two

369
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
group

370
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,800
safety and efficacy analysis groups

371
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:41,039
vagus nerve stimulation was used in

372
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:42,799
about ten percent of patients ketogenic

373
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,919
diet and about eight or nine percent of

374
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:46,879
patients

375
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,799
and globosamcotherapy was present in

376
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:50,320
about half of our sample

377
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:52,799
and then you can see the range of

378
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
seizure types there were focal seizures

379
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,919
in

380
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,720
36 percent of patients there were tonic

381
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:59,439
seizures

382
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,560
41 percent of patients atonic seizures

383
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,959
and about 20

384
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,919
to 23 percent of patients tonic clonic

385
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,759
seizures

386
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:07,039
in the majority greater than 50 percent

387
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:09,198
of patients

388
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:11,278
and other motor seizures were identified

389
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:14,719
again in a majority of patients

390
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,679
the next slide goes over the diagnoses

391
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,160
of the patients

392
00:14:15,679 --> 00:14:20,319
who were enrolled in the study that was

393
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:23,360
reported in lancet neurology

394
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,399
and this includes dravet syndrome in 20

395
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,039
percent

396
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,720
of the safety group and 23 percent of

397
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:32,000
the efficacy group

398
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:35,040
lennox gastow syndrome in 19 of the

399
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,519
safety group and 22 percent of the

400
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:39,198
efficacy group and then you can see

401
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,480
spread out a number of

402
00:14:39,198 --> 00:14:44,319
other disorders from investigators who

403
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,879
categorize the diagnosis as minimal

404
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,360
brain dysfunction

405
00:14:45,879 --> 00:14:50,159
cdkl5 tuberous sclerosis epilepsy with

406
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,199
myoclonic

407
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:53,838
absences febrile infection related

408
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,120
syndrome

409
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,040
odahara jevins and several others

410
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,039
so it was a wide range of patients but

411
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:02,639
dravet and lennox gusto were the two

412
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:06,639
most common

413
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,600
here is the side effect or adverse event

414
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,480
profile of the 162 patients that we

415
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,320
analyzed

416
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,079
and you can see on the top this is very

417
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,959
similar to what was reported before

418
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:18,000
somnolence decreased appetite diarrhea

419
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:20,319
fatigue

420
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,399
convulsion there were some patients with

421
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,120
increased appetite

422
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,120
were the main adverse events in more

423
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,959
than five percent of patients

424
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,679
with regards to the serious adverse

425
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:33,758
events status epilepticus was reported

426
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:34,958
in six percent of patients diarrhea and

427
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,199
two percent

428
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:38,239
uh decreased weight in one percent and

429
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:41,039
then a number of

430
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,560
uh serious adverse events in less than

431
00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:44,240
one percent of patients

432
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,319
so i want to finish now with what i

433
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,560
think is the most exciting data to share

434
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,600
with you this was recently

435
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:54,239
released as a press release by gw

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,040
pharma and this is based on the phase

437
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,278
three

438
00:15:55,039 --> 00:15:58,799
randomized placebo-controlled

439
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,198
double-blind trial

440
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:02,799
that involved a number of centers in

441
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,120
both the united states

442
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,479
and in europe and this was selectively

443
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,198
for patients

444
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,600
with dravet syndrome with the epilepsy

445
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:13,679
study consortium and ingrid sheffer

446
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,639
doing the screening to make sure all of

447
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,758
the patients

448
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,600
fit the clinical and diagnostic criteria

449
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,320
for draeva syndrome

450
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,199
there were 128 pediatric patients

451
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,278
enrolled

452
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:27,838
ages 2 to 18 years 61 of those patients

453
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,838
were in

454
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,360
randomized to receive epidialex or

455
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:34,480
cannabidiol

456
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,399
59 of them were randomized to placebo

457
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,039
and you can see the mean ages for the

458
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,559
groups are essentially identical at 9.7

459
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,198
or 9.8

460
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:44,239
years these patients had all

461
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,120
treatment-resistant

462
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,240
epilepsy they had an average of three

463
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,720
concomitant

464
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,839
anti-epileptic drugs and they averaged

465
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,160
having been treated

466
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,160
with more than four previous

467
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,559
anti-epileptic drugs none of them

468
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:59,759
in multiple combinations had controlled

469
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,239
their seizures

470
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,360
and the median baseline of convulsive

471
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,038
seizures

472
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,400
in this group of patients who were

473
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,759
randomized

474
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,640
was 13 per month so again a high seizure

475
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:14,240
frequency

476
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,759
for a very severe disorder with regards

477
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,880
to the safety overall

478
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:19,439
epidialex was well tolerated and these

479
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,360
data

480
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,120
closely parallel the open label

481
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,359
experience that we had

482
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,918
adverse events that were recorded in 10

483
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:31,279
percent or more of patients

484
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:34,320
included somnolence diarrhea

485
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:37,918
decreased appetite fatigue

486
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,079
pyrexia vomiting lethargy

487
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,759
upper respiratory tract infection and

488
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,960
convulsion

489
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,759
84 percent of all adverse events were

490
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,798
rated

491
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:51,919
by the investigator as being either mild

492
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:52,480
or moderate among the serious adverse

493
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,799
events

494
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,400
there were 10 in the epididylex treated

495
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,519
group and three

496
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:03,759
in the placebo group with regards

497
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,679
to discontinuation due to adverse events

498
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,160
epididylex patients eight of them

499
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,320
discontinued due to side effects

500
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,279
and in the placebo group one

501
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:14,720
discontinued

502
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,000
due to adverse events with regards to

503
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,160
the efficacy

504
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
which is really the the exciting data

505
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,519
because this is we had no idea what the

506
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,558
placebo rate

507
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,879
would be so it was a 14-week

508
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,079
treatment period for the patients who

509
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,360
were randomized

510
00:18:28,079 --> 00:18:33,599
to the epidiolex or cbd therapy

511
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:34,399
there was a two week titration period in

512
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,599
which they went

513
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,280
from no drug to 20 milligrams per

514
00:18:37,599 --> 00:18:41,599
kilogram per day

515
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:42,558
i do think in hindsight this was a

516
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,199
relatively

517
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,558
rapid taper and probably a lot of the

518
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,319
adverse events

519
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,720
could have been reduced or even

520
00:18:48,319 --> 00:18:52,000
prevented had we have gone with a slower

521
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,200
titration period

522
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,960
but having said that there was a

523
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,038
two-week titration period people on

524
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
placebo were titrated to more placebo

525
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:00,160
during that time

526
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,679
people on epidiolex were titrated to

527
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,480
more epidialex

528
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,720
and then there was a 12-week period of

529
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,240
continuous treatment with the same dose

530
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,200
of either epidialex

531
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,038
or placebo the median reduction of

532
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,319
convulsive seizures which was our

533
00:19:13,038 --> 00:19:17,599
primary

534
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,519
outcome measure over the 14 weeks

535
00:19:17,599 --> 00:19:21,519
now the data would actually look better

536
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:23,359
if we just looked at the 12 weeks where

537
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:25,200
the patients were actually on

538
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,879
the target dose of epidiolex 20

539
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,519
milligrams per kilogram

540
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,320
but the data i will present is the

541
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:32,000
agreed

542
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:34,720
primary outcome measure with the fda

543
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,119
which was based on the entire 14 weeks

544
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,679
which includes the titration period and

545
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,399
for epidiolex the median reduction

546
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,919
convulsive seizures was 39 percent

547
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,798
and for placebo it was 13 and that was

548
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,480
significant

549
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:52,720
at a level of 0.01

550
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,640
we are very encouraged and excited by

551
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,400
these results we're very happy that the

552
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:59,200
placebo response rate

553
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
was relatively low which we think has

554
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,798
much to do

555
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,320
about careful selection of patients with

556
00:20:02,798 --> 00:20:06,319
dravet

557
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:07,759
careful determination of the seizure

558
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,399
type that we would count

559
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,200
in which parents and caretakers could be

560
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,720
reliable

561
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,960
and consistent and we hope

562
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,919
that the second study which will be a

563
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,640
dosing study

564
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,480
of placebo versus 10 milligrams versus

565
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,320
20 milligrams

566
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,599
per kilogram per day will produce

567
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:27,599
similar results

568
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,759
and that hopefully this medication will

569
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,798
be available to children with drug a

570
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:33,679
syndrome

571
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:34,480
and can improve both their seizure

572
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:48,480
control

573
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:48,480
and their quality of life thank you
