00:00:01,379 --> 00:00:05,040
my name is George Fernandez and I'm the

2
00:00:03,658 --> 00:00:07,199
founder and CEO of modern Canada

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,240
Laboratories modern Canada's reputation

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,638
speaks for itself and we've built that

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,039
reputation over the years not just

6
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:16,980
through fast turnaround times and good

7
00:00:14,039 --> 00:00:19,500
service but also by providing reliable

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,359
data that our clients can count on when

9
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:23,339
samples comes to the laboratory it is

10
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,140
our responsibility to ensure that they

11
00:00:23,339 --> 00:00:26,640
are safe for human consumption it's

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,278
about accuracy it's about

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,099
reproducibility and reliability modern

14
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:34,738
Canada was founded in 2014 we were the

15
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:36,839
first lab involved in rural development

16
00:00:34,738 --> 00:00:38,218
we're the first lab to test medical

17
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,840
marijuana in the State of Florida

18
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:42,239
something else that we take great pride

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,739
in our clients know that our data is

20
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:46,019
legally defensible and that it's

21
00:00:43,738 --> 00:00:48,419
reproducible this is an industry that's

22
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,160
changing it's constantly evolving so you

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,439
have to be nimble you have to be able to

24
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:55,500
Pivot quickly adjust to new rules and

25
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:57,659
regulations in 2019 we found out that

26
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,299
the state was planning to require a

27
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:02,159
variety of microbial analyzes and so

28
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:04,679
when that happened we really needed to

29
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:06,060
start looking more into what provider we

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,920
were going to use what vendor we were

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,140
going to go with what technology we were

32
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,478
going to go with at that time we were

33
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,478
doing plating and we were having a lot

34
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,879
of inconsistency with reproducibility of

35
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:21,118
data contamination and so we started

36
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:24,420
looking at microarray versus qpcr and

37
00:01:21,118 --> 00:01:27,060
medicinal genomics had done the work to

38
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:28,978
understand and know these assays that's

39
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:31,500
not something that every vendor could

40
00:01:28,978 --> 00:01:33,239
provide and that was when we decided

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,099
medicinal genomics was going to be our

42
00:01:33,239 --> 00:01:36,478
partner we used medicinal genomics

43
00:01:35,099 --> 00:01:38,578
products to test for microbial

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:41,099
contaminants in our extraction process

45
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,039
we're isolating the DNA from there we

46
00:01:41,099 --> 00:01:45,839
then tested for aspergillus species

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:48,118
salmonella shingotoxin E coli and yeast

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,680
and mold besides those we also test for

49
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:52,259
viruses and gender testing through

50
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,780
medicinal genomics the important part of

51
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,759
isolating cannabis DNA in the process is

52
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,099
that it serves as an internal standard

53
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,259
and allows us to ensure that our process

54
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:04,019
worked so if there's no microbes present

55
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,420
that we can confidently say there was no

56
00:02:04,019 --> 00:02:08,818
microbes present this is a big benefit

57
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,679
over something like plating where you're

58
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:12,780
not able to have that internal control

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,878
you can plate a sample and something

60
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:18,780
won't grow and you may think it's safe

61
00:02:14,878 --> 00:02:20,579
however if that plating didn't work you

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,378
really don't know if the product is safe

63
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,180
for human consumption one of our

64
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,818
favorite features of medicinal genomics

65
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,280
is our fast extraction process when we

66
00:02:26,818 --> 00:02:31,560
have busy days in 80 to 100 samples

67
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,719
there's a lot of work in micro being

68
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520
able to streamline our process is

69
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:38,280
extremely helpful using medicinal

70
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,459
genomics in their qpcr platforms really

71
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:43,259
allows us to have that confidence in the

72
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:45,360
data we're reporting it allows us to

73
00:02:43,259 --> 00:02:47,159
know for sure that that sample is clean

74
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,260
and no one is going to be harmed when

75
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,419
they consume it I do a lot of

76
00:02:49,259 --> 00:02:52,679
troubleshooting across the lab with

77
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,780
various instruments and different

78
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:56,400
chemical processes for the different

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,378
tests that we do within the laboratory

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,959
medicinal genomics has been a fantastic

81
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:02,939
partner providing technical support do

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,400
very good difficult to do my job without

83
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:07,199
having them in place the future of

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,599
Cannabis Testing is here to stay

85
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:11,759
third-party testing is going to continue

86
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:13,979
existing so that people can work out the

87
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:16,139
Kinks and figure out the regulations and

88
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:18,238
the standardization when it goes

89
00:03:16,139 --> 00:03:20,639
recreational the market is going to be

90
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,039
booming and if Labs don't have the

91
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,658
support and the standardization that

92
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,060
they need they're not going to be able

93
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:29,459
to handle the sample volume of such a

94
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,860
booming Market we want to be number one

95
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:35,719
and I think that with a partner like

96
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,720
medicinal genomics we can do that
