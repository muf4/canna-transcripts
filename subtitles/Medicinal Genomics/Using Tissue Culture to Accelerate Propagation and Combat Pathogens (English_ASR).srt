good afternoon Bill thanks so much for

89
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:13,719
joining us on the

90
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:16,000
podcast glad to be here all right so

91
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:18,238
let's talk about tissue culture and I

92
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,639
know this is a a propagation method that

93
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:23,399
you've been evangelizing for for quite

94
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,199
some time and with the emergence of

95
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,439
hlate and vroid and other plant

96
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,759
pathogens it seems like now more than

97
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:33,519
ever tissue culture is top of mine for

98
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:35,560
many Growers so so let's dive into it um

99
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,120
and let's talk about what tissue culture

100
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,560
is and what advantages that it may have

101
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,160
over the cloning that a lot of Growers

102
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,319
are doing now so um so let's start with

103
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,360
that so give us a high Lev view of what

104
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:53,839
is the tissue culture process and uh

105
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:56,080
we'll take it from there oh happy to uh

106
00:04:53,839 --> 00:05:00,239
ordinarily tissue culture is going to be

107
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:02,279
practiced in uh in four stages uh and

108
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,160
then incidentally I might just take this

109
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:07,239
opportunity to kind of tell everybody

110
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:09,840
what tissue culture is in especially as

111
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,000
it pertains to plants and very simply it

112
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,959
is Hydroponics with sugar so we're using

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,240
the same nutrients we've got some uh

114
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:21,399
special amino acids uh usually there may

115
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,560
be um hormones to give it Direction uh

116
00:05:21,399 --> 00:05:25,120
but uh what makes tissue culture special

117
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,439
from the Hydroponics that Growers are

118
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:30,000
already doing is going to be adding

119
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:32,079
sugar uh to give that

120
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
energy source directly to the plant

121
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:36,519
sugar can be directly absorbed by the

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,399
stem and uh and and surface tissues

123
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:41,639
without roots um to provide that energy

124
00:05:39,399 --> 00:05:44,719
so we can make plants from pieces that

125
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,319
would be too small to uh clone very fast

126
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
themselves however because it's sugar

127
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:51,000
everything else wants to grow on it and

128
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,800
that's when you start seeing the scalpel

129
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,680
and forceps and the HEPA filter and the

130
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,600
laminar hoods and the pressure cookers

131
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,600
all those things are to be able to make

132
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,000
the growing medium clean the plant

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,720
handle it uh and grow it so that uh the

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,598
fungus and bacteria and those things

135
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,800
don't get back onto it um but uh given

136
00:06:08,598 --> 00:06:14,800
that uh tissue culture is fantastic for

137
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:19,520
being able to make lots of uh brand new

138
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,639
clones from a a a sterile uh Source once

139
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:23,758
the plant's clean and it's growing in um

140
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:26,199
it's growing in the jar so the four

141
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,400
usual steps of of tissue culture are

142
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:31,560
going to be uh introduction

143
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:34,918
multiplication uh rooting in culture and

144
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:36,439
then rooting back out of culture but you

145
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:38,758
uh you probably already know that I've

146
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:41,319
kind of made a little special version of

147
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,840
that uh to make it easier for for

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:46,280
Growers and to make it more effective

149
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,799
for uh a lot of our producers right so

150
00:06:46,279 --> 00:06:51,359
at a completely high level what we're

151
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,800
talking about is using small pieces of

152
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,720
an established plant to make new copies

153
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:58,598
of a plant so not too dissimilar from

154
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,479
what you would do with cloning just with

155
00:06:58,598 --> 00:07:03,000
much smaller pieces right oh yeah yeah

156
00:07:01,478 --> 00:07:04,758
and in fact it's funny I'm actually

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
calling it tissue cloning because we're

158
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:10,038
using tissue culture to clone uh and um

159
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,759
and that's kind of part of my uh the

160
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:16,478
shortcut that I've made up and that is

161
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:18,680
to um uh top veg plants uh taking a two

162
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:21,199
or three centimeter uh cutting off of

163
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,879
the top so that the plants will branch

164
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,120
which is valuable for indoor growth

165
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,520
especially um and this is primarily for

166
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,840
our our vertical Growers but works for

167
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,198
anybody who uh is raising plants uh

168
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:35,279
indoors and vegetative growth but that's

169
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,360
uh but that's putting a uh a tip cutting

170
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,918
directly onto rooting medium which is

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
sort of a a shortcut of the usual uh

172
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:45,959
four

173
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:47,439
stages right so you're taking so a lot

174
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:49,279
of Growers they're they're topping their

175
00:07:47,439 --> 00:07:51,000
plants like you said to kind of widen

176
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,000
them and give them more of a bushy look

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,560
so you're actually being able to make

178
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,759
use of that by putting it into a a

179
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,680
rooting media and and kind of create

180
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:04,120
copies now with that not be a good

181
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:06,560
material to use for cloning

182
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,478
traditionally uh it actually makes a bad

183
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,360
clone because there's uh so much

184
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:13,639
concentrated branching in that piece uh

185
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,199
and um to take it as a clone length

186
00:08:13,639 --> 00:08:19,519
you're usually throwing away you know

187
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,478
four six even eight good nodes uh which

188
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:24,878
is all growth um that we don't want to

189
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:27,878
get rid of uh uh typically when a veg

190
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,879
tray which is about 96 or 100 plants

191
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:32,000
when it's when it's growing

192
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,440
um everybody in there is essentially a

193
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,320
clone but some are going to be more

194
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,719
vigorous than others uh and the

195
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,760
technicians are going to look at it and

196
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:44,600
say okay we have enough lower branching

197
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,278
that we are going to remove this much

198
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,200
material off the top of that plant uh

199
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:52,120
and leave you know is it going to be

200
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
four five six sometimes eight limbs

201
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,039
whatever their number is uh but that

202
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,119
piece has to go and they're usually just

203
00:08:56,039 --> 00:09:00,519
pinching that to trash pinching it

204
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,879
compost uh uh and so what we did is I

205
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:06,000
was like you know I I'm in the facility

206
00:09:03,879 --> 00:09:07,639
already to do collection they're always

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,759
sending me to the mom plants to do it

208
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:12,559
but I prefer to go to the veg plants

209
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,000
because immediately we can tell which

210
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:18,199
ones are strongest just based on figure

211
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,559
and number two is uh that it's already

212
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,720
being done uh so you know this is

213
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:25,599
material I can take that doesn't

214
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,399
interfere with any other uh cloning or

215
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,240
um propagation going on in the facility

216
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,720
and then it turns out that we could turn

217
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,839
it into an actual strategy to produce

218
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:40,240
all the plants that that the Grove needs

219
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,680
and in fact improve the crop um quickly

220
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,480
uh by selecting on Vigor and that's

221
00:09:42,679 --> 00:09:46,519
where things get really

222
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,079
interesting right so I mean you touched

223
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:51,600
on a good point there

224
00:09:48,078 --> 00:09:54,399
so with your system you could

225
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
potentially do away with moms and just

226
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,919
do all of your propagation off of your

227
00:09:55,919 --> 00:10:02,078
veg plants is that right yes I am mom's

228
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:04,799
mom plant's worst enemy uh you know but

229
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,239
but you know I totally get it you know

230
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,479
um what's really kind of funny is how we

231
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,278
got here because I of course ran the

232
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,278
retail shops man made grow equipment I

233
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:19,559
and we used it so I got to be the grower

234
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:23,720
equipment maker and really Mom plants

235
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:26,239
were a a means to an end it got us by

236
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,839
you know as a grower myself I never did

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,440
my did Mom plants because it was a waste

238
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,480
of P tensi light uh I can get if I'm

239
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,720
producing all the veg plants I need for

240
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:41,079
my grow then I really just need like two

241
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,879
or three flowering rooms um so that I'm

242
00:10:41,078 --> 00:10:45,120
producing veg plants every two or three

243
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:48,120
weeks so I've got all the fresh material

244
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,679
I need to cut from and you when I was a

245
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:53,240
a college Gardener uh I was using side

246
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:54,919
limbs for that work funny enough that

247
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:57,200
was exactly the same time I got into

248
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:59,278
tissue culture and it was going to be

249
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,879
20s something years later I'm not dating

250
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:02,919
myself uh that I started realizing wait

251
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:05,120
a minute this material that we're

252
00:11:02,919 --> 00:11:07,639
proving off the top actually makes a

253
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,360
great clone and if we're taking it from

254
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:13,240
the very best veg plants then that Vigor

255
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,759
which was expressed in the veg plant it

256
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,839
was cut from carries over into the new

257
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,600
plant that that uh um culture is going

258
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:21,399
to

259
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,600
produce and we're able to we're able to

260
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:26,879
get all the plants back uh over two uh

261
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,519
pruning Cycles so if I've got a tray of

262
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:33,480
100 veg plants I need to replace I can

263
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:35,839
take about 35 of the best tops first and

264
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:38,519
then seven days later go back for

265
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:42,079
another hundred or so so that we can be

266
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:44,078
selective and in eight weeks those tops

267
00:11:42,078 --> 00:11:46,638
going into culture were going to be the

268
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,078
plants that are being topped again so

269
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:50,879
we're able to short the whole uh

270
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:52,000
selection cycle down to um eight weeks

271
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:55,200
and and you can see none of that

272
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,799
involves a m plant H all right I'm not

273
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,720
sure if I quite followed that all the

274
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,039
different stages and the different mul

275
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,360
so topping the plants to make the new

276
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:04,319
plants that all that ultimately go back

277
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,480
to

278
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,079
veg okay so so walk me slides while

279
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:11,360
we're talking say that again go ahead

280
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:12,799
I'm pulling up slides while we're

281
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,800
talking so I can actually throw these up

282
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:18,879
if we uh need them oh yeah absolutely

283
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:22,399
that that would be great so

284
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,679
email yeah you could do that or uh yeah

285
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,919
you want if you want to do that I could

286
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:29,039
pull it up that'd be cool would it kind

287
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:31,639
of show the different um you know yeah

288
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:35,039
it's got a picture multiplication steps

289
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:36,720
there it does it does but uh very simply

290
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,879
it just kind of shows a veg plant being

291
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:45,040
topped and then that going into a a tube

292
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:47,198
um on rooting medium which will uh grow

293
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:49,439
about three or four times its original

294
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:52,078
Mass um because that's what's happening

295
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:54,639
when this cutting is in the tissue

296
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:58,000
culture tube so if we've taken a a a 2

297
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,639
or 3 cmet cut and put it onto um rooting

298
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,519
tissue culture media

299
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:03,000
the uh sugar is absorbed immediately

300
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,720
right through the surface of the stem

301
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and that cambium that green growth

302
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,800
tissue just underneath the surface is

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,879
going to be turning that into uh starch

304
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:15,278
complex carbohydrates it's turning into

305
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:17,559
stored energy wood it turns it into wood

306
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,799
and you can see it get fat um

307
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:24,559
unfortunately I took all of my last

308
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:26,719
clones to um Rhode Island with me and uh

309
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:29,679
and didn't bring any back uh I can run

310
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,278
over and grab one um from show the other

311
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:34,239
day but it's got a little spoilage on it

312
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:36,720
but anyway the bottom gets fat uh with

313
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,278
all that stored wood and it gets lumpy

314
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:43,399
uh because of the influence of rooting

315
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:46,078
hormone so these shortcut Ro uh tissue

316
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:48,919
cuting are root ready to root into plugs

317
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:53,120
in about three weeks so I'm using tissue

318
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:55,198
culture as a cloning tool without how

319
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
many different copies can you get from

320
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,439
one

321
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,440
plant well if we were doing the straight

322
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,680
micropropagation where one cutting would

323
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,880
go into a jar and it uh would uh branch

324
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:10,679
and grow on a on a multiplication

325
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:13,399
hormone that is going to be the class of

326
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:15,838
called cyto which are the opposite of uh

327
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:19,159
oxin which are rooting uh those plants

328
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:21,959
will usually grow to um if we're lucky

329
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,958
enough to get them to Branch uh to like

330
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:29,278
six or seven um new uh 1 and a half

331
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:31,838
cimer node cuting in the period of like

332
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,439
five weeks and that would make that many

333
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,480
new plants you start doing an

334
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:39,240
exponential uh multiplication on that um

335
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,320
and uh you're going to have you know we

336
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,799
can have thousands uh in the case of

337
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,600
regular horiculture uh I can tell you

338
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,679
for a fact that a couple of plants can

339
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,560
turn into tens of millions because uh

340
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,758
that's what I did with uh citrosa

341
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:55,559
deriums if any of your Watchers have the

342
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,600
uh the mosquito repelling geraniums in

343
00:14:55,559 --> 00:15:00,039
front of their house uh and everybody

344
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:03,079
recognizes them those actually came from

345
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:05,278
these hands in 1992 because that was my

346
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:08,198
project when I went when I was hired to

347
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:11,000
work at AGR starts uh hired from college

348
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:14,278
to return to college um with a special

349
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,720
one-year project and um uh I did start

350
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:20,198
with just a hundred cuting from the

351
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:23,040
original stock plants and those are the

352
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:25,319
parents of all of the citrosa plants

353
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:27,120
that anybody has ever grown in North

354
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:29,759
America since

355
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,159
1992 wow which has to just be in the

356
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:34,919
tens or even a 100 million plants by now

357
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,799
wow so are those all propagated through

358
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:38,479
tissue

359
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:41,120
culture they now funny enough the plants

360
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,278
they sent me were in 8 inch pots from

361
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,440
Holland which is really interesting

362
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:47,480
because this was a plant that was

363
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,759
supposedly developed by somatic

364
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,319
hybridization the process was supposedly

365
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,759
to take this scented uranium and grass

366
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:57,799
of China strip all the cell walls off

367
00:15:55,759 --> 00:16:01,440
make the little naked stells stick

368
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:03,719
together um regrow some cell walls and

369
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,000
then encourage those to grow in culture

370
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:12,000
and become uh a uh a duranium that had

371
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:13,399
this uh citronella oil in it um however

372
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
that it would you know very much a

373
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:16,919
tissue culture

374
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,159
tool however the plants I got were in

375
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:21,078
pots and so that was when I first

376
00:16:19,159 --> 00:16:23,439
suspected that they were not actually

377
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:24,879
from tissue culture uh and the second

378
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,600
was when I got a mosquito bite when I

379
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:30,519
was in a a greenhouse of like 200,000

380
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,519
plants

381
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,680
uh but I still encourage them because

382
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,000
they're really pretty and they smell

383
00:16:34,679 --> 00:16:38,439
great and I still have them all over my

384
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,720
house but that's that is tissue culture

385
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:42,319
as far as a few plants making many and

386
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,440
and that's where we really stand today

387
00:16:42,318 --> 00:16:46,120
as an industry most of the people who

388
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,880
have used your you are using your

389
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:52,519
products uh especially the um uh hlvd

390
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:55,039
testing uh are testing plants that are

391
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:58,278
going to be dedicated moms and I totally

392
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,120
get that um we try to encourage that to

393
00:16:58,278 --> 00:17:02,198
um

394
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,439
uh to to get away from moms and to try

395
00:17:02,198 --> 00:17:09,279
and do a lot of this work off of veg

396
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:11,120
plants for the reason that um we kind

397
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,359
there there's a disease cycle involved

398
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,759
with Mom plants that is unique to

399
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,798
cannabis indoor cannabis um and that is

400
00:17:16,759 --> 00:17:20,199
that you know the plants are the Petri

401
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,439
dishes for everything we're trying to

402
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,839
get rid of good or bad and uh things are

403
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:29,480
shared um in innocuous ways I mean it's

404
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:31,678
really hard to move the around and clean

405
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,440
the tools every single handling and most

406
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:36,798
grows uh you know are never going to be

407
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:39,720
that disciplined so anyway even just air

408
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:42,279
exposure in the same grow facility

409
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:44,038
everything we're worried about grows on

410
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:45,918
cannabis and the oldest plants are going

411
00:17:44,038 --> 00:17:48,400
to be the most exposed and as your

412
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:52,640
testing reveals so often is that plants

413
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:56,480
that show no out outward symptoms uh can

414
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,440
contain thyroids fusarium uh Bettis

415
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
aspergillis uh any of the things that

416
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,600
we're really worried about and of course

417
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,798
they are the source of all the new

418
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:08,719
plants in the garden and so I the tissue

419
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:10,879
culture shortcut helps break that

420
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,440
because the plants that will become the

421
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,960
new crop will have to grow inside of a

422
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,038
sterile tissue culture tube for at least

423
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:20,519
three weeks in which case if there's

424
00:18:18,038 --> 00:18:23,440
anything there that doesn't belong uh we

425
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:25,639
can usually see it by eye and of course

426
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,679
you know um the medicinal genomics gives

427
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,000
us tools for being able to uh PCR test

428
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:34,280
that uh and know that the material in

429
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,599
the tube itself is also uh is sterile

430
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:38,359
you know just in the course of the 3

431
00:18:35,599 --> 00:18:40,519
weeks but uh that's that's a good start

432
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,000
we can label it as a negative and then

433
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,079
follow it afterwards uh and test it

434
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,038
several more

435
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:50,960
times if you're anybody familiar with uh

436
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:53,519
segra or any of the uh companies doing

437
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:56,880
uh tissue culture services to clean

438
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,158
plants uh they will be doing the exact

439
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,080
same things propagating the the plants

440
00:18:59,159 --> 00:19:03,480
and testing over and over again you know

441
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:07,000
they they usually look for at least

442
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:09,599
three negatives um uh from subcultures

443
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:12,319
before they kind of give guaranteed um

444
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:13,879
vroid free uh back to the customer and

445
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,599
then it's what does the customer do they

446
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,039
grow another mom plant they started all

447
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:20,759
over again they put Mom in the same room

448
00:19:18,038 --> 00:19:22,720
as all the other mom plants uh the

449
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:24,839
technicians still have the dirty tools

450
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,159
even if they're cleaning there's risk

451
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:28,359
and we just want to kind of break all

452
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,200
that besides if I can turn a mom room

453
00:19:28,359 --> 00:19:33,038
into a flower room I've just made a

454
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,798
grower you know a little bit more money

455
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:38,279
sometimes 20% and then if the crop gets

456
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:41,359
better from just Vigor there's another

457
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:44,399
20 30 40% from doing nothing else except

458
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:45,879
selecting on Vigor which incidentally is

459
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,840
why we don't have corn that looks like

460
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:51,159
this anymore someone went in and said

461
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:52,558
hey that one look that one looks a

462
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,240
little better and that's what they grew

463
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,399
next year no and you make a great point

464
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:59,679
about this you know the moms being a bit

465
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,280
of a Petri an incubator for all these

466
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,679
different diseases and and it makes

467
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:07,000
sense they're older plants um and

468
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:08,720
they're constantly being exposed to the

469
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,440
air and the elements because they're

470
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,000
continually having their their limbs

471
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:16,880
lopped off so um sort of breaking that

472
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,200
cycle seems to make a lot of sense and

473
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,520
one of the things I I did I had the

474
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,480
pleasure of seeing you present at the

475
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:24,119
Cannabis science conference uh just

476
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,038
recently and another thing that was

477
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:29,759
brought up during that talk was this

478
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:33,319
idea of genetic drift um yes which also

479
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:36,640
seems to be sort of um a problem that

480
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:40,359
emerges from using mother plants so

481
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,200
speak a bit about that oh uh this is

482
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,359
actually one of the things that got uh

483
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:46,480
the kits popular the first time is

484
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,719
because there are a lot of fantastic

485
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:51,200
Growers and especially Legacy Growers

486
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:54,120
who have been growing uh plants for 10

487
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,558
20 years or so I mean these are their

488
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,079
trademark strains but what's going to

489
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,839
happen in that much time especially

490
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,279
especially if it's you know recycled

491
00:20:59,839 --> 00:21:04,639
indoor growth is it sometimes happens

492
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,639
that the plants are just not yielding

493
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,159
like they used to they're not behaving

494
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:10,559
like they used to they're not yielding

495
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,159
like they used to but we know it's the

496
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:16,240
same plant because you do the DNA

497
00:21:13,159 --> 00:21:18,240
testing of these things well so you know

498
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,798
what that comes down to is epigenetics

499
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:23,679
which is going to be the expression of

500
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,558
the genes uh so they're there why aren't

501
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:27,320
we seeing them and why aren't they their

502
00:21:25,558 --> 00:21:29,918
very strongest and there's usually a

503
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:32,839
couple of things uh they can usually be

504
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,520
stress related um because you've got a

505
00:21:32,839 --> 00:21:35,720
really nice indoor environment the light

506
00:21:34,519 --> 00:21:37,720
comes on at the same time the

507
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,640
temperature is great everything is

508
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:42,640
wonderful if we lived in spas I don't

509
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,640
think we'd look quite as fit as if you

510
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,278
know we were outside um you know uh

511
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:51,480
taking care of the land like uh our

512
00:21:48,278 --> 00:21:53,759
ancestors right um though it'd be worth

513
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,120
it uh but uh genetic drift is going to

514
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:56,839
sort of just be like the plants sort of

515
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:59,359
drop off of what they used to do tissue

516
00:21:56,839 --> 00:22:00,759
culture is a great little Tool uh for

517
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,719
that because it kind of brings back

518
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:04,000
juvenile growth it tends to strip off

519
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,079
some of the

520
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:11,038
methylation um that has occurred on that

521
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:14,119
DNA uh in um in those nice environments

522
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:15,879
and frankly we try to do a two-prong uh

523
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:18,359
approach anyway and that is for any

524
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:21,278
grower that's experienced genetic drift

525
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:23,558
uh is to uh try to raise uh some of the

526
00:22:21,278 --> 00:22:26,640
plants vegetatively outdoor in the

527
00:22:23,558 --> 00:22:29,519
outdoors in the summer um for you know

528
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,720
like six weeks or so for that

529
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:34,798
multi-spectrum Sunshine uh the hot days

530
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,200
the cold nights we can even simulate

531
00:22:34,798 --> 00:22:41,480
some pest attack uh with um harpon

532
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,558
protein um and and and material like

533
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,240
that you know possible real insect

534
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:49,038
attack uh wind all those things like

535
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,000
that that uh are actually

536
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,919
stimulation to the plant uh we had

537
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,119
several um uh lectures during cannabis

538
00:22:54,919 --> 00:22:59,038
science uh about stress and so on like

539
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:01,959
that so I tried to put the two together

540
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:04,359
and of course we are going to take uh

541
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,240
tip cuttings from those outdoor plants

542
00:23:04,359 --> 00:23:08,158
put them into bleach water which is sort

543
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,720
of our conduit getting plants into

544
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:14,559
culture and that is our quarantine to

545
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,079
moving outdoor material back into the

546
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:20,678
growth space plant cuting go into the

547
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:23,558
chlorine uh we clean the tools every cut

548
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:27,159
which is how we are able to uh take that

549
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:28,960
small piece of tissue and um uh put it

550
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:31,520
into a solution that's not only cleaning

551
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,319
the surface but preventing uh vroid or

552
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:35,079
any other pathogens from moving between

553
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:36,359
plants and another one of the things

554
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:39,000
we'll catch up on before we get out of

555
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:43,000
here will sort of be uh the strategy of

556
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:45,038
taking small pieces to um uh hopefully

557
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,038
eliminate to hopefully take material

558
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:49,759
without thyroids and

559
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:52,278
pathogens yeah so I mean no time like

560
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,400
the Pres let's get into that now oh

561
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:56,440
shoot this is where we've been using

562
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:59,840
your kits this is where uh this is where

563
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,000
the um upcr H has been um I beg your

564
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:04,199
pardon that was mostly for our

565
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,960
chromosomes but uh using um uh your

566
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:10,960
vroid detecting um PCR has been

567
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:13,120
excellent because we're using such small

568
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:16,919
material and we can get smaller I mean

569
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:20,038
two to 4 cmers is a good working size

570
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:23,520
for new users because the plants that

571
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:26,158
begin to root are a good size to go into

572
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,480
a rooting plug and and begin creating

573
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,520
the new plants quickly which is what

574
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:33,159
Growers one um but you know as we teach

575
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,639
in like our our master class is that you

576
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:37,039
know we'll go down to 1 cmet half

577
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,799
centimeter pieces we can keep going

578
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:41,278
smaller and smaller because this is the

579
00:24:38,798 --> 00:24:43,480
cool thing is once you've got a simple

580
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,319
setup and I don't know if your viewers

581
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,798
can see you know what's behind me but

582
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:50,720
I've got a simple laminar Hood which is

583
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:53,119
not even really necessary uh and a

584
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,798
lighted Shelf with a HEPA filter and

585
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:59,359
this is my grow chamber um but we are

586
00:24:55,798 --> 00:25:02,398
able to uh once we've got tissue culture

587
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:05,759
media prepared we can do plants of all

588
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:07,398
sizes but anyway the the premise uh I

589
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:10,839
have really just written into a proposal

590
00:25:07,398 --> 00:25:12,959
for research paper is that there the

591
00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:15,359
material the tips are always outgrowing

592
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,640
viroids or anything systemic so all the

593
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,079
growth is coming from the very tip I

594
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,640
mean less than a millimeter of the very

595
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:26,839
tip is the future growth of that entire

596
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:30,480
limb uh and even before vascular tissues

597
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:32,918
are produced so the vroid and and so on

598
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,839
will move either in the vascular tissues

599
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,038
or in the intercellular uh intercellular

600
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:40,558
space between the cell walls and the

601
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:42,158
cells themselves some will pass into the

602
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:43,918
cells and some will be shared with the

603
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,159
cells next to it because that's kind of

604
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,600
how how cells communicate but not

605
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,039
quickly it's all passive and as long as

606
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:53,839
that tip growth is vigorous that passive

607
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:57,079
exchange is not necessarily fast enough

608
00:25:53,839 --> 00:25:59,639
is there viroid in the cytoplasm in that

609
00:25:57,079 --> 00:26:02,599
brand new GR growth and and some of the

610
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,038
work that zir Puna um especially as we

611
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:09,359
saw canmed uh was showed in his

612
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,480
presentation is that uh viroids and uh

613
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:13,839
systemic pathogens are not uniformed

614
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:16,399
through the plants you he had that one

615
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:18,639
slide of a plant he goes left side has

616
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:21,038
vroid the right side does not it was all

617
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,200
the same plant and where was I my hand

618
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,879
was Sky High back there in the audience

619
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,038
I was like let let talk about that

620
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,159
because that happens on on on idual

621
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,398
Limbs and the more the plant grows limbs

622
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:35,399
uh the more likely that's the case and

623
00:26:33,398 --> 00:26:37,199
um and especially the vigorous ones so

624
00:26:35,398 --> 00:26:39,519
it kind of one thing sort of led to

625
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,440
another uh in all of that but your stuff

626
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:45,599
comes in because we can take uh a

627
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,080
cutting a small cutting and uh actually

628
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:51,079
save a piece of the bridge tissue which

629
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:53,918
would be uh the stem tissue going into

630
00:26:51,079 --> 00:26:56,839
that cutting if I take a 4 cimet cutting

631
00:26:53,919 --> 00:27:00,038
I can use bottom centimeter for a

632
00:26:56,839 --> 00:27:02,959
thyroid test and the upper 3 cmers uh

633
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:06,599
are being clean to go to culture and if

634
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,679
we've got your tools for working on site

635
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:10,439
at that at that location at that moment

636
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:13,559
we can know before that plant is even

637
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:15,960
cultured if it uh was uh negative or

638
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:18,119
positive on the test so that's kind of

639
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,798
an interesting one that I talked to uh

640
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:23,000
we we talked about it can Med and I

641
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:28,480
talked to Kevin uh is uh exploring the

642
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,480
use of bridge tissue for uh um uh PCR

643
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:33,200
testing of viroid because we shouldn't

644
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,839
need much especially now that you I saw

645
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:38,720
that you guys have tests with infinitely

646
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:41,918
small uh amounts of sample like we can

647
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,319
actually just stab the actual cutting uh

648
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,200
with the tip of a um a micropipe pet uh

649
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:50,839
no cutting no cutting needed no washing

650
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,360
needed so I'm really looking forward to

651
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:53,798
getting into that because we can now

652
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:57,158
test the piece that's actually being

653
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:59,240
isolated and grown to be the next crop

654
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,840
negative lives mean a lot more if we

655
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:03,880
know that it's trapped inside of glass

656
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:06,439
going get a whole out of it well yeah

657
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:08,960
and so a lot of the talk about using

658
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:11,320
tissue culture to S sort of create a new

659
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,079
copy that's that's free of hlvd had

660
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:14,639
always been about meristem tissue

661
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:18,158
culture which I think when you were

662
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,640
talking before is that very top tip um

663
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,720
which you're hoping that the virid

664
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:24,600
hasn't had a chance to get to yet but it

665
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,759
sounds like you were just describing to

666
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,798
take a a larger cutting but then test

667
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,278
the bottom of it where it had met the

668
00:28:29,798 --> 00:28:33,960
the larger plant to see if there's

669
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:35,599
anything there and if that's clean you

670
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,200
assume that the rest of the cutting is

671
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:41,319
clean as well do I have that right we

672
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:43,440
yes and it is totally assuming um and

673
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:45,720
and it's not necessarily 100% we can't

674
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,120
test every cutting uh you know because

675
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:50,480
if I need if I need 100 veg plants and

676
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:52,239
I'm doing 135 cuts to get it that's a

677
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,720
lot of expensive testing but that's why

678
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:56,240
it's called sampling we will do stum

679
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,440
along the

680
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,399
way know I've got we got a whole

681
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:03,960
strategy for this uh that kind of

682
00:29:00,398 --> 00:29:06,599
involves you know weaning the vroid out

683
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:09,240
of the crop gradually um but by

684
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:11,480
gradually it can be 20 or 30% a cycle

685
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:14,759
and those Cycles can be eight eight or

686
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,599
nine weeks apart um if you guys if you

687
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:19,960
want to know a little more about that um

688
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:22,839
yeah yeah but you know what we've gone

689
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,278
on because I do this for big Growers and

690
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:27,398
I did it for myself interesting Enough

691
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:29,079
by the way everything that that I kind

692
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:32,119
came up with that we shared was

693
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:35,599
developed for fusarium first so when you

694
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:40,239
all sent your uh sent uh your first um

695
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:42,519
uh PCR test uh around um with Kyle uh

696
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:44,599
way back when we were doing gender

697
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:46,079
testing but you asked right away they

698
00:29:44,599 --> 00:29:48,278
were like oh what's the next test we

699
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:50,199
would need and I said fusarium because

700
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:52,798
at that moment I had a massive fusarium

701
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,840
problem at my place and so we did this

702
00:29:52,798 --> 00:29:57,759
really to eliminate fusarium but the

703
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,480
premise is exactly the same and

704
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:02,798
incidentally it's turns out to be ideal

705
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,880
for a vroid as well because they sort of

706
00:30:02,798 --> 00:30:09,240
tend to travel and move the same ways um

707
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:13,278
but uh you know if you're 100% trying to

708
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:14,960
eliminate uh vroid uh in one shot that's

709
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:16,880
where we would take like those half

710
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,600
millimeter Marist stems and that could

711
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,919
take a long time to grow a new plant but

712
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:24,079
you can but what I discovered was that

713
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,480
uh on a plant that we might have uh that

714
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:29,038
might register positive because it was

715
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,759
it because of where the tests were taken

716
00:30:29,038 --> 00:30:33,240
it was taken at Leaf WLS you know where

717
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:36,720
everything that the penate leaves all

718
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:38,839
come together or down in The Roots uh

719
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,960
and those are uh either vascular

720
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:43,398
intersections where traffic seems to

721
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,278
slow and so they accumulate or of course

722
00:30:43,398 --> 00:30:47,918
the roots are a sink you know everything

723
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:51,000
kind of goes down there and stays put um

724
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:53,120
as a testing company you want to find

725
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:56,038
the greatest concentration of vroid so

726
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,199
that you can get the uh result that yes

727
00:30:56,038 --> 00:31:00,679
this plant has vroid in it it but funny

728
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:03,278
enough I go to that exact same plant and

729
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,759
do my stuff off of the tips especially

730
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:07,038
if it's if it's been cloned um and it's

731
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,960
on the table and we've got viger's

732
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:13,079
growth if we select on

733
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:15,720
Vigor then and this kind of goes down

734
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:19,879
the type of uh research that Kevin's

735
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:22,519
doing is that we might have uh plants

736
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,760
that are naturally resistant we might

737
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,120
have a strain of the vroid that is

738
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:30,638
particularly weak we might have any

739
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:34,199
number of circumstances that just kind

740
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:37,119
of mean that vroid is not necessarily a

741
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:39,278
problem not only in this particular crop

742
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:43,319
but in this particular tissue if the

743
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:44,599
tissue is vigorous that's our sign and

744
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:47,480
you know we've kind of assumed just

745
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:51,359
making up a number is if we had a a

746
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:53,639
positive plant uh made into 100 clones

747
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,678
uh vegetative clones and we start

748
00:31:53,638 --> 00:31:59,479
selecting on Vigor on those uh that

749
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:02,559
taking time tops we're maybe uh taking

750
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:04,240
off 20 or 30% uh that are absolutely

751
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,638
vroid free because the viroids would

752
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:09,720
have not caught up with that tip growth

753
00:32:06,638 --> 00:32:12,199
um but eight weeks later those same

754
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,880
plants are now uh are clone donors so

755
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:17,159
the plants from the two test tubes that

756
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:19,278
we topped are the veg plants being

757
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:21,639
topped again and we do the same

758
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:25,240
selection on Vigor and now we take off

759
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:28,558
another 20 or 30% thyroid free so if we

760
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:32,759
start at a a hypothe 100% we can go down

761
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:36,079
to 80 62 keep going like that uh pretty

762
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:39,000
much uh at the end of the year um we're

763
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,558
in the low single digits getting smaller

764
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:43,079
and here's the thing is most of the

765
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,240
Growers who have thyroids as your

766
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,278
testing reveals are living with it

767
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,440
anyway so we just try to strategically

768
00:32:48,278 --> 00:32:53,359
make that the very best growth that it

769
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,120
can be and besides selecting on viiger

770
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:59,000
seems to make the entire crop uh perform

771
00:32:56,119 --> 00:33:02,319
better anyway mom plants as Growers are

772
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,079
using today have been selected on Vigor

773
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:07,158
anyway but that was eight months ago by

774
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:10,000
doing it at eight weeks we can do that

775
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:12,880
six times a year you know remember if

776
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,839
you're trying to do breeding experiments

777
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:18,679
um you got arabidopsis for plants and

778
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:20,599
fruit flies you know if you want insects

779
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:23,320
because we want those Generations you

780
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:25,199
know flip them right which is another

781
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:27,398
culture trick by the way is we started

782
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,960
doing um we started harvesting amateur

783
00:33:27,398 --> 00:33:34,199
embryos uh um fertilized embryos uh at

784
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:36,200
like two days so we fertilize a bud then

785
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:38,720
dissect the flower and pull out the uh

786
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:40,759
the fertilized embryo um and can put

787
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:43,038
that on culture as well it's smaller

788
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:45,599
than it's great but you just put it

789
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:48,319
right over the same medium you little

790
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:51,119
less sugar a little less hor no hormone

791
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:54,558
um and uh and give it time and we can

792
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:56,558
make plants from that the value being is

793
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:58,720
by just touching the tip of a scalpel to

794
00:33:56,558 --> 00:34:02,759
that little embryo we can get our DNA

795
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,600
sample for that entire cross so then we

796
00:34:02,759 --> 00:34:09,599
can run it through PCR uh and be able to

797
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,279
see it uh our is our marker pattern um

798
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,320
the desirable cross that we were looking

799
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,960
for because that's how that goes is you

800
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,960
do a cross and your seeds still go all

801
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,599
different ways and uh know there's going

802
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:21,918
to be a good deal of testing but we can

803
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:23,838
test the seeds for the genetics and then

804
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,078
from culture uh turn those into whole

805
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:29,320
plants after that selection wow yeah all

806
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,399
right this is this is where we work

807
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,440
together so well yeah veered off into

808
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:35,358
whole different I don't want to do what

809
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,599
you're doing but I want to I I want to

810
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:39,119
keep sharing what we do you know

811
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:41,039
absolutely walk them right up to the

812
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,079
edge and then you take them from there

813
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:45,960
excellent no and I want to go back to

814
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,519
sort of this this process of continuing

815
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,960
to propagate to kind of get ahead of hot

816
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,239
plate and hyid and so as I understand it

817
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:57,720
so is the idea being that like like like

818
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,358
zamir had had shown in his in in his

819
00:34:57,719 --> 00:35:03,559
presentation that the plant typically

820
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:04,799
gets infected it goes down to the roots

821
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,358
stays there for a little while and then

822
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,880
it kind of proliferates throughout the

823
00:35:06,358 --> 00:35:11,159
rest of the plant so is the idea being

824
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,240
that like you're trying to catch those

825
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:14,920
tips before the vroid has had a chance

826
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:18,000
to get there and then you're kind of

827
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,400
constantly it actually M and down so

828
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:22,639
even if it's in those limbs some of it

829
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,639
moves down the down tends to go down and

830
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:30,519
stay down it could of course carry back

831
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:33,838
up because the um xylem uh which will go

832
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:37,119
back up to the limbs uh is especially

833
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:39,759
active during uh it's active early on

834
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,160
for you know water and um and nutrient

835
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:45,200
salts so of course it's the primary car

836
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:46,399
carrier for those in uh flowering

837
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:48,199
especially in cannabis it gets

838
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,960
interesting because we have a a new

839
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:54,199
shunt and that is that uh stored sugar

840
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,800
uh the wood and and and carbohydrates

841
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:58,719
we're talking about in The Roots and

842
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:00,800
stems begins to mobilize again so it'll

843
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,559
take complex carbohydrates and turn into

844
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,560
the simple sugars again and start

845
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:07,639
sending those up the xylem which is when

846
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:09,759
we suspect that the uh vroid is going to

847
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:11,199
be carried up as well you know because

848
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,640
you know sugar relatively large

849
00:36:11,199 --> 00:36:17,358
organisms it's obviously metab uh

850
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:20,078
metabolically driven um and uh we

851
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:23,199
suspect that vroid is involved somewhere

852
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,839
in uh gumming up the metabolic process

853
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,919
um but uh it's first of all we're doing

854
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:29,159
an AEG when those things would not be

855
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:33,079
moving

856
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:35,039
anyway number two is just uh that all

857
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:37,280
that growth is coming from the tip it's

858
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:40,400
like trying to chase a rocket if you're

859
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:42,359
in its uh in its in its burn stream you

860
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:45,000
know it's going to be

861
00:36:42,358 --> 00:36:47,920
hard you know what was what was that

862
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,440
very tip growth yesterday is now

863
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,920
centimeters or inches higher tomorrow

864
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,880
that's incredible and considering we're

865
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,400
talking about uh things that are just

866
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,880
shared passively

867
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:02,800
uh cell to cell and um uh when you get

868
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,240
up into growth that high and then those

869
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:08,359
brand new vascular tissues is they are

870
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:11,279
often missed is how it goes and this is

871
00:37:08,358 --> 00:37:13,159
where the testing comes in yeah because

872
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,480
you know I I've done this for a while

873
00:37:13,159 --> 00:37:17,960
and we were sending in Te uh testing

874
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:20,719
from tips uh and we were getting so much

875
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,039
more negative material and what's funny

876
00:37:20,719 --> 00:37:26,318
is you guys as a testing agency were

877
00:37:23,039 --> 00:37:28,599
saying oh well you you should either mix

878
00:37:26,318 --> 00:37:30,880
all of those samples together or let's

879
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:33,039
go for these other high concentrated uh

880
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:35,358
tissues which is great again for

881
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,679
identifying the presence of the vroid in

882
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:40,480
the garden I would almost go ahead and

883
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:42,480
say it's there and if it wasn't vroid

884
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,838
it's something else um but you know

885
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,519
let's uh if we start doing it off of

886
00:37:44,838 --> 00:37:51,440
tips there is the uh greater likelihood

887
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:53,119
uh that given the plant assuming the

888
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:56,400
plant had vroid in it at all that we're

889
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,358
using uh material that's so new uh and

890
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
as has grown so vigorously that it is um

891
00:37:58,358 --> 00:38:02,480
vroid free and if we take that cutting

892
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,960
with clean tools now the part about this

893
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:06,559
I had mentioned is that to take that top

894
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:08,639
off your hands have been cleaned in

895
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:10,519
bleach water your tools have cleaned in

896
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:13,078
bleach water I actually have a a vinyl

897
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:15,639
apron with bleachy sponges in it and

898
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,160
three sets of tools and gloves uh so I

899
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:19,799
can do that and of course from talking

900
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:23,039
to zamir he said yes Spyro can live and

901
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,800
bleach as well but not well and not for

902
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:28,679
a long time so we you know it's the best

903
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:30,039
we have right is to use that you know

904
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:31,799
let's we're not going to ask for trouble

905
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:33,838
we're going to do our best to eliminate

906
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,160
it but that will be cleaning the plant

907
00:38:33,838 --> 00:38:38,318
cleaning the tools and then taking

908
00:38:35,159 --> 00:38:40,799
another cutting but that's it uh if I

909
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:44,039
can I want to take my sample for the

910
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:47,480
test from this piece on its way to

911
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:49,880
culture that's it right and so if I'm

912
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:51,800
hearing you correctly so if I'm a grower

913
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:54,680
and I have a plant that tested positive

914
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:56,119
for H for hot PL and viroid and maybe

915
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:58,039
we're assuming that we were looking at

916
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:00,920
one of those High concentration areas

917
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:02,838
maybe like the roof or one of those so

918
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:05,680
we know that there's vroid there but I

919
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:07,358
think from what I'm hearing is yes

920
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,399
before you throw it away you might want

921
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:11,719
to search for a spot on that plant that

922
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:13,559
doesn't have the vroid take a cutting

923
00:39:11,719 --> 00:39:17,559
from that and then try to use tissue

924
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:20,838
culture to create a vroid free copy yes

925
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:23,759
yes thank you and you know um yeah for

926
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:26,039
sure I would and above that would be you

927
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,240
know taking like a hundred or something

928
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,559
copies

929
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:31,679
uh in testing as many as as you can

930
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:34,679
afford so you can have a representative

931
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,639
sampling you know again Growers don't

932
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,759
need to freak out because you know

933
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,799
viroids in plants are shared by plant

934
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,480
juice it's only juice to juice that's

935
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,599
going to make uh problems which is why

936
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:48,039
we clean tools uh you know think of it

937
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:49,960
like HIV or hepatitis um you know you

938
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,719
can you you can touch the plants with

939
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:54,199
your bare hands um you can move pots

940
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,679
around and stuff in the room when the

941
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,759
leaves rub each other it's not

942
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:59,159
necessarily spread spreading um and we

943
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,800
don't know so much about like the the

944
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,960
sucking insects uh aphids um spider

945
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,240
mites so on like that you know we those

946
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,199
things should all be under control

947
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,399
anyway but uh um the idea is that I

948
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:13,719
would take like aund and something

949
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,358
cuting and select off of vigor and do

950
00:40:13,719 --> 00:40:18,239
the testing on as many of those as you

951
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:21,440
can afford so we have a representative

952
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:24,719
group if out a 30 test we get 10

953
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,519
positives or 20 um you know we'll keep

954
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:29,519
the good 10 and the other 100

955
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:30,920
uh that we go because you're still in

956
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,000
business these are the plants that made

957
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,318
you um uh tens of thousands of dollars

958
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,838
Just A Week Ago we'll go ahead and grow

959
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:41,679
them again always keeping things clean

960
00:40:38,838 --> 00:40:43,078
between uh handlings but then you know

961
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:45,838
we'll test the next round two where

962
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:47,839
hopefully we'll see you know 12 or uh 12

963
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:50,599
or so positives and then the next time

964
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:52,159
fewer than that so uh you know always a

965
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:54,000
valuable part of it and I would

966
00:40:52,159 --> 00:40:58,039
recommend you know testing at least 20

967
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,318
of every uh 130 or 40 plant batch so you

968
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:02,199
have a representative sample right and

969
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:03,920
so this is a process you've used you've

970
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:05,960
used in the past and it's been

971
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,920
successful yeah yeah this is one of the

972
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,880
best parts about it uh it's why I call

973
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,119
them buggy guys all the time is uh um

974
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,559
kind of coming up and saying hey I'm

975
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:16,720
doing this thing different and

976
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:19,880
strategically working out ways to um uh

977
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:22,358
make sure that we have a suitable sample

978
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:25,599
you know for uh for the

979
00:41:22,358 --> 00:41:27,920
testing excellent no we'd love to do an

980
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,400
application note or a case study with uh

981
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,079
some of your success stories I think

982
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,000
that would be a a great thing to have on

983
00:41:31,079 --> 00:41:34,440
our website and share with our potential

984
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,159
prospects too so if that's something

985
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:40,200
that you're interested in we could do a

986
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:43,239
nice nice co co-branded uh um document I

987
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,679
think that'd be awesome okay I'll uh

988
00:41:43,239 --> 00:41:47,479
I'll I'll send it to you as I go I just

989
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:52,078
put in another um uh 800 words yesterday

990
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:54,000
so oh excellent it is I I I will get the

991
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,359
research done because this is still

992
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,559
we've seen it on site but you know

993
00:41:56,358 --> 00:42:00,679
science is science there's a method and

994
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:02,279
we're going to do it properly besides if

995
00:42:00,679 --> 00:42:04,598
I do enough of these I may finally get

996
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,319
that degree that I've been seeking for

997
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:09,960
30 you know it's crazy I would have had

998
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:12,800
a cannabis degree you know if it

999
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:15,079
existed 169 credits under Graduate

1000
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,039
University of Florida would not leave

1001
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:19,200
school first I was growing so I could

1002
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:21,480
pay for those credits and um and they

1003
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,799
were only 99 bucks each so State schools

1004
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,760
awesome uh but um uh you know everything

1005
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:30,318
everything was really kind of cannabis

1006
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,920
horiculture molecular biology related

1007
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:33,400
you know it's just one thing right after

1008
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,480
another I was like oh this is cool they

1009
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:37,160
made me leave and I tried to get a

1010
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,119
graduate degree but no one was going to

1011
00:42:37,159 --> 00:42:39,960
take me because they didn't know what I

1012
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:42,800
was doing that's how it went and I

1013
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,000
really just couldn't marry peas or uh

1014
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:47,119
beans or corn or something like that you

1015
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,960
know uh to get in on with somebody's

1016
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,480
good graces right talk to the we about

1017
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:54,760
it we can't get you that degree but uh

1018
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,719
we we might be able to get you up on the

1019
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,319
caned stage if you if you publish that

1020
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:01,199
research or if you send that research to

1021
00:42:58,318 --> 00:43:03,519
us so uh it's a it's a decent

1022
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:06,399
consolation prize I

1023
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:09,719
suppose I I might I also promise to

1024
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,639
share a copy with Max Jones um maybe we

1025
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:14,679
can wrap that all up everybody's in this

1026
00:43:11,639 --> 00:43:16,679
game together all right Bill Before I

1027
00:43:14,679 --> 00:43:19,838
Let You Go I want to give you a chance

1028
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:22,598
to share any resources that the

1029
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:24,880
listeners or the Watchers um might be

1030
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,440
interested in to learn more about uh

1031
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:29,318
your process and some of the research

1032
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,240
that you've done and um of course plug

1033
00:43:29,318 --> 00:43:33,519
away with any other ways that people can

1034
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:35,838
get in touch with you uh learn more more

1035
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:39,318
about what you're doing oh I definitely

1036
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:42,318
appreciate thank you uh um I I post the

1037
00:43:39,318 --> 00:43:45,599
uh I post all the um Graphics uh links

1038
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:47,599
to the videos at microc clone. comom um

1039
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,280
we have the videos on YouTube under

1040
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:54,800
microcone 100 uh Instagram is microcone

1041
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,880
100 I believe uh uh Twitter x uh

1042
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:59,240
microcone Facebook Facebook microcone

1043
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:01,480
it's microcone everything and I try to

1044
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:03,519
post uh um little bits and pieces

1045
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:05,639
everywhere um so you can sort of build

1046
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:09,239
the story but the website is the uh the

1047
00:44:05,639 --> 00:44:13,239
the very best uh direct resource and my

1048
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:18,358
email is Bill micron.com

1049
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:21,639
um and uh and uh I'll uh um put up uh

1050
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:24,519
resources such as my um uh appendix or

1051
00:44:21,639 --> 00:44:27,719
the um the index of the research that we

1052
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:31,119
followed mostly uh zir punja uh some of

1053
00:44:27,719 --> 00:44:35,558
your early stuff on um on viroids and

1054
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,240
detection distribution um and uh uh

1055
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:41,040
anything related to the um uh to the uh

1056
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:43,279
shortcut propagation excellent excellent

1057
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:45,079
yeah and I've and before when I was

1058
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:47,240
getting ready to to talk with you I did

1059
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:49,760
watch some of the videos of the process

1060
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:52,679
and you make it look very easy is it as

1061
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:54,680
easy as you make it look because I think

1062
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:56,519
maybe in my mind and maybe other other

1063
00:44:54,679 --> 00:44:59,039
people's minds too like issue culture

1064
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:00,480
seems like a very kind of daunting

1065
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,119
process that you know you have to be

1066
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,920
super clean and super precise but um

1067
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,680
like I said you make it look very

1068
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:09,240
easy uh yeah I mean when you if if

1069
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:11,558
you're going to be full-on professional

1070
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:14,479
and you've got you know 100 200,000

1071
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:16,559
invested in it we'll put up you know the

1072
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,000
um uh the doors and the pass keys and so

1073
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:21,519
on but genuinely the whole idea is to

1074
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:23,800
learn start successfully get all the way

1075
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:26,960
through and we do this in that little

1076
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,280
lunchbox kit you've seen me carry um we

1077
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,838
have prepared medium in um uh the our

1078
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:34,680
starter process usually works with like

1079
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,039
an instant pot or a uh a stove top

1080
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:39,558
pressure cooker uh to sterilize media

1081
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:42,838
our transfer area is as simple as a

1082
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:45,160
plastic storage bin um and we work in a

1083
00:45:42,838 --> 00:45:47,440
little shallow saucer the plants are

1084
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:49,879
cleaned in chlorine water our choice

1085
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:54,000
chlorine is going to be uh sodium D

1086
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:56,559
chloro uh cyanurate um uh pull shock

1087
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:59,039
really it's 99% um

1088
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:01,480
uh dissociative chlorine so it's free

1089
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:02,759
chlorine uh and it evaporates so I love

1090
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,760
it because we can work in it without

1091
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:06,559
rinsing and that's a big deal and we can

1092
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,520
make it stronger but we will clean the

1093
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,559
plants in this solution and I'll

1094
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:13,000
actually put a puddle of it in the

1095
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:15,559
saucer so that as we're dissecting the

1096
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:17,318
plants um nothing is getting on there so

1097
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:20,079
that gives us a still air box and then

1098
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:22,358
lastly will be some sort of a clear grow

1099
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:24,920
area um where we can have lights on a

1100
00:46:22,358 --> 00:46:26,960
shelf and a HEPA filter running nearby

1101
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,800
to keep the air clean over there so the

1102
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,679
pressure cooker in the kitchen a pH

1103
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:33,880
meter and some mixing tools and um a

1104
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:36,318
real simple transfer area I've done this

1105
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:38,318
at trade shows I do this in hotel rooms

1106
00:46:36,318 --> 00:46:41,838
I have generally sterilized media in the

1107
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:44,358
microwave right next to the waffle maker

1108
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:46,960
in the morning and put plants in that

1109
00:46:44,358 --> 00:46:48,159
Medium before the afternoon we might

1110
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,280
have a little more incidents of

1111
00:46:48,159 --> 00:46:51,960
contamination because it's all brand new

1112
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,280
but that's usually for Learning and the

1113
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:56,440
crazy part is is we still will end up

1114
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:58,400
with like 50% clean plant

1115
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:01,519
that the grower will transplanting into

1116
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,480
plugs three weeks later that's the whole

1117
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:06,559
idea is that tissue culture is a grower

1118
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:09,199
tool they can use in the simplest area

1119
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:12,200
and can always expand it's absolutely

1120
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:14,318
scalable uh my I've got Growers who are

1121
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:16,318
up to over a thousand clones a day who

1122
00:47:14,318 --> 00:47:18,599
started with the same instant pot that

1123
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:20,079
I'm talking about right it's really just

1124
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:21,559
a way to get their feet wet and get them

1125
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,440
comfortable with it and then you can

1126
00:47:21,559 --> 00:47:26,240
scale up from there that's it that's it

1127
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:27,519
excellent that's the idea yes take the

1128
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:29,719
intimidation out of it it's a Growers

1129
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,559
tool we're Growers Growers innovate look

1130
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:33,759
at what the hell we did when growing was

1131
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:35,720
illegal you know look at what we made

1132
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,280
work the grow lights you have today you

1133
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,118
spoiled youngsters um you should have

1134
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:43,880
had it back in my day walk to school

1135
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:45,880
uphill both ways um is that you know we

1136
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,000
we made stuff from what we had I was

1137
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:49,838
like street light Warehouse light

1138
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,559
