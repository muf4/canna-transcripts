00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,599
hello thank you for coming

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,280
hope we are ready to go

3
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:12,798
i'm seth crawford my brother and i

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,239
co-founded oregon cbd in 2015

5
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:15,678
where oregon's oldest continually

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,320
operating hemp farm in the nation's

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,960
leading supplier feminized cannabis seed

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,879
when i was here last in 2018 i delivered

9
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
a presentation about the promise and

10
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:28,160
potential of developing non-thc

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
varieties grown as hemp this work can be

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,719
seen as an extension of the

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,039
well-documented breeding program

14
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:35,200
published by etienne de meyer at gw

15
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,200
pharmaceuticals which is itself the

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,719
culmination of work started at hortafarm

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,040
in the netherlands by dave watson and

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,800
rob clark in the 1990s

19
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:45,039
our intent was not to just develop

20
00:00:42,799 --> 00:00:47,119
clones with novel chemotypes like

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,439
hortifarm did rather the goal was to

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:51,119
produce field-ready f-1 versions that

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,960
would allow farmers to maximize their

24
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:55,359
yields in a way that brought these

25
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,198
cannabinoids into the mainstream

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:58,640
we set out to accomplish that task by

27
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:00,399
applying classical plant breeding

28
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,840
strategies to cannabis

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,679
isolating individuals and

30
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,040
self-pollinating through multiple inbred

31
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:09,519
generations in hopes of attaining higher

32
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,840
excuse me higher rates of homozygosity

33
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:13,438
fixing chemical composition enabling

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,880
uniform flowering responses in our

35
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,719
hybrids

36
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:18,239
and attempting to maximize heterosis

37
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:19,359
through careful selection of final

38
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,879
parents

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,400
we've been engaged in the project for

40
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,679
about eight years now and can report

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:30,079
that the first phase is complete we have

42
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,240
cbd cbdv cbg and cbgv parental stock of

43
00:01:30,078 --> 00:01:34,158
inbred photo period and day neutral

44
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,280
lines developed for hybrid f1 seed

45
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,799
production

46
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,320
the results of this approach have

47
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,600
yielded commercial varieties that set

48
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,839
the benchmark for both field

49
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,679
productivity and total cannabinoid

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
across the country

52
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:51,359
concurrently they've ushered in a new

53
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:51,359
era where non-psychoactive trim flowers

54
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:55,519
can actually compete on par with their

55
00:01:53,438 --> 00:01:57,199
thc counterparts

56
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:58,879
for consumer attention

57
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,880
farmers have received over 40 different

we're a small r d operation with an

70
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,120
oversized influence on the hemp market

71
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:31,280
in large part due to our attention to

72
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,560
detail in the breeding process and our

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,400
desire to collaborate with other

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,878
scientists to better our collective

75
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
understanding of this incredible plan

76
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:40,639
we've built out facilities that include

77
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,120
over 275 000 square feet of next

independence oregon

85
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,319
we've basically been lucky enough to

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,759
build a professional life that the

87
00:02:58,318 --> 00:03:01,280
20-year-old version

88
00:02:59,759 --> 00:03:03,039
of ourselves couldn't have dreamed up

89
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,479
and we're tremendously thankful to have

90
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:06,318
been born in the right place at the

91
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:08,799
right time who knew that a couple kids

92
00:03:06,318 --> 00:03:09,919
raised in an electricity-less log cabin

93
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,400
in the woods of southern oregon would

94
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:14,000
get such an amazing opportunity so big

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,840
thanks to mom and dad

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,800
i'd also like to thank the entire canmed

97
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,400
event team for hosting what is to me the

98
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,159
most outstanding cannabis conference in

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
the country and thank all of you for

100
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:26,158
taking the time to listen today many of

101
00:03:24,878 --> 00:03:27,919
the best and brightest minds in the

102
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:30,399
cannabis space are here and we're all

103
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,000
very lucky to get first-hand first-hand

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,560
accounts of the work being accomplished

105
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
right now i'd also like to thank

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,560
everybody on our whole team at oregon

107
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,319
cbd past present and future for their

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
contributions to the work that's going

109
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:43,839
to be discussed today and say thanks to

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,680
all of our collaborators over the past

111
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
few years there's too many to mention

112
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,599
right now but they're going to be

113
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:50,238
acknowledged throughout this

114
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:50,238
presentation

115
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,039
so the title of today's talk is phrased

116
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:56,079
as a question 2022 the golden year of

117
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,039
cannabis

118
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
full disclosure it had been 2020

119
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:02,878
the golden year of cannabis uh and then

120
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,479
a couple years of epidemiological

121
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:06,079
history got in our way

122
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,199
um i want to address the question at the

123
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,680
outset so everybody's able to

124
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:12,959
concentrate on the rest of the talk

125
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,439
yes this is the golden year

126
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,319
last year was two and the year before

127
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,599
that and next year probably be as well

128
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:21,358
um

129
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,439
it can be true regardless of your world

130
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,680
view whether the glass is truly half

131
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:27,279
full or totally empty as long as we can

132
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,280
grow for another season and build on

133
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:31,599
what we collectively learned last year

134
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:34,000
it's always going to be the golden year

135
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,320
all dialectical meanderings aside we do

136
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,040
stand at an absolutely sublime moment in

137
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,839
time for cannabis research in no small

138
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,919
part due to the rise of hemp in the u.s

139
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:46,079
the general framework for today includes

140
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:47,680
a brief overview of that program a more

141
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:49,839
in-depth dive into the use of ploidy

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,079
manipulation as a breeding tool with

143
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:53,679
triploids as the primary example and

144
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:56,478
finally we'll finish up with some

145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,639
thoughts about the next phases double

146
00:04:56,478 --> 00:05:00,959
entendre there on purpose genomics and

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
plants that will push our industry

148
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,439
forward it's going to be ample time at

149
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,038
the end for both public questions uh and

150
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,959
we do have a break conveniently

151
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:11,519
scheduled afterwards so it doesn't get

152
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,038
addressed in the public comment section

153
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:15,918
please come find me at the end i'm happy

154
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,918
to answer anything

155
00:05:16,478 --> 00:05:20,639
the u.s hemp timeline so industrial hemp

156
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:22,959
was federally legalized in the u.s via

157
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,600
the 2014 farm bill passed in december of

158
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,758
that year with a maximum allowable thc

159
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
limit of 0.3

160
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
or less

161
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,159
with the late passage many states took a

162
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,000
number of months to adopt conforming

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,039
policies and start issuing licenses to

164
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,038
growers making 2016 the first production

165
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:41,038
year in any meaningful sense

166
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,478
a strange patchwork of state enforced

167
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,399
rules were the name of the game from

168
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,199
then until this year which is the first

169
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:48,478
to be conducted under final usda rules

170
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,879
these gray

171
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:52,959
gray market area years led to variable

172
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,959
sampling methodologies compliance test

173
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,120
timing and reporting requirements across

174
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:59,120
the country with significant confusion

175
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,478
amongst regulators and farmers alike

176
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,160
occasionally leading to whole crop

177
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,758
destruction when plants tested over the

178
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,080
thc threshold

179
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
as has been established by many this thc

180
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,000
limited

181
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,599
thc limit is demonstrably arbitrary and

182
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,120
not grounded in science but that's what

183
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,720
we have to work with until congress

184
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,319
updates the rules

185
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,560
the biggest watershed moment on this

186
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,319
timeline occurs at the end of 2018 with

187
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,079
passage of the most recent farm bill

188
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,240
which did away with the research pilot

189
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,478
aspect of the original law and placed

190
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,879
fully legalized temp production in the

191
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:30,399
u.s under the jurisdiction of the usda

192
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,719
moving forward

193
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,120
usda issued an interim final rule for

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,120
producers on halloween of 2019 was

195
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,038
definitely a scare proposed that

196
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,879
sampling occur within six days of

197
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,439
harvest and be taken from the top two

198
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:45,759
inches of terminal flowers so basically

199
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:47,360
no economically valuable cbd varieties

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,840
that were being grown in the us at that

201
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,720
time would pass testing the public

202
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:55,279
comment period was intense farmers were

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,960
pissed and luckily this time around we

204
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:58,799
had some help from universities studying

205
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,318
the crop for the first time

206
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,919
after reviewing public feedback and

207
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
coordinating with other affected federal

208
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:08,318
agencies usda concretized the final

209
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,079
final rules on january 19 2021.

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,240
these require that all states with hemp

211
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,079
programs submit a control plan for usda

212
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,319
approval which most have completed at

213
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:17,918
this point would-be producers in states

214
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,160
without formal programs are able to

215
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:21,598
apply for a license directly from the

216
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,439
usda

217
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,519
the final rules made compliance sampling

218
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,839
much more uniform nationally with a

219
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:28,959
28-day pre-harvest when uh window

220
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:30,638
instituted

221
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:32,799
in a sampling protocol that calls for

222
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,598
the top five to eight inches of of the

223
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:37,120
main female cola while some variability

224
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:39,680
still exists from state to state and

225
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:41,360
from sampler to sampler

226
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,598
it's been tamped down substantially

227
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,280
through this harmonization

228
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:47,199
in a parallel effort the national

229
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,198
institutes for standards and testing

230
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
started a voluntary program for cannabis

231
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,800
testing labs in may of 2019 called the

232
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,918
canna qap or cannabis quality assurance

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,840
program

234
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:59,758
the goal of this program is to establish

235
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:01,439
uniformity in analytical measurement

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
through distributed testing of material

237
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,918
with known cannabinoid profiles and

238
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,000
publicly releasing the results

239
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,918
taken together it's clear to see that

240
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
federal agencies are preparing for

241
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:14,079
national legalization and hemp is

242
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
serving as the test case

243
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,439
from 2020 on

244
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,759
a number of previously unavailable

245
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:24,160
cannabinoids entered the marketplace so

246
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,639
delta 8 thc delta 10 thc thco

247
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,240
hydrogenated cannabinoids if you can

248
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,079
name it enterprising chemists with

249
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,439
varying levels of skill and equipment

250
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,360
we're making it out of hemp derived

251
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:34,958
precursors while there's been

252
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,879
significant consternation about the

253
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:39,199
safety of these products largely due to

254
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:41,360
residual residual contaminants and

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,200
unknown compounds being generated in the

256
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
conversion process

257
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
movements by individual states to rein

258
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,759
in potentially intoxicating hemp

259
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,919
derivatives

260
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:52,559
uh have really been met by a lot of

261
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,039
permissiveness by the federal uh with

262
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:56,639
the federal response the last note on

263
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,639
this timeline directly addresses these

264
00:08:56,639 --> 00:09:01,600
new compounds and essentially any other

265
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:04,000
product made from cannabis grown as hemp

266
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,240
on january 6th of this year the dea sent

267
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,720
a policy determination letter to a hemp

268
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,480
product manufacturer that clearly stated

269
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,200
the agency does not have enforcement

270
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,200
authority over hemp in any way delta 8

271
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,200
thc derived

272
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,278
including delta 8 thc derived from the

273
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,278
isomerization of cbd

274
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:23,838
so this obviously has significant

275
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,838
implications

276
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,919
production of hemp over this same period

277
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:34,480
of time underwent a absolutely meteoric

278
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:36,879
ascent peaking in the summer of 2019

279
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,519
following passage of the new farm bill

280
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,360
overproduction ensued prices plummeted

281
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,839
and in action by the fda created a

282
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,320
cacophony of doubt amongst established

283
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,240
product manufacturers over the future of

284
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,080
hemp-derived cannabinoids

285
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
the initial rapid expansion in

286
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,759
production was met with an equally

287
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,159
precipitous decline in total acres

288
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,838
registered and farmgate prices to the

289
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:59,439
point where it's not economical to grow

290
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,839
for most farmers

291
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,680
biomass prices so this is the floral

292
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
material destined for extraction

293
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,319
bottomed out around 50 cents per pound

294
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,079
earlier this year and are slowly

295
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,480
creeping up as the tremendous glut of

296
00:10:10,078 --> 00:10:14,159
material finally starts to dissipate

297
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,159
the trimmed hemp flower market is still

298
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:17,919
holding on but is a very small

299
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:18,958
proportion of the total acres planted

300
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,439
each year

301
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:23,679
registered acres as you can see

302
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,240
in 2022 are currently estimated to be

303
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:29,599
slightly more than 2017

304
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,440
but still quite a bit less than 2018.

305
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,440
the few farmers who have held on over

306
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,680
the last three years are desperately

307
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,360
hoping for a solid price rebound but at

308
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,879
this point who really knows what's going

309
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
to transpire

310
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,720
if anything the tendency of boom and

311
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,959
bust cycles with recently opened

312
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,200
cannabis markets is a stark reminder

313
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,838
that efficiency marketability and

314
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,040
novelty are all mandatory for growers to

315
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,040
simply stay in business

316
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,600
the silver lining here despite the

317
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:01,599
market collapse is that hemp viewed as a

318
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,360
vehicle for research has absolutely

319
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,120
exploded during this production collapse

320
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,560
as universities join industry and their

321
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,799
ability to handle the plant in a

322
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:10,639
relatively uninhibited way

323
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:12,879
a key regulatory scientific and

324
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:15,199
practical farming question has been

325
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:17,439
where does residual thc come from in

326
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,120
type 3 and type 4 plants

327
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,959
the question was of critical importance

328
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,480
while the usda was proposing rules for

329
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,319
the hemp industries their initial

330
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,399
versions would have essentially ended

331
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,079
cbd production and we believe in this

332
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,039
case that some good science actually

333
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,879
affected national policy for once

334
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:35,039
uh no free and co-authors gave us some

335
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:37,360
tantalizing clues in their 2015 survey

336
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,480
of gw pharmaceuticals diverse germplasm

337
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,919
library

338
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,920
demonstrating a relationship between

certain single-letter nucleotide changes

in the genes responsible for cbd-a and

343
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:53,838
thca production lead to different

344
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:57,119
cannabinoid purities ranging from 66 to

345
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,200
90 percent in the case of cbda in type 3

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,200
plants leaving up to 10 percent of the

347
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,600
total cannabinoid fraction as other

348

producers

350
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,919
zurple's 2018 paper demonstrates that

351
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,959
cbd as the gene responsible for cbd

352
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:12,799
production

353
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:17,599
in vitro produces

354
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:19,599
cbd a thca cbca and five other unknown

355
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,159
compounds in ratios affected by

356
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,440
substrate ph but reportedly normalized

357
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:28,078
to 20 to 1 1-1 for the known products

358
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:29,680
larry smart's lab at cornell

359
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:30,958
has done some great work over the past

360
00:12:29,679 --> 00:12:33,039
three years cataloging and

361
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:34,638
characterizing commercially available

362
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,159
hemp varieties and getting great

363
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,278
graduate student publications in the

364
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:39,120
process

365
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:41,439
their work on time series cannabinoid

366
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,560
accumulation in field trials shows that

367
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,519
most type 3 germplasm grown in the u.s

368
00:12:44,559 --> 00:12:49,838
tested about 25 to 1 cbd to thc

369
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,799
throughout its flowering period

370
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,120
taken together we now know that most thc

371
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:56,799
produced in these high cbd varieties is

372
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,278
coming from the gene responsible for

373
00:12:56,799 --> 00:13:01,519
cbda production you can't have one

374
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,399
without the other but their co-presence

375
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,399
is predictable

376
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,399
during this time we spent a lot of

377
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,919
energy in these intervening years

378
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:11,919
developing varieties that would meet a

379
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:14,000
stringent 0.3

380
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:16,799
day of harvest limit since that was the

381
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,879
initial direction proposed by the usda

382
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,599
we were successful in doing so with cbg

383
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:23,120
dominant varieties as well as cbdv rich

384
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,879
varieties

385
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,039
our cbg varieties are made possible

386
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:28,879
through a synthase variant we found in

387
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:32,838
one of our inbred populations it's a

388
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:35,759
full length thcas with a single snip at

389
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:37,839
1064 base pairs responsible for

390
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:41,439
significant loss of function with final

391
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:44,000
flowers averaging 100 to 1 cbga to thca

392
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,199
ratios and always compliant when grown

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,799
as hem

394
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:48,319
our work with high varying content

395
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:50,719
varieties has shown that unlike their

396
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,040
pencil counterparts the cannabinoid

397
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,278
fraction undergoes dramatic changes over

398
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:56,879
the course of flowering the varying

399
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,360
proportion of total cannabinoids

400
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,958
decreases as flowers mature from a

401
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,480
compliance perspective this is a really

402
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:07,919
beneficial outcome since thcva is not

403
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,120
included in the 0.3 total thc harvest

404
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:14,559
limit in this example thc va is present

405
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:16,639
at levels three times higher than thca

406
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:18,799
at that critical 28-day pre-harvest

407
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,079
window but the two dropped to an equal

408
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:24,319
one-to-one ratio by the end of flowering

409
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,559
the shift in federal policy to a 28-day

410
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,519
pre-harvest test allows nearly all type

411
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:31,439
3 plants to test below the legal limit

412
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,919
if varieties are fully mature in eight

413
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,839
weeks even with high cannabinoid content

414
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,439
hemp and we believe that this is a good

415
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,040
compromise until congress can be

416
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:43,959
convinced to implement a one percent

417
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:43,958
total thc rule across the board

418
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:48,240
other recent research has significantly

419
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,320
contributed to our understanding of

420
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,519
specific traits and relative genomic

421
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,320

chromosomes 3 4 6 9 and the x chromosome

428
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:13,198
there have also been some really great

429
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:15,759
papers on terpene synthase pathways

430
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,120
recently with the allen booth and zagger

432
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,959
three independent papers really standing

433
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:23,120
out as the most useful these help us

434
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,799
place many of the mono and sesquiterpene

435

tps variants on chromosomes 1 5 and 6

places the cbgas synthase on the x

chromosome as well

442
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:47,600
our team used lighthouse genomics snip

chip data from a segregating f2

444

cannabis

448
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
and show that its location is on

449
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,199
chromosome 2.

450
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199

chromosome one as well

456
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,360
subsequent aluminum shotgun sequencing

457
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:19,119
of the same population by nrgene and

458

data analysis with our collaborators at

459
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,839
osu and the vining lab yielded markers

460
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,240
associated with elevated total propyl

461
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,000
cannabinoid fractions which we know from

462
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,320
other publications to be a polygenic

463
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,480
trait on chromosomes 3 4 5 7 8

464

and 9 with a single marker on chromosome

465
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
3 having the greatest impact

466
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,278
between the shifting policy landscape

467
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,959
and research developments cannabis

468
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:44,720
essential oil breeding programs are

469
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:46,319
quickly moving from an opaque guessing

470
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,399
game requiring multiple methods of

471
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,759
triangulation

472
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,759
to one where many traits can be

473
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,919
determined at the seedling stage with

474
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,759
targeted pcr tests and particular

475
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:57,919
crosses can be designed in a way that

476
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,639
maximizes successful outcomes while not

477
00:16:57,919 --> 00:17:02,399
getting mired down in impossible dreams

478
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,318
this becomes even more important as we

479
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,880
consider that the frontier of production

480
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:09,199
of all cannabinoid plant types will most

481
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,360
likely be polyploid and much more

482
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,079
genetically complex than the diploids we

483
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,078
all know and love

484
00:17:14,558 --> 00:17:20,480
so why triploids let's turn to triploids

485
00:17:18,318 --> 00:17:21,918
triploids are cannabis plants that are

486
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,558
basically incredibly resistant to

487
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:26,480
pollination as well as have

488
00:17:24,558 --> 00:17:29,359
exciting attributes brought on by extra

489
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,360
genome copies

490
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,558
our development of triploids was born

491
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:34,400
out of the trauma of losing several

492
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:38,480
crops to cross-pollination events in

493
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:40,640
2016 and 2018 and hearing horror stories

494
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,160
from growers year after year

495
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
if you've grown cannabis you likely

496
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,798
understand how devastating

497
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,319
pollen drift can be on crops and it can

498
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:49,519
travel hundreds of miles in the right

499
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,279
conditions

500
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,038
fully pollinated plants produce 50

501
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,519
percent less flower weight and 30

502
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:56,798
percent less cannabinoids a seeded crop

503
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:58,798
is essentially worthless if you're

504
00:17:56,798 --> 00:18:01,599
growing for trim flowers and still

505
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,038
devastating if your end goal is biomass

506
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,558
and extraction

507
00:18:03,038 --> 00:18:06,240
as we've also seen in the first seven

508
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:08,558
years of production in oregon feral

509
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:10,798
populations of cannabis are regularly

510
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:12,879
establishing themselves in fallow fields

511
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:14,480
and become a big enough concern that our

512
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,080
department of agriculture is now working

513
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,640
on rules and penalties for landowners

514
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:20,639
who fail to control rogue plants

515
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,480
in newly opened midwestern production

516
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
areas previous research has shown that

517
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,798
over a third of all airborne pollen

518
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,960
in the summertime in the month of august

519
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,400
is derived from feral hemp

520
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,480
having a plant that's relatively

521
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,320
incapable of being pollinated could fix

522
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,759
a lot of those issues and threats and

523
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,599
let farmers put their energy into

524
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:41,279
growing great crops instead of worrying

525
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,038
so to understand triploids we need to

526
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,319
establish some basic terminology and i

527
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:47,519
apologize

528
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:50,240
to anyone who this is uh easy for me it

529
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,759
is not it's been a long a long trip

530
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,558
chromosomes are packed together

531
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:57,038
collections of dna so dna is the

532
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,038
underlying genetic instructions for life

533
00:18:57,038 --> 00:19:01,440
it's helpful to think of chromosomes as

534
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,359
books of code which make up the library

535
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,960
that is an organism

536
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:07,678
every species has a unique number of

537
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,400
books in its library humans have 46

538
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,720
naked mole rats have 60 and cannabis has

539
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,919
20 in the diploid state

540
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,240
this library

541
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,759
size is referred to as the chromosome

542
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,599
sat number

543
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,519
ploiety refers to the number of

544
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,639
homologous sets of chromosomes in an

545
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,480
organism

546
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,320
organisms with a single set are referred

547
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,519
to as haploid

548
00:19:26,319 --> 00:19:32,558
two is diploid three sets triploid four

549
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:34,798
sets tetraploid so on and so forth

550
00:19:32,558 --> 00:19:37,599
any organism with a ploidy higher than

551
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,918
two is referred to as a polyploid

552
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:41,599
in sexually reproducing species one half

553
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:44,320
of the chromosome sets are inherited

554
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,000
from each respective parent for humans

555
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:47,519
this means our individual genome is

556
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,319
actually a fusion of two different

557
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,960
genomes cut in half during reproduction

558
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,918
we're truly one half of both parents the

559
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:58,319
same is true for diploid plants

560
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,960
while most vertebrates are diploid many

561
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:03,119
many plants are polyploid these include

562
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,120
major agricultural crops of critical

563
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:08,639
importance to humans such as coffee

564
00:20:05,119 --> 00:20:11,359
bananas strawberries bread wheat oats

565
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:13,759
citrus potatoes and tobacco to just name

566
00:20:11,359 --> 00:20:15,399
a few

567
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:17,759
the main point to understand is that

568
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,840
polyploidization is a natural phenomenon

569
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:21,119
that has occurred many times in nature

570
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,678
and has led to the creation of the

571
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,839
ancestors of many modern crops

572
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,240
polyploid induction in nature tends to

573
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:30,319
correspond with extreme climate events

574
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,880
or natural disasters and lead to

575
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:34,558
increased diversity within a species

576
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,720
the only documented naturally occurring

577
00:20:34,558 --> 00:20:39,519
tetraploid cannabis population was found

578
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,038
at 14 000 feet in elevation in the

579
00:20:39,519 --> 00:20:43,200
himalayas by

580
00:20:41,038 --> 00:20:44,158
an indian research effort about 10 years

581
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,080
ago

582
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,679
the extreme climate and altitude may

583
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:49,759
have been the causal agent responsible

584
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,360
for that particular event

585
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:53,679
we can think of this as nature's way of

586
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,839
creating options for diverse responses

587
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:57,440
under changing circumstances

588
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:59,038
it's also important to note that these

589
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,000
events are not changing the underlying

590
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:04,480
dna in any way or introducing new genes

591
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,480
they're simply whole genome duplications

592
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,480
of what was already present

593
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,319
in the case of polyploids more gene

594
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:13,120
copies is believed to confer better

595
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:14,399
adaptability and resilience

596
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:16,399
plant breeders became aware of the

597
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,159
remarkable superiority of polyploids in

598
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,919
the mid 20th century and have induced

599
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,240
polyploidy and or used natural

600
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,799
polyploids in many ways to obtain

601
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,400
increasingly improved plant cultivars

602
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:28,158
some of the most important consequences

603
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,559
of polyploidy for plant breeding are the

604
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:33,600
increased size of plant organs so bigger

605
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,839
flowers bigger leaves bigger stems the

606
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:38,000
buffering of deleterious mutations

607
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,158
increased heterozygosity and superior

608
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,599
heterosis or hybrid vigor

609
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,760
cultivars have been generated with

610
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:45,839
higher yields improved product quality

611
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,679
and increase tolerance to both biotic

612
00:21:45,839 --> 00:21:50,240
and abiotic stresses

613
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,480
polyploidy is a tried and true method of

614
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,640
improvement in many crops

615
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,798
an important bonus to all this is that

616
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:59,840
plants with odd chromosome set numbers

617
00:21:56,798 --> 00:22:02,079
so triploids pentaploids and so on often

618
00:21:59,839 --> 00:22:04,879
prove to be infertile this is what makes

619
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:06,809
seedless watermelons bananas hops and

620
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,839
now cannabis a reality

621
00:22:06,809 --> 00:22:09,838
[Music]

622
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,158
the only thing you need to know about

623
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,960
this is that the haploid cannabis genome

624
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,200
is 800 megabases in size we'll save some

625
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
time

626
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,679
our polyploid development program was

627
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:25,359
designed and led by dr shen chen osu

628
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,400
grad who's now an assistant professor at

629
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,240
nc state

630
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,240
um our goal was to convert our diploid

631
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,159
breeding stock these you know take three

632
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,240
to four years to develop on their own

633
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,400
but our goal was to convert these into

634
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,159
tetraploids and beyond

635
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,480
test the fertility of various ploidies

636
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,799
and controlled environments and to test

637
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:44,720
the agronomic traits of various ploities

638
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:45,918
via controlled crosses and initial field

639
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,319
trials

640
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,000
this work began in early 2019 and was

641
00:22:48,319 --> 00:22:52,399
occurring simultaneously to the efforts

642
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,240
at canopy growth corporation and jessica

643
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,080
level brands lab at the university of

644
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,440
connecticut both of whom have recently

645
00:22:56,079 --> 00:23:00,079
published papers describing their

646
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,640
processes and we did as well

647
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:05,038
i say this is a is a way of not so

648
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,640
subtly conveying some disapproval of the

649
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,879
most recent claim to emerge from a large

650
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,320
purveyor of clones here in california

651
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,360
who if you were at the emerald cup last

652
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,279
december you probably know what i'm

653
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:14,479
talking about just launched what they

654
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:16,319
purported to be the world's first

655
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,679
triploid cannabis

656
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:19,678
in a day and age so rife with

657
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:21,200
misinformation history will probably not

658
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,038
care one way or the other but for some

659
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
of us truth is more important than

660
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:26,158
marketing efforts and i i for one

661
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,520
believe it's important to acknowledge

662
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:29,760
the labor of others that led to

663
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:31,599
increased knowledge that benefits us all

664
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,119
on that note while our company was

665
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,759
actually the first to offer triple-a

666
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,879
cannabis commercially in 2021 the harder

667
00:23:35,759 --> 00:23:38,158
farm group that i had previously

668
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,000
mentioned

669
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,840
led by dave watson

670
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,519
were likely the first to test triploids

671
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:45,759
back in the 1990s and i'd like to

672
00:23:43,519 --> 00:23:47,440
publicly acknowledge that effort and his

673
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,038
encouragement of our program as we went

674
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,120
through the r d phase

675
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:52,480
so that aside let's get into the details

676
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,319
and our findings from the past three

677
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,319
years on cannabis polity research

678
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,480
controlled genome doubling events

679
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,199
require initial plants a cell division

680
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,038
inhibitor steady hands patients and a

681
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,038
flow cytometer which is a really cool

682
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:09,278
piece of equipment capable of measuring

683
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,440
an organism's cell size

684
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:13,519
hundreds of asexually propagated clones

685
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:16,320
of a target plant genotype are pruned

686
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:19,038
back until a single growth point remains

687
00:24:16,319 --> 00:24:20,399
and then colchicine is applied to that

688
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,960
growth point

689
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,640
most plants die within a month

690
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,798
the few survivors are screened by flow

691
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,278
cytometry and any confirmed tetraploids

692
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:31,038
move on to the stabilization process

693
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:32,798
at each step plants are re-screened

694
00:24:31,038 --> 00:24:35,119
repeatedly as they have a tendency to

695
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,679
revert to lower or mixed pleiades until

696
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:39,759
fixed a term i use lightly is diploid

697
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,919
reversion is always a possibility under

698
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:44,640
stressful conditions

699
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,880
if a plant has 10 shoots all 10 shoots

700
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,640
are tested this continues until that

701
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,400
relative stability is attained and then

702
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,720
the plants are ready for seed production

703
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,080
in our case but not before a final flow

704
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,000
testing

705
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,000
to date we've now successfully created

706
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:02,319
tetraploid versions of all of our

707
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,119
classic cbd cbg cbdv and cbgv production

708
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:07,439
mothers as well as a long list of type 1

709
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:09,119
plants in our germplasm library and have

710
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,759
incorporated the streamlined conversion

711
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:13,839
process into our breeding program start

712
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:15,839
to finish this process takes about eight

713
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:17,839
months it's not the breeding that leads

714
00:25:15,839 --> 00:25:19,519
up to it but just the conversion process

715
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:21,119
is about eight months

716
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:22,480
if you guys have time everybody have

717
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,918
time we've got about a three minute

718
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,159
video clip

719
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:29,278
okay cool everybody's got time

720
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:30,720
this is brendan rojas he is our employee

721
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:31,599
lab manager and he's going to walk you

722
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,360
through

723
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:35,119
a very quick description of what it

724
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,719
looks like in the greenhouse in the lab

725
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:39,119
to actually convert and test these

726
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,120
plants

727
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,120
i'm going to go through the process for

728
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:46,879
converting plants the first step is

729
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:49,439
after we've gotten the plants is we'll

730
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,799
trim it down to just a single meristem

731
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,400
for this plant you can see it's right at

732
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:54,720
the top just right here this one single

733
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,880
meristem and after that what we'll do is

734
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,400
we'll take a piece of cotton and we'll

735
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,080
just wrap it right around that one

736
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
single meristem and then come in with

737
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,798
colchicine and add just a little bit of

738
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,839
colchicine to fully hydrate that cotton

739
00:26:04,798 --> 00:26:08,639
swab

740
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,480
so after everything's been treated we

741
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,679
we need to keep the plants moist and

742
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
warm so that they have a good

743
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,798
environment to grow in to do that we use

744
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:18,480
a second one of these black trays and we

745
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,038
prop it up with cinder blocks and then

746
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,038
we use this plastic to wrap all the way

747
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:25,519
around to ensure that it

748
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:28,079
holds that humidity inside

749
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,079
once once everything's uh been treated

750
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,918
we do the treatments for

751
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,079
four days in a row at the end of the

752
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,960
fourth day we pull the cotton off and

753
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:39,119
then rinse the meristems with water so

754
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,679
that we rinse off any of that excess

755
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,359
colchicine and then after

756
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,960
after they've been treated

757
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:47,359
in about two weeks we'll start to see

758
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,360
growth from those points and with that

759
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:51,359
growth we'll take them up to the tissue

760
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,519
culture building to start running flow

761
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:55,918
on them and to check our results so at

762
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:58,639
this point i've gotten i've got a plant

763
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,799
that's been treated with colchicine uh

764
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,600
just one single meristem was treated and

765
00:27:00,798 --> 00:27:03,519
then

766
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,759
what we have in front of us is a plant

767
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:07,918
that's grown up from that single stem

768
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,519
and what i'll do is i'll come in with a

769
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,919
pair of scissors

770
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,400
and i'll take just one leaf sample the

771
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
samples can range in size

772
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
we don't need a whole leaf i can use as

773
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:20,879
little as just

774
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,519
a leaf tip very small

775
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,399
we have two buffers that the sample goes

776
00:27:23,519 --> 00:27:26,480
into

777
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:28,398
the first one's an extraction buffer

778
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,319
that just helps make sure that when

779
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:33,278
you're chopping the plant material the

780
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:35,599
nuclei in the plant material don't

781
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:37,839
break apart and the second one is a

782
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:39,839
fluorescent stain buffer

783
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:42,158
which dyes the

784
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:44,879
nuclei of the cells within the plant

785
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:46,799
material which makes it possible for our

786
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,399
flow cytometer to

787
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:52,079
actually read the

788
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:52,079
genetic material in the nuclei

789
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,600
so this is the extraction buffer

790
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,730
it goes into a petri dish

791
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:05,009
it gets chopped

792
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,009
[Applause]

793
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:09,759
the nuclei gets stained

794
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,919
we then run the plant material through a

795
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:16,789
filter

796
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,038
so we don't clog up our machine

797
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:20,079
[Applause]

798
00:28:19,038 --> 00:28:21,839
goes

799
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:24,639
into the sample cell

800
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:24,639
and then

801
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,000
it should start running

802
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,200
so after the sample has been prepared

803
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,840
and we put it into the flow machine what

804
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,080
the flow cytometer actually does is it

805
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:43,199
it takes the liquid that we just

806
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:46,398
prepared and it runs it through a very

807
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:48,798
small cuvette in a single file line

808
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:51,439
where it lines up all the nuclei

809
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:53,839
in just one row and then it shoots a uv

810
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,600
light through the nucleus as it goes

811
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,639
through this one cuvette

812
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:02,398
so based off of how the uv light

813
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,759
reflects off of the nuclei that we just

814
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:05,839
prepared

815
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,720
that's how it gets the readout and we

816
00:29:05,839 --> 00:29:11,678
get the results on a graph so it's kind

817
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:15,200
of like a relative peak of the genetic

818
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,120
material within the nuclei

819
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,840
awesome thank you brendan it's oregon

820
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:23,038
cannabis breeding duct tape zip ties and

821
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,959
now with laser beams

822
00:29:23,038 --> 00:29:26,798
our lab's been operating with the two

823
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
quantum p flow cytometer units for the

824
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:31,119
past couple years we just recently added

825
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,440
a high-throughput cytoflex v2 with two

826
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,959
lasers which i'm told is great it's a

827
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,278
higher throughput allows us to use

828
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,200
standard 96 well plates to be able to

829
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:40,880
have a much much

830
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:43,679
larger number of plants get screened at

831
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,440
any given time

832
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:47,200
you can see in these images

833
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,200
the resulting peaks generated by that

834
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,759
flow cytometer when testing plant

835
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,679
material in various ploieties so fluid

836
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:55,839
cytometer results in the far left and

837
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:58,559
then some chromosome squash

838
00:29:55,839 --> 00:30:00,639
pictures from pictures from microscope

839
00:29:58,558 --> 00:30:02,240
in the middle there

840
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,399
using multiple methods to validate

841
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,839
ploidy levels is especially necessary

842
00:30:04,398 --> 00:30:07,519
when creating bass lines for further

843
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,599
analysis but the chromosome pictures

844
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:11,679
here help to convey the cellular changes

845
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:13,678
present in these polyplates there's

846
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,440
really a lot more genetic information in

847
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:16,798
these plants and you can see it when you

848
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,960
get close enough

849
00:30:16,798 --> 00:30:21,679
diploid cannabis plants contain about 60

850
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,960
000 genes and have a genome size of 1.6

851
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,440
gigabases

852
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:28,159
triploids contain about 90 000 genes and

853
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,440
have a genome size of 2.4 gigabases

854
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,399
tetraploids contain 120 000 genes and

855
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,558
have a genome size of 3.2 gigabases or

856
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,479
roughly half the size of humans

857
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,240
these extra gene copies are what is

858
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,140
believed to drive resilience and

859
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,440
adaptability in polyploids

860
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:45,440
[Music]

861
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,880
so seedlessness and triple-a cannabis

862
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
would be an awesome thing right but we

863
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,720
had to design some experiments that

864
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,480
would adequately test that claim

865
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,798
to do so we created six crossing

866
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:57,120
combinations to assess seed production

867
00:30:54,798 --> 00:30:59,038
and viability diploid triploid and

868
00:30:57,119 --> 00:31:01,199
tetraploid versions of the same f1

869
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:03,759
hybrid were pollinated by diploid and

870
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,519
tetrapoid pollen donors these trials

871
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:06,960
were conducted in sealed greenhouses and

872
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,960
the target plants were subjected to

873
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,278
massive amounts of pollen this was

874
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:13,519
intended to simulate a flower crop grown

875
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,679
side by side with a large grain farm or

876
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,278
dense feral populations

877
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:19,519
the results show that diploids

878
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:21,519
pollinated by diploids produce about two

879
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,759
times as many seeds as tetraploids

880
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,919
pollinated by tetraploids suggesting

881
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,839
that ploidy increases result in lower

882
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,679
fertility in cannabis

883
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:32,079
tetraploids are not viable as a pollen

884
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:35,200
donor for diploids but are able to

885
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,038
induce many problematically empty seeds

886
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,720
the key finding is that seed production

887
00:31:37,038 --> 00:31:40,720
was essentially non-existent in

888
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,480
triploids when pollinated by either a

889
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,600
diploid or a tetraploid in this

890
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,440
experiment

891
00:31:43,599 --> 00:31:47,839
even under substantial duress they

892
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,480
remain nearly seed free with a maximum

893
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:52,480
average of six seeds per triploid plant

894
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,319
when pollinated by diploids in the

895
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,319
controlled pollen inundation zone

896
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:00,398
in addition to significantly impeded

897
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:02,640
fertility triploids also demonstrated

898
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:05,439
superiority in many key agronomic traits

899
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:07,278
relative to their diploid counterparts

900
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,360
we conducted outdoor field trials at our

901
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,599
campus in 2020 with several different

902
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,119
diploid triploid and tetraploid crossing

903
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:15,038
combinations

904
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:17,119
flower production increased between 30

905
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:19,200
to 100 percent although that was variety

906
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:21,038
dependent with the largest leaves seen

907
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,880
in day neutral varieties

908
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,119
the yield differences are statistically

909
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,360
significant but the visual differences

910
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:30,079
in plant size larger leaves larger

911
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,278
flowers thicker stems denser trichome

912
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,960
coverage

913
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:34,398
tells you all you need to know about

914
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,840
triploid vigor

915
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:37,678
there's a slight increase in total

916
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,199
cannabinoid content in flowers and a

917
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,559
market increase

918
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,759
in

919
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,079
excuse me

920
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:45,278
in trichome density on sugar leaves near

921
00:32:44,079 --> 00:32:47,359
flowers

922
00:32:45,278 --> 00:32:49,278
additionally olfactory compounds were

923
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,678
noticeably more abundant in triploids

924
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:53,359
and tetraploids compared to diploids but

925
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,038
we did not test for total terpene

926
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,278
content in this study because terpenes

927
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:58,960
tell us less than half the story and

928
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:00,480
most of the major aroma components of

929
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,640
our varieties are not terpenes at all

930
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,558
there's more about that to come we don't

931
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,919
have enough time for the entire story

932
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:07,599
today but we'll get into it with a

933
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:09,679
little bit more detail later

934
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:11,359
these early results suggested

935
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,600
that triploids are much more resilient

936
00:33:11,359 --> 00:33:15,439
to any challenges they face relative to

937
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:17,678
diploid counterparts

938
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,360
in 2021 we followed up with extended

939
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,519
field trials at north carolina state

940
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:23,199
university cornell and the university of

941
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,200
kentucky as part of our founding

942
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,960
membership of the far sponsored hemp

943
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,319
research consortium

944
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,240
the study designed at all three

945
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:31,918
institutions were very similar with

946
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,240
diploid and triploid versions of our

947
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
feminized varieties planted on four-foot

948
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:38,480
centers at two separate outdoor field

949
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:40,640
sites in each study one field was

950
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,240
designated as a negative pollen control

951
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,640
and the other was purposefully planted

952
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:46,000
at a high density with male female

953
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,480
diploid grain

954
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,558
grain varieties immediately adjacent to

955
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,159
the trial locations

956
00:33:50,558 --> 00:33:53,759
final research reports from all three

957
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,760
institutions will be available on their

958
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:57,200
extension website soon but they were

959
00:33:55,759 --> 00:34:00,558
kind enough to grant us some of the

960
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,720
preliminary data for today

961
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,079
in north carolina the goldsboro location

962
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000
served as the positive pollen

963
00:34:04,079 --> 00:34:07,119
environment and salisbury the negative

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,280
control

965
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:11,118
white cbg's super haze and lifter

966
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,280
varieties were trialled in both diploid

967
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,960
and triploid form thanks to david

968
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:18,079
souchoff and his team for their work on

969
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,159
this trial and the subsequent data

970
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,320
at the negative pollen control salisbury

971
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:25,838
site differences in biomass defined as

972
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:27,359
non-stem flower foliage and any seed

973
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:28,960
produced

974
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,398
differences in biomass between the two

975
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,240
ploidies at harvest was not

976
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,358
statistically significant but it is

977
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:35,838
worth noting that the amount of

978
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:38,000
variation was greater in the triploids

979
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:40,078
at the positive pollen goldsboro

980
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,918
location biomass production was greater

981
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,760
in triploids by about a quarter pound

982
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,480
per plant and the difference was

983
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,919
statistically significant

984
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,838
differences in seeding were all

985
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,078
statistically significant pollinated

986
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:54,719
diploids produced about 2500 seeds per

987
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,560
plant while triploids were around 50 or

988
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,319
about 2 percent relative to their

989
00:34:56,559 --> 00:34:59,679
diploid counterparts

990
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,519
seed weight per plant followed a

991
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:03,199
genotype specific pattern that at this

992
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:04,239
point generates more questions than

993
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:06,239
answers

994
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:08,319
relative seed size between the genotypes

995
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:10,399
varies with lifter seed much smaller

996
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:11,920
than white cbg in general which may

997
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:13,680
account for some of the variation seen

998
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,159
here but there also seems to be an

999
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,399
unexplainable element at play as well

1000
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:20,000
note the single outlier with much higher

1001
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,599
seed

1002
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
seed weight present in the triploid

1003
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:25,760
super haze variety it's just a little

1004
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,480
line up there on the triploid section on

1005
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,480
the far right

1006
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:33,920
trials at cornell included lifter super

1007
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:36,559
haze and white cbg in both diploid and

1008
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,800
triploid forms as well as sour lifter

1009
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:40,480
sour super haze and sour rna as

1010
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,320
triploids only

1011
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,280
thanks to larry smart and his lab for

1012
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:47,200
their work on this project

1013
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,240
this particular trial is a great example

1014
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:52,399
of the phrase farming happens

1015
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,319
strip biomass yields highlight this as

1016
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,559
triploids did not fare as well compared

1017
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:59,039
to their diploid counterparts with super

1018
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,960
haze being the lone exception

1019
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:02,719
the problem here was that large portions

1020
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,480
of the negative pollen trial site were

1021
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:06,879
subjected to catastrophic flooding

1022
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,639
multiple multiple times this past summer

1023
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,720
and we're eager to follow up next year

1024
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,679
to get improved data

1025
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:15,358
that said it's definitely an example of

1026
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,159
a time where negative environmental

1027
00:36:15,358 --> 00:36:21,039
events do seem to impact triploids more

1028
00:36:18,159 --> 00:36:21,039
than diploids

1029
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,760
in terms of seed counts and weight

1030
00:36:23,838 --> 00:36:27,679
triploids again demonstrated their

1031
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,960
remarkable infertility relative to

1032
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:33,039
diploids at the pollen positive site

1033
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,838
triploids contain an average of 11.3

1034
00:36:33,039 --> 00:36:38,559
percent as many seeds as diploids and

1035
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:40,880
produce 10.5 percent as much seed weight

1036
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,559
as diploids

1037
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,079
while a good result for triploids the

1038
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:47,759
seed amounts are significantly higher

1039
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:47,760
than those reported at nc state

1040
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,358
in kentucky the north farm location

1041
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,800
served as the positive pollen

1042
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:55,440
environment and the south farm the

1043
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,680
negative control in this study lifter

1044
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,000
and white cbg were trialed as diploids

1045
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:02,239
and triploids while our new forbidden v

1046
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,719
and pinewalker cbdv dominant triploid

1047
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:06,399
varieties were also included thanks to

1048
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,039
bob pierce and his team for their work

1049
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,119
on this trial and data collection

1050
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,279
biomass and seed yields were reported as

1051
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,200
pounds per acre in this study with the

1052
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,040
exception of diploid lifter overall

1053
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:20,000
biomass yields were higher at the

1054
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:22,480
pollinated site relative to the negative

1055
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
negative pollen control site which when

1056
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,760
taking the underlying seed weights into

1057
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,358
account suggests that environmental

1058
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,280
conditions may have contributed to this

1059
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:31,199
particular outcome as well

1060
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,200
that said triploids consistently

1061
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,598
produced more biomass than their diploid

1062
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:37,679
counterparts in both locations and again

1063
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:40,640
produced very few seeds when subjected

1064
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,639
to pollen challenge

1065
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,519
one of the interesting unanticipated

1066
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,599
pieces of information that we receive

1067
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,199
from the kentucky trial is some

1068
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:51,440
observations on relative disease

1069
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,719
resistance between diploid and triploid

1070
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,358
cultivars

1071
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:56,799
during the 2021 growing season uh

1072
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,480
university of kentucky observed that

1073
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,400
triploid versions of lifter appeared to

1074
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:02,400
be significantly more resistant to leaf

1075
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,240
spot diseases than their diploid

1076
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,838
counterparts as measured by the

1077
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:06,959
percentage of the leaf affected by the

1078
00:38:05,838 --> 00:38:08,639
disease

1079
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,240
this pattern of resistance was true for

1080
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,679
three of the most important foliar

1081
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,759
fungal pathogens observed in the

1082
00:38:11,679 --> 00:38:17,118
southern region of the united states

1083
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,440
circuspora bipolaris and septoria

1084
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:21,680
these three pathogens each of which

1085
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,039
cause leaf spots where spores land on

1086
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:25,039
the leaf surface and colonize the

1087
00:38:23,039 --> 00:38:27,199
surrounding tissue are some of the most

1088
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,960
economically important pathogens of the

1089
00:38:27,199 --> 00:38:30,399
southern part of the country

1090
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,920
their relative importance to each other

1091
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,920
is still being investigated but as you

1092
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:35,838
can see in the photograph they have the

1093
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:38,159
ability to cause major reductions in

1094
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:40,480
economic yield and likely exist in

1095
00:38:38,159 --> 00:38:42,239
disease complexes whereby several of the

1096
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,920
pathogens are present at the same time

1097
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:45,838
causing disease

1098
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,200
the same trend was not seen for white

1099
00:38:45,838 --> 00:38:48,799
cbg

1100
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:50,399
the diploid and triplet counterparts

1101
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,079
were approximately equal in terms of

1102
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,240
their susceptibility to these particular

1103
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,720
pathogens furthermore while we don't

1104
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,959
have diploid comparisons for our cbd-v

1105
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,959
cultivars those are all triploids

1106
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:03,440
they appear to be extremely resistant to

1107
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,639
all three fungal pathogens

1108
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,639
increases in employee have been

1109
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,719
implicated in increases in disease

1110
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,879
resistance in other cropping systems for

1111
00:39:08,719 --> 00:39:13,759
example in hops the most closely related

1112
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,280
plan of economic importance to cannabis

1113
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,119
research has shown that the effect of

1114
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,839
ploidy on disease resistance can be

1115
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,358
highly dependent and not only

1116
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:23,358
it's dependent not only on the crop

1117
00:39:21,358 --> 00:39:26,000
species but can vary even amongst

1118
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:27,679
varieties within the same species

1119
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,800
in this way it's not surprising to see

1120
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:33,440
this impact of ployity on lifter

1121
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,359
and not white cbg um kevin mckiernan's

1122
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,960
team uh in their pre-print a couple

1123
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:38,400
years ago

1124
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,880
noted a

1125
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:43,280
an interesting correlation between cbcas

1126
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,039
cassettes on chromosome 7 and disease

1127
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,040
resistance in cannabis plants there's

1128
00:39:45,039 --> 00:39:49,039
still a lot of inquiry into that line of

1129
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:51,519
reasoning but what i wanted to mention

1130
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:53,599
is fairly interesting and

1131
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,280
not entirely proven at this point but

1132
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:00,000
our cbdv dominant varieties have

1133
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,920
basically four copies of that cbcas

1134
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,760
cassette over and above what a normal

1135
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:05,599
type 3 plant would have so it's a fairly

1136
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,280
interesting correlation

1137
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,119
these initial data from kentucky helped

1138
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,040
give us important insight into disease

1139
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,880
resistance in cannabis and how we may

1140
00:40:11,039 --> 00:40:15,358
start to leverage this leverage this

1141
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,039
information for future breeding goals to

1142
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,598
make more robust varieties for farmers

1143
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:24,480
[Music]

1144
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,318
uh the farmer experience in 2021

1145
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
the quote at the very top sort of says

1146
00:40:26,318 --> 00:40:29,440
it all everything else we grew last year

1147
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:30,959
got seeded

1148
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,400
it was kind of the experience with folks

1149
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,400
that were growing triploids and diploids

1150
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,838
side by side that underwent pollen

1151
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,000
challenges with a few exceptions

1152
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:41,759
farmers relayed nearly universal acclaim

1153
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,920
on performance especially when subjected

1154
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:45,440
to unplanned pollen challenges they

1155
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,599
report qualitative improvement in

1156
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,760
overall aroma character and intensity

1157
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,240
faster maturation of flowers larger

1158
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,560
yields and probably most importantly

1159
00:40:52,239 --> 00:40:55,838
dense top grade flowers even on lower

1160
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,599
branches

1161
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,358
the main drawbacks reported are that

1162
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:01,599
triploids tend to perform worse than

1163
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:03,519
diploids in low light conditions so

1164
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:05,519
again another situation where the

1165
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:06,880
environment ends up impacting

1166
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:08,719
plants that have higher ploidies in a

1167
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,440
little bit more profound way

1168
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:13,439
there were also a small number of

1169
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:16,639
isolated cosmetically undesirable

1170
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,318
hermaphroditic flowers flower sports on

1171
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:20,078
these triploids compared to the diploid

1172
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:22,079
counterparts

1173
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:23,599
farmers outdoor experiences were very

1174
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,200
positive and relative triploid

1175
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,440
infertility seemed to prevent seed

1176
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,118
formation for most including several in

1177
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,720
colorado with intensive feral hemp

1178
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,800
populations that have been decimated the

1179
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:34,799
last couple years

1180
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,960
outdoor flowering response was slower to

1181
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,400
trigger by about two weeks largely

1182
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,159
driven by the underlying genome

1183
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,760
imbalance of our hybrids

1184
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:44,799
so two genomes are derived from the

1185
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,040
photoperiod photoperiod parent and one

1186
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,680
from the day neutral parent the opposite

1187
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,759
is true when the pairing is reversed so

1188
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:54,318
two day neutral genome copies in one

1189
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,319
photoperiod genome copy leads to earlier

1190
00:41:54,318 --> 00:41:58,159
flower formation with a late august

1191
00:41:56,318 --> 00:41:59,920
early september harvest time at 45

1192
00:41:58,159 --> 00:42:02,399
degrees north in the experimental

1193
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,119
varieties we tried last summer in

1194
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,440
general farmers loved triploids and many

1195
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:09,358
swear to never grow diploids again and

1196
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:11,039
honestly myself included in production

1197
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:13,358
environments

1198
00:42:11,039 --> 00:42:14,800
there were several outliers worth noting

1199
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,598
because as awesome as these higher

1200
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:20,160
ploidy plants are nothing is a cure-all

1201
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:22,400
we had reports from about 12 farmers uh

1202
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:24,159
out of hundreds last year who were

1203
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,358
seated at levels that were higher than

1204
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:26,879
sporadic

1205
00:42:25,358 --> 00:42:29,279
not as bad as diploids under full

1206
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,599
pollination but more effective than we'd

1207
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:33,839
previously previously seen including at

1208
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:35,680
the university field trials

1209
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:37,759
so emory garcia our client support

1210
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:39,199
expert and andrea garfinkel the director

1211
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
of r d for us

1212
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,679
visited most of these farms in person

1213
00:42:41,519 --> 00:42:45,838
collected samples and got as much detail

1214
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,440
as possible from the farmers

1215
00:42:45,838 --> 00:42:49,039
leaf samples from the affected plants

1216
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,400
were confirmed as triploids by flow

1217
00:42:49,039 --> 00:42:52,480
cytometry

1218
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,559
some seeds were capable of germination

1219
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,639
this is pretty interesting and tested

1220
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:59,039
between diploid and

1221
00:42:56,639 --> 00:43:01,039
triploid making them alloploids with

1222
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,759
more than two sets of homologous

1223
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,759
chromosomes but less than three

1224
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,839
the pollen pressure impacting the farms

1225
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:10,079
were equally mixed between very large

1226
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:11,920
feral populations in the midwest and the

1227
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,599
surrounding areas

1228
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:15,838
intense localized pressure from

1229
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,480
neighboring farms and what we termed

1230
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:20,400
paranormal triploid self-pollination

1231
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:22,159
where no other discernible explanation

1232
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,599
could be identified

1233
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:25,519
continued field trials and data

1234
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,119
collection are necessary to better

1235
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:28,800
understand these anomalies but i think

1236
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:30,640
it's safe to say that they're definitely

1237
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,240
outliers from the overwhelmingly

1238
00:43:30,639 --> 00:43:33,519
positive results most farmers

1239
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,439
experienced

1240
00:43:33,519 --> 00:43:36,480
but definitely not the only anomalies

1241
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,440
we've seen

1242
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,920
this plant just never ceases to amaze a

1243
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:44,480
small case in point

1244
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,480
in the summer of 2020 my my brother eric

1245
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:49,199
picked out four absolutely outstanding

1246
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
plants in a highly inbred diploid

1247
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:52,799
uh in a

1248
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,440
highly inbred diploid population of day

1249
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,880
neutral type 4 plants grown from seed in

1250
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,800
our breeding program during a seed

1251
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:00,400
multiplication run this is a parallel

1252
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,318
breeding line to the pollen donor that

1253
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,760
we use to create white cbg and stem cell

1254
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:05,199
cbg

1255
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,440
this is going to be the final selection

1256
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,358
out of about 3 000 plants these were

1257
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:11,358
literally the best and you know what's

1258
00:44:09,358 --> 00:44:13,519
going to happen here right the plants

1259
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:15,920
had larger leaves and flowers more resin

1260
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:17,119
content and far stronger aroma than any

1261
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,119
of the others

1262
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:21,039
ploidy screening revealed that all four

1263
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,000
were tetraploid while the remaining

1264
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:26,159
population were diploid as expected

1265
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,960
seeds produced on these tetraploids were

1266
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:30,559
screened and they came back as triploid

1267
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:32,800
why were there tetraploids in this

1268
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,960
population of diploids

1269
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,720
fast forward to last spring we submitted

1270
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,720
our first commercial triploid seed for

1271
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:41,118
germination purity employee screening to

1272
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,279
the oregon state university seed lab and

1273
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:45,680
received these results

1274
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:48,079
relative rates of triploidy in seed

1275
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:50,399
produced from tetraploid seed carriers

1276
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,318
and diploid pollen parents

1277
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:53,440
appears linked to the pollen donor

1278
00:44:52,318 --> 00:44:55,838
lineage

1279
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,159
in this example super haze and lifter

1280
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:00,799
both of which share the same erb day

1281
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:01,920
neutral pollen donor tested at 100

1282
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:04,960
triploid

1283
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,200
the sour versions of both which utilizes

1284
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,280
the same tetraploid production mothers

1285
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:12,159
but switches pollen donors to a unique

1286
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:15,680
terpenoline dominant day neutral variety

1287
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:17,519
resulted in 97 and 93 triploidy rates

1288
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:20,559
respectively while the remaining three

1289
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:22,000
to seven percent tested as tetraploids

1290
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:24,559
so i guess we were also the first to

1291
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:27,119
release tetraploids

1292
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:29,440
didn't really mean to do that though

1293
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,519
the same is true in stem cells cbg and

1294
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,119
white cbg varieties where one to five

1295
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,400
percent respectively tested as

1296
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,920
tetraploids

1297
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:37,519
so armed with this confusing new

1298
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:39,119
knowledge we implemented a new step in

1299
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:41,358
our commercial seed production program

1300
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,000
this year where every pollen donor was

1301
00:45:41,358 --> 00:45:45,920
ploidy screen to confirm diploid status

1302
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,280
while no tetraploids were found in any

1303
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,119
populations

1304
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:52,480
triploids were present in both donor

1305
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:54,400
lines at rates less than 0.5 percent

1306
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,880
even with the offenders removed from our

1307
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:59,119
process the resulting seed continues to

1308
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,358
throw low rates of tetraploids in

1309
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,599
certain genotype combinations

1310
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:05,440
it's just fascinating to me

1311
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,720
this is made even more confusing when

1312
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:08,400
the breeding history of the pollen

1313
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:10,000
donors interrogated these are lines

1314
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,559
produced via multiple generations of

1315
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,679
self-pollination of single plants in

1316
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:18,078
isolation tents with hepa filters

1317
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,799
that only i have access to like i made

1318
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:22,720
all these seeds um i know with 100

1319
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:25,519
certainty and we confirmed it via flow

1320
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,118
cytometry that the parent was a diploid

1321
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:29,759
we've done whole genome sequencing on

1322
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,920
both the parent and resulting offspring

1323
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:33,680
we know that these plants are from the

1324
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:35,039
same source

1325
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:36,799
there's

1326
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:39,279
there's no good explanation what we've

1327
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,680
received from oregon state university

1328
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,920
is we've been told that it's

1329
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,318
i consider it a speculative alternative

1330
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,880
related to a non-disjunction during

1331
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:50,159
meiosis like okay

1332
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,240
i know that has something to do with

1333
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:53,838
pollen and cell division there's got to

1334
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:55,279
be a fascinating dissertation for

1335
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:56,480
someone in there to figure out what's

1336
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,400
really going on

1337
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,760
but what i'm absolutely awestruck by is

1338
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,240
that nature does find a way in this case

1339
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,640
the first triploid cannabis was actually

1340
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:09,279
released by cannabis itself probably

1341
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:12,400
millions of times over and long before

1342
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:14,800
humans existed in modern form so

1343
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:17,280
it's a good one for cannabis

1344
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,200
in summary on triploids um we're seeing

1345
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:21,519
dramatically reduced fertility although

1346
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:22,879
not 100 seedless

1347
00:47:21,519 --> 00:47:25,358
uh

1348
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:27,358
it's just that's that's the reality it's

1349
00:47:25,358 --> 00:47:30,000
very close but not quite

1350
00:47:27,358 --> 00:47:32,400
relatively unchanged cannabinoid content

1351
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,559
uh between diploids and triploids and

1352
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,838
even tetracloids although there is some

1353
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,280
evidence that suggests that there's a

1354
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,279
slight increase and i think we need to

1355
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:41,040
do more replications of that to get to

1356
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,200
the bottom of it

1357
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:44,558
in our experience yields are higher but

1358
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,799
come with that slightly delayed

1359
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,559
flowering response the most dramatic

1360
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:50,318
example of yield can be found in our day

1361
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:53,519
neutral varieties

1362
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:56,159
our best 2018 day neutral diploid uh

1363
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:58,239
yielded about 250 grams of flour which

1364
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,480
is really good for uh for a day neutral

1365
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:02,799
this is an autoflowering variety very

1366
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,838
good but the improved triploid version

1367
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,240
this past summer produced over 658 grams

1368
00:48:05,838 --> 00:48:10,318
of usable flour and my brother did not

1369
00:48:08,239 --> 00:48:12,159
change sizes between those two pictures

1370
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:15,199
lost a little bit of hair with two two

1371
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:17,519
newborns but same size guy for uh

1372
00:48:15,199 --> 00:48:17,519
scale

1373
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:23,358
olfactory compounds

1374
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:25,280
seem to be qualitatively heightened and

1375
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:26,159
i say qualitatively this is a sticky

1376
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,440
issue

1377
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:32,399
likely due to combinatorial effects of

1378
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,838
unique aroma pathways being multiplied

1379
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,838
we don't have enough time today to get

1380
00:48:33,838 --> 00:48:37,199
into the details and it's not my story

1381
00:48:35,838 --> 00:48:40,078
to fully tell but if you want

1382
00:48:37,199 --> 00:48:42,719
breadcrumbs do search for unfunded usda

1383
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,640
grants on hemp aroma compounds

1384
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:46,399
but the general point is that terpenes

1385
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:48,400
contribute about 50

1386
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:50,880
of the total

1387
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,800
of the total aroma in cannabis

1388
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,480
most analytical reports on them are not

1389
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,800
very helpful because there's only eight

1390
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,240
to ten terpenes depending on the variety

1391
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,000
of cannabis but about eight to ten

1392
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:02,000
terpenes that are even above the

1393
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,079
detectable odor threshold so when you're

1394
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:07,039
looking at a terpene test result that

1395
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,800
has you know point zero five percent

1396
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:10,639
depending on the compound you may not be

1397
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,640
smelling that and so a lot of the

1398
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,558
analytical data that we see commercially

1399
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,239
available for folks isn't actually

1400
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:18,480
capturing what's responsible for those

1401
00:49:16,239 --> 00:49:20,318
underlying aromas

1402
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,800
the rest of the aroma is comprised of

1403
00:49:20,318 --> 00:49:24,239
things like esters sulfur-containing

1404
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:27,039
compounds that were described earlier

1405
00:49:24,239 --> 00:49:28,558
today aldehydes and others that can

1406
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:30,960
dramatically impact the sensory

1407
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,640
experience even when present in trace

1408
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,599
amounts we're talking like parts per

1409
00:49:32,639 --> 00:49:36,159
billion

1410
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,960
the hypothesis here is because unique

1411
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:41,118
precursor pathways are responsible for

1412
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,639
many of these compounds their presence

1413
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,119
and diversity could be driving the

1414
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,960
overall loudness of aroma which would

1415
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:49,680
then be magnified by increased copy

1416
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:51,199
numbers in polyploids there's obviously

1417
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:53,039
much more work to be done in this area

1418
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:54,159
but the early findings lend support to

1419
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:55,679
this view

1420
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:57,440
there's obviously some big mysteries to

1421
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:59,199
be figured out regarding pollen ploidy

1422
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,119
and identification of cannabis most

1423
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:03,519
efficient employee level for various

1424
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:05,920
production purposes but our work to date

1425
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:08,079
strongly suggests that lower pleiades so

1426
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,800
haploids and diploids are best for

1427
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,119
breeding work while higher pleiades

1428
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:14,960
triploids and tetraploids so far with

1429
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,880
pentaploids and octopoids to be tested

1430
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,838
next seem to be better suited for

1431
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,838
commercial production

1432
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:28,000
[Music]

1433
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,000
i'd like to wind down today's talk with

1434
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,440
some yet to be completed research that's

1435
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,800
near and dear to my heart and what i

1436
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,519
personally believe will be one of the

1437
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,039
lasting legacies we can leave

1438
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:39,039
to future generations of cannabis

1439
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,880
breeders

1440
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:42,480
new advances in sequencing technology

1441
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,480
and bioinformatics pipelines are

1442
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,719
allowing for the deepest most accurate

1443
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,559
exploration of organisms that we've ever

1444
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:50,719
seen to the point where the data is

1445
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,480
actually pretty useful and reasonably

1446
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,759
priced relative to the return on your

1447
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:55,519
investment

1448
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,000
in our lab these advancements allowed us

1449
00:50:55,519 --> 00:50:59,759
to shrink our computing needs from a 384

1450
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,679
core computing cluster the size of a

1451
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:04,000
negative adc freezer

1452
00:51:01,679 --> 00:51:06,558
pictured here down to a well

1453
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:09,119
well-equipped laptop the wall time for

1454
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:10,800
assembly has gone from over a week to

1455
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,559
just under five hours

1456
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,559
the quality of the assembled genome is

1457
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:16,480
improved from synthetic haploids to

1458
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:19,359
partially phased diploids using a pack

1459
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:21,519
bio sql ii and the freely available hifi

1460
00:51:19,358 --> 00:51:23,119
asm assembler

1461
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:24,960
the order of magnitude increase and

1462
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,559
efficiency and highly accurate reads are

1463
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,318
moving us from an era of a single

1464
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:30,720
reference genome serving as a

1465
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:32,159
representative of an entire species to

1466
00:51:30,719 --> 00:51:33,919
one where the full diversity of a

1467
00:51:32,159 --> 00:51:36,318
species can be represented through

1468
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,920
hundreds or even thousands of reference

1469
00:51:36,318 --> 00:51:40,400
quality assemblies

1470
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,480
this is the new era of pan genomes

1471
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:44,880
important agricultural crops like corn

1472
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:48,000
soy cotton and apples are some of the

1473
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:50,480
first plants to undergo this process

1474
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:52,159
fortuitous historical circumstances have

1475
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:54,159
made it possible for cannabis to be

1476
00:51:52,159 --> 00:51:56,480
brought into the club as well

1477
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,399
greg concepcion of pak bio recorded a

1478
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,639
talk after the cancellation of pag this

1479
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:03,280
year where he outlines the basic steps

1480
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:05,838
of pan genome construction and

1481
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,400
pan genome tool application in plants

1482
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:10,318
using cannabis is the example as the

1483
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:12,240
example species and our genome

1484
00:52:10,318 --> 00:52:13,838
collection is the initial library if you

1485
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,679
haven't seen it yet please check it out

1486
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,920
greg's been contributing to the cannabis

1487
00:52:15,679 --> 00:52:19,358
genome research efforts for years now

1488
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:21,200
and we're all really lucky to have his

1489
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:24,239
expertise directed at our collective

1490
00:52:21,199 --> 00:52:24,239
genomics problems

1491
00:52:24,318 --> 00:52:28,318
we've generated very high quality hi-fi

1492
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:30,558
whole genome assemblies for over 100

1493
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,920
diverse cannabis plants in our sql 2

1494
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,599
derived from our internal breeding

1495
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,280
efforts and some key publicly available

1496
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:37,119
clones to build the library for initial

1497
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,040
pan genome construction

1498
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,440
these include representatives of all

1499
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:43,759
chemotypes one through five plants with

1500
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,280
pencil and propyl cannabinoids and what

1501
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,760
we believe to be the pantheon of

1502
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,760
potential photoperiod responses unique

1503
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:52,400
phenotypical expressions like australian

1504
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,720
bastard cannabis and fasciated specimens

1505
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,280
and many diverse aroma palettes

1506
00:52:54,719 --> 00:52:59,039
busco assessments of completeness

1507
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,480
demonstrate that these assemblies offer

1508
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:03,519
significant improvements over the

1509
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,519
previous reference

1510
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:07,680
the irony of pangenomic promises to move

1511
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:09,599
away from a single reference standard is

1512
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:11,519
that doing so requires at least one good

1513
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,838
reference for bioinformatics packages to

1514
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:15,679
map new reads to so while we've all been

1515
00:53:13,838 --> 00:53:17,440
talking about cannabis pan genomes for

1516
00:53:15,679 --> 00:53:19,358
the last three years progress has been

1517
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,440
agonizingly slow

1518
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:22,960
the current reference cs10 is

1519
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,200
substantially more complete than

1520
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:26,960
previous publicly available assemblies

1521
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,318
and incredibly useful for many types of

1522
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,000
inquiries but appears to lack

1523
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:31,920
concordance with more recent higher

1524
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,239
quality sequencing work

1525
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,920
kovalchuk's 2020 review of assemblies is

1526
00:53:34,239 --> 00:53:37,919
a great starting point for understanding

1527
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:40,079
the legitimate debate about the nature

1528
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:42,720
of these issues but the implications of

1529
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:44,960
subpar genome representation is critical

1530
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:46,879
for plant breeders a great example of

1531
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,400
this can be illustrated by an alignment

1532
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:53,838
of chromosome 7 from cs10 both of which

1533
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:56,720
are type 3 plants with one of our type 3

1534
00:53:53,838 --> 00:53:58,318
sorry cs10 is a type 3 so is the plant

1535
00:53:56,719 --> 00:53:59,598
that we are comparing to from one of our

1536
00:53:58,318 --> 00:54:01,599
assemblies

1537
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:06,160
chromosome 7 is the physical location of

1538
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:08,960
thcas cbdas cbcas phytochrome e several

1539
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:11,598
dye terpene synthases a propyl precursor

1540
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,119
gene and a marker for overall potency

1541
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,119
the different colored rectangles

1542
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,800
represent localized collinear blocks

1543
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,400
which are conserved genomic regions

1544
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,160
between the two

1545
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,838
this particular alignment suggests that

1546
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:24,239
the contents of each chromosome are

1547
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:26,480
similar but also structurally divergent

1548
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:28,558
which if real and not an artifact of the

1549
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:30,559
sequencing and assembly process

1550
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:32,640
would indicate widespread and recurrent

1551
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:34,319
rearrangements throughout

1552
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,000
we suspect that this is attributable to

1553
00:54:34,318 --> 00:54:38,558
the lower quality sequencing approach

1554
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,358
used on cs10 which was

1555
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,280
an older oxford nanopore chemistry as

1556
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:45,679
well as assembly artifacts that arise

1557
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,000
when collapsing two real haplotypes into

1558
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,159
a single synthetic haploid so in other

1559
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,039
words the two underlying haploid genomes

1560
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:57,358
of a diploid plant that are real get

1561
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:57,358
combined via software into one

1562
00:54:57,519 --> 00:55:00,318
not real

1563
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,719
software representation of what the

1564
00:55:00,318 --> 00:55:05,279
plant actually is

1565
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:08,000
this this ability to do diploid plants

1566
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:10,160
is a brand new opportunity there's very

1567
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
few other genomes in terms of reference

1568
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:15,759
genomes that have been fully phased and

1569
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,760
released as both haplotypes

1570
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,279
so we used

1571
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:22,639
yeah there we go we used several

1572
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,720
sequencing approaches to build a new pan

1573
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:26,960
genome anchor reference and brought in

1574
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,358
collaborators from pac bio bio nano

1575
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,880
dovetail nc state cornell and oregon

1576
00:55:29,358 --> 00:55:32,960
state university

1577
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:35,119
the plant serving as reference is the

1578
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:36,880
same f1 hybrid we self-pollinated to

1579
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:39,280
generate our segregating f2 breeding

1580
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:42,358
population yielding autoflower and varan

1581
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:45,200
markers and has a genome size of

1582
00:55:42,358 --> 00:55:47,358
1.4456 gigabases as estimated by

1583
00:55:45,199 --> 00:55:50,879
shenzhen at nc state

1584
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:53,279
the two parents won a type 1 hypropyl 16

1585
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:56,480
week flowering nightmare of a plant and

1586
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,559
the other a day neutral type 3 plant

1587
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,760
that flowers in about six weeks were

1588
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:04,000
sequenced using pacbio's clr technology

1589
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:06,240
the f1 itself was sequenced twice using

1590
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:09,358
pacbio's hifi process generating two

1591
00:56:06,239 --> 00:56:10,959
full smart cells of data hifi asm using

1592
00:56:09,358 --> 00:56:14,318
both clr

1593
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,240
parental data sets as input guides

1594
00:56:14,318 --> 00:56:18,239
excuse me hifi sm was then used at the

1595
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:20,639
trio bin function using those two

1596
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,719
parental assemblies as input guides

1597
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,318
high c data on the f1 was generated by

1598
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,318
dovetail genomics and was used to

1599
00:56:24,318 --> 00:56:28,558
scaffold contigs into pseudochromosomes

1600
00:56:26,318 --> 00:56:30,239
for both haplotypes and the resulting

1601
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:33,200
draft assemblies are now being verified

1602
00:56:30,239 --> 00:56:35,039
against optical maps uh created by bio

1603
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:36,879
nano and these are amazing they're

1604
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:38,558
really cool they don't give you any

1605
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,079
indication of nucleotide identity but

1606
00:56:38,559 --> 00:56:42,559
they'll tell you basically the full

1607
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:44,079
length and size of chromosomes

1608
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:45,599
but we're also using linkage maps

1609
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:48,400
constructed by dustin wilkerson at

1610
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:51,280
cornell generated from nrgine aluminum

1611
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:54,798
shotgun reads of 289 of the f2 s1

1612
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:56,559
individuals from our reference example

1613
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:58,960
dovetail is currently annotating both

1614
00:56:56,559 --> 00:57:01,280
haplotypes using multiple tissue rna-seq

1615
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:01,280
runs

1616
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,279
so the project's nearing the finish line

1617
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:08,480
and we're really excited to release this

1618
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:10,000
first phased diploid cannabis genome for

1619
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,440
everyone to use

1620
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,119
but the initial results have already

1621
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:15,200
proven useful for us and allowed the

1622
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:17,280
deployment of some promising pan genome

1623
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:19,279
tools most importantly the results are

1624
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,040
suggesting most cannabis chromosomes are

1625
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,440
fairly stable relative to what many of

1626
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:25,519
us previously believed here's the same

1627
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,639
comparison of chromosome 7 from the two

1628
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,559
haplotypes

1629
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:30,719
of our draft reference assembly just to

1630
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:32,240
highlight the improvement experienced

1631
00:57:30,719 --> 00:57:34,078
where the previous chromosome 7

1632
00:57:32,239 --> 00:57:35,598
alignment produced acid reflux the

1633
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:37,839
alignment between haplotypes and our

1634
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:40,400
assembly is more like a sigh of relief

1635
00:57:37,838 --> 00:57:42,480
and i that's my interpretation here

1636
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,160
despite the fact that one is thca

1637
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,159
containing and the other is cbda

1638
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,000
containing more technical details on

1639
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:50,239
this entire project will be released by

1640
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,318
a much more competent scientists who are

1641
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:54,479
working with us uh we're looking we're

1642
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:57,519
shooting for a fall 2022 to an early

1643
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:59,119
winter 2023 release of all this data and

1644
00:57:57,519 --> 00:58:00,079
the creation of the first publicly

1645
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,280
available

1646
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,599
cannabis pan genome

[Music]

1648
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:06,640
now i'm almost done

1649
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,480
says i have two minutes we'll see here

1650
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:11,519
speaking of fall 2022 one last

1651
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,440
announcement

1652
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:15,199
uh we're using this information gleaned

1653
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:17,599
from these all to all comparisons to

1654
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:18,960
help us design varieties to maximize

1655
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:20,798
heterosis

1656
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,318
mash is one of these pan genomic tools

1657
00:58:20,798 --> 00:58:24,079
that estimates genomic distance and

1658
00:58:22,318 --> 00:58:25,920
mutation rates within our plant library

1659
00:58:24,079 --> 00:58:28,079
giving us unparalleled insight into the

1660
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,838
relatedness of particular plants

1661
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:31,280
results from early analysis suggested

1662
00:58:29,838 --> 00:58:34,239
that the inbred photoperiod line

1663
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:35,839
developed for a white cbg hybrid seed

1664
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:37,279
is the most genetically distant from

1665
00:58:35,838 --> 00:58:39,358
others in our library so to take

1666
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,440
advantage of that we paired it with two

1667
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,598
cbd dominant day neutral pollen donor

1668
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,079
lines to create two new hybrid type

1669
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:48,640
three lines uh we field trial these in

1670
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:50,798
2021 and we're really really impressed

1671
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:53,279
with the results they were standouts in

1672
00:58:50,798 --> 00:58:54,960
the field for yield and flower structure

1673
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,480
these positive results along with our

1674
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:58,720
internal analysis of the underlying

1675
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:00,000
whole genome data are aiding or breeding

1676
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,639
decisions as we move forward with

1677
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,719
commercial type 1 and type 2 varieties

1678
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:06,879
our first release of type 1 and type 2

1679
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:09,598
f1 triploid seed will take place this

1680
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:12,318
fall with a specific eye towards the thc

1681
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:14,559
flower market and a pairing of classic

1682
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:16,798
classic flavor architectures with

1683
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:18,720
exciting twists informed by our internal

1684
00:59:16,798 --> 00:59:20,318
flavor development program

1685
00:59:18,719 --> 00:59:22,078
initial tetraploid production mothers

1686
00:59:20,318 --> 00:59:23,440
for these projects include a number of

1687
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:25,680
really interesting

1688
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,318
inbred lineages derived from chem d

1689
00:59:25,679 --> 00:59:30,719
triangle cush durbin poison california

1690
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:32,639
orange trainwreck urkel

1691
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:33,519
and some of our own internal lines as

1692
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:35,519
well

1693
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:38,079
so we're really excited to pair these

1694
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,759
tetraploid production mothers with some

1695
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:41,680
special new

1696
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:43,760
day neutral varieties to create

1697
00:59:41,679 --> 00:59:44,960
basically the same type of award-winning

1698
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:47,920
hybrids that we've done in the hemp

1699
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,838
market but bring them to the thc side

1700
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:51,119
so while these advancements offer a lot

1701
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:53,119
of hope for the future of cannabis

1702
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:55,119
production we're really stoked to make

1703
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:57,119
it possible they're happening in real

1704
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,358
time and subjected to the whims of an

1705
00:59:57,119 --> 01:00:00,960
unpredictable market which fundamentally

1706
00:59:59,358 --> 01:00:02,880
challenges every producer's right to

1707
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,400
exist on a daily basis

1708
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,880
we hope that these plants will give

1709
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:08,960
farmers a fighting chance to realize

1710
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:10,318
their own dreams as well

1711
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:12,480
with that

1712
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:13,750
we'll end for today and take questions

1713
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:21,519
thank you

1714
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:24,559
[Applause]

1715
01:00:21,519 --> 01:00:26,159
hi thank you you did mention at the last

1716
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:29,119
part of your uh

1717
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:29,920
closing here about the thc market

1718
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:34,000
and

1719
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:34,000
does this mean that the triploid

1720
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:39,679
um the triploid intention is not really

1721
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,358
available in the thc market

1722
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:45,118
uh it's currently not available in

1723
01:00:41,358 --> 01:00:48,400
triploid form that's correct yeah

1724
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:48,400
about about three months

1725
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:53,838
meaning no one else is doing it either

1726
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:55,839
you're as far as you know

1727
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:57,519
meaning no one else is doing it either

1728
01:00:55,838 --> 01:00:59,679
as far as you know that's correct

1729
01:00:57,519 --> 01:01:01,039
there's one other company that's working

1730
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,879
on it right now i'm sure there's other

1731
01:01:01,039 --> 01:01:04,719
companies working on it it is the future

1732
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,599
but in terms of being available in the

1733
01:01:04,719 --> 01:01:09,279
market there are none right now yeah

1734
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:10,880
yeah

1735
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:12,480
thank you so much for the presentation

1736
01:01:10,880 --> 01:01:15,920
very very nice talk

1737
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:16,960
so uh my question is uh i want to ask

1738
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:20,639
about the

1739
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:21,838
environmental suitability of the tripod

1740
01:01:20,639 --> 01:01:23,598
so

1741
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,119
since the string that you're starting

1742
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:26,960
with

1743
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:29,119
in fact no string that we are growing

1744
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:31,679
right now in the u.s

1745
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,920
none of them are selected for

1746
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:37,679
the growing environment the u.s i was

1747
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:41,200
just wondering have you looked into the

1748
01:01:37,679 --> 01:01:43,838
growth the environmental parameter that

1749
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:45,838
would be suitable i mean that that that

1750
01:01:43,838 --> 01:01:48,400
would fit the grow environment the u.s

1751
01:01:45,838 --> 01:01:49,759
what's the range that you can possibly

1752
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:52,798
grow this

1753
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:55,200
tripoi plant in the us and if not

1754
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,199
is there any interest for research to

1755
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:58,399
look into those parameters let's figure

1756
01:01:57,199 --> 01:02:01,679
out where

1757
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:04,079
we can grow this in united states

1758
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:07,838
i want to apologize the audio is

1759
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:09,359
terrible up here i can't uh i i guess i

1760
01:02:07,838 --> 01:02:12,480
just want to ask

1761
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:15,038
about the uh environmental suitability

1762
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:17,440
of the tripoi uh a very very nice talk

1763
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:20,000
by the way i i was wondering have you

1764
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:22,559
figured out where we can grow this in

1765
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,318
the u.s like in terms of the temperature

1766
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,480
ring photo period you know like those

1767
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:27,759
gotcha yeah no that's perfect thank you

1768
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:29,599
you can grow them anywhere in the united

1769
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,200
states the photo period response is

1770
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:34,160
similar regardless of whether you're in

1771
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,519
vermont or florida so these are they're

1772
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:38,078
hybrids that have been designed in a

1773
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:39,599
very particular way to allow farmers to

1774
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:41,200
grow them and get them basically

1775
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:43,039
harvested and out of fields by early

1776
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:44,399
october

1777
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,480
what you're specifically talking about

1778
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:48,960
and i saw the previous presentation it

1779
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:50,960
was awesome you can basically grow

1780
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,240
industrial hemp which is cannabis it's

1781
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,318
the same thing there's just a single

1782
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:56,078
gene difference between in most cases a

1783
01:02:54,318 --> 01:02:58,400
single gene difference you can grow them

1784
01:02:56,079 --> 01:03:01,960
anywhere with a hemp license so anywhere

1785
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:01,960
in the united states

1786
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:06,798
um that was awesome so

1787
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:09,038
i appreciate the whole thing so i'm

1788
01:03:06,798 --> 01:03:10,400
actually an environmental biologist um

1789
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,559
and everything you just said and the

1790
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:14,798
exact question that he just asked is

1791
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:16,240
exactly where i'm going with this so i'm

1792
01:03:14,798 --> 01:03:17,920
actually part of the midwest hemp

1793
01:03:16,239 --> 01:03:18,959
database program

1794
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,760
we use

1795
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,599
uh

1796
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,680
surfer haze and

1797
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:25,599
white cbg i think it is as part of our

1798
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:27,440
cultivar check program

1799
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:29,200
we send those seeds across the midwest

1800
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:31,280
and grow them in different environments

1801
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,679
to this point have you all looked at any

1802
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:35,519
epigenetic data

1803
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:37,838
as to why some of these changes because

1804
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:39,599
again they are still all compliant right

1805
01:03:37,838 --> 01:03:41,440
but they're showing different levels

1806
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:43,119
have you all looked at it into any

1807
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:44,480
different epigenetic stuff in those

1808
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:47,838
different environments

1809
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:49,760
so it's a really good question um

1810
01:03:47,838 --> 01:03:50,480
no

1811
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,160
no

1812
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,760
we'll talk afterwards then well what's

1813
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:55,920
really cool it's worth mentioning pac

1814
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:57,599
bio just released a brand new tool that

1815
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,280
goes along with their sequencing that

1816
01:03:57,599 --> 01:04:00,960
allows for the detection of methylation

1817
01:03:59,280 --> 01:04:03,519
in whole genome reads

1818
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:04,798
which is opening up a whole like this is

1819
01:04:03,519 --> 01:04:06,079
this is like

1820
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,318
everything they've been doing has been

1821
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:10,318
revolutionary this is the next phase in

1822
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,159
revolutionary sequencing it's going to

1823
01:04:10,318 --> 01:04:14,000
be pretty incredible but to directly

1824
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,318
answer the questions in terms of

1825
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:18,400
different varieties the problem that we

1826
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:20,960
ran into is that different varieties in

1827
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:23,358
different locations ended up producing

1828
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,280
some seeds in certain circumstances so

1829
01:04:23,358 --> 01:04:27,119
it wasn't there were genotype specific

1830
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:28,640
differences but what we ended up seeing

1831
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,720
is that the genotype differences

1832
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:33,199
sometimes would change depending on

1833
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:35,118
which area that it was in there weren't

1834
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,598
enough samples to be able to really pull

1835
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:39,200
that apart so we do need more data

1836
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,119
and we didn't see the same outcome in

1837
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,838
the university field trials or our own

1838
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:45,599
internal trials so it's basically one of

1839
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:47,119
those unfortunate situations where you

1840
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:49,039
just have to say

1841
01:04:47,119 --> 01:04:51,280
we need more data to make a good claim

1842
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,520
but at this point there is something

1843
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:57,599
interesting going on and we just don't

1844
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,599
know awesome thanks thank you

1845
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:04,078
hi sharon's my name um curious question

1846
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:06,960
the culture scene that you're using

1847
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:08,720
at the initial stage is that the same

1848
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:12,400
anti-inflammatory

1849
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:13,519
drug yeah it's great for gout right

1850
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:15,079
and

1851
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:19,280
so are you using it as the

1852
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:20,079
anti-inflammatory to suppress or

1853
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:23,680
uh

1854
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:25,200
in specific doses it stops microtubule i

1855
01:05:23,679 --> 01:05:26,480
can't i i was going to i was going to

1856
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,000
pretend that i know what i'm talking

1857
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:30,318
about uh

1858
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:32,480
well don't think basically it stops it

1859
01:05:30,318 --> 01:05:34,159
stops chromosomes from dividing stops

1860
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,838
cells from dividing and so instead of

1861
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:38,239
getting that division phase you

1862
01:05:35,838 --> 01:05:40,639
basically just get a replication phase

1863
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:41,759
and you end up with four sets instead of

1864
01:05:40,639 --> 01:05:44,000
two

1865
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:44,960
so rather than an anti-inflammatory it's

1866
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,599
actually

1867
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,760
at a at a cellular level stopping things

1868
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,519
from dividing

1869
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:54,079
the reason i asked that question is

1870
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:56,318
colchicine just recently

1871
01:05:54,079 --> 01:05:58,559
well it's it's being used in

1872
01:05:56,318 --> 01:06:01,440
cardiovascular disease

1873
01:05:58,559 --> 01:06:03,599
which is an off-market claim

1874
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,079
and that's on the endothelial or the

1875
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:07,680
vascular system to stop that plaque

1876
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:09,440
replication so

1877
01:06:07,679 --> 01:06:11,440
it was an interesting thank you

1878
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,599
yeah it's funny how certain things that

1879
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:16,079
are developed for one application can

1880
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:17,519
end up having a million different uses

1881
01:06:16,079 --> 01:06:19,839
and in the plant plant-breeding world

1882
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:20,880
it's widely used for stopping cell

1883
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,119
division

1884
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,119
yeah

1885
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:28,078
please

1886
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,079
thank you for sharing such amazing

1887
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:31,680
information with the public it's really

1888
01:06:30,079 --> 01:06:32,640
it's an honorable thing that you're

1889
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:34,879
doing

1890
01:06:32,639 --> 01:06:37,838
um my question was about germination

1891
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:39,838
rates and maybe i missed uh did you have

1892
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,880
any issues with germination rates or

1893
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:45,920
failure to thrive with some of the uh

1894
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,079
triploids yes that is a great question

1895
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:51,119
so what we've noticed is even in

1896
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:52,720
diploids we have varying rates of

1897
01:06:51,119 --> 01:06:54,318
basically

1898
01:06:52,719 --> 01:06:56,159
conditioning that has to happen for

1899
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:58,480
certain varieties of seeds some are

1900
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,318
immediately ready you can germinate them

1901
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,719
the week after they're harvested and

1902
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:04,880
you'll get 100 germination others you

1903
01:07:02,719 --> 01:07:06,719
have to wait up to six months they have

1904
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,400
to go through a conditioning process

1905
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:10,719
stratification process

1906
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:14,160
triploids are more impacted by that

1907
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,078
tetraploids even more impacted by that

1908
01:07:14,159 --> 01:07:18,639
we're seeing it in regeneration as well

1909
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,720
taking cuttings

1910
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:22,480
are much faster to basically

1911
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:24,959
clone tetraploids are a little bit

1912
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,559
slower and as we go up the ploidy chain

1913
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,280
the higher you go the more difficult

1914
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:32,960
they are to work with so most definitely

1915
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,680
a ploidy relationship between dormancy

1916
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,679
and

1917
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:38,798
seed for sure awesome thank you

1918
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:38,798
fascinating thank you yeah

1919
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:44,399
hi um really appreciate the talk um my

1920
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:47,358
question is building off the cultism uh

1921
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:50,240
as well um curious if you're seeing any

1922
01:07:47,358 --> 01:07:52,480
other um notable mutations following

1923
01:07:50,239 --> 01:07:54,399
that and maybe that might be involved in

1924
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:56,400
your environmental uh

1925
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:57,920
you know epigenetic expressions that

1926
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,440
you're seeing too yeah that's a

1927
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,280
fantastic question that was one of my

1928
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:02,798
biggest concerns i've just spent the

1929
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,480
last three and a half years developing

1930
01:08:02,798 --> 01:08:06,480
this plant line breeding it now you're

1931
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,480
going to put a mutagen on it and expect

1932
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,318
us to make seed with it get out of here

1933
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:12,639
right

1934
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:14,639
we have sequenced the

1935
01:08:12,639 --> 01:08:16,238
using the older clr technology we

1936
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:17,039
sequenced the first tetraploid that we

1937
01:08:16,238 --> 01:08:18,479
made

1938
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:20,560
didn't see any differences but i don't

1939
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,158
trust the older technology we're in the

1940
01:08:20,560 --> 01:08:23,679
process of

1941
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:25,198
getting sequencing data and doing the

1942
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,960
comparison right now through it's a

1943
01:08:25,198 --> 01:08:29,439
graduate student project at oregon state

1944
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,279
university taking a cannabinoid free

1945
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:33,039
plant that we basically gave the

1946
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,799
university to work with that went

1947
01:08:33,039 --> 01:08:37,039
through the same process

1948
01:08:34,798 --> 01:08:39,198
we have underlying sequence data from

1949
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:42,238
the diploid form and now we're going to

1950
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:44,318
be doing the sequencing and comparing it

1951
01:08:42,238 --> 01:08:47,599
so far we haven't seen we do see some

1952
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,199
strange things when it doesn't stick so

1953
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,640
like if you have a reversion on part of

1954
01:08:49,198 --> 01:08:52,399
the plant you'll end up seeing

1955
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:55,679
phenotypical differences but for the

1956
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:58,158
most part there really isn't uh

1957
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,158
widespread mutations that that people

1958
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:02,238
would sometimes think about like with

1959
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:04,479
gamma radiation or something like that

1960
01:09:02,238 --> 01:09:06,399
it seems to be true to type uh

1961
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:08,158
phenotypically anyway

1962
01:09:06,399 --> 01:09:10,158
just better like if you if you have a

1963
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:11,439
diploid plant that's great best way to

1964
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,719
make it better is to turn it into a

1965
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,838
tetraploid

1966
01:09:12,719 --> 01:09:19,119
perfect thank you yeah

1967
01:09:15,838 --> 01:09:20,158
hi um over here fantastic talk thanks so

1968
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:22,719
much

1969
01:09:20,158 --> 01:09:25,439
my question is about the the thc seeds

1970
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:27,359
that you uh referred to at the end

1971
01:09:25,439 --> 01:09:29,119
do you have a distribution model set up

1972
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:32,400
that we could get seeds in california

1973
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,920
for example or yeah go to a gtrseeds.com

1974
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:37,358
enter your credit card information and

1975
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:39,920
we'd happily take your money

1976
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:41,759
fantastic but um

1977
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:43,279
seriously from a regulatory compliance

1978
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,479
standpoint if we're bringing in seeds

1979
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,159
into california that's coming from

1980
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,519
another state how are we going to get

1981
01:09:46,158 --> 01:09:49,198
that into our

1982
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,560
metric systems and compliance is all

1983
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:52,399
that going to be taken care of through

1984
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:53,759
interstate it's this is part of the

1985
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,198
problem is that it's state to state

1986
01:09:53,759 --> 01:09:57,119
right it's dependent

1987
01:09:55,198 --> 01:10:00,238
on each individual state the only thing

1988
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:02,000
that we're covering our backsides on is

1989
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:03,599
our legality to make sure that we can

1990
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,198
send them out they're sent out as

1991
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,280
industrial hemp seeds which are

1992
01:10:05,198 --> 01:10:08,960
completely 100 legal in the united

1993
01:10:07,279 --> 01:10:10,880
states it's up to the individual

1994
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:12,640
cultivators or home growers who buy them

1995
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,960
to check with their local authorities

1996
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,199
and regulations before popping the seeds

1997
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,710
okay thanks yeah great question though

1998
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:19,519
thank you

1999
01:10:17,710 --> 01:10:21,279
[Music]

2000
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:22,880
thank you thank you for your nice talk

2001
01:10:21,279 --> 01:10:25,519
on nice work

2002
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:28,159
my question is related to the

2003
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,360
natural tetraploid plant that you're

2004
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:33,839
isolated from himalaya did you sequence

2005
01:10:31,359 --> 01:10:35,439
the genome and did you mine for good

2006
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:38,319
alleles that could explain its

2007
01:10:35,439 --> 01:10:40,799
resilience to this climatic

2008
01:10:38,319 --> 01:10:42,719
climate to this climate you know it can

2009
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:44,719
the resilience can be due to the

2010
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:48,079
doubling the number of genes but also

2011
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,319
accepting mutations in the second

2012
01:10:48,079 --> 01:10:52,238
genome without being lethal for the

2013
01:10:50,319 --> 01:10:55,279
plants so i was wondering if you're mine

2014
01:10:52,238 --> 01:10:55,279
for very good allele

2015
01:10:55,760 --> 01:10:59,119
that was in reference to the to the

2016
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:01,520
indian yeah

2017
01:10:59,119 --> 01:11:03,359
population no um

2018
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,520
and honestly i haven't been able to get

2019
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:07,279
in contact with that that group that did

2020
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,440
the research and we've been we've been

2021
01:11:07,279 --> 01:11:10,960
trying for about two years so if anybody

2022
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:13,359
has any way to get a hold of them that

2023
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:15,840
would be great okay i'm very curious

2024
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:18,079
because it's such a unique population

2025
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:19,600
for all those reasons it would be

2026
01:11:18,079 --> 01:11:21,279
amazing to get

2027
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,120
just get the germplasm so that we can

2028
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:25,759
look at what makes it different

2029
01:11:23,119 --> 01:11:28,559
i'm sure i'm sure it has evolved a lot

2030
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:30,800
and the second genome has

2031
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:32,800
accumulated some potential beneficial

2032
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,560
mutations and it would be nice to

2033
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,239
sequence this

2034
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,360
yeah also do you have an idea why

2035
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:41,919
tetraploids haven't evolved

2036
01:11:39,359 --> 01:11:44,000
every everywhere on earth you know

2037
01:11:41,920 --> 01:11:46,719
either producing

2038
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:48,000
more even more resilient why

2039
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:50,319
the evolution didn't make this

2040
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,840
tetraploid

2041
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:56,000
to colonize

2042
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:57,920
earth and i'm i'm really sorry i'm sorry

2043
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:59,119
yeah i have a strong accent on the top

2044
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:01,039
so

2045
01:11:59,119 --> 01:12:02,319
i'm usually really good

2046
01:12:01,039 --> 01:12:04,000
didn't

2047
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:07,039
i was wondering why evolution didn't

2048
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:09,359
keep tetraploid instead of deployed if

2049
01:12:07,039 --> 01:12:12,238
you either growing better having a in in

2050
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,238
the triploid population no why just

2051
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:16,879
tetraploids

2052
01:12:14,238 --> 01:12:19,359
oven colonized earth

2053
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:21,039
oh oh god that's a huge question that's

2054
01:12:19,359 --> 01:12:22,559
a really big one

2055
01:12:21,039 --> 01:12:24,479
and i'm not an expert in the area i

2056
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:27,520
would defer to people who who really do

2057
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:28,718
study polyploidy um my best guess at

2058
01:12:27,520 --> 01:12:30,480
this and from everything that i've

2059
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:32,158
gathered is that you have more gene

2060
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:34,158
copies it makes you more resilient in

2061
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:36,158
places where there's challenges what we

2062
01:12:34,158 --> 01:12:39,439
see is that a lot of the invasive

2063
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:42,158
species that really make headway across

2064
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:44,079
ecological regions are polyploids and

2065
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:45,920
they end up for whatever reason being

2066
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:46,800
better at uh

2067
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:49,359
at

2068
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:51,679
succeeding in those areas which is super

2069
01:12:49,359 --> 01:12:54,559
interesting because fertility is almost

2070
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:56,560
universally lower in higher ploidy

2071
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:58,000
plants so they're making up for that

2072
01:12:56,560 --> 01:12:59,840
lowered fertility with a better

2073
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:02,000
adaptability is what it seems like

2074
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,800
between seed production and resilience

2075
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:07,279
yeah yeah it's it's fascinating

2076
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,880
you only have so many years right so you

2077
01:13:07,279 --> 01:13:12,000
got to choose your uh choose your

2078
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,000
investigations wisely

2079
01:13:12,399 --> 01:13:16,000
hi thank you

2080
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,600
for your great presentation

2081
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,600
i work in indoor cultivation i'm just

2082
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:21,760
curious to know if

2083
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:24,320
you guys have studied using triploid

2084
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:27,119
plants in indoor cultivation or if you

2085
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:29,279
have any plans to do so and what kinds

2086
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:33,359
of advantages do you think there would

2087
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:35,840
be to using away plants in indoors

2088
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:37,679
using triploid plants indoors

2089
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,000
tripled plants and i would say

2090
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,319
tetraploid plants are dramatically

2091
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:44,000
superior to diploid plants we just

2092
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:46,158
obtained a couple thc production

2093
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:48,560
licenses in oregon specifically in

2094
01:13:46,158 --> 01:13:50,639
preparation for national legalization

2095
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,960
and we don't grow anything except

2096
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,880
converted tetraploids in that facility

2097
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,800
that's it

2098
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:58,239
triploids are great as well but in terms

2099
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:00,239
of getting something true to type very

2100
01:13:58,238 --> 01:14:01,678
quickly the fastest thing for us to do

2101
01:14:00,238 --> 01:14:04,238
is develop a plant variety at the

2102
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,079
diploid phase convert it to a tetraploid

2103
01:14:04,238 --> 01:14:08,079
and then put it into production and

2104
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:09,600
honestly you have never experienced

2105
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,519
cannabis until you walk into a

2106
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,960
greenhouse full of triploids or

2107
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,159
tetrapods

2108
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:18,319
compared to a diploid environment it's

2109
01:14:16,158 --> 01:14:20,238
it's like the ultimate expression

2110
01:14:18,319 --> 01:14:22,158
we're about to flower the 8x plant the

2111
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:23,519
octopoid if it's better i'll tell you

2112
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:25,039
next year but

2113
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:27,440
so far so good

2114
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:31,719
yeah great thank you awesome thank you

2115
01:14:27,439 --> 01:14:31,719
guys really appreciate it
