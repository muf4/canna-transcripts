2
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:18,239
so I know that you don't want to reveal

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,920
uh too much of your findings got to save

4
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:23,239
that for caned which I completely

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:27,320
understand and appreciate um but can you

6
00:00:23,239 --> 00:00:30,399
explain how or how and if you identified

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,079
some more toxic additives in some of

8
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,238
these Vapes and sort of what are the

9
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:41,120
implications there for consumer

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:43,558
health so we first analyzed um a variety

11
00:00:41,119 --> 00:00:46,839
of different tping blands that are sold

12
00:00:43,558 --> 00:00:51,039
on the market uh internally we have a

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:53,480
gcms inhouse that can do tpine analysis

14
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,239
so we first ran all the products inhouse

15
00:00:53,479 --> 00:01:00,000
to analyze kind of the total composition

16
00:00:57,238 --> 00:01:02,038
of these Blends then what I did is

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,959
narrowed down our Target list of

18
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:09,280
compounds to a select view that at true

19
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:12,759
Tarpin we choose not to use at all

20
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:16,000
because I think the safety profile um is

21
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:18,959
just not not there it's more hazardous

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,959
then it's worth using um so that is kind

23
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:27,319
of the target list that we uh started

24
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:30,438
with then we sent out a select of these

25
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:33,719
samples to third-party lab so we tested

26
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:37,959
them by two thirdparty labs to validate

27
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:40,920
and verify the results that we found in

28
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,599
house so you analyzing products on the

29
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:46,840
market for sort of a hit list of

30
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,599
compounds that are sort of known to be

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:53,040
um

32
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:55,199
risky yes more or less excellent okay um

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,240
and so you you mentioned that you at

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,560
true tpin you guys do not use those for

35
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,078
obvious reasons um why I mean I know you

36
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,519
can't really necessarily say why others

37
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:10,239
do but um you know is it because it's a

38
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:13,519
flavor enhancer or some other some other

39
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:16,200
reason for maybe some of these additives

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
yeah that's a great question so a lot of

41
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:21,598
these ingredients are really commonly

42
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:24,479
used in food so they have a safe history

43
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,399
of use they are approved by the FDA for

44
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:29,959
un food most of them are grass we've

45
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,599
heard that a lot generally recognized as

46
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:36,239
safe however none of those accounts for

47
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:38,878
inhaling these compounds so when I do

48
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,599
the risk assessment I go beyond just

49
00:02:38,878 --> 00:02:44,840
oral application and I assess what would

50
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:50,639
it do if we inhale these compounds and

51
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,640
that's where we see a higher risk factor

52
00:02:55,139 --> 00:03:04,559
