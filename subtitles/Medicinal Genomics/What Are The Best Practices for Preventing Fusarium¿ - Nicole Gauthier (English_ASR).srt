2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,320
so what about prevention um what are the

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,799
best practices for preventing fusarium

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,278
in different growing

5
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:19,839
environments well that's the

6
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:22,600
million-dollar question right so um so

7
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:25,399
what we know about fusarium griin arum

8
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,519
is the most pop is the most common um

9
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:30,198
species that's causing fusarium

10
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,839
headlight so if I say fusarium gineer

11
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,920
that's kind of the big one um so we know

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,200
what we know about fusarium gri arum and

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:41,800
other headlight um producing uh Fus

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,160
areia we know from wheat and barley and

15
00:00:41,799 --> 00:00:47,078
and and cereals and corn so we we base a

16
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:50,558
lot of things off of that until we can

17
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,120
generate our own data so in wheat so I'm

18
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:55,399
G to give you a life cycle because you

19
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,038
know nerdy Pathologists so in wheat

20
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:00,600
wheat is a cool season crop xerium comes

21
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,679
in it really kind of effects during

22
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,359
anthesis which is when that anther is

23
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:07,239
kind of poking out of that wheat flow um

24
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:10,280
and that's when infection occurs and in

25
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:14,118
Kentucky for example um that's happening

26
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,359
in May we're harvesting wheat in June

27
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:18,118
and then we've got a hemp crop that

28
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,359
really is not going in until July in

29
00:01:18,118 --> 00:01:24,078
most cases so by the time hemp starts

30
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:27,840
flowering and is ultra susceptible to um

31
00:01:24,078 --> 00:01:30,758
to fusarium infection it's July August

32
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,799
so how are we having this two month or

33
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:37,239
more

34
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:39,640
um um division between that that wheat

35
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:43,280
infection and that hemp infection but we

36
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:46,640
are and what our research has told us is

37
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,280
that in in fields where there was wheat

38
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,239
or near Wheat we have a lot higher

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,399
incidence of um disease and toxin so so

40
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:59,959
there's a lot more fusarium garum when

41
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,718
there was wheat in the vicinity um and

42
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:04,798
and what we're finding out now is that

43
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:07,438
wheat cover crops even though they were

44
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,959
terminated before they flowered are

45
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:12,799
still inducing a much higher amount of

46
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:14,120
disease so um I don't remember your

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,000
question

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:19,480
now what do we do about it um and that's

49
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,439
what we're trying to figure out what are

50
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:24,560
all the roles where is it coming from uh

51
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:27,359
what we do know about fusarium again

52
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,598
from the the serial grains uh research

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,599
is that those spores those canidia can

54
00:02:29,598 --> 00:02:33,639
get really high up into the atmosphere

55
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,518
and they can move very long distances so

56
00:02:33,639 --> 00:02:38,359
no one's safe right no Greenhouse is

57
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,599
safe if you've got a vent but the closer

58
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,080
we are that proximity to any wheat or

59
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:49,719
any other um any other um host plant uh

60
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,959
seems to be um really inducing a higher

61
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:53,878
level of

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:57,479
disease now is there any sort of um

63
00:02:53,878 --> 00:03:00,239
sprays or bioagents that can be applied

64
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,079
to kind of prevent an infection

65
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,560
so right now so I'm going back up just a

66
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,319
little bit right now we don't have any

67
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,878
conventional fungicides or pesticides

68
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:13,000
labeled for for hemp um and we

69
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:15,199
definitely don't for um high THC um

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,680
cannabis so we don't have any products

71
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:19,598
anyway um in terms of Organics we've

72
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,280
been looking at a lot of Biologicals and

73
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,000
right now we're not finding anything

74
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,719
that is that is effective uh we have a

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
few years of field studies um and we're

76
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,919
we're trying lots of things we're

77
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,200
throwing a lot of things to see what

78
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:35,158
sticks and we just don't think we're

79
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:35,158
getting anything right now

80
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:49,889
