big mike and amy welcome to the podcast

88
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,079
thank you

89
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,759
thank you glad to be here

90
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,280
all right and as you know we're entering

91
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:01,280
the holiday season which is

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,158
traditionally a time to consider giving

93
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,919
back

94
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:06,079
so we thought it fitting to have both of

95
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,238
you on today to talk about humanity

96
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,799
heroes which is a cause that i know is

97
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,158
important to both of you so first for

98
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,400
those who are not familiar was hoping

99
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,478
you could tell us what is the mission of

100
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,439
humanity heroes

101
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,680
humanity heroes our mission is to touch

102
00:04:19,439 --> 00:04:23,680
as many as many homeless people as many

103
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,360
lives through direct action

104
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,918
and we do that by

105
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,759
giving our backpack campaign

106
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:31,680
which we do every year

107
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,000
to homeless people this year our goal is

108
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,319
7 000 backpacks filled with hygiene

109
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,079
items

110
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:43,759
cleanliness items protection ppe and

111
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:47,359
goods like that soap shampoo

112
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:49,919
writing paper pens razor blades

113
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,400
socks caps

114
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,918
blankets the things that the the basic

115
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,799
necessities that keep them warm and

116
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:58,079
healthy down and skid row

117
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,639
fantastic

118
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:03,758
so and that's a great cause so

119
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,840
when and why did you decide to create

120
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,720
humidity heroes

121
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:09,038
well

122
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,919
well we first started it in bulgaria

123
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,639
because there actually were no legit uh

124
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,918
charities uh we believe if a cus if a

125
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,319
company is successful they have an

126
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:20,079
obligation to give back directly

127
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:23,038
to the community in which they make

128
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,839
their money from and society

129
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:25,839
as a whole

130
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,960
excellent excellent and so what are some

131
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:30,638
of the things that you've learned

132
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,439
throughout the years we're

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,000
doing your work through humanity heroes

134
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:38,160
um for me myself um i've definitely

135
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,199
learned a different appreciation for

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,199
life

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
this work for me just giving back and

138
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
helping those in need it's been a very

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,080
fulfilling

140
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,960
experience

141
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:51,038
and also to learn that when working in a

142
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:52,879
big company like advanced nutrients it

143
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:55,839
brings together

144
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:57,839
the employees because every day i see

145
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,918
employees here in our office that ask me

146
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:03,359
about volunteering when is the next

147
00:05:59,918 --> 00:06:05,439
event and i realize that it creates a

148
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,680
company morale that's really positive

149
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:11,279
because people are happy to work for a

150
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,160
company to for for an owner of a company

151
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:17,279
that likes to give back and so you know

152
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,360
definitely it um it's affected us in

153
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:21,119
that sense and you know the more and

154
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,680
more we come together and get more

155
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,680
people involved more companies involved

156
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,639
um we'll be able to

157
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,120
make

158
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,800
an impact greater than the problem right

159
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,519
and the problem is getting

160
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,680
worse and worse every year

161
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:38,000
when we first started this program was

162
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,478
it five six years ago yeah yeah

163
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,439
uh we gave out 1800 backpacks we pretty

164
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:46,318
well covered everybody down in skid row

165
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:49,598
now we're doing 7 000 and it's a drop in

166
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:51,919
the bucket and so we really want other

167
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:54,719
people to join other corporations to to

168
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,439
help out and join in with this cause

169
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,840
with us and together we can make a

170
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,399
significant impact in fact

171
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,478
we we do we go beyond actually giving

172
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:07,038
out those backpacks we've gone down and

173
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,199
giving out masks uh and all kinds of

174
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:12,800
things during uh kobet during the worst

175
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:15,038
of cobit we were down there on skid row

176
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
uh helping out

177
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,918
excellent excellent and so

178
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:22,478
you mentioned that the problem is big

179
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,159
and it's only giving getting bigger so i

180
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,079
was wondering if you could expand on so

181
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,319
what are some of the biggest challenges

182
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:30,959
that humanity heroes has been able to

183
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,439
help the homeless community in la

184
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,439
overcome

185
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:38,239
go ahead um for me through our direct

186
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,038
action program with the hygiene

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,038
backpacks you know we simply deliver a

188
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:44,878
glimpse of hope

189
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:48,079
there's different levels to the

190
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:50,400
homelessness in los angeles and one

191
00:07:48,079 --> 00:07:52,639
thing that we do every year is we walk

192
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:55,359
the outskirts of

193
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,079
skid row and we hand deliver backpacks

194
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,479
and knock on tents and usually those

195
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:03,198
people are just experiencing a bad time

196
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,598
in their journey in life and so to just

197
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,080
show them that we care that we took the

198
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,839
time to walk the streets and you know

199
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,959
give gifts

200
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,000
of daily essentials um clean garments a

201
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:18,159
warm blanket a warm meal um

202
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,720
you know it's just a small token of love

203
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,879
but it helps overcome a lot mentally and

204
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,319
food for their pets as well uh dog food

205
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,599
very very popular down there a lot of

206
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,360
folks have pets yes

207
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:31,120
and now you mentioned that that some of

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,800
the people who who you're encountering

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
might be kind of going through a

210
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:37,359
temporary issue or something and i you

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,000
know that might be a misconception some

212
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,599
people have about

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,679
homeless patients what are some other

214
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,560
misconceptions that you you typically

215
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:48,399
see amongst amongst people

216
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:49,679
here's a statistic that most people

217
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
aren't aware of

218
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:55,439
59

219
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,279
of the american population is one

220
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,480
paycheck away from being homeless

221
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:02,480
and when you think about that

222
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:09,399
you uh

223
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,399
i can't help but want help

224
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,600
absolutely because i can tell you it

225
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,360
could be a a friend someone you know

226
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
someone in your circle

227
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,879
is one paycheck away from being down

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,519
there and what would you do for that

229
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:25,120
person

230
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,320
yeah absolutely yeah when you put it

231
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,200
that way

232
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,600
that's

233
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,360
that's pretty sobering

234
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,440
um and so

235
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,399
and given that you know many homeless

236
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
people

237
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,480
suffer from mental illness and or

238
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,839
substance abuse um obviously not the

239
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,560
people that you were just referencing

240
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,000
but but a significant amount of them um

241
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,759
do you think that cannabis medicine

242
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,039
could potentially help some members of

243
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:48,799
the homeless community because we are

244
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,559
seeing some research that it can it can

245
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:53,199
help some of those conditions

246
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,958
i believe it can absolutely i i know

247
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,839
that uh

248
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:59,199
so depends on mental illness it you know

249
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:01,040
whether you want to give them or can't

250
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,560
give them cannabis or not but for

251
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:05,199
substance abuse

252
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:06,399
absolutely there are

253
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
rehab

254
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,159
facilities that now give away

255
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,120
cannabis

256
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:14,799
uh to the the people that are in rehab

257
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,959
and they're finding it

258
00:10:14,799 --> 00:10:19,519
very good for people especially who are

259
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,759
on oxycontin or heroin

260
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:24,078
that they they are switching

261
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:27,120
off of that and onto cannabis

262
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:28,000
and it is working extremely

263
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,240
well

264
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,519
so cannabis is a healing plant and it

265
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,959
can

266
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,879
absolutely help

267
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,199
some of the people down there on skid

268
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,639
row the mental health issue is

269
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,519
is an important one the state of

270
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:44,559
california here they have spent a lot of

271
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:47,839
money i believe it's about 3 billion

272
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:49,919
on mental health and getting those folks

273
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,720
off the street and

274
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:52,719
getting them help

275
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:58,719
amy anything to add there

276
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:59,920
um no big mike said at all so

277
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,278
excellent all right well now i'm going

278
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,000
to put you on the spot

279
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:03,360
so

280
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,679
i know that homelessness it's a

281
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,440
multifaceted issue um

282
00:11:05,679 --> 00:11:09,759
but if there were one thing you could

283
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,079
change whether it be a policy or

284
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,360
something culturally or logistically

285
00:11:12,078 --> 00:11:16,719
something that could help solve the

286
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,480
problem um what would it be

287
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,040
i've got an answer for that

288
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,519
uh i would like to see

289
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:24,719
states build

290
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,959
cities

291
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,440
out in the desert that teach people

292
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:32,239
trades give them education

293
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,600
getting get them prepared to go back

294
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,039
into

295
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,639
the communities and work now it sounds

296
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,639
simple to do

297
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:42,639
here's the issue

298
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:45,519
there's a lot of

299
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:47,199
civil liberty organizations out there

300
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,959
that are saying well if a person wants

301
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,959
to be homeless it's their right to be

302
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,239
homeless you can't force them to go into

303
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,679
these places

304
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,600
on the other hand

305
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,159
they're all over the streets it would be

306
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,079
great to get them into a community and

307
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,799
really start rehabilitating all these

308
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:04,399
folks and that would be

309
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,838
monumental and it's

310
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:08,320
not like we don't have the money in the

311
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,040
state of california to do that we do

312
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,440
have the money to do that it's just that

313
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,838
there's a lot of interference from

314
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,079
other groups that are making it very

315
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:20,079
difficult to uh to hit that goal

316
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,879
well it's a that's an innovative

317
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:27,519
approach so really just kind of having a

318
00:12:24,879 --> 00:12:28,559
more dedicated education

319
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,639
um

320
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,119
system in place to help help them enter

321
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,600
the workforce absolutely you know give

322
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,240
them computer skills vocational skills

323
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
uh just just skills that they'll need to

324
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,480
go back into society

325
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,399
and and become a uh

326
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,079
a a good part of society

327
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,078
excellent excellent and now you

328
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,359
mentioned earlier your goal for

329
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:55,759
2021 um being what was it did you say 7

330

some of our goals for 2022 are to

335
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,199
continue to build

336
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
our cannabis coalition so that we can

337

342
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:23,360
give more support to our cannabis

343
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,119
community who is dealing with natural

344
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,879
disasters

345
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,200
we're going to do a lot more charity

346
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,439
events to help raise money and also get

347
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,639
more people involved and hopefully

348
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:36,240
that'll move us towards the cannabis

349
00:13:33,639 --> 00:13:39,039
rehabilitation educational and

350
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,560
relocation program for homeless people

351
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:45,039
that just need um you know a fresh start

352
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,159
and a helping hand and i'd have to say

353
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,399
there are

354
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:50,319
a lot of cannabis companies now that are

355
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,240
starting to step forward and and work

356
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,519
with us and donate money

357
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,320
and uh realizing that this is uh an

358
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
important uh part of

359
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
the community

360
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,320
absolutely i agree with that so if we do

361
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,480
have some listeners who who want to get

362
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,079
involved what's the best way to do that

363
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,120
yeah definitely they could go to our

364

to to all of those in the show

375
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:38,559
description so people have an easy way

376
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,919
to access that

377
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,359
one of the things one of the things i

378
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:43,679
want to ask about when you were talking

379
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,000
about your goals for 2022 and beyond was

380
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:48,879
this um what did you say the the

381
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,639
cannabis education and um

382
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,559
uh i i don't remember the name of it

383
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,320
exactly but it sounded similar to what

384
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:57,119
big mike was describing before where are

385
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
you going to have a program to educate

386
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,839
some of these people in maybe the

387
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,759
cannabis field so that they can

388
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,160
participate there

389
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:06,480
um that would be like a big picture

390
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,519
thing but just my own experiences in

391
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,680
skid row are that peop the skid row and

392
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,480
the homelessness homelessness there is

393
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,479
in levels so you have mental illness you

394
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:19,039
have drug addiction which are beyond

395
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,600
what we can do um but for those people

396
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:23,919
that are just in a bad place in life

397
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,920
it would be a really great idea

398
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:28,559
if it were possible to come together

399
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,479
evaluate some of these people maybe put

400
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:33,518
them through some sort of educational

401
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,759
program that lasted six or nine months

402
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,159
work with some farmers or cultivators

403
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,720
around the country that could utilize

404
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:43,519
entry-level workers and somehow create

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,440
an educational rehabilitation and

406
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,839
relocation program

407
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,360
in our regard absolutely

408
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,360
yeah that sounds that sounds great that

409
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,959
sounds like a great marriage of the two

410
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,600
um there's two projects that you have

411
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,958
going on here um another thing that you

412
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,879
that you touched on that i wanted to ask

413
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,439
you about was i know that humanity

414
00:15:58,879 --> 00:16:02,879
heroes has expanded to also helping

415
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
members of the cannabis community

416
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:06,639
dealing with natural disasters i was

417
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:07,600
hoping you could talk a little bit more

418
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,839
about that

419
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,320
yeah absolutely um this year we've been

420
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,440
very busy providing aid to our cannabis

421
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,160
community um in april of this year we

422
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
helped a number of wildfire victims in

423
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,159
northern california

424
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,519
with monetary as well as nutrient

425
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:24,480
donations

426
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,959
we also

427
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,879
donated humanity packs and warm meals to

428
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:32,239
these communities

429
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:34,480
we also helped over 70 bushmen in saint

430
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,959
vincent in the caribbean

431
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,920
island when the la sophia volcano

432
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:41,599
erupted it took out 70

433
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,838
of the

434
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,159
island's agriculture so we were the

435
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,079
first international aide

436
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,879
to help the people there

437
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,879
with

438
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:54,000
nutrient donations as well as some

439
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:54,799
humanity packs and warm meals and then

440
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,039
um

441
00:16:54,799 --> 00:16:58,559
in september i traveled actually to

442
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,879
upstate new york

443
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:03,599
there was a small hydroponics store that

444
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:05,599
was flooded out with four feet of water

445
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,279
from hurricane ida

446
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:09,359
it's also a customer of advanced

447
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:11,199
nutrients so we were able to make a

448
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,958
monetary donation

449
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,519
to that hydroponics store and it was

450
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,000
actually a blessing in disguise for that

451
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,798
store because they were able to expand

452
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,798
their store to a very large facility

453
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,318
so that's just some of the stuff that

454
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:26,400
we've done well over four hundred

455
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,798
thousand dollars worth of aid directly

456
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,720
to our cannabis community and we're

457
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:35,038
prepared to do more there's a lot going

458
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,720
on for cultivators around our country so

459
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:38,160
that's excellent and that's that's so

460
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:40,160
fantastic that you were able to give

461
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,160
back to to your customers you know to

462
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,360
show that uh you're you're able to help

463
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,798
them in a time of need that's fantastic

464
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:48,879
um and just

465
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:52,558
i mean just thinking about how some of

466
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
these cultivators are you know

467
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:56,639
i can't help but draw a parallel here

468
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,400
between you saying that you know 59 of

469
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,559
the population is one paycheck away from

470
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,440
being homeless i got to imagine that you

471
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:05,038
know a natural disaster for a cannabis

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,720
cultivator with you know all the

473
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:08,640
overhead and all of the

474
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,880
the things that they're dealing with um

475
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
that's potentially devastating so the

476
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:15,840
fact that you're helping them out is is

477
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,839
huge yes yes it is

478
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:19,359
thank you for that

479
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:22,399

480
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,889
so winding down here um i wondered if uh

481
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,559

482
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:25,759
