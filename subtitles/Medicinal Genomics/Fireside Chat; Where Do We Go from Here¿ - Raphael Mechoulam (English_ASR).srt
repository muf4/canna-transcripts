1
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:05,278
thank you

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,120
i think we have these microphones on can

3
00:00:05,278 --> 00:00:10,638
everyone hear us

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:13,199
yep okay there so

5
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:14,919
let's uh let's talk about microbes i

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,600
love microbes

7
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:21,359
oh well we were just

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,400
chatting and um i mentioned that uh

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,720
well the endocannabinoid system

10
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:28,879
to a certain extent particularly through

11
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:31,678
the cb2 receptor

12
00:00:28,879 --> 00:00:33,439
is a protective system now one of the

13
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:37,679
things that we have protect

14
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:39,199
ourselves is tolerance of microbes to

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:42,558
antibiotics

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,399
now what does that mean i mean our body

17
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:45,599
and microbes have been talking to each

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,640
other for

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:52,800
millions of years and chances are that

20
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,160
the body attacks microbes at least

21
00:00:52,799 --> 00:00:57,439
certain microbes

22
00:00:54,159 --> 00:01:00,718
and microbes respond

23
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:01,839
by taking protective measures and then

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
the body

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
tries to find ways to overcome the

26
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,200
protective measures

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,560
and it goes back and forth now as

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,560
uh obviously

29
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:20,319
at the moment one of the major

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,520
problems in in medicine is

31
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:26,599
what do we do with

32
00:01:23,519 --> 00:01:27,920
this tolerance of microbes to

33
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:31,199
antibiotics

34
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,840
if things do not change and seriously

35
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
change

36
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,560
within 10 years we may not have any

37
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:43,039
uh real antibiotics around

38
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:45,200
a situation which is extremely dangerous

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,118
but we do have the endocannabinoid

40
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,439
system so we thought let's see

41
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:50,640
whether the endocannabinoid system is

42
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:54,798
somewhat

43
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:58,239
involved in in

44
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
that kind of conversation between

45
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:02,560
microbes

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,560
and and the humans so i have

47
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,719
something on the fireside chart which is

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,679
uh not immediate

49
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,679
it comes somewhere oops here it is

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,840
can we go one back oh the red one will

51
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:21,519
go back the red one and the laser is

52
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:25,039
the green one there we go yeah now

53
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:29,040
we speak to each other by making noise

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,840
we call it talking chatting

55
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:32,878
chatting if you wish microbes talk to

56
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,479
each other

57
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:39,518
by releasing chemicals

58
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:43,439
and they when microbes in

59
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,439
are in stress they start

60
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,479
excreting chemicals selling other

61
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,039
microbes

62
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:50,479
not one or two but millions of them

63
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,439
let's do something

64
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:55,598
and this is called quorum sensing why

65
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:57,039
code's quorum sensing i have no idea but

66
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:59,518
that's what it's called

67
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,479
and one of the ways they protect

68
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:05,840
themselves

69
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,840
they come together and form a biofilm

70
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,519
so the quorum sensing as you can read is

71
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,679
the ability

72
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,519
of bacterial population to chemically

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,200
communicate with each other

74
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:20,400
and one of the ways bacteria

75
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:22,959
protect themselves from stress and

76
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,920
antibiotics for them obviously stressed

77
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,199
they make biofilms very films of

78
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:31,839
millions

79
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:34,878
of microbes the antibiotics cannot go

80
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,400
in in the biofilm

81
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,798
uh the microbes do not develop and if

82
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,799
they

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,120
do not develop then the antibiotics

84
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,439
anyway do not act on them so on

85
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,799
and they sit there and wait until they

86
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:50,158
can do something

87
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,719
so this is one of the ways

88
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,959
microbes protect themselves against the

89
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:58,080
stress of antibiotics

90
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,360
one way of tolerance if you wish now

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
we thought if we have an endocannabinoid

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
system which is a protective system

93
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,799
does it do something and uh

94
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,239
my colleague one of my colleagues who

95
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,959
knows how to do these things

96
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,680
i haven't got a focused idea how to work

97
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,959
with

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,000
uh with these things uh

99
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,399
we gave him an extremely potent

100
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
synthetic cannabinoid which is very

101
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,638
potent both on cb1

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and cb2 we thought well maybe we shall

103
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,079
take something very potent

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,360
see whether it acts and then we go to

105
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,560
cbd thc

106
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,360
endocannabinoids and so on this is a

107
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,439
compound count h210 which is about 100

108
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,479
times more active than thc

109
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:48,560
and one wanted to see whether it affects

110
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:51,680
the microbes and yes we reduced

111
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,399
uh the form formation of biofilms it

112
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,319
also

113
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,719
reduced the formation of virulence

114
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,639
factor production by these

115
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,440
particular microbes so

116
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,560
we are going on and with other microbes

117
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:08,000
we're going on

118
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,600
in other forms of protection but

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,680
it seems that the endocannabinoid system

120
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,840
at least this is the first evidence i

121
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,720
hope this is not the last evidence

122
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,679
that the cannabinoid system interferes

123
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,120
with the

124
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,240
signal transduction used by bacteria

125
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,038
by the protection of bacteria against

126
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
stress

127
00:05:27,038 --> 00:05:34,240
which means that maybe just maybe

128
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:38,839
in a couple of years antibiotics will be

129
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,840
administered together with uh

130
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:42,239
endocannabinoids or particular

131
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:45,519
endocannabinoid

132
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,280
to reduce the tolerance of

133
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:52,079
bacteria to antibiotics so

134
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:52,799
this is an answer shall we be there

135
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:55,918
someday

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,439
i sincerely hope so one of the ways

137
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:02,240
uh to to go ahead maybe it's a mistake

138
00:05:59,439 --> 00:06:03,918
let's find out in three years time so

139
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
just before we jump onto the next topic

140
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:06,079
um

141
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,360
i find it interesting that there are

142
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,959
some class of antibiotics known as

143
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,160
aminoglycosides that act specifically on

144
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,758
the mitochondria and

145
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
we even have some patients that when

146
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,000
there's a mutation in

147
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,879
the mitochondria the aminoglycosides can

148
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,800
actually induce a form of hearing loss

149
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,319
uh because of these so is it possible

150
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,879
that the cannabinoids are working

151
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,120
through

152
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:28,240
a different mechanism for their their

153
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,199
quorum sensing or

154
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,639
or dissolving of corn sensing or what do

155
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,879
we know about its mode of action in the

156
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,560
in the microbes well quite frankly we

157
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:39,759
don't know anything at the moment

158
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,918
i this is the first evidence we have

159
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
i'm talking to the microbiologist and

160
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,959
they look they have never heard of

161
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,399
endocannabinoids

162
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,918
they did normally don't know the

163
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,959
existence of this thing

164
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,639
and they look at me say oh really and

165
00:06:52,959 --> 00:07:00,159
but it makes sense that our body

166
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,519
has a defense mechanism against

167
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,560
something that is normally occurring

168
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:08,879
bacteria sense

169
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
that the body is fighting against them

170
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:12,079
in this case it's a

171
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,080
synthetic compound or semi-synthetic

172
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:14,560
compound that we give and it's attacking

173
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,959
them

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:18,478
they don't don't seem to know that they

175
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:21,598
know that the body

176
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:23,120
is attacking them and this is their

177
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:25,519
reaction

178
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,959
making a biofilm making other things

179
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:29,198
making a biofilm

180
00:07:26,959 --> 00:07:30,399
to protect themselves against

181
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,360
antibiotics

182
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:34,399
we have to learn a huge amount of things

183
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
right

184
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:38,478
i mean it could be cytokine based you do

185
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,479
tend to get cytokine storms when they're

186
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,079
and there's inflammation and it seems as

187
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:43,758
if the cannabinoids are having some role

188
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,399
in dampening down that inflammation

189
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,080
there's

190
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:47,918
i think some talks today on pans and

191
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:50,318
pandas where we see this happening in

192
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:51,680
in pediatric patients but um yeah it's

193
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,120
fascinating lots a lot of work to do a

194
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:56,319
lot maybe a lot more sequence well

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,199
we know that cannabinoids some

196
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,759
cannabinoids

197
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,280
endocannabinoids most definitely act and

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,160
cytokines

199
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,918
this type another type many of the

200
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:08,479
cytokines we've published

201
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:09,758
quite a bit on that and most definitely

202
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,959
they act on

203
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,360
the cytokines how irrelevant

204
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,560
that is to form cells that's what i was

205
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,520
telling you about i haven't got a

206
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,839
focused idea

207
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:20,560
interesting well on the sense of bone

208
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:23,038
remodeling

209
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,598
our mother recently broke her leg in six

210
00:08:23,038 --> 00:08:24,959
places

211
00:08:23,598 --> 00:08:26,159
and so we've been paying a lot of

212
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,318
attention to your work here in

213
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,919
osteoclast and osteoblast development

214
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,759
tell us more well this this started from

215
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,519
a completely different

216
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:38,559
research we were doing it had nothing to

217
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,560
do with cannabinoids

218
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:45,679
there were papers and statistics that

219
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:47,120
women after the age of 50 when there are

220
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:50,958
hormonal changes

221
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,200
uh women have much less osteoporosis

222
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
in the mediterranean region than let's

223
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,278
say no way

224
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:58,639
and the reason for that people said was

225
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:01,039
olive oil

226
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:01,838
we thought well olive oil all of them

227
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,000
use only

228
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,839
olive oil so we thought okay let's look

229
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,240
at the oleic acid which is the

230
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,480
principle of olive oil nothing to do

231
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,440
with cannabinoids at this point

232
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,399
and so we looked at olive oil and it my

233
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,040
friend

234
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,399
itai bab who is a specialist in bones

235
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,079
didn't find anything

236
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
so we didn't throw it away they said

237
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,040
maybe it's a metabolite of

238
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,919
oleic acid so we looked at what kind of

239
00:09:25,039 --> 00:09:28,399
metabolites

240
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:30,559
these acids make and one of them we

241
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,240
thought maybe

242
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:35,838
for all kinds of reasons i wouldn't got

243
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,879
into that fatty acid bound to amino acid

244
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,360
and we made

245
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,080
oleic acid bound to serine and amino

246
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,120
acid

247
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,320
now this now brings us closer to

248
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
endocannabinoids

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,839
because the endogenous cannabinoids

250
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,560
compounds of that type

251
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,800
fatty acid bound to an amino acid or a

252
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:56,000
derivative of amino acid

253
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:58,319
so we are now closer all of a sudden to

254
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,120
uh endocannabinoids we want to go away

255
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,200
from it okay

256
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,159
cannabinoids so we looked at this

257
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,519
particular

258
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:08,480
compound ole serine or os

259
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,278
and we found that it is present in bone

260
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,320
and

261
00:10:09,278 --> 00:10:15,519
itai baff i found that it is extremely

262
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,680
potent against osteoporosis

263
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:20,480
and so we why did we look at all in

264
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,838
syria

265
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,480
well those of you who remember your

266
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,680
chemistry this is anandamite

267
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,240
and uh there is a

268
00:10:27,679 --> 00:10:36,078
uh uh olayin serine on the top

269
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,799
and our hidden oil syringe which is a

270
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:40,559
close to anandabytes et cetera et cetera

271
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,120
and at the end i mean looking

272
00:10:40,559 --> 00:10:44,078
following this particular line of

273
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,278
thought we have

274
00:10:44,078 --> 00:10:48,000
the olympian this was published uh five

275
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:50,879
years ago

276
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,919
in uh proceedings of national academy of

277
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:54,159
sciences

278
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:55,759
and this particular compound allele

279
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:59,600
syrian turned out

280
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:04,078
to be extremely potent in

281
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:07,200
in bones it uh enhances the activity

282
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,599
of cells that produce bones

283
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,040
and it and here we have you can see

284
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,480
going up and down

285
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:17,120
and it lowers the activity of

286
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,600
the cells that destroy bones okay that's

287
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,519
fine

288
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:24,879
but does it work in osteoporosis

289
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,759
so we took uh poor mice we take we took

290
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:28,799
away the

291
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:31,838
reproductive system which essentially is

292
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,639
what is happening in women after the age

293
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,120
of 50 not

294
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,319
exactly but more or less so they don't

295
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,959
have the hormones

296
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:44,399
and these mice after a few months

297
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:45,119
osteoporosis like women after the age of

298
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,120
50.

299
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:53,200
so this if you look at the red

300
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,200
on the slide you'll see that the bones

301
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,759
bone volume goes down at this point we

302
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,120
started giving them

303
00:11:57,759 --> 00:12:04,159
all serine and lo and behold

304
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:07,278
we saw now that it stops the reaction

305
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:10,958
it also moves it

306
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:15,919
moves it up so the bones start

307
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:15,919
being formed again so here we have a

308
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:22,479
endocannabinoid-like compound

309
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,200
which works in a direction which we

310
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,399
couldn't

311
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:28,560
even think about at the beginning

312
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,919
now this is something that we have to

313
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:33,119
take into account

314
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,838
we have about 150

315
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,959
compounds of this type in our body in

316
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,920
our brain

317
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:41,439
so in addition to anatomite which acts

318
00:12:39,919 --> 00:12:44,958
on the endocannabinoid system

319
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,760
we have an additional 150 compounds or

320
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,719
even more

321
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:49,600
of this type endocannabinoid like

322
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:52,720
compounds

323
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,759
and a few of those only very few have

324
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,120
been looked into

325
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:00,720
so we can expect a huge amount of

326
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,360
uh things happening of which

327
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,839
at the moment i can only guess what they

328
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,159
are

329
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,920
one speculation if you wish

330
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:14,639
has to do with psychology

331
00:13:11,919 --> 00:13:15,278
i went to some of our psychology and

332
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,320
asked them

333
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:18,320
what do we know about

334
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:27,200
biochemistry of uh

335
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:29,599
individual differences of uh

336
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:32,079
why am i different than anybody else

337
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,639
here here we have a couple hundred

338
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,759
people

339
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,200
each one of us is different why are we

340
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,159
different

341
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,560
what is the chemistry in the nobel and

342
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:45,039
they said we haven't got a focused idea

343
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:47,119
well is it possible that i said that

344
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,039
because we have 150

345
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,198
or maybe 200 compounds of this type

346
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:54,000
endocannabinoid-like

347
00:13:51,198 --> 00:13:55,519
compounds those that we have looked into

348
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,078
seem to act on the central nervous

349
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,560
system

350
00:13:56,078 --> 00:13:59,278
is it possible that the relations of

351
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:02,638
these

352
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,720
150 compounds have something to do with

353
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,519
our personality

354
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,920
well he said i have nothing against it

355
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:12,240
so

356
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,439
maybe maybe our personality to a certain

357
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,079
extent

358
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:22,160
is based genetically on the

359
00:14:18,078 --> 00:14:25,919
150 to 200 anandamite

360
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:29,600
like compounds that we have in our brain

361
00:14:25,919 --> 00:14:32,240
and the relations between them will

362
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,879
show someday that they they are the

363
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,360
basis

364
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:36,879
or one of the basis of personality

365
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,320
complete speculation

366
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:40,799
somebody comes up and says all that is

367
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,160
silly

368
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:46,000
i'll accept it so if somebody tells me

369
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,759
that i'm hardheaded it's because these

370
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,360
things are affecting my brain and the

371
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,360
bones around my brain right and i'm

372
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:54,399
excellent

373
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,000
would you like me to tell another short

374
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,838
story

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
yes of something that uh

376
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,600
this is the um

377
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:16,639
why do a

378
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:19,959
cannabinoids act and so many things

379
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,600
well we really don't know one

380
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,958
possibility

381
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
is they have at least cannabidiol dial

382
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:28,559
has

383
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:31,759
an endobite has the ability

384
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,958
to act through epigenetics what is

385
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:37,360
epigenetics

386
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,919
it is the effect on dna without breaking

387
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,560
it

388
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:42,000
just modifying the activity of dna by

389
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:43,838
methylating here

390
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,519
let's say a part of the dna that's

391
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:46,320
involved in certain in a certain

392
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:49,440
reaction and

393
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,639
causes the production of peptides or

394
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:54,399
proteins

395
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:57,360
somewhere we and works overtime and this

396
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,480
working overtime causes a a reaction

397
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:01,600
because it's a disease

398
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:05,199
if we block the activity it can lower it

399
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:08,560
well it was shown by italian group that

400
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:10,240
cannabidiol and anandamite can do that

401
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,879
in a particular skin disease

402
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
in psoriasis if this is a general

403
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,198
reaction

404
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,639
then it may explain why cannabinoids

405
00:16:17,198 --> 00:16:22,000
have

406
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:25,600
such a white uh

407
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,679
type of reaction maybe just maybe

408
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,440
cannabinoids not only in that particular

409
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:33,679
skin reaction but maybe in

410
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,880
other diseases causes changes in the dna

411
00:16:33,679 --> 00:16:38,799
epigenetics who knows again

412
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,320
it's speculation you were asking me

413
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,479
where are we going well

414
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,000
here are some speculations some of them

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:45,920
may be right some of them may be

416
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
completely wrong

417
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:49,120
there's an interesting model for from

418
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,039
memory in

419
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,480
model organism called the plagia and we

420
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,439
did some sequencing in this before

421
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,159
because it's a single

422
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
it's the largest single cell neuron and

423
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,319
the genome

424
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,958
copy number in this is like a hundred

425
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,399
thousand uh throughout the cell

426
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:04,240
but in sequencing it there's a very

427
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,519
interesting connection with 5ht which is

428
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,359
serotonin

429
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,199
and methylation and we could actually

430
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:10,719
sample different areas of this single

431
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:11,919
cell when it was trying to form we

432
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,120
believe memories

433
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,120
and see different patterns of

434
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,639
methylation rna moving around on at a

435
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,359
single cell level which is really

436
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,280
fascinating

437
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,558
if these govern everything in there i

438
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:21,838
don't know if there's an endocannabinoid

439
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:22,959
system in plagiarism i might go home and

440
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,399
look

441
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,679
well if we're speaking

442
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,240
of endocannabinoids or not

443
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,600
i mentioned several things my lecture

444
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,759
just

445
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:36,959
passing on one of them is we need

446
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:39,599
clinical trials

447
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,079
we've talked about that for quite a few

448
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:42,000
minutes

449
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:43,359
again i repeat it we need clinical

450
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,319
trials we can't go ahead

451
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:46,719
without that a second thing is we need

452
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:48,639
to

453
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:50,319
look at the entourage effect we

454
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,160
published under entourage effect 20

455
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:52,558
years ago there has been no research on

456
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
it

457
00:17:52,558 --> 00:17:56,000
we should do many other people should

458
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:59,519
work on the entourage effect

459
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:01,919
thc is not the same

460
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,720
as cannabis with some other compounds

461
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,038
there what

462
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,440
what do we what are we looking at we

463
00:18:05,038 --> 00:18:10,319
don't know we don't know whether

464
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
thc with cbd is better at for heart

465
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:15,200
disease

466
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:18,798
at what concentrations we heard

467
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,519
from the clinicians that yes we need

468
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:22,558
more cbd less cbd depends on the disease

469
00:18:21,519 --> 00:18:26,319
depends on the

470
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:28,160
age and so on we know so very little and

471
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:29,678
the third thing that we have there are

472
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,440
many other things that we have to know

473
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,679
but another thing that we have to know

474
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,720
is what are these

475
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:39,519
endogenous like cannabinoids doing

476
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,880
i mentioned now the possibility that

477
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:43,759
they have to do with

478
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:45,600
uh protection against microbes there are

479
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:50,879
many other things but let me enter the

480
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:50,879
positive note there is

481
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:58,159
there are lysozymes which are present in

482
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,000
uh

483
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,600
many animals these are cellular

484
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,599
organelles that have

485
00:19:01,599 --> 00:19:08,558
function by digestion and recycling

486
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:09,359
of macromolecules proteins and so on

487
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:12,720
fine

488
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:13,599
now somebody looked at the lysozymes in

489
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,200
a worm

490
00:19:13,599 --> 00:19:20,798
there is a worm called sea elegance

491
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,000
now people that work on longevity

492
00:19:20,798 --> 00:19:28,319
work and see elegance why because

493
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,679
the worm sea elegance uh lives only

494
00:19:28,319 --> 00:19:32,720
a few months i think and it's easy to

495
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
work on it i mean

496
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,000
working with a human being and longevity

497
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:39,279
well

498
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,599
we don't have the time to do that but um

499
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,440
working in a worm live just a very short

500
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,480
time

501
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:48,798
that's a good idea so almost all

502
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,599
people that work on longevity work and

503
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:53,200
the worm

504
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:54,639
see elegance and in a very recent paper

505
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,080
just a few months ago

506
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:01,280
it was found that this part of the

507
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,000
cell the lysozyme takes

508
00:20:01,279 --> 00:20:06,079
proteins and one of the compounds that

509
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,000
under certain condition it can make

510
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:13,918
is an endocannabinoid endocannabinoid

511
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:16,880
like compound called oleil ethanolamide

512
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,400
i remember i just was speaking serine

513
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,760
that has to do with bones

514
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,840
here the worm see elegance

515
00:20:21,759 --> 00:20:26,400
makes ole tanolamite which is again is a

516
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:29,918
endocannabinoid

517
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:32,480
like compound and lo and behold

518
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,120
this endocannabinoid like compound

519
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,360
through

520
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:37,599
a certain mechanism that they found this

521
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,319
was published in science

522
00:20:37,599 --> 00:20:40,319
activates

523
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:47,720
certain genes and

524
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:51,919
activates the transcription of genes of

525
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:55,200
nh80 and promotes longevity

526
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:56,240
so the next idea is well maybe as of

527
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
tomorrow morning

528
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,720
each one of us should take a spoonlet of

529
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:04,159
olive and olamide

530
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:08,640
and leave to be 120 years old

531
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:13,039
excellent he had some worms right well

532
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,520
this is it is a beyond speculation this

533
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,640
is

534
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:20,558
just to end a happy note

535
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,559
excellent yes all right

536
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,120
well

537
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:30,240
with all of that we would like to turn

538
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,559
some time here to present dr mitchullum

539
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
with

540
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,200
a lifetime achievement award this is our

541
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:38,400
sign of appreciation

542
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,600
for the cascade and the avalanche that

543
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,919
he has created

544
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:44,079
now there's something attached to this

545
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,640
award that's not very transparent

546
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:48,079
or uh or apparent from what brennan's

547
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,440
holding

548
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:55,038
this award is actually

549
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,919
represents a one trillion base pair

550
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,960
award so we are going to offer up a

551
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:01,120
trillion bases

552
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,240
i say that with a pinky by my thumb or

553
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,558
picking by my mouth

554
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,079
uh to dr machulam to sequence whatever

555
00:22:04,558 --> 00:22:08,158
he wants to sort of

556
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,918
better expand the space and to

557
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:13,840
understand whether it's gene expression

558
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
or methylation

559
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:30,000
thank you very much thank you i'm so

560
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
very thrilled to do this

561
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,839
sure

562
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:48,240
this is uh 1 million megabases or 1 000

563
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,639
gigabases

564
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,640
and we encourage everybody to to tweet

565
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,840
or email their ideas we by no means

566
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,360
understand all this we want to

567
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,359
crowdsource the best solution here

568
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:08,159
thank you
