world of professional contact Sports and

47
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,800
how cannabinoid products could

55
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,519
published an extensive literature review

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,919
titled cannabinoid therapy in athletics

57
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,759
a review of current cannabis research to

58
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,318
evaluate potential realworld cannaboid

59
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:49,239
applications in sport which establishes

60
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:51,919
a foundation for their future research

61
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:54,400
during our conversation we discussed how

62
00:02:51,919 --> 00:02:56,000
Liz became interested in the therapeutic

63
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,080
potential of

64
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,479
cannabinoids the published literature

98
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,800
good afternoon Liz thanks so much for

99
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:43,439
joining us on the podcast for sure well

100
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,520
thank you so much for having me I'm a

101
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,560
big fan of your podcast so I'm honored

102
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:51,198
to be here oh well that's that's great

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,160
thanks uh well I'm excited to talk with

104
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:55,240
you today about the work that you and

105
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:57,320
your team are doing to better understand

106
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,439
the therapeutic potential of

107
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,800
cannabinoids in athletics so I think a

108
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,399
good place to start is why don't you

109
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:06,280
tell us how you got involved in

110
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,758
researching cannaboids and Athletics

111
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:10,559
yeah for sure um so it was not a linear

112
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:12,600
path as I don't think anybody's ever

113
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,478
really is but my undergraduate degree is

114
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,439
in molecular biology and then I have a

115
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,000
master's degree and applied physiology

116
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,918
and I was always athletic and so with my

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,399
uh physiology degree we were always

118
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,918
looking at you know training principles

119
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,879
or just basically principles of

120
00:05:24,918 --> 00:05:28,519
physiology of how can you really push

121
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,839
the human body to do things that you

122
00:05:28,519 --> 00:05:32,879
want it to do essentially using

123
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:34,758
non-pharmacological agents so looking at

124
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:37,199
you know training principles or

125
00:05:34,759 --> 00:05:39,919
nutrition or even supplementation

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,600
whatever so um I worked with athletes

127
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:44,439
and I also worked clinically so I had a

128
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,280
patient population um but the the

129
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:48,279
biggest driving Factor behind it was my

130
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:50,359
husband's actually was an athlete a

131
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:52,198
professional athlete and we've been

132
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,960
together since we were 17 years old and

133
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,919
I would watch him play and I was like

134
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:58,439
man this is not going to end well if you

135
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,399
keep on you know the head contact and

136
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:02,560
the contact and the contact and so just

137
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:04,478
knowing having a background really of

138
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,439
molecular mechanisms and understanding

139
00:06:04,478 --> 00:06:08,000
what was happening all the time I

140
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,759
started to really look for ways to

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,639
reduce the neural inflammation just

142
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,879
thinking like I don't want to be feeding

143
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,560
you with a straw when we're 80 years old

144
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:16,959
so let's see what we can do there's got

145
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,560
to be things and there are a lot of

146
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:20,719
things you can do which is the

147
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,598
empowering part about understanding

148
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,800
physiology is there's a ton that you can

149
00:06:22,598 --> 00:06:29,038
do to really help support your system to

150
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:31,240
reduce those things and so um I I

151
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,839
started looking specifically so when he

152
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,639
was playing really was in the 2000s so

153
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,560
I'll date myself here but it was really

154
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,079
the height of the opioid epidemics in

155
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,038
athletics like there was a lot of

156
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:44,120
exposure of opioids and you know we we

157
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:46,879
had teammates that ended up with opioid

158
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,720
problems we buried some teammates and I

159
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:50,598
was like you know there has to be

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,720
something better than this and so in

161
00:06:50,598 --> 00:06:54,639
order to understand that I wanted to

162
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
understand the mechanisms of how opioids

163
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,280
worked and so I started to look at the

164
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,918
molecular mechanisms in the brain of how

165
00:06:58,279 --> 00:07:03,038
opioids were actually working and

166
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:04,839
physiologically like why are people how

167
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:07,079
does it kill you what is happening here

168
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:10,159
and so I came across research that

169
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:12,519
suggested that using canono you could

170
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:15,599
actually reduce the required amount of

171
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:17,240
opioids to have the same pain efficacy

172
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,759
and I was thinking like that's crazy how

173
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,160
would that even work and I didn't really

174
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:23,439
know anything about cannabis at all you

175
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,400
know I mean I was a downhill ski racer

176
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:27,439
and I I played rugby I was always like

177
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:28,799
you know an endorphin junkie and so we

178
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,719
understood cannabis from like a

179
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,120
recreational cultural standpoint I grew

180
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,759
up in Canada it's always around but I

181
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,439
didn't really understand anything about

182
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,000
the molecular mechanisms which was

183
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:39,639
shocking because I'd already finished

184
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,560
two degrees that were focusing on

185
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:45,439
molecular mechanisms and I had never

186
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,800
seen anything about the endocannabinoid

187
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:50,680
system so anyways I started looking at

188
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:52,960
that and um I kind of went down a rabbit

189
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,720
hole and I have been there for probably

190
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:57,680
the last 10 or 15 years just looking at

191
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,120
the different ways that the endoc canabo

192
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,560
system can work um really a

193
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,800
neuroinflammation but it really goes

194
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,360
everywhere throughout your whole body

195
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,360
and so it was looking at things like

196
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,120
that and and um so then I applied to you

197
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,919
know I thought okay well I I think this

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,199
I saw the mechanism that I really wanted

199
00:08:12,918 --> 00:08:16,240
to look at and it was the calcium

200
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,639
channel so just getting like super nerdy

201
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,759
here but it was the the calcium channels

202
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
in the neurons and I thought well like

203
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:25,000
who's looking at this and so I looked

204
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,360
for any supervisor anywhere that was

205
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,918
actually studying that and of course

206
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,000
after having a couple people tell you

207
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:31,120
you're totally crazy because it's like

208
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,158
hey have you ever looked at using

209
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,679
cannabis to reduce neuroinflammation and

210
00:08:33,158 --> 00:08:37,319
most people are like yeah okay next I

211
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:41,199
don't know what you're talking about but

212
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,640
my supervisor now um he he was one of

213
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
the first people he's like the only

214
00:08:42,639 --> 00:08:47,039
paper that I actually found at that time

215
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,000
that was published specifically talking

216
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,599
about um some of the cyto kindes and

217
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,278
chemokines that that happen you know

218
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,320
when you have neuroinflammation and the

219
00:08:54,278 --> 00:08:58,000
potential for maybe some things that

220
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,959
cannaboids could do to reduce those and

221
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,440
so I contacted him

222
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:02,919
um and he knew exactly what I was

223
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
talking about and so I was like so

224
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,479
thrilled and so I thought I was going to

225
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,559
have to beg him to take me on as a

226
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,519
graduate student but he said oh oh yeah

227
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,679
like I would love to have you and so um

228
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,120
I applied and so I I wanted to look at

229
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,679
concussion specifically it was

230
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,600
concussion and neuroinflammation in the

231
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:22,919
brain and um you know he was happy to do

232
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,240
that and right after that we saw the

233
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:27,159
call from the NFL I was actually outside

234
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,039
watering my first cannabis plant that I

235
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:31,278
ever grew and it was in 2021 W and it

236
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:32,879
came across my phone and I was like

237
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,838
Patrick check it out like the NFL is

238
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,039
actually putting up money to study the

239
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:39,800
thing that I just said like I I this why

240
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,360
we want to look at and so I didn't

241
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,879
really think we would apply I thought

242
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,120
that he'd be like he cool like we're not

243
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:47,360
crazy you know we're this is not some

244
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,959
you know people think that yes someone

245
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,320
else thinks this and so he would but

246
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,039
instead he was like okay yeah we're

247
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,160
gonna apply and so he went and he

248
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:57,958
gathered and he's wonderful so he

249
00:09:55,159 --> 00:09:59,838
gathered people that he had worked with

250
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,719
over the course of his career look at

251
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,760
like we're looking at so many different

252
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:07,000
metrics but um we had to put in for it

253
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,278
was an NIH adjudication to go through

254
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,958
you know all the different researchers

255
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,039
that applied for the funding and um and

256
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,759
we were selected as the group that the

257
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:17,559
NFL would fund to look at all the

258
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:20,200
different metrics um for using

259
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:23,000
cannabinoids for neuroinflammation

260
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,399
concussion pain and then opioid sparing

261
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,839
so he's my one supervisor that took me

262
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:29,078
on and then I'm actually double

263
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:32,120
supervised um my other supervisor is the

264
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:33,879
de a pharmacy so my PhD is in pharmacy

265
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:35,919
at the University of Saskatchewan so

266
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,000
those two are my supervisors and we have

267
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:40,879
a team an amazing team of people that

268
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,519
are looking at so many different metrics

269
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:45,519
of um yeah how we can use canabo to

270
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,959
potentially reduce so some of the things

271
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,399
you know so for me it's very personal I

272
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:51,119
have people in my life like we are

273
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:53,799
surrounded by athletes I grew up in

274
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:56,078
sports and you know you can only change

275
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:58,359
so many rules and redesign a helmet and

276
00:10:56,078 --> 00:10:59,879
a mouth guard so many ways but unless

277
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,959
you're actually

278
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:03,720
focusing on the molecular things inside

279
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:06,559
the skull you're missing a massive

280
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,079
opportunity to do something um that I

281
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:11,078
believe you know we need the data and

282
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:13,838
that's why we're getting it um to prove

283
00:11:11,078 --> 00:11:15,439
that what what we believe to be true is

284
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,360
actually happening in humans and we have

285
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,360
a ton of preclinical there's a ton of

286
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,320
animal models that show it but because

287
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,278
of the laws and the prohibitor you know

288
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,200
the prohibition and the inability for

289
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:31,000
researchers to put this substance in a

290
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,920
human and actually draw data which in

291
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,240
Canada now is even doubly ridiculous

292
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:36,159
because people can walk down the street

293
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:39,039
and buy it anywhere they want and it's

294
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:41,199
still actually very hard to do research

295
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,799
in Canada even though at the federal

296
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,639
level it's legal we're we've been legal

297
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:48,759
there since 2018 and so it's accessible

298
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:51,360
to anybody in our country that's over

299
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,078
the legal age but to do research was

300
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,680
actually still very difficult that's why

301
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:59,278
it's taken us so long you know that was

302
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:02,120
in 2021 and we just finished um the

303
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:04,159
first portion of the clinical trial so

304
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:06,519
it's yeah I mean I feel like there'd be

305
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:08,120
a lot more human data if the policies

306
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:09,519
would have allowed researchers to do the

307
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:12,320
research that they've been trying to do

308
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,360
for a really long time yeah no I guess I

309
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,199
didn't realize that that that Canada had

310
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:18,199
those restrictions on Research I mean

311
00:12:16,198 --> 00:12:20,479
here in the states we're familiar with

312
00:12:18,198 --> 00:12:22,240
it because cannabis it's a schedule one

313
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
drug and you know that has a lot of

314
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,959
limitations and now there's talk about

315
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,639
rescheduling uh we' prefer descheduling

316
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:30,159
but I think we'll take rescheduling just

317
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,839
because it will open up some of that

318
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,480
research but I didn't realize that

319
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,079
Canada uh had the same issues well you'd

320
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,000
think that it would be easier than it

321
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,958
really was and that was you know our

322
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,839
ability to do the clinical trial at all

323
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,439
were definitely at an advantage in

324
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,839
Canada like the fact that we were able

325
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,079
to you know we have the Cannabis

326
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:49,959
research licenses in our Labs like we're

327
00:12:47,078 --> 00:12:51,599
actually able to do it but it's you know

328
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,399
the requirements and it's it's really

329
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:56,159
probably no different than any other

330
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:59,559
like natural product research you know

331
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,078
it's just your ability to source things

332
00:12:59,559 --> 00:13:03,078
that you want to Source because you

333
00:13:01,078 --> 00:13:05,799
still have to have the stability tests

334
00:13:03,078 --> 00:13:07,439
the investigation brochures and so like

335
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:10,159
you have to find people that actually

336
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,360
have that quality and that grade of the

337
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,719
cannaboids that you want to use because

338
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,278
in order to do a clinical trial you have

339
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,560
to be sure that any of the effects that

340
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:19,120
you're seeing aren't coming from some

341
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:22,039
other reagent or something else that's

342
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,879
in the product right so it's the same as

343
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:25,559
other things it's just that the

344
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:27,838
accessibility to the product that you

345
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,638
need in order to do it and then that was

346
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,040
very restrictive too because in order to

347
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,879
go through to get a no objection letter

348
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:36,039
you have to have that on every single

349
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,519
molecule that you want to study and so

350
00:13:36,039 --> 00:13:40,919
in cannabis because it has 500 bioactive

351
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,120
molecules you would need 500 different

352
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:44,919
brochures and investigativ and talks on

353
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,560
everything and so it really kind of

354
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:49,759
handcuffs you to what you can actually

355
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:51,719
do and progress with because to get so

356
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:53,919
we had to start with a CBD isolate

357
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,320
because in order to do anything more

358
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:58,120
than that which you know most of us of

359
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
course would want to do something more

360
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,759
full spectrum or you know there's

361
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:03,799
reasons you know of course it makes

362
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:07,320
sense to do a clinical trial with just

363
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:09,039
the one so you can see what is changing

364
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,839
in association with just that one

365
00:14:09,039 --> 00:14:13,799
molecule but if you were looking for

366
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,680
better outcomes you could design it

367
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:19,958
better I think but yeah I know that's

368
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:21,399
that that's tricky like you said so many

369
00:14:19,958 --> 00:14:24,439
different compounds in the cannabis

370
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:27,839
plant um probably even many that we

371
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:30,079
haven't even uh identified yet yeah so

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,800
that makes things tricky right and and

373
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:33,919
that's the thing is you can't do a

374
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:35,639
clinical trial if you can't identify

375
00:14:33,919 --> 00:14:37,399
exactly the mechanisms of what it is

376
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:38,879
you're studying and so if you're study

377
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,679
you know but I think that that's where

378
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:43,320
there's a real place for real world

379
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:45,519
research and like you know because

380
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:47,600
really at the end of the day what is the

381
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,560
point of this research if it's not at

382
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,079
least in parallel or mirroring what

383
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:54,159
people are accessing in real life right

384
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,198
I mean there are some CBD products of

385
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,879
course that are isolates you know but if

386
00:14:56,198 --> 00:15:00,278
you were going to preferentially pick a

387
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:03,000
product it like wouldn't be an isolate

388
00:15:00,278 --> 00:15:05,159
you know if you know how canabo

389
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,639
pharmacology works you would try to

390
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:08,360
design something better but it's just

391
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,000
for the sake of a clinical trial so of

392
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,600
course you know some people are like

393
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,078
well why are you using an isolet well of

394
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,680
course it's not by choice it's because

395
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:20,679
we had to you know and then you progress

396
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:22,479
from there so um in the next couple of

397
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:25,838
steps we'll be able to hopefully add in

398
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,720
some more canabo but first to have there

399
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,880
is no data right now at all even on the

400
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,920
CBD isolate like that doesn't even exist

401
00:15:29,879 --> 00:15:33,919
in a healthy population yet so what

402
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,120
we're doing by putting it into a healthy

403
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:39,039
population is still the first time it's

404
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:41,919
ever been done we have you know the

405
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:44,039
metrics on epidex which is a CBD you

406
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,759
know but that's not a healthy athletic

407
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:48,360
population that's in a population of

408
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:50,120
epileptic children and so I think one

409
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,800
thing in cannabis research where people

410
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,919
really need to be careful is to identify

411
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:57,078
the population that whatever you're

412
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:59,120
looking at was actually studied in

413
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:01,399
because you can't take metrics from an

414
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,399
epileptic child population and think

415
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:05,600
that that equates to a healthy athletic

416
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:09,318
male population those two aren't the

417
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:11,600
same right as in same as an epileptic

418
00:16:09,318 --> 00:16:13,278
brain it it's not the same as a

419
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,759
non-epileptic brain and that's not the

420
00:16:13,278 --> 00:16:16,799
same you know so I mean we have to be

421
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:18,159
really careful at what are we looking at

422
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,120
when we're looking at these studies and

423
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,639
the studies that do exist and so in

424
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,600
athletics I think that makes it really

425
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,318
complicated because there is you know

426
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,839
there are we do have research that

427
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:31,479
exists in certain things humans not so

428
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,160
much there's lots of pre-clinical data

429
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,159
lots of animal data but we have to be

430
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:36,879
really careful in the interpretation of

431
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,679
and that was one of the points in the

432
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,879
recent publication that I put out in

433
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:41,879
sports medicine was we have to be

434
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:44,159
careful with our interpretation of

435
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:46,039
research that does exist and not to take

436
00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:49,360
that research and apply it to

437
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:52,480
populations that it wasn't actually done

438
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,159
on yeah for sure now I so I wanted to

439
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,319
kind of just circle back to the NFL

440
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:58,000
because I know that that's U um that's

441
00:16:56,318 --> 00:16:59,759
an important part of your research and

442
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,839
you know kind of getting that approval

443
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,839
from them and you know it was funny cuz

444
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:06,519
I was looking back and so our first

445
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,838
event our cam first cam at event in 2016

446
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:10,759
was at Harvard Medical School and Kyle

447
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:12,958
Turley former NFL player actually

448
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:15,400
attended and spoke there and a

449
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,720
documentary film crew followed him uh

450
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,360
for vice and so I was going back and I

451
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:22,000
was um and I was watching some of that

452
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:24,198
and there are clips of the NFL

453
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,679
commissioner talking about you know

454
00:17:24,199 --> 00:17:29,038
cannabis in the NFL and their policy

455
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:32,080
around that and his stance then was

456
00:17:29,038 --> 00:17:34,599
there's not enough evidence to um

457
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:37,678
support changing anything at that point

458
00:17:34,599 --> 00:17:40,439
so that's 2016 eight years later here we

459
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,919
are um I guess it's better late than

460
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,720
never but um speak to kind of how

461
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,799
attitudes from the major sports

462
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,519
organizations have changed when it comes

463
00:17:47,798 --> 00:17:52,359
to cannabis and do you have any thoughts

464
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:54,599
of kind of what was the Tipping Point

465
00:17:52,359 --> 00:17:57,678
yeah I do have I got a lot of thoughts

466
00:17:54,599 --> 00:17:59,319
on a lot of things but um yeah so that

467
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,480
you know by them saying that there we

468
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:04,359
don't have enough evidence to change our

469
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,120
policies that is true and they stuck

470
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:07,319
with that the NFL did and it was

471
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,719
actually the players that were

472
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:10,519
pressuring them saying okay fine like

473
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,558
you keep saying you don't have the data

474
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:14,158
get the data then like figure out how to

475
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,918
get the data because you can't just keep

476
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:18,080
saying you don't have the data you know

477
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,240
that's kind of sometimes people will say

478
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:22,359
that as it's like an excuse to just keep

479
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,759
bad policies in place it's the same as

480
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,719
people saying there's no research

481
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:27,240
there's tons of research we have tons of

482
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,960
research that is already in the

483
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:32,000
published literature you just look like

484
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,480
that it's the it's excuses or these

485
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,319
talking points right to just kind of

486
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,759
leave things status quo because it is a

487
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:39,519
very disruptive space because it's very

488
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,119
misunderstood because we have that

489
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:44,400
commercial industry too right a

490
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,959
recreational industry um but the NFL it

491
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,159
was the players that kind of pressured

492
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,079
them and again why are we so many years

493
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,039
later and we don't have the data and

494
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:55,119
that is true and I think one of the most

495
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,960
complicated things with cannabis and

496
00:18:55,119 --> 00:19:01,279
getting that data is the funding because

497
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:03,558
really clinical trials are expensive and

498
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:05,359
so the people that are going to fund

499
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:07,839
clinical trials would be the people that

500
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:10,399
ultimately somehow would have some

501
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:12,720
benefit from seeing the results right

502
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,200
one way or the other now the NFL truly

503
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,519
does want the data what they do with it

504
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,200
is up to them we're just you know we are

505
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:21,679
just here to get the data um and it'll

506
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,919
be really interesting to see what they

507
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,400
do with the data because you know you

508
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,640
still have other people that are well we

509
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,679
need more data we need more data so so

510
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,640
it's hard to say but I think that

511
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,320
ultimately right now because of the

512
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:38,679
shift in the laws of our countries the

513
00:19:35,319 --> 00:19:41,240
society is Shifting and so the policies

514
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,720
that they have in Pro Sports and even I

515
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:46,120
mean the NCAA just removed cannabis from

516
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:48,720
their prohibited list because those

517
00:19:46,119 --> 00:19:51,558
policies no longer align with Society

518
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:55,120
like Society is changing their laws and

519
00:19:51,558 --> 00:19:57,558
so in order to have fluidity amongst the

520
00:19:55,119 --> 00:20:00,759
game and the place of the game in

521
00:19:57,558 --> 00:20:03,839
society dysfunction it it was starting

522
00:20:00,759 --> 00:20:06,000
to become too much and so I think that

523
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,879
was one of the reasons why they were you

524
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,798
know they got interested in okay well

525
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:12,080
let's see maybe we can put up some

526
00:20:09,798 --> 00:20:14,119
funding and find people to get the data

527
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,879
then because you

528
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:18,199
know it's the amount of money you know

529
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,559
and yeah and there's a lot of drug

530
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,080
design for sure being done with

531
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,918
cannaboid molecules because the

532
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:25,960
scaffolding of how they work will it

533
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,799
will I mean we have data already to show

534
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:30,759
in animal models that there there is a

535
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:33,558
ton of effect there in neuroinflammation

536
00:20:30,759 --> 00:20:35,038
neurod degeneration you know we know

537
00:20:33,558 --> 00:20:37,798
that they are active there those

538
00:20:35,038 --> 00:20:40,558
molecules are active there we know that

539
00:20:37,798 --> 00:20:42,599
we now drug design has some complicated

540
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:44,359
things like you know bioavailability you

541
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:46,199
have to have reproducible dose you have

542
00:20:44,359 --> 00:20:48,879
to have reprod you know and then the

543
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:50,640
canono system itself is very complicated

544
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,919
and so that's a whole different thing

545
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,559
but when you look at funding the

546
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:57,000
clinical trial it's who would put money

547
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,200
into that because with a product that's

548
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:01,200
available to everybody right now with no

549
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,360
prescription needed and it will continue

550
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,279
to be like that industry is not going

551
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:08,399
away so whose benefit is it to put the

552
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:10,278
money up to do the research and even in

553
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
the commercial industry they don't

554
00:21:10,278 --> 00:21:15,079
actually need any data whatsoever to

555
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,079
shelf a product they don't need to show

556
00:21:15,079 --> 00:21:19,240
pharmacokinetic data they don't need to

557
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:21,199
show bioavailability they don't need to

558
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:23,200
show anything they can package a product

559
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,798
and sell it as long as they're following

560
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,200
the Food and Drug compliance but it's

561
00:21:25,798 --> 00:21:30,038
not an FDA approved thing so like

562
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,720
there's no incentive for them to fund it

563
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,319
because they actually don't need it they

564
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,960
can make an edible product and just put

565
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:38,918
it on the shelf and so It's tricky to

566
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,400
find anybody that it would even would be

567
00:21:38,919 --> 00:21:43,559
interested in doing it so I think the

568
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,880
NFL like I applaud them really for doing

569
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:48,119
it because it shows that their minds are

570
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:50,120
at least Progressive and they're not you

571
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,759
know for a long time the conversation

572
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:54,719
about cannabis as a medicine just had

573
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:56,720
the brakes on like nobody wanted to talk

574
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,278
about it or try to understand it you

575
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:02,440
know and it's no different than any

576
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:03,960
pharmacological agent it it is bioactive

577
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:06,320
and it should be treated that way it's

578
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:08,038
just that in society we've chosen to

579
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:09,639
make it available to everybody and

580
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:11,359
that's a different conversation but it

581
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:13,600
is a plant and perhaps should never have

582
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:16,038
been prohibited in the first place right

583
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:18,079
right so why we are in this place right

584
00:22:16,038 --> 00:22:20,359
now is a different conversation but it's

585
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:22,599
like how do we get out of it and so I

586
00:22:20,359 --> 00:22:25,278
applaud the NFL for wanting to actually

587
00:22:22,599 --> 00:22:27,678
see the data and putting up you know the

588
00:22:25,278 --> 00:22:32,319
call for research because it is not an

589
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,880
easy space to get funding for sure yeah

590
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,079
yeah so how do we get out of it so it

591
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,400
seems like at least the first step is

592
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,319
the uh the publication that you

593
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,640
mentioned earlier um and the title is

594
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,119
cannaboid therapy and Athletics a review

595
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:48,038
of current Canabis Research to evaluate

596
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:52,839
potential real world cannaboid

597
00:22:48,038 --> 00:22:54,278
applications in sport so um i' I've

598
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:55,959
looked through the paper and there's

599
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,200
there's a lot in there about a lot of

600
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:59,240
different uses for canabo and Athletics

601
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,679
so

602
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,038
I guess in your opinion or in your

603
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:04,519
research what are some of the most

604
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:07,960
common or most promising applications of

605
00:23:04,519 --> 00:23:10,038
of cannaboids in athletics well for me

606
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,120
personally like where I think they can

607
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:13,640
make the best difference or the biggest

608
00:23:12,119 --> 00:23:16,239
difference for me for sure is in

609
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,440
neuroinflammation like I think right now

610
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,679
and and I might be biased because that's

611
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:23,798
what drew me to be interested in it in

612
00:23:20,679 --> 00:23:25,000
the first place but I think right now I

613
00:23:23,798 --> 00:23:26,639
mean there's there's a difference I

614
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,240
guess for where I think it should go and

615
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,360
where it is being used as athletes those

616
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,480
are things like athletes currently right

617
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:36,278
now in my experience another part I'm um

618
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,640
Gathering data to research athletes

619
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:39,200
themselves like by talking to them and

620
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,520
interviewing them and also their medical

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
training staff and so I have some

622
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,400
Publications coming out on that but

623
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,960
athletes themselves have are using it

624
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:53,720
for primarily uh pain inflammation sleep

625
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,960
and somewhat anxiety you know mental

626
00:23:53,720 --> 00:24:00,079
health things now where do I think for

627
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:02,079
sure those places will be beneficial but

628
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:04,759
the one place where I think it could be

629
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:06,158
very applicable is in neuroinflammation

630
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,759
in the brain and concussion and there's

631
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,640
a few reasons for that molecularly it it

632
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:13,400
makes a ton of sense why we could

633
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,480
actually use these molecules to invoke

634
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:17,400
the same Downstream effects as we would

635
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:20,360
have by our naturally secreted endoc

636
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:22,600
canabo but secondly we don't currently

637
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:25,038
have any pharmacological agent that does

638
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:26,599
anything for concussion or TBI it is a

639
00:24:25,038 --> 00:24:29,720
space where we're just sitting there

640
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:31,599
like there isn't any that anybody can do

641
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,919
to help somebody right now other than

642
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:35,359
you know Physical Therapy occupational

643
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,600
therapy those types of things like

644
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:38,879
vestibular training you know balance and

645
00:24:37,599 --> 00:24:40,599
those things but as far as a

646
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,679
pharmacological agent goes there isn't

647
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:45,959
one and so for me it's like why wouldn't

648
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,720
you want to investigate this when it

649
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:51,558
could and we know statistically like con

650
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,679
you know contact sport athletes they die

651
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:55,200
from neurodegenerative disorders at a

652
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,240
three times greater rate than the

653
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,038
population that doesn't play contact

654
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,359
Sports so we know that there's something

655
00:24:59,038 --> 00:25:04,038
happening there with neuro degeneration

656
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:06,678
and contact for the mechanisms of that

657
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:08,158
you know of course biology is a network

658
00:25:06,679 --> 00:25:10,159
it's never linear so there's a lot of

659
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,520
things going on there but we know from

660
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:13,320
the statistics when you look at the

661
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,639
neurod degeneration that absolutely they

662
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:19,119
have a higher rate of it so for me the

663
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,480
focus to focus on something like that

664
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,038
which is your brain it just makes a lot

665
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,360
of sense because if you could and so the

666
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:27,640
metrics that we're looking at in our

667
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,398
clinical trial we are looking at you

668
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,720
know cerebral vascular changes in your

669
00:25:29,398 --> 00:25:32,079
brain like how does the blood flow

670
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,558
actually change in your brain using

671
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,519
cannaboids we're looking at the

672
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:37,359
oxygenation concentration so how does

673
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:40,158
the oxygen concentration changed in your

674
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:43,639
brain when you're using canabo because

675
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,399
it comes down to really the question of

676
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:47,240
you if you can reduce that neural

677
00:25:45,398 --> 00:25:50,439
inflammation you can reduce the

678
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,679
secondary effects of that Cascade and

679
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:55,519
domino effect that ultimately leads to

680
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,600
neurodegenerative disorders um which is

681
00:25:55,519 --> 00:25:58,798
starting at you know the secondary

682
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,959
effects of what happen Happ s when you

683
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,798
smash your head together or you know

684
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,640
what whatever and then I do think also

685
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,798
there's some things with the peripheral

686
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,278
you know peripheral inflammation also I

687
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,519
believe plays a role in it because you

688
00:26:08,278 --> 00:26:12,240
have so many circulating

689
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:14,000
pro-inflammatory signaling molecules

690
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,159
that everything and really that's what

691
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,880
inflammation is Right inflammation is

692
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,520
everybody thinks of it as a thing it's

693
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:23,679
not a thing it's a process inflammation

694
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:26,319
is a process of signaling molecules that

695
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:28,038
are calling in your immune system to

696
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,278
Signal them to either you know come in

697
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:31,798
we have a problem we got to fix this now

698
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:33,359
we got to clean it up now we have to

699
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,480
reduce now we have to shut off and now

700
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:38,240
we're back to homeostasis that's when

701
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,759
inflammation is working correctly and

702
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,640
and it should work correctly your body

703
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:43,798
is designed to do that inflammation only

704
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:46,159
really is a problem when it doesn't shut

705
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,599
itself off or when it's you know it's

706
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,200
chronic and that's what happens I think

707
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:52,759
in the brain if you can't shut off that

708
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:55,200
inflammation in your brain and it

709
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:57,079
continues to be inflamed then you end up

710
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,558
with neurodegenerative disorders a long

711
00:26:57,079 --> 00:27:01,240
time down the road so if we had the

712
00:26:58,558 --> 00:27:03,480
opportunity to use these molecules as

713
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,319
pharmacological agents to get in there

714
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:07,000
and reduce that neuroinflammation at

715
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:09,960
that time I think it would be such an

716
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:12,200
advantage to athletes particularly but

717
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,079
also military and then also it just

718
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,200
ripples out into like the Aging

719
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:18,278
population and then all of these

720
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,759
neurodegenerative disorders because it's

721
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:23,440
all stemming from the same thing right

722
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,679
like there's a setup in your brain and

723
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,600
all these cascading things they're just

724
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:30,798
different flavors of the same

725
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:32,759
kind of right like it's all on the same

726
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:34,879
mechanisms it's just different portions

727
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:37,398
are being broken for lack of a better

728
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,840
word yeah all right so yeah let's dig

729
00:27:37,398 --> 00:27:43,759
into that a little bit so how I mean how

730
00:27:40,839 --> 00:27:45,439
ideally would canono be used for

731
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:47,519
neuroprotection is it sort of like a

732
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,320
preventive thing that would be taken for

733
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:53,359
anyone who's kind of participating in

734
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:55,558
these types of sports or is it sort of

735
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,639
okay I've had a head injury now I need

736
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:58,720
to take canono to like you said cool

737
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:01,360
that inflam

738
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,919
how does that work yeah so that is the

739
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:05,759
million dooll question and um there

740
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,799
there has been research done to look at

741
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,319
that and really the the short answer is

742
00:28:07,798 --> 00:28:12,879
both I mean you can so when you look at

743
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:14,759
neuroinflammation in the brain you have

744
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,159
to first look at your endocannabinoid

745
00:28:14,759 --> 00:28:20,839
system which is why and how cannabinoids

746
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:25,440
work in your body at all so your endoc

747
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:28,158
canabo system is um when you get conked

748
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,679
in the head you secrete endoc canabo

749
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,000
yourself like plant aside this isn't

750
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,240
even talking about cannabis but like you

751
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:36,200
secrete endoc canabo and so when there

752
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,839
is an injury a neural injury your body

753
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:40,759
will secrete those endoc canabo to go

754
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:42,759
and hit receptors to essentially break

755
00:28:40,759 --> 00:28:47,679
the circuit of inflammation and calm it

756
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:49,679
down and so in concussion if you at the

757
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:51,640
time of an acute injury one approach

758
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,559
would be okay well you could take

759
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,840
canavan oids right there and there are

760
00:28:53,558 --> 00:28:58,798
some places like I think the Israeli

761
00:28:55,839 --> 00:29:00,278
military I read uses it on impact if

762
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,720
they get injured they actually have a

763
00:29:00,278 --> 00:29:06,960
nasal spray of a THC CBD that they they

764
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,759
nasally inhale because at that time you

765
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,960
can hit the CB1 receptor which

766
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:13,960
essentially shuts those calcium channels

767
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:16,440
and it'll reduce the amount of exy Talk

768
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,440
Like excitatory neurotransmitter which

769
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:20,440
is glutamate if you hit that CB1

770
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:22,320
receptor you can actually reduce that

771
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:26,080
outof control secretion that we know

772
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:28,319
happens in concussion so if you take THC

773
00:29:26,079 --> 00:29:30,480
which is stereochemically basically

774
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:32,839
identical to anandamide which is what

775
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,200
you secrete yourself if you can't

776
00:29:32,839 --> 00:29:37,599
provide enough anandamide yourself like

777
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,120
you can't keep up with the amount of

778
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:42,319
excitatory neurotoxin that's being fired

779
00:29:40,119 --> 00:29:44,199
by your neuron if you can't put out the

780
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:46,879
fire yourself you can bring in an

781
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,720
exogenous molecule such as THC to hit

782
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,799
that same receptor and it would actually

783
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,000
cause the same Downstream results for

784
00:29:50,798 --> 00:29:56,839
all intents and purposes and it itself

785
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:59,359
will reduce that firing of the

786
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,199
excitatory neurot transmitter so that

787
00:29:59,359 --> 00:30:03,959
would be on impact but CBD does

788
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,159
something completely different and it's

789
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,679
like it's very promiscuous and you have

790
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:09,679
to remember that every molecule in

791
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,559
cannabis functions differently than the

792
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
next like they don't all hit the same

793
00:30:11,558 --> 00:30:15,158
receptors which is why it's so

794
00:30:13,359 --> 00:30:17,678
fascinating to study but also we could

795
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:19,559
be here for another 300 years like

796
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,480
studying it to figure out what's doing

797
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:22,879
what

798
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:25,480
but there's certain approaches of

799
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,080
thinking of taking CBD you know

800
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:31,440
prophylactically to maintain because CBD

801
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:33,879
does some things basically for your own

802
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,080
endocan avonoid system where it helps

803
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,440
you

804
00:30:35,079 --> 00:30:40,398
maintain um healthy and Hearty endoc

805
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,120
canabo system where you would it would

806
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:46,278
help support your ability to secrete and

807
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:48,038
use your own anandamide and 2 a so

808
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:50,119
there's a lot of receptors I won't go

809
00:30:48,038 --> 00:30:52,599
into all of them but one of the big ones

810
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:54,359
really CBD does is it inhibits the F

811
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:56,480
enzyme which is the enzyme that breaks

812
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,439
down your own anandamide which is the

813
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,519
thing that hits that CB1 recept

814
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,880
so there are some thoughts that taking

815
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:06,000
CBD um prophylactically you know on a

816
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,320
consistent basis will allow your own

817
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,319
endoc

818
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:14,000
canabidol canabo at the time that the

819
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,398
injury is going to happen and in sports

820
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,880
you can pretty much Bank on the fact

821
00:31:15,398 --> 00:31:18,638
that you're going to get slammed like in

822
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:20,880
contact Sports you know the hit's coming

823
00:31:18,638 --> 00:31:23,199
it's not an if it's when like and it's

824
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,000
you know small hits big hits whatever to

825
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,840
your body to your brain you know that

826
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,638
those pro-inflammatory cyto kindes are

827
00:31:26,839 --> 00:31:30,199
going to start firing and the reactive

828
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:32,638
oxygen species you know that that's

829
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:35,240
coming and so the approach should be to

830
00:31:32,638 --> 00:31:37,479
do everything that you can to give your

831
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:40,960
body the ability to reduce it when it

832
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:42,599
does happen and so using cannaboids um

833
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,798
and also you have to remember in sports

834
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:49,158
too THC is cognitively impairing and so

835
00:31:45,798 --> 00:31:50,798
you have to be careful with how things

836
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:52,600
affect your decision-making or your

837
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:55,278
reaction time or things like that right

838
00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:57,519
whereas CBD is not cognitively impairing

839
00:31:55,278 --> 00:32:00,720
and so you can take it and it wouldn't

840
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,798
affect you're outputed as an athlete so

841
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,200
um there's two schools of thought there

842
00:32:02,798 --> 00:32:06,839
but personally for me I think and and

843
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,519
again that's why a lot of the research

844
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,759
that does exist you have to be very

845
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,558
careful because the devil's in the

846
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:14,919
details like there are some studies that

847
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:18,038
were looking at CBD and how effective

848
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,559
CBD was at reducing inflammation but

849
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:25,798
they only looked at it for you know for

850
00:32:21,558 --> 00:32:26,879
three hours post inflammation so I think

851
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:28,638
they were doing they were doing a

852
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
workout protocol I think and so they

853
00:32:28,638 --> 00:32:32,158
looked at it and you know it didn't do

854
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:33,918
much well in my opinion I think the

855
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,559
prophylactic approach is going to be

856
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,840
better because I think if you're taking

857
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:39,599
it leading up to whatever you're doing

858
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:42,119
and that has been shown in the research

859
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:45,558
that yes having it on board before does

860
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:48,398
seem to help when the impact does happen

861
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,558
or the inflammation does happen but CBD

862
00:32:48,398 --> 00:32:53,359
seems to work better when there is

863
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:55,319
inflammation in play already so if your

864
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,879
cells aren't already in the process of

865
00:32:55,319 --> 00:33:00,638
inflammation CBD is you know it doesn't

866
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,320
really have a lot of activity but for

867
00:33:00,638 --> 00:33:04,678
inflammation I mean but when things are

868
00:33:02,319 --> 00:33:06,480
inflaming you upregulate a lot of your

869
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:08,399
endocannabinoid receptors which means

870
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,798
the concentration of available receptors

871
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:14,719
to hit has increased so now CBD has

872
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:16,480
something to work on right so it's again

873
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,319
you have to look really at what was the

874
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,159
population and what was going on at at

875
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:24,158
what we were studying or what was that

876
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:26,159
research done on and then H so and then

877
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,720
you can't really apply what was found in

878
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,399
that to a different situ a so for me I

879
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,480
think for athletes taking it I think

880
00:33:31,398 --> 00:33:35,439
take it before and then if you did have

881
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,319
a a head contact then there would be a

882
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,558
place for sure to take it immediately

883
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,439
after that's only in my opinion that

884
00:33:39,558 --> 00:33:42,839
hasn't been proven out anywhere because

885
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,840
we can't you know we haven't done it in

886
00:33:42,839 --> 00:33:48,000
humans yet but we do have anomal models

887
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,798
we have mice models you know looking at

888
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,720
what happens in their brain when we honk

889
00:33:50,798 --> 00:33:56,359
them in the head and and they they have

890
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:58,278
a massive secretion of 2 Ag and

891
00:33:56,359 --> 00:34:00,398
anandamide which are your natural

892
00:33:58,278 --> 00:34:03,359
endocannabinoids and they also have a

893
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:05,038
big op regulation in the CB2 receptors

894
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:07,839
um which are the receptors that are on

895
00:34:05,038 --> 00:34:09,960
the microa which are the immune cells in

896
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,078
your brain and so in that experiment

897
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,800
with the mice if you gave them an

898
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:18,000
exogenous source of 2ag the inflammation

899
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,800
reduced quickly and you could save the

900
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,918
neurons and you could save the tissue

901
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:25,399
and it recovered and so in theory you

902
00:34:22,918 --> 00:34:27,118
know mice aren't humans but in theory

903
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,519
that would be what you would be looking

904
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,399
at now again to make it pH phag grade

905
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,358
you'd have to have you know a pharmag

906
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:35,440
grade product to do that but in my

907
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:36,960
opinion we we have a product that does

908
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:39,760
it right now you know we know the

909
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:43,159
cannabis plant can do it in some degree

910
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,280
so it it's just like we don't have

911
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,639
anything so why if you know you have

912
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:49,519
something that might have a benefit why

913
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:51,878
wouldn't you try it rather than sit

914
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:54,320
there and do nothing and let the

915
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:56,358
inflammation just Cascade out of control

916
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,599
because if you do it correctly we know

917
00:34:56,358 --> 00:35:02,519
that CBD has a really High safety um

918
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,079
safety profile it's very safe CBD is as

919
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:05,759
long as it's made in the right way

920
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,519
because these days these days you have

921
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,040
to be careful where you're sourcing it

922
00:35:07,519 --> 00:35:12,320
but you know if if you get good quality

923
00:35:10,039 --> 00:35:14,920
CBD we know that it's safe

924
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,800
so I just think you know why wouldn't

925
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,720
you try it right no and I mean that's

926
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,519
it's a common refrain when we talk about

927
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:25,759
sort of cannabis as a medicine is

928
00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:29,519
there's a lot of upside and not a whole

929
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,440
lot of downside um why not try um yeah

930
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,559
and so and so you mentioned that you

931
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:38,358
know perhaps the Israeli military is

932
00:35:33,559 --> 00:35:40,759
sort of using a nasal spray um for um

933
00:35:38,358 --> 00:35:43,759
for treating head injury to your

934
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:46,960
knowledge are any sports teams or

935
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:48,960
Athletics are do they use CBD do they

936
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,159
kind of have it as a protocol are they

937
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,559
experimenting with it no well well again

938
00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:58,598
loaded questions so Protocol no and so

939
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:02,440
really when it comes down down

940
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,519
to experimenting with it yeah athletes

941
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,838
yes because I think that athletes

942
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:09,559
themselves do anecdotally or from each

943
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,559
other they have heard and they have

944
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:13,440
learned but that's a separate thing from

945
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:16,559
then looking at league and League

946
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,159
policies and so a lot of leagues even in

947
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:21,679
Canada like I mean in 2018 cannabis

948
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:23,440
became federally legal so now okay if

949
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,239
you're an adult you can use it the same

950
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:27,720
way you use beer like this is not an

951
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:30,479
illegal substance and so in use for

952
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:33,399
which is the equivalent of the NCAA in

953
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:35,280
2020 it was actually stated that like we

954
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,480
will no longer test athletes for

955
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:40,760
cannabis anymore it's just it's not a

956
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:43,318
thing right but then the progress isn't

957
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,520
made to then all right now are you going

958
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,519
to develop Protocols are you going to

959
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:49,719
teach your medical training staff how to

960
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:51,119
use this or how to inform the athletes

961
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:52,799
how to use it properly and that's the

962
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,800
portion of my PhD that I'm working on

963
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,720
right now is really informing the

964
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,920
medical staff because so what I was

965
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:01,279
gathering was data to see like how much

966
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:03,559
do they even know about cannabis or or

967
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,800
what do they think about cannabis right

968
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:08,039
and so you know in Canada we had an

969
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,400
opportunity because we made it legal

970
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,800
five over five years ago to really

971
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,720
create teaching opportunities for

972
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:17,240
medical professionals and this isn't

973
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:20,159
even just for athletics it's for all

974
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:22,759
medical professionals there is still a

975
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,838
massive lack of Education in our doctors

976
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,960
and when we asked our doctors when we

977
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:30,078
gathered statistics just from a general

978
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,720
population standpoint are doctors okay

979
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:36,079
how many of you have had a patient come

980
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:38,679
to you and ask you for advice or maybe

981
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,440
some sort of guidance to use cannabis as

982
00:37:38,679 --> 00:37:43,039
a medication or you know authorization

983
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,119
to use cannabis instead of something

984
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:46,519
else how many of you guys have had that

985
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,599
because we wanted to know like is this

986
00:37:46,519 --> 00:37:52,000
common 92% of them have had a patient

987
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,960
come and ask them that's like almost

988
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,000
100% okay so then we looked at well what

989
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:00,159
are the barriers to like proper care

990
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,239
well only 6% of them had ever had any

991
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:04,838
kind of education on using cannabis or

992
00:38:02,239 --> 00:38:07,479
canid molecules so the barrier is

993
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:10,239
obvious it's that it the educa they are

994
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:13,519
not taught so they don't have confidence

995
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:15,039
to provide any kind of guidance um but

996
00:38:13,519 --> 00:38:17,759
that creates a problem right because the

997
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:19,719
product is available there so now you

998
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,560
know rather than using a medical

999
00:38:19,719 --> 00:38:23,399
professional to maybe help you guide

1000
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:25,119
them they're just going straight to the

1001
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:26,680
bud tenders so because they don't need a

1002
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,720
doctor so what you've done now is you've

1003
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:31,358
actually taken the patient out of the

1004
00:38:28,719 --> 00:38:34,279
healthare system rather than keeping

1005
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:36,440
them in the Health Care System right and

1006
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,119
it's a it's a pharmacologically active

1007
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,639
agent like if anything you should want

1008
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,039
to have somebody there to guide you but

1009
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:43,719
then you have to remember our doctors

1010
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:45,639
are very busy we don't have enough

1011
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,480
doctors they have like three minutes

1012
00:38:45,639 --> 00:38:50,639
with every patient so like they don't

1013
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:53,358
have a lot of time and cannaboid as a

1014
00:38:50,639 --> 00:38:55,239
therapeutic it takes an interaction with

1015
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,920
your patient you have to spend time with

1016
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:59,239
them and the patient has to be willing

1017
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,639
to toy with the levels that they're

1018
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:05,039
taking in the amounts because everybody

1019
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:06,799
has a different optimal dose and so I

1020
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:09,440
personally think that we could have an

1021
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:11,359
entire undergrad degree just teaching

1022
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,559
people how you know the endocan aoid

1023
00:39:11,358 --> 00:39:14,559
system and how to use it as a

1024
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:17,719
therapeutic and I hope one day that we

1025
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,559
can do that um because the doctors

1026
00:39:17,719 --> 00:39:21,480
they're too busy like that I think we're

1027
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:23,440
aiming at the wrong people there and so

1028
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,920
in athletics when I went and was

1029
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,200
interviewing medical staff they they're

1030
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,440
busy same thing but now you have a

1031
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:33,439
different population because your job is

1032
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,079
to keep these athletes which are million

1033
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:37,920
dooll athletes safe and so if your

1034
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:39,880
million-dollar athletes are interested

1035
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:42,800
in this substance and they're able to

1036
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:46,000
access it and you don't have any kind of

1037
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,119
rules against it which the NFL still has

1038
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:51,159
rules at C just in preseason I think and

1039
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:52,960
then but it's like if they can access it

1040
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:54,838
then your responsibility as a healthc

1041
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,880
care provider is to be able to provide

1042
00:39:54,838 --> 00:39:59,679
them with information and guidance about

1043
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,680
it it's not okay to just be like uh

1044
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:02,879
pretend you know like look the other way

1045
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:05,039
and pretend we don't know what's

1046
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:09,079
happening which is pretty much what's

1047
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:12,279
going on like but everybody is scared of

1048
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,760
the hierarchy and of who sets the rules

1049
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,880
and who you answer to including the

1050
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,040
athletes they don't necessarily want to

1051
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,519
talk to somebody in their team about it

1052
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:22,599
because they're worried that they're

1053
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:24,239
going to get in trouble and then the

1054
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:25,880
medical staff are worried that they're

1055
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:28,039
going to get in trouble if they were

1056
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:31,000
giving them sort sort of guidance on it

1057
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:33,800
and so the NCAA removing it as a

1058
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,599
prohibited substance has created a space

1059
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,519
in my opinion well okay then if you're

1060
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,318
going to remove it then you have to

1061
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:42,199
teach them how to use it responsibly the

1062
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,159
same way that you did with alcohol you

1063
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:47,598
know the the this whole punishment model

1064
00:40:45,159 --> 00:40:50,559
that's ridiculous the abstinence thing

1065
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:53,119
doesn't work all the athletes say that

1066
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,480
it it's offensive to the medical staff

1067
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,400
when they're learning this message where

1068
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,000
it does not align with what we see in

1069
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,838
society and so athletes and a lot of

1070
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,079
them are actually gravitating towards

1071
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:04,759
cannabis um for different reasons you

1072
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:06,720
know they're choosing it over other

1073
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,160
things for different reasons for example

1074
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,559
alcohol alcohol you know there's a next

1075
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,759
day effect in athletics that takes up

1076
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,159
time they they're dehydrated they're

1077
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,800
hung over they can't train they lose a

1078
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:21,399
day when they spent Saturday night

1079
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,960
drinking 16 beer if they spent Saturday

1080
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:25,000
night they ate a gummy just is just

1081
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,838
totally recreationally well the next day

1082
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,119
they they probably sat at home ate

1083
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:30,440
something went to bed and then the next

1084
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,280
day they can train they're not

1085
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,240
dehydrated they're probably have their

1086
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,720
inflammation reduced and they can carry

1087
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:39,919
on and so the dysfunction now that we

1088
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:42,318
see is like the regulations aren't

1089
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,358
lining up with reality and so it's to

1090
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:47,480
find a way to correctly and put in place

1091
00:41:45,358 --> 00:41:50,000
the policies that align with these

1092
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,400
things because if you don't you're

1093
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,039
fractioning the trust of your athletes

1094
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,519
towards their team and you're

1095
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,960
fractioning you know the trust that they

1096
00:41:56,519 --> 00:42:00,639
have that you're able ble to actually

1097
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,079
care for them in all capacities because

1098
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:03,759
if you can't answer their questions

1099
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:05,400
about this one thing they're just going

1100
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,920
to bolt and go find their information

1101
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:10,318
somewhere else and you don't want that

1102
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,358
right no and I would think in an an

1103
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:15,199
athlete population too um these are

1104
00:42:13,358 --> 00:42:17,358
people who are very hyperaware of their

1105
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:19,118
bodies and how they perform and they're

1106
00:42:17,358 --> 00:42:20,519
always trying to get an edge that's why

1107
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:23,640
you have people jumping into cold

1108
00:42:20,519 --> 00:42:25,239
plunges and having different diets and

1109
00:42:23,639 --> 00:42:28,639
things like that I would think that you

1110
00:42:25,239 --> 00:42:30,838
know uh canabo as a way to reduce your

1111
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:32,679
inflammation or maybe you know reduce

1112
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:34,558
your anxiety so that you can perform

1113
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:36,239
better like I would imagine a lot of

1114
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,720
athletes are are very interested in that

1115
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:39,838
and are experimenting with it yes and

1116
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:41,838
that's the thing is they are

1117
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,159
experimenting with it they are training

1118
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:45,960
with it and they have found results and

1119
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,639
so these guys you know and they learn

1120
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:49,318
from each other so if one they're like

1121
00:42:47,639 --> 00:42:51,078
ants like if one guy has a good

1122
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,558
experience they'll tell the next guy the

1123
00:42:51,079 --> 00:42:53,640
next guy you know before you know it

1124
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:56,280
then they're all trying it but they're

1125
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:58,719
not wrong there are things like it does

1126
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,800
legitimately molecular mechanisms that

1127
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,199
do reduce inflammation and so that can

1128
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:07,119
help you recover we have to prove that

1129
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:09,318
out in humans but in theory so if

1130
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,240
they're feeling that you can't tell them

1131
00:43:09,318 --> 00:43:12,880
that what they're feeling is incorrect

1132
00:43:11,239 --> 00:43:14,558
if if they're feeling you know if it

1133
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,440
does reduce their inflammation and stuff

1134
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,599
and so that's where the dysfunction is

1135
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:20,400
between research and the real world and

1136
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:22,400
I think cannabis is one of the places

1137
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,200
where I mean I can't even think of

1138
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,760
another one where research is further

1139
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:28,879
from Real World I mean the real world

1140
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,960
they're doing stuff like I mean athletes

1141
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:32,358
because I work with athletes they'll try

1142
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,838
exactly like you said I mean they want

1143
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:37,000
an advantage and they want ways to you

1144
00:43:34,838 --> 00:43:39,639
know Advantage their body because their

1145
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,480
body is their most important tool it is

1146
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:43,279
their most valuable tool is their body

1147
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,159
and they're very intentional about what

1148
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,640
they put inside it they're not messing

1149
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:48,318
around with things that they think are

1150
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:49,519
going to hurt them so if they try

1151
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,679
something once and they're like yeah I

1152
00:43:49,519 --> 00:43:52,679
didn't feel good they're not going to do

1153
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:55,598
it again but if they try something and

1154
00:43:52,679 --> 00:43:58,199
they're like okay w i you know whatever

1155
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:01,000
hurt before doesn't hurt anymore or I

1156
00:43:58,199 --> 00:44:02,639
was able to recover faster you know but

1157
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,639
then they're at a loss for you know

1158
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,318
they're going on Google or whatever to

1159
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:08,078
get their information there's no place

1160
00:44:06,318 --> 00:44:11,079
for them to find they don't know how to

1161
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,640
find good information and then the

1162
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:15,440
question is like well would they even

1163
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,358
ask their team anyways and then if they

1164
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,679
did ask their team what could the team

1165
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:23,480
even offer them as far as answers go and

1166
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:25,759
currently not much like it's and now the

1167
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,280
NCAA is in the exact same spot because

1168
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:29,000
they've removed it as a prohibited

1169
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,920
substance which I applaud them for doing

1170
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,440
that because it it didn't make any sense

1171
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,599
to have it prohibited anymore um because

1172
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,000
there are valid places where athletes

1173
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:39,838
should be able to use cannaboids and and

1174
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,760
one place that comes to mind because it

1175
00:44:39,838 --> 00:44:44,039
came up a lot was female athletes and

1176
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,760
they use it for once a month they are

1177
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,239
doubled over in pain with menstrual

1178
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:52,359
cramps and canono work amazingly for

1179
00:44:48,239 --> 00:44:54,639
reducing because menstrual pain is both

1180
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:56,639
neurological and it's no receptive so

1181
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:59,440
you have neurons firing and you have

1182
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:01,519
tissue inflaming and canono can get at

1183
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,760
both of those to reduce them and it does

1184
00:45:01,519 --> 00:45:05,559
work really well in female athletes and

1185
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:09,720
so you had female athletes that would

1186
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:12,040
prefer to use that instead of an nsid or

1187
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:13,358
any other type of drug but if they did

1188
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:15,558
they were at risk of losing their

1189
00:45:13,358 --> 00:45:16,920
scholarship and that was wrong in my

1190
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:19,240
opinion like they shouldn't have to

1191
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,358
worry about that and then have to take

1192
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:24,118
whatever prescription or other drug that

1193
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:26,719
you say is good when they would prefer

1194
00:45:24,119 --> 00:45:28,800
to use something else so the autonomy

1195
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:31,078
over their own choices I think is also

1196
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,160
making it you know I think athletes are

1197
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,720
voicing that more now than they did

1198
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:40,519
before so I I definitely think um yeah I

1199
00:45:37,719 --> 00:45:41,879
think the athletes for sure are you know

1200
00:45:40,519 --> 00:45:43,920
they're trying different things as they

1201
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:45,440
always do that's not new a lot of times

1202
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,960
athletes like we call it bro science

1203
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,838
right like Bro Science is always about

1204
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,400
10 years ahead of actual science and

1205
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:53,239
half the time they're right and half the

1206
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,838
time they like harm themselves but I

1207
00:45:53,239 --> 00:45:57,078
mean a lot of the times they come out

1208
00:45:54,838 --> 00:45:58,239
with like these guys just do it because

1209
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,720
they're like okay well I'm just going to

1210
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:02,279
try it and then like then science

1211
00:46:00,719 --> 00:46:06,039
catches up right but Bro Science there's

1212
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:08,480
something to that like it's you know so

1213
00:46:06,039 --> 00:46:10,880
yeah no and it's funny you see it in in

1214
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,358
C cannabis cultivation too where you

1215
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,760
know the Growers they're not trained

1216
00:46:12,358 --> 00:46:16,719
scientists or or whatever but they they

1217
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:18,960
know it works and they've been using it

1218
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:20,919
for a long time and only now the

1219
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:22,400
researchers are coming along and

1220
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,838
understanding like okay well this is the

1221
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:26,960
mechanism and that's why that works

1222
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:28,679
exactly and I think that cannabis

1223
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,199
honestly like I laugh all the time

1224
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:33,279
because it's it's backward it's been

1225
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:35,719
backwards since the beginning of time

1226
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,599
like what other substance like you know

1227
00:46:35,719 --> 00:46:41,318
mulam wanted to know why people were

1228
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:44,200
getting high and so in 64 like he

1229
00:46:41,318 --> 00:46:47,119
isolated like the THC molecule but it's

1230
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:48,719
like we went completely backwards as far

1231
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:51,000
as like usually in Pharmaceuticals

1232
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:53,318
you're looking for an agent to cause an

1233
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,719
effect and in this place we already had

1234
00:46:53,318 --> 00:46:56,639
the effect and we were trying to look

1235
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:59,480
for the agent like it's backwards and

1236
00:46:56,639 --> 00:47:01,400
then we had no idea how it worked and

1237
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,358
then we discovered this enormous endoc

1238
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,119
canabo system because we discovered this

1239
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:06,639
molecule in a plant like normally you

1240
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:08,079
know what system you're working in and

1241
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,480
you're looking for like it's completely

1242
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,559
backwards so we discovered like isolated

1243
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,960
the molecule and then happened to

1244
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,800
discover the biggest neurophysiological

1245
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,559
receptor system in your body because we

1246
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,839
were looking at what like it's just it

1247
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:23,760
was completely backwards and so I think

1248
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:26,199
you know I laugh because it's like

1249
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:29,800
almost everything is backwards in it in

1250
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:31,960
cannabis like it's it's yeah but I mean

1251
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:34,119
I I think it's an opportunity really for

1252
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,720
people to learn so many things about so

1253
00:47:34,119 --> 00:47:39,079
many things by studying it yeah so I

1254
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:41,838
mean instead of going backwards let's

1255
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:44,039
look forward so what new studies are are

1256
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:45,759
you working on or are you excited about

1257
00:47:44,039 --> 00:47:49,119
that you know are in the works when it

1258
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,839
when it comes to uh canabo and Athletics

1259
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,640
so I'm really excited we just finished

1260
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,960
um the first part of our NFL clinical

1261
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:58,598
trial so what we were looking at um

1262
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,880
before we could go into the next part is

1263
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:03,599
we really wanted to see what is the

1264
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:05,720
optimal dose of CBD in an athlete like

1265
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:07,960
nobody knows right and you hear it all

1266
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:09,799
the time in people arguing over like low

1267
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:12,480
dose high dose what you know nobody

1268
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,839
really knows and so um we have a group

1269
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,719
of athletes that these poor guys gave so

1270
00:48:14,838 --> 00:48:19,679
much blood every two weeks but we um had

1271
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,439
an escalating dose and we got them up to

1272
00:48:19,679 --> 00:48:24,239
a pretty high amount and so now we're

1273
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:26,159
going to calculate out what would be

1274
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:28,799
what would appear to be the optimal dose

1275
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:32,440
just based on you know the serum levels

1276
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:34,559
and stuff like that so with that then

1277
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,318
the next part is we're going to use that

1278
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:38,640
optimal dose and we're actually going to

1279
00:48:36,318 --> 00:48:41,358
do a double blind crossover in a season

1280
00:48:38,639 --> 00:48:43,719
of football and we're using um athletes

1281
00:48:41,358 --> 00:48:45,838
in Canada in in the football season and

1282
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:47,679
we're going to use the product that we

1283
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:48,920
have and this is where it's going to get

1284
00:48:47,679 --> 00:48:50,798
really exciting because we're going to

1285
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:53,440
be able to compare the group that's

1286
00:48:50,798 --> 00:48:55,239
using the cannabinoids compared to the

1287
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:57,679
group that isn't and the metrics that

1288
00:48:55,239 --> 00:48:59,879
we're looking at in that is like so

1289
00:48:57,679 --> 00:49:01,279
exciting to me because we're looking at

1290
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,599
you know a couple of things I mentioned

1291
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:04,839
before the things that are happening in

1292
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:07,240
the brain like the cerebral oxygenation

1293
00:49:04,838 --> 00:49:09,000
and the cerebral blood flow but we're

1294
00:49:07,239 --> 00:49:10,639
also looking at the bioinf flammatory

1295
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,760
markers to look at what the changes are

1296
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,480
in that when you're taking cannabinoids

1297
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:17,240
versus when you're not um and then we're

1298
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,440
also going to look at of course the pain

1299
00:49:17,239 --> 00:49:20,479
scores we're going to look at the

1300
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:23,200
concussion scores we're going to look at

1301
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:25,318
um the contractility of their heart

1302
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:27,000
because we want to look at the uh

1303
00:49:25,318 --> 00:49:28,920
because your heart is electrical endoc

1304
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,280
canabo system functions on ions

1305
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:32,440
essentially so we're going to look at

1306
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:34,480
the heart and the differences in the

1307
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,400
contractility and blood pressure like we

1308
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:38,000
have we're looking at sleep scores we're

1309
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,760
looking at their mental status so like

1310
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,760
we're going to be able to pull so much

1311
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,720
data out of this specific to athletes

1312
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:47,119
which hasn't been done like athletes

1313
00:49:44,719 --> 00:49:48,959
just haven't really been studied because

1314
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:52,440
you know they're a healthy population

1315
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:55,559
right but for me you know they really

1316
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,960
are representative of a great number of

1317
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:58,400
people in the world you know like

1318
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,639
Weekend Warriors or people that are

1319
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,559
generally healthy you know like people

1320
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:03,960
that want that are looking for you know

1321
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:06,559
you could consider it a supplement

1322
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,679
really like a supplement agent and so

1323
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:12,359
that is really exciting to me and um the

1324
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:15,279
other thing that really excites me is

1325
00:50:12,358 --> 00:50:18,239
the progress that's being made right now

1326
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:21,960
in um biophysics which is looking really

1327
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:23,759
at the ion exchanges between like all of

1328
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:25,760
your cells so usually when you're

1329
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:27,720
looking at ion movements it's you know

1330
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,040
brain waves because we know that your

1331
00:50:27,719 --> 00:50:32,519
neurons function on electricity and your

1332
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,318
heart functions on electricity but with

1333
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:37,039
Recent research we've been able to see

1334
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:39,719
that the ion movements between all the

1335
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:41,679
cells so there's a lot of um

1336
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:43,358
communication it's a communication

1337
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:45,118
system and so it's a communication

1338
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:47,119
system that typically you know we know

1339
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:50,400
your body runs on biochemistry so that's

1340
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:53,039
looking at the chemistry of it but above

1341
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:55,119
that it's actually physics it's ion

1342
00:50:53,039 --> 00:50:56,199
exchanges and so when you look at um

1343
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:57,280
that's one of the things we're looking

1344
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:59,919
at in the brain is the brain

1345
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,559
oscillations also using the cannaboids

1346
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:04,599
because um there's a lot of information

1347
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,400
there I think and I think that uh the

1348
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:09,200
future for that is is really bright I

1349
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:12,599
think and I think that it'll develop a

1350
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,719
whole new way to treat bodies um you

1351
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,720
know sick bodies too because right now

1352
00:51:14,719 --> 00:51:20,159
we treat them with you know medication

1353
00:51:17,719 --> 00:51:22,879
or things that are targeting receptors

1354
00:51:20,159 --> 00:51:24,960
but if we could develop the ability to

1355
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,920
um like a quick example of cancer cells

1356
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:30,318
like you can see uh cell that's about to

1357
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:33,119
turn cancerous because there's a change

1358
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:35,599
basically in the it's basically in the

1359
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,760
bioelectric frequency of the cell so you

1360
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,720
can you can see it by the change in the

1361
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:45,760
ions if you could in theory use that

1362
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:48,798
information to then reverse it by using

1363
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:51,359
ions and electricity rather than

1364
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:54,119
chemistry you could potentially find

1365
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:56,159
ways to actually push physiology again

1366
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:57,920
just using a different mechanism and so

1367
00:51:56,159 --> 00:52:00,719
for me I'm always looking at how do you

1368
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:04,200
push physiology without drugs really you

1369
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:06,719
know and so that and that really was the

1370
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:08,679
endocannabinoid system to me is I think

1371
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,399
there's a lot going on there and you

1372
00:52:08,679 --> 00:52:12,239
know it started with me looking at it

1373
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:13,838
because you can push that system without

1374
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,759
the cannabis plant you know you can

1375
00:52:13,838 --> 00:52:17,679
invoke it with exercise you can invoke

1376
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,480
it with meditation the cold plans that

1377
00:52:17,679 --> 00:52:21,679
you just talked about before when you

1378
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:23,880
shock it you secrete endocan aboid and

1379
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:24,960
so singing you know youed to create them

1380
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,960
when you sing you used to create them

1381
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,639
when you dance and so it's like a lot of

1382
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,760
the things again that historically and

1383
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:33,159
traditionally and culturally were used

1384
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:35,599
for therapeutic reasons and again it was

1385
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:37,199
like Bro Science culture mode like they

1386
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:39,079
were doing it and they were doing

1387
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:41,598
dancing and chanting and nobody knew why

1388
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:43,400
it worked but now we come to find out oh

1389
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:45,119
wow they're secreting a massive amount

1390
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,519
of anandamide when they're doing that

1391
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,240
well that makes perfect sense because

1392
00:52:46,519 --> 00:52:50,480
anandamide is named that because it's

1393
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:52,598
the Bliss molecule so it makes a lot of

1394
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,039
sense right so what they always knew to

1395
00:52:52,599 --> 00:52:57,280
be true now we have the technology to

1396
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,519
actually prove out molecular

1397
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:01,559
why it is true but they always knew that

1398
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:04,838
it was working you know way back when

1399
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:07,599
and so um yeah so I think that for me

1400
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:09,239
it's an exciting space to be in because

1401
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,960
you're looking at your neurons and

1402
00:53:09,239 --> 00:53:14,239
you're looking at your like the immune

1403
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:16,400
system which to me really I mean it

1404
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:19,358
touches everything in your

1405
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:24,480
body absolutely yeah that that is

1406
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:26,679
exciting um lots of work to do yeah y um

1407
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:29,559
so wrapping up Liz I want to give you

1408
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:31,039
opportunity to share any other resources

1409
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:32,880
or papers that you know of that you

1410
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:34,358
think the listeners might be interested

1411
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,838
in reading up on if they're curious

1412
00:53:34,358 --> 00:53:38,838
about some of these things and then also

1413
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:41,199
any website social media or ways that

1414
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:43,639
people can connect with you to to learn

1415
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,879
more yeah uh so the paper that I

1416
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:47,838
recently published the one that you

1417
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,838
mentioned is in the sports medicine

1418
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:51,719
journal and then our protocol for what

1419
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,719
we're doing for our clinical trial was

1420
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:56,598
just published in BMC neurology and so

1421
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:58,039
that lists all of the different metrics

1422
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:59,519
that we're going to be looking at in our

1423
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:02,079
athletes so if that's of interest to

1424
00:53:59,519 --> 00:54:04,159
anybody they can search that one up too

1425
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,559
and then um I don't really have a lot of

1426
00:54:04,159 --> 00:54:08,639
social media so I have uh there's a

1427
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,839
website a research website basically

1428
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:13,199
that just kind of updates what we're

1429
00:54:09,838 --> 00:54:15,000
doing and it's trainwith Mar jane.com um

1430
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:17,358
and then on Instagram it's just train

1431
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,358
with. Mar Jane and there's not a ton on

1432
00:54:17,358 --> 00:54:20,440
there but there's you know just updates

1433
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,880
brief

1434
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:24,400
updates excellent well I'll put links to

1435
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:26,838
all that stuff in the show description

1436
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:29,519
so people can have an easy way to find

1437
00:54:26,838 --> 00:54:32,159
it and um Liz thanks again for taking

1438
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:34,039
the time um this is fascinating stuff

1439
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:36,118
that you're working on uh we're excited

1440
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:38,519
to see where it goes and uh hopefully

1441
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:40,200
we'll see you down at canmed real soon

1442
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:44,929
yeah I hope so thanks so much for having

1443
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:55,509
me on I appreciate it all right
