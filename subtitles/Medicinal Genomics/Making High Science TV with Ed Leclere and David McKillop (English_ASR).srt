00:04:43,399 --> 00:04:47,918
science that drives it forward an

100
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:52,159
ambitious project to say the

101
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:55,079
least so with that said Ed what inspired

102
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,600
you to create high science specifically

103
00:04:55,079 --> 00:05:02,038
about cannabis and why

104
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,680
now you know uh back in 2018 I had

105
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:07,240
acoustic neuroma surgery and if anybody

106
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,160
knows what that is that's a a tumor in

107
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,918
the brain uh that's connected to uh your

108
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
basically everything and after surgery I

109
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:21,639
spent 33 days and ICU and had some

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:26,399
issues uh and the medicine I was on I

111
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:29,038
did not like uh I also believed when

112
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,799
they did the the surgery was I don't

113
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:35,000
know 10 12 12 hours whatever it was uh

114
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,160
they said it was easier to remove it was

115
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,120
more cystlike uh than the tumor uh and I

116
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,919
believe that when I found out I had this

117
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,759
this uh problem I just smoked a lot of

118
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:49,519
weed because I heard uh it was great for

119
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,759
cancer and tumors and blah blah blah the

120
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:55,758
list goes on so I smoked a lot of weed

121
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:57,720
and uh I believe that's what made it uh

122
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,360
easier to remove the doctor doesn't

123
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:05,160
think so but that's

124
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:08,720
medical versus a cannabis guy and uh I

125
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,840
had this idea for a show and because I

126
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,800
wanted other people to understand what

127
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:18,038
cannabis was all about uh and managed to

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,800
through a friend meet uh the infamous

129
00:06:18,038 --> 00:06:22,519
David mckellop uh who's now my partner

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,639
and I don't know what I would do without

131
00:06:22,519 --> 00:06:29,598
him uh I think we make a great team uh

132
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,319
and he asked me do you really think uh

133
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:34,240
we could do this and I said I do David

134
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,680
and he goes who's going to own the IP

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,560
and I said you and I uh we're not going

136
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,360
to sell it to a network uh we're going

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,160
to do everything ourself and he said

138
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:49,038
let's go uh he comes from the television

139

00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:20,120
Discovery to Storage Wars Pawn Stars and

170
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,240
uh Duck Dynasty at history and A&amp;E um so

171
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,560
I you know i' I've been doing this most

172
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:30,199
of my life um when I met Ed you know I

173
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:32,759
had I kind of left the network you know

174
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,278
you you you can't program you have

175
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:37,240
there's a certain limit to which you can

176
00:08:35,278 --> 00:08:39,599
do in terms of your age and everything

177
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,399
so it's time to let the other people

178
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,800
come in and program but I had a great

179
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,480
run and loved what I was doing um and

180
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:50,199
you know I was looking for my next thing

181
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:52,000
so when Ed approached me I was skeptical

182
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,680
to be quite honest with you you know to

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,399
me it was like oh [ __ ] you know am I

184
00:08:54,679 --> 00:09:00,039
allowed to say that um is that

185
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:01,799
um that um

186
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:03,719
I'm not going to just sit here and do

187
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:06,559
some kind of Stoner show you know that's

188
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:08,639
just not what I smoked the I smoked some

189
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,919
weed when I was a kid in fact we when I

190
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,600
was growing up we actually smoked weed

191
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:17,078
we didn't really drink I never even

192
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,440
drank until after college um but anyway

193
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:21,879
I started to meet some of the people Ed

194
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,519
had rounded up in this group and I

195
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:25,679
started to do some research and I

196
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:29,360
suddenly realized

197
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:32,799
wow um people's perception of the C

198
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:36,519
Canabis industry is still squarely in

199
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:38,479
this idea of a of a recreational drug

200
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,560
and the government and big

201
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,560
pharmaceutical companies all would love

202
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:46,799
to have you think that but what we soon

203
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:49,078
discovered where Ed had shown some light

204
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,519
and I did some discoveries is that quite

205
00:09:49,078 --> 00:09:55,639
the opposite I mean up prior to to the

206
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:57,639
to World War II cannabis was the goto

207
00:09:55,639 --> 00:10:00,559
treatment for up to a hundred different

208
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:04,240
alements it was also the main treatment

209
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,239
for pain before aspirin so we began to

210
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,240
discover that the relationship of human

211
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,399
evolution and cannabis evolution is

212
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,759
tightly bound and it's somehow gotten

213
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:17,200
lost uh you know I have my theories on

214
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:19,600
why a lot of it probably is people don't

215
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,360
have patents on it and can try to make a

216
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,079
lot of money off of it but anyway so I

217
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:26,600
thought you know what I'll take this

218
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:27,919
I'll take this on you know we didn't

219
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,200
have a lot of

220
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:33,120
money uh but but we had a lot of passion

221
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,959
and someone like Ed and we met some of

222
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,720
the people and the characters in the

223
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:39,518
show and we worked hard and we all

224
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,399
chipped in we didn't weren't you know we

225
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,120
weren't

226
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:49,399
paid this was kind of a uh it became a

227
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:51,879
passion for me and um because I know how

228
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:55,559
many people can benefit from it and the

229
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,120
most important thing is is that people

230
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:59,518
there have been lots of stories about

231
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,120
people overdoing it or going into mer

232
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,560
rooms and that's because there there's

233
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,120
no information there's no one there's no

234
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,159
trusted source of information the

235
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,600
government doesn't want to tell you

236
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,319
anything pharmaceutical companies don't

237
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,200
want to tell you anything so people are

238
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
basically finding out for themselves how

239
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,680
many gummies it takes and that's a

240
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,759
disaster you know an

241
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:22,479
uneducated population is not going to

242
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:25,159
really be able to fully Embrace what

243
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,959
cannabis can do for the human body and

244
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:28,559
since no one else is going to do it Ed

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:31,359
and I decided that we're going to do it

246
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,439
and the first step in this was to create

247
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,639
the high science TV show which is going

248
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:38,120
to be an anthology Series so this first

249
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:41,560
series is we're following up a family of

250
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,879
investors but our second third uh we

251
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,879
could be doing something totally

252
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,480
different but the goal here is to

253
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:48,600
educate people at the same time and have

254
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,120
a and have a lot of fun so that's how I

255
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,360
kind of got involved in it excellent no

256
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,078
and and your story is not unique to to

257
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,399
enter the the industry or the topic

258
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,239
skeptical but then dig into the the the

259
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,078
actual information and be made a

260
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Believer we hear it all the time on the

261
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:07,799
podcast we hear it at the conferences

262
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:09,519
all the time um so I think it's great

263
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:11,719
that you're bringing this to more more

264
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:14,000
people so we can have more Believers out

265
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:15,959
there and get more great information

266
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,159
into the hands of folks and I think

267
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:20,159
people are going to see it's trusted

268
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,480
information you know I mean there's so

269
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:28,000
much you know what is real anymore and

270
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:31,680
so um or what what what can what can you

271
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,399
trust to be real information or truth um

272
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,679
and so what we've relied on is rather

273
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:38,240
than lecturing people about what we

274
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:40,439
think it is is we've just followed the

275
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:43,959
stories of individuals people tell their

276
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:48,440
own stories uh from you know veterans

277
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:50,518
who um were were in very dark places who

278
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,800
stumbled across literally stumbled

279
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:54,240
across

280
00:12:51,799 --> 00:12:55,439
cannabis uh that that that was changing

281
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,519
their lives people aren't going to lie

282
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,680
about

283
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:04,919
that um so our show is really

284
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:07,759
testimonials wrapped up in a wonderful

285
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:10,078
narrative um and so it's not preachy

286
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,240
we're not here creating a documentary

287
00:13:10,078 --> 00:13:14,799
with a voice of God that's that's

288
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:17,399
telling people they have to know about

289
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:20,679
this stuff it's actually you're

290
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:22,639
experiencing the journeys of a lot of

291
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,799
individuals uh as they come to the

292
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,198
realization of what cannabis can do

293
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,198
responsible use of cannabis can do sure

294
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:32,319
now and you've said said that it's the

295
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:34,599
blending of educational content with

296
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,079
entertainment were there challenges in

297
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:39,519
Making Science and cannabis accessible

298
00:13:37,078 --> 00:13:42,559
to a broader

299
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,440
audience yeah I mean look well there

300
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:46,838
there's certain limitations in terms of

301
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,320
broadcast uh it's it's you know what we

302
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,480
were doing you know 10 years ago would

303
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,639
have put us in put us in the federal

304
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:58,600
penitentiary um but um look storytelling

305
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:59,600
is human is our way of that that's the

306
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,159
secret to

307
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,120
Humanity um you'll never change

308
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:07,480
anybody's Mind by throwing facts at them

309
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,600
but you will convince people by telling

310
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,879
him a good story the most obvious

311
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,320
example OJ's trial right I mean the

312
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:19,320
defense had every single fact it was an

313
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:22,519
open and shut case and all they did was

314
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:24,278
they presented the facts OJ's attorneys

315
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,600
turned around and just gave a better

316
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:30,480
story and the jury went with that so

317
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,800
this idea that we tell as human beings

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,879
we we we Thrive the most in terms of

319
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:35,719
learning and educating it during play

320
00:14:34,879 --> 00:14:39,559
and

321
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:41,519
storytelling um so how do we find the

322
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:43,479
narrative and the arc that's kind of the

323
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,679
that's what took Ed and I so long but

324
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:48,920
once we found the narrative then it just

325
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,278
fell into place um you know it's

326
00:14:48,919 --> 00:14:52,679
probably never going to be able to air

327
00:14:50,278 --> 00:14:54,278
on a table Channel because they just too

328
00:14:52,679 --> 00:14:55,799
many standards and practices issues it's

329
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:59,919
still illegal on the federal level

330
00:14:55,799 --> 00:15:02,319
advertisers have certain um has lots of

331
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:05,039
reservations but in some ways I think

332
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,720
that's a that's a mark of

333
00:15:05,039 --> 00:15:09,439
uh courage and I think people like to

334
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,440
see that especially

335
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Americans um we're we're leading the

336
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:17,399
charge kind of pioneers you know you

337
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,360
know and and and and the beauty is when

338
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:22,559
you look at our cast members uh they're

339
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,320
being supported and backed up with

340
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:28,599
Incredible people like uh Kevin mckernan

341
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:33,879
uh one of you you know one of the owners

342
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:36,959
of of medicinal geonomics uh Dei Mir who

343
00:15:33,879 --> 00:15:39,159
I think uh I I I just couldn't get

344
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:41,599
enough of Dei when I was interviewing

345
00:15:39,159 --> 00:15:45,879
him uh he said some things that just

346
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:50,159
blew me away uh Ethan Russo uh again we

347
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:52,399
were all at caned and uh uh that's

348
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:55,679
that's the place you really need to go

349
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:57,919
uh and you guys have really supported

350
00:15:55,679 --> 00:16:02,000
what our cast members in the show are

351
00:15:57,919 --> 00:16:03,958
doing and it just hit the nail on the

352
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,278
head when he put all these pieces

353
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:09,000
together it's not it's it's really look

354
00:16:06,278 --> 00:16:10,958
the information is there you all these

355
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,559
all you guys you guys have done the most

356
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:17,919
amazing work in the research and um the

357
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:19,958
I mean there's there lots of simple

358
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:23,679
Concepts that we don't that the average

359
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:27,599
person doesn't know or understand um and

360
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:29,719
something as simple as that um you know

361
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,480
when you inhale

362
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:36,079
cannabis there's only a like I think

363
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:38,319
it's 40% 30% or even less is is is is

364
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,958
actually metabolized into your body but

365
00:16:38,318 --> 00:16:43,519
when you eat something it can be upwards

366
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:46,119
of highs of 90% um which is you know why

367
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,600
eating too much and it takes longer so

368
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,120
what's the difference between you know

369
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,278
indoor grows and outdoor grows what is

370
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:57,318
the um what is the benefit of of of a

371
00:16:54,278 --> 00:17:00,439
rainbow effect of uh cannaboids and

372
00:16:57,318 --> 00:17:02,919
Tarpin you know um so once you start to

373
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,519
learn all that stuff you begin to sense

374
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:07,720
wow there's something here I mean it

375
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,480
actually goes back to challenge the the

376
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,480
way that the medical system works now

377
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:15,959
where they use a very sharp focus of one

378
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,038
one very specific drug for one very

379
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,640
specific symptom cannabis they're

380
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,759
beginning to understand as you know and

381
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,720
this is what these stories we're going

382
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:29,919
to be telling is it is a it's it's a um

383
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:33,360
it's a fabric of of of U medic uses that

384
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:36,600
attack it as a group so we're going from

385
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:39,038
a a single shot to a shotgun approach

386
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:43,038
and that's very very that has that has

387
00:17:39,038 --> 00:17:44,359
an enormous promise in terms of Medical

388
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:45,960
Treatments I mean I'm preaching to the

389
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:47,558
choir you know all that stuff but what

390
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm getting at I get excited about it

391
00:17:47,558 --> 00:17:51,558
that then my job is to make the audience

392
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,520
get excited about it because if they get

393
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:56,639
excited about it they can then you know

394
00:17:54,519 --> 00:17:58,480
they can go back and educate their

395
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,799
doctors you know because we're not going

396
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,839
to see you know the here's an

397
00:18:00,798 --> 00:18:06,960
interesting statistic 70% of the income

398
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,000
for broadcasting cable television comes

399
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,120
from the pharmaceutical

400
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,279
industry wow that's where their ad

401
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,158
revenues that that's where their

402
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:15,678
revenues coming and so that's when you

403
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,440
if you have who does I don't know who

404
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,080
watches the news anymore but if you do

405
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:23,919
watch CBS or ABC News try it one night

406
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:26,359
broadcast every single commercial is a

407
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,480
drug there are only two countries in the

408
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:33,199
entire world that allow

409
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:35,480
the um drug companies to advertise

410
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,240
that's the United States and New Zealand

411
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:39,839
every other country in the world it is

412
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,400
banished the drug companies spend more

413
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:46,079
money advertising than they do on R&amp;D W

414
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,400
so you know so we're up against a

415
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:51,000
monster

416
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:52,880
here and and so it's a no pun intended

417
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,640
it's really this is where Ed convinced

418
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,840
me it's a Grassroots Duty here to get

419
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,799
people to educated on the potential of

420
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:03,000
cannabis now cannabis isn't the Cure All

421
00:19:00,798 --> 00:19:06,720
it's not going to change the entire

422
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:11,880
world but it is certainly a safe and

423
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:12,839
organic uh alternative to a lot of the

424
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,640
uh kind

425
00:19:12,839 --> 00:19:18,720
of uh what's the word um well

426
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,038
traditional ways now that medicine is is

427
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,319
being practiced and our job is to

428
00:19:21,038 --> 00:19:24,798
educate people and then let them make

429
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:29,200
their own decision we're not pushers no

430
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:31,960
pun in it again um we're educators um

431
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,759
and as you know this there's a lot of

432
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:36,640
potential and also the other thing is we

433
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:39,720
don't we only know we only know what was

434
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,038
it Ed how many how many canono are there

435
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,360
in in a in a plant something like 48 or

436
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:46,038
something or 100 I forget what the

437
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:48,918
number was it's he would know better

438
00:19:46,038 --> 00:19:50,400
than us because yeah but we don't I

439
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:52,960
don't even think we I don't even think

440
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,120
we fully know we don't know and we only

441
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,679
know

442
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:01,000
about a fraction of those isn't it like

443
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,400
200 we only know about so far but like

444
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,798
yeah so there's more to learn yeah and

445
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,960
then in terms of how many are actually

446
00:20:04,798 --> 00:20:10,400
tested for too it's even a a smaller

447
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:12,000
portion of that yeah so there's a

448
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,919
there's a

449
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,558
vast body of knowledge that still needs

450
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,840
to be discovered and so getting people

451
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:22,119
excited about that will help them you

452
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:27,079
know encourage others and encourage

453
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:29,359
their doctors and uh uh and and and

454
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:32,279
lawmakers to

455
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:34,639
to not just run away from this kind of

456
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,960
uh misrepresentation of of a very

457
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,440
powerful drug one of our main characters

458
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,840
or one of our characters is a guy named

459
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:45,759
John piai I don't know if you know John

460
00:20:41,839 --> 00:20:48,079
he's a he's a he's a grower up in

461
00:20:45,759 --> 00:20:51,359
Massachusetts uh I I refer to him as

462
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:55,119
kind of Mr Natural meets Thomas

463
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:57,399
Jefferson uh he is just uh he's a genius

464
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,399
but um he's also just an amazing man and

465
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,360
has incredible knowledge

466
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,200
and his whole piece is that he believes

467
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:06,959
that the cannabis plant really has a

468
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:10,038
co-evolution with humanity and in the

469
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,798
same way that the dog became the one

470
00:21:10,038 --> 00:21:15,759
mammal that co-evolved with humans he

471
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:18,440
firmly believes that the cannabis plant

472
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:21,879
which can be traced back to the earliest

473
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:24,600
known uh human interactions actually

474
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,600
evolved in a similar way with with

475
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,359
humans um and so that that there's a

476
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:33,119
tremendous

477
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:35,839
amount of power in that

478
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:38,319
potentially no I think you're absolutely

479
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:40,079
I I saw rambling I'm sorry Ed got me all

480
00:21:38,319 --> 00:21:42,399
excited about this and now I I can't

481
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:45,439
stop talking about

482
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,720
it no it's great your passion definitely

483
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,159
definitely comes through and I think you

484
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,759
touched on a lot of great points there

485
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,559
and one of them being that I mean for a

486
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:54,679
lot of us in the industry we take a lot

487
00:21:52,558 --> 00:21:56,480
of this information for granted and

488
00:21:54,679 --> 00:21:59,240
assume that it's common knowledge but it

489
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,240
really isn't so having a show like this

490
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,359
that's more accessible to the general

491
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:05,558
public so that they can start

492
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:06,678
understanding what we already know um is

493
00:22:05,558 --> 00:22:08,720
very

494
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,400
powerful you know I ran up against that

495
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,839
one at the History Channel you know when

496
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,320
when we first took over history it was

497
00:22:12,839 --> 00:22:16,639
there was a lot of criticism that we

498
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:18,119
were showing shows that weren't really

499
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,799
about history and I thought well you

500
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:22,678
know everything we do is about history

501
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:26,319
but what we did find was that

502
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:28,840
it it inow television is a wonderful

503
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:31,439
means of expressing emotion it is a a

504
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:34,199
terrible means of giving

505
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,278
information um but if you tell as I say

506
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,440
if you have it's a great emotional

507
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:39,960
that's like you know you see a cotton

508
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:44,840
commercial and you cry right I mean it's

509
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:46,400
uh so it has a it triggers people um and

510
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:48,599
the one the most successful thing we did

511
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:52,000
at history was that it wasn't so much

512
00:22:48,599 --> 00:22:53,798
that we were just reciting like a

513
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,960
historical encyclopedia we just got

514
00:22:53,798 --> 00:22:57,599
people excited about history and as they

515
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,200
got excited about history we went from

516
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:04,759
the number 30 for Network up to number

517
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,200
three um and people knew where they you

518
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:07,960
know you get them excited about American

519
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,200
history they go on to the internet and

520
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,159
they learn about it here if we get

521
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,759
people excited about cannabis they'll

522
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,919
start doing their research they'll come

523
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:19,839
back to you and they'll find

524
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,080
you um rather than having to go to the

525
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:22,879
conference they'll be doing their own

526
00:23:21,079 --> 00:23:25,480
research because of their impassion and

527
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,039
then they'll find you Excell you know

528
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:29,720
the other thing the other Beauty about

529
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,200
the show uh a lot of people think that

530
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:34,000
these entrepreneurs are just sitting

531
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:36,278
back making boatloads of money yeah uh

532
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:40,079

lives uh you know uh the millions and

534

536
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:52,558

537
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:55,080

538
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:57,960

00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,599
banking in the industry you know they

546
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,840
because you work in a cannabis industry

547
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,038
you can't go buy a car you can't buy a

548
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:22,038
house uh because you're using federally

549
00:24:20,038 --> 00:24:24,440
illegal money well it's the same damn

550
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:28,440
money that's in my pocket uh that's in

551
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:31,080
yours I I mean the list goes on of what

552
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:35,640
these poor guys men and women in this

553
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:38,599
industry are fighting uh and we touch on

554
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:41,799
on all of it in the show uh to show

555
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:44,839
people that hey it's not all you know

556
00:24:41,798 --> 00:24:47,359
champagne and pop and corks these guys

557
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:50,918
are actually busting their butt because

558
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:55,918
they believe so much in this plant

559
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:58,480
they're willing to do this and that's

560
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:02,399
what high science is all about is

561
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:04,720
showing all of it oh no well said I mean

562
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:06,439
there are a lot of a lot of things up

563
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,120
against folks in the industry not just

564
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,200
the regulations but you have the black

565
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:12,398
market that they're competing with and

566
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,159
now um with the farm bill and have all

567
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,599
these loophole stores that are popping

568
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,320
up with our hemp derived canabo there's

569
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,000
there's a lot of things a lot of

570
00:25:19,319 --> 00:25:22,918
challenges facing the industry and uh I

571
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,679
think it's great that you guys are

572
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:26,919
highlighting that and obviously those

573
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,480
are topics we try to dive into as well

574
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:32,520
at the conference at can helping people

575
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:35,038
kind of try to navigate this because it

576
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:37,240
is a difficult industry the one thing

577
00:25:35,038 --> 00:25:39,079
that I found that when I tell people

578
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:42,120
what we've been up to and this is at

579
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:47,000
dinner parties or friends houses and all

580
00:25:42,119 --> 00:25:51,000
is every single person has said you know

581
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:53,159
I just don't know much about it and the

582
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:56,640
other story is I I find a lot of older

583
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:58,760
people I was at a like a neighborhood uh

584
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,640
picnic the other day or couple months

585
00:25:58,759 --> 00:26:04,240
ago and this couple said they were in

586
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,200
their I don't know late 50s and they

587
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,960
said that they had heard about you know

588
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,558
gummies and so they decided they were

589
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,558
going to take a gummy so they took some

590
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:13,639
gummies nothing happened they took

591
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:15,839
another one the woman said that three

592
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,919
days later she was still thinking about

593
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:22,639
going to the emergency room um and you

594
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,480
know the the the the thing here is that

595
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,360
if they had only known that's what they

596
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:30,519
said they just didn't know anything

597
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:34,479
about it and um so educating people not

598
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:36,960
only is it good for them in terms of you

599
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,558
know empowering their their Wellness but

600
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,720
it's also a very important protection

601
00:26:39,558 --> 00:26:46,000
against irresponsible use and there's no

602
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,440
place to go you know there's no cons

603
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,278
there's no consistency it's not like you

604
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:55,159
go and pick up a bottle of Tylenol and

605
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:57,200
know exactly what to do right right um

606
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:59,278
so that's why it's so important to get

607
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,038
the show on the air and to start

608
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,440
generating interest is that it's there

609
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,558
to educate people and an educated

610
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,399
population on this stuff is going to be

611
00:27:06,558 --> 00:27:10,759
good for wellness and it's going to be

612
00:27:08,398 --> 00:27:13,719
good for the Cannabis

613
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:16,640
business well said so let's talk a bit

614
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,919
about you know how is the show what can

615
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,759
people expect when they're watching the

616
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,240
show you mentioned that um you kind of

617
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:25,240
have some characters that um tie all

618
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,480
these different stories together what

619
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:29,159
does that look

620
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,919
like well you have to have a thread you

621
00:27:29,159 --> 00:27:32,960
know you have to have a thread and and

622
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:35,559
and and a story you know and I've always

623
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
been very successful with uh father son

624
00:27:35,558 --> 00:27:39,759

Generations tend to uh people tend to be

627
00:27:43,398 --> 00:27:49,518
able to relate to that um so in this

628
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,919
particular ep season you know we we're

629
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:55,319
following a a group of a family of um

630
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,640
venture capitalist

631
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:01,759
entrepreneurs um as they um look to

632
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,080
expand their business in in the Cannabis

633
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:07,679
world and in doing so they we created

634
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:11,359
their

635
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:15,240
interactions with everybody from ogs to

636
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:17,918
Suits to scientists and there's a bunch

637
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:20,240
of H Jinks that UE you know in terms of

638
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,240
family Dynamics

639
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,839
uh uh situational comedy that kind of

640
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:28,519
stuff but that's all tied into the to

641
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:31,199
the the the entertainment pieces it but

642
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:34,759
it's really just a skeleton and when you

643
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:37,240
hang on that skeleton all of these other

644
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:42,119
individuals including John piai we've

645
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:44,759
got this couple uh uh Megan Eric up in

646
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:48,239
the birk Shear who are you know who have

647
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:52,359
been experimenting in in in retail to to

648
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,880
customers we have um we have Mo in

649
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:57,599
Arizona who you know he's kind of this

650
00:28:54,880 --> 00:29:00,440
uh he was his mother was suffering and

651
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:03,519
so he invented a a type of cannabis

652
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:05,798
that's used for your skin so we and and

653
00:29:03,519 --> 00:29:08,480
we've tied all of these individuals into

654
00:29:05,798 --> 00:29:11,519
a storyline around this family that's

655
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:13,759
out in search of of increasing their

656
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,759
knowledge and investments in in the

657
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:19,679
Cannabis world that's kind of how we did

658
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:21,720
it um so as I say it's not a lecture

659
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,600
it's not a it's

660
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:28,759
not it's kind of a reality Series right

661
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:30,719
but I think you know the reality is

662
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:33,440
series are kind of misunderstood these

663
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:35,480
days but um but what it is is it's it's

664
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,440
very entertaining it's watchable it's

665
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:43,640
easy on the eyes um but it's also really

666
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,759
informative uh in fact it's like you're

667
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,840
getting that information on a on a

668
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:49,079
secondary and tertiary level you don't

669
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:51,798
even know you're getting it because

670
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:54,639
you're enjoying watching the

671
00:29:51,798 --> 00:29:56,240
show right so Ed you were originally

672
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,120
conceived of the idea how does the

673
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:01,759
finished product compare to your origin

674
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,439
Vision you know when we were looking to

675
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:05,440
go well he fired me the first

676
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:13,440
time I'm not the first person to get you

677
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,240
fired no I've been fired a lot the the

678
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,960
the the the thing is when we were

679
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,000
looking to put this on cable uh nwork

680
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:25,000
the show was so different from what I

681
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,640
envisioned uh in the very beginning uh

682
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,679
because when you go on cable uh uh you

683
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,200
know you can't show this you can't show

684
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,159
that you're showing too many products

685
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:36,159
you're going to dispensary oh my God you

686
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,919
got to block all those names out you

687
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,320
can't show smoking you can't show

688
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,640
somebody taking a gummy it's like it's

689
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:45,079
like all of a sudden you're doing a

690
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,640
Seinfeld show a show about nothing so

691
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:50,079
when we cut the

692
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,679
cord and David really got

693
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,558
into

694
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:59,798
uh the characters and how they all

695
00:30:55,558 --> 00:31:05,000
intertwin together he goes I got it I

696
00:30:59,798 --> 00:31:10,918
got it and the show is exactly as I

697
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:15,679
Envision uh David has had 100% creative

698
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:19,919
control uh you know I I sit back and I

699
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:24,840
really treasure his thoughts and ideas

700
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:28,360
and uh I just I I'm super super excited

701
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:30,119
about it uh and uh I I just can't wait

702
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:31,599
for everybody to see it hon in fact most

703
00:31:30,119 --> 00:31:35,359
of the people working on the series

704
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,359
refer to edai as The Odd

705
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:42,200
Couple a good thing H it's a good thing

706
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:44,319
you know uh they they kind of we walk

707
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:47,440
into a room and you know I'm I'm usually

708
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:50,839
got a suit jacket on and a button- down

709
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,090
shirt and and uh and they look at they

710
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:54,439
kind of look at it go whoa what is

711
00:31:53,089 --> 00:31:57,398
[Laughter]

712
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:00,200
this but uh but we work together really

713
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,719
well so um and I think it's because we

714
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:06,319
share the same passion um which is you

715
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,000
know to get people to understand the

716
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,480
benefits of cannabis it's a you know

717
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,638
this is a it's an important story to

718
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,639
tell and that's what we want to tell it

719
00:32:13,638 --> 00:32:17,519
excellent and now you've mentioned

720
00:32:15,638 --> 00:32:19,599
future seasons and maybe you know

721
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,038
working with with different characters

722
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:24,319
are there any you know people on your on

723
00:32:22,038 --> 00:32:27,038
your wish list or dream collaborations

724
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:29,439
or experts that you'd be interested in

725
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,319
featuring and future Seasons yeah we

726
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,759
have I mean look we could some of the

727
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:34,398
people that we've met along the way in

728
00:32:32,759 --> 00:32:37,359
in this season we could spin off and do

729
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:39,359
separate Seasons um I think what it's

730
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,479
going to become is an anthology series

731
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,959
meaning that high science will come back

732
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,038
season after season and they'll have

733
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,519
returning characters that from different

734
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,558
but there'll be maybe a totally

735
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:51,278
different story being told there is so

736
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:54,119
much out there honestly there's so much

737
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:58,079
potential uh and

738
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,839
um some spin-offs there's some spin-offs

739
00:32:58,079 --> 00:33:01,599
one that we could spinoffs and and do

740
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,359
their own series I think they're strong

741
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:07,599
enough to handle their own series uh and

742
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:11,240
as we spend them off we can add newans

743
00:33:07,599 --> 00:33:15,240
into uh new cast members into season two

744
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:18,038
of high science uh and it's just it's

745
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:19,880
exciting to see this all come together

746
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,200
and you know we're you know we're we're

747
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,240
gonna we made a conscious decision to go

748
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,720
out on

749
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,038
YouTube I personally think YouTube is

750
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:31,519
the future of uh you know

751
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,200
YouTube today is what cable was 25 years

752
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,159
ago it's where you go to learn about

753
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,120
cooking shows that aren't competition

754
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,760
shows and all the rest of it so um

755
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:44,678
YouTube is a has a powerful reach into

756
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:48,679
the to the everyday common person in

757
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,000
America um and now you know it's you

758
00:33:48,679 --> 00:33:53,519
don't have the marketing Machinery

759
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,519
behind which you would have at a network

760
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,000
but honestly I think through social

761
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,359
media and Word of Mouth build it they

762
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,038
will come and I think YouTube is really

763
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:04,638
the perfect place for this you know we

764
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:06,879
got a lot of push back from some of the

765
00:34:04,638 --> 00:34:08,480
uh characters in the show because oh

766
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,559
they said this is going to be a TV show

767
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:14,519
and it's G to be on you know Netflix or

768
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:18,078
some other thing like that and

769
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:20,639
um but I remind them that uh right now

770
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:24,359
YouTube is probably the has the largest

771
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:27,039
potential audience um and if we can if

772
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,398
we can manipulate social media to act as

773
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:31,398
our marketing

774
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:33,078
I think it's the perfect um it's the

775
00:34:31,398 --> 00:34:36,039
perfect spot for

776
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:36,879
it yeah no I mean if my if my kids are

777
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:39,159
any

778
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:41,440
indication um YouTube is where it's at

779
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:42,960
that's all they want to watch is YouTube

780
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,320
you know when you when you sit back and

781
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:49,320
you think it's

782
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:52,399
worldwide uh it's uh 78% of the people

783
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:55,200
uh that stream they stream by their

784
00:34:52,398 --> 00:34:57,838
handheld uh so you know most people have

785
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,639
cut the cord on the television uh the

786
00:34:57,838 --> 00:35:03,559
beauty is not only can I watch uh

787
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:05,920
YouTube on my handheld but I also have

788
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:09,480
the app on my television and I can watch

789
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:13,440
it on my my TV as well y so or on your

790
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:16,599
your your iPad whatever it might be so

791
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:18,838
so I I think it's the perfect Avenue for

792
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:21,200
us uh now that's not to say we're not

793
00:35:18,838 --> 00:35:24,119
going to go out and sell the show or

794
00:35:21,199 --> 00:35:26,519
license a show in other countries and

795
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:29,640
and uh doing other things with it since

796
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:32,199
we own the IP we have that that ability

797
00:35:29,639 --> 00:35:34,358
to do that uh and that's exactly what

798
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:37,078
we're going to do but we're starting

799
00:35:34,358 --> 00:35:39,199
with YouTube and we could not be more

800
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:41,680
excited about it and the people are

801
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:44,118
really embracing it uh that we're

802
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:46,279
telling uh our cat some of our cast

803
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,880

804
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,240

award-winning producer uh he uses him to

hold his doors open at his house uh it's

887
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,480
uh it's it's just exciting the amount of

888
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,720
people and you're going to meet Kelly

889
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:41,079

and Eric Kevin MCC Carnell and Brendan

891
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,560
uh the list goes on of all these cast

892
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:49,119
members and the incredible work they're

893
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:51,519
doing in the Cannabis industry and I

894
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,440
could not be more excited to be sitting

895
00:39:51,519 --> 00:39:57,039
on a side of David watching our episodes

896
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,440
as we we go live and you know when we

897
00:39:57,039 --> 00:40:01,440
realiz these things take time too so you

898
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,599
know we we've managed our expectations

899
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,358
that's the other thing about YouTube

900
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,480
it's not like we're launching after a

901
00:40:04,358 --> 00:40:08,920
multi-million dollar ad campaign and

902
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,119
buses ads on buses in New York City and

903
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,880
billboards in La uh but I do believe

904
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,280
it's like a diesel engine you know it

905
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:19,680
takes a while to get those guys up to

906
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,359
speed but once you hit your your your

907
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:24,078
once you hit your RPMs they're almost

908
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:26,400
impossible to stop and so we'll be we'll

909
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,039
be we're going to be uh manage our

910
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:31,160
expectations but we are 100% behind this

911
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:34,559
and everybody that we have been working

912
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:36,960
with is 100% behind this everybody who I

913
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:39,279
have to say shout out to all of us none

914
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,358
of no one is no one has been paid for

915
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,880
this that's the other thing um people

916
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:47,598
have are doing this out of the out of

917
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,519
the their their passion to get this

918
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:51,920
information across um and I think that

919
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:54,119
when you do something like that and you

920
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:56,639
have that type of passion and personal

921
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,760
commitment success may take time but

922
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:59,759
it's going to

923
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,280
happen absolutely you know one thing I

924
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,560
want to I want to say uh DD Mir I keep

925

Dei I said Dei could you tell me the

930
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,279
difference uh because season one we're

931
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,599
in cannabis season two we might go into

932
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:24,319
mushrooms I don't know where we're going

933
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,440
to go uh but we need to explore and he

934
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:31,279
goes Ed Ed Ed Ed Ed sit back I said

935
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:33,318
what's that de he goes Ed cannabis is

936
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,960
the little

937
00:41:33,318 --> 00:41:41,679
village he goes but mushrooms is the

938

wait and see so we're going to no

940
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,799
telling where season two is going to

941
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:49,838
take us but we're going to be exploring

942
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,680
this plant

943
00:41:49,838 --> 00:41:54,639
medicine uh it's got a lot to be said

944
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:57,239
for what what Mother Nature has put on

945
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:58,799
this Earth and I'm hoping also that

946
00:41:57,239 --> 00:42:00,439
people will see the show and then

947
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,119
contact us because you know I I think

948
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:03,440
it's just the tip of the iceberg of who

949
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:05,358
we've you there's been a lot of

950
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,800
serendipity in terms of who we've been

951
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:09,639
able to to rope in and meet but I'm

952
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,119
hoping that the series will bring all

953
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:15,000
kinds of interesting people out of the

954
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:18,039
woodwork and and and so it start to grow

955
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:19,318
exponentially um and that's gonna that's

956
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,199
what's really going to be exciting and I

957
00:42:19,318 --> 00:42:23,679
think it's also excited for the for the

958
00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:28,598
people we are showcasing in the series

959
00:42:23,679 --> 00:42:31,838
too I mean I think um it's great uh

960
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:33,760
it puts a face to a lot of uh a lot of

961
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:36,039
these products and and it actually puts

962
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:37,800
a human face to the science and that's

963
00:42:36,039 --> 00:42:40,318
kind of the basis of the series is we're

964
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,720
putting a human face with a human story

965
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:46,239
on some really exciting and complex

966
00:42:43,719 --> 00:42:49,480
science absolutely I hope we can help

967
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:52,759
just one person through education in a

968
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:55,159
show I hope we can shed some light to

969
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,839
our politicians that something needs to

970
00:42:55,159 --> 00:43:00,440
be done with Federal legalization I hope

971
00:42:57,838 --> 00:43:03,639
we can be instrumental and helping

972
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:06,400
