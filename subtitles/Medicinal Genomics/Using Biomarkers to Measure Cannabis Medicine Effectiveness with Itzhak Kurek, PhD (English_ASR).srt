effectiveness of cannabis-based

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,120
medicines using biomarkers so far they

104
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:05,519
have identified dozens of cannabis

105
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,360
responsive biomarkers that can be used

106
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
to objectively quantify the

107
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,840

affected by medical cannabis and cbd

111
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,000
their pilot study looked at patients

112
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,918
with autism spectrum disorder and was

113
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,040
published in the journal of cannabis and

114
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:29,439
cannabinoid research in december

115
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,319
during our conversation we discussed

116
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,719
details of the asd pilot study the

117
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,079
benefits of using biomarkers versus

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,479
self-reporting

119
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,560
the bi-directional nature of cannabis

120
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:42,639

spectrum medicine products

123
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,240
how the focus on thc potency stifles

124
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,319
medical research and the challenge of

125
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,840
doing proper medical cannabis research

126
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:57,439

[Music]

142
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:42,319
good morning itzhak thanks for joining

143
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,478
us on the podcast

144
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:45,199
hi good morning thank you for inviting

145
00:05:44,478 --> 00:05:47,038
me

146
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,478
for this podcast

147
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,279
yeah for sure

148
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,839
so

149
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:53,918
your team is taking a novel approach to

150
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,000
measuring the effectiveness of cannabis

151
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,879
treatment by using cannabis responsive

152
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,478
biomarkers and we discussed this topic a

153
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:03,038
little bit when bonnie goldstein was on

154
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,120
the podcast a little while back but now

155
00:06:03,038 --> 00:06:07,759
we have you here to to dig into the

156
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,840
details a bit more so

157
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,160
maybe the best place to start is for you

158
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:14,318
to tell the audience about the autism

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,479
spectrum disorder pilot study that your

160
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,199
team has published

161
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:18,079
so

162
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,759
we

163
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:23,439
had an autism disorder pilot study in

164
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,160
which we

165
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:27,600
it was the first time that we as a proof

166
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,880
of concept

167
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,840
showed that we can detect a cannabis

168
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:36,319
responsive biomarkers in saliva of

169
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:37,839
children treated with medical cannabis

170
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,439
children with autism treated with

171
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:44,159
medical cannabis

172
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:47,279
the idea behind that is that we take

173
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,479
we identified metabolites that responds

174
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:52,318
to medical cannabis treatment

175
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:56,240
and

176
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:58,400
analyze the change of those molecules uh

177
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,120
and in that way we

178
00:06:58,399 --> 00:07:03,598
we can see if those molecules change

179
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,879
towards any physiological range which we

180
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,000
determine

181
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,759
in a

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,800
in a group of

183
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:13,840
typical developing children

184
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,000
and that way we can quantify first time

185
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:19,198
the impact of medical cannabis treatment

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,639
excellent so

187
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,759
tell me a bit about how did you

188
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,079
determine which biomarkers were of

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,960
interest and how did you determine what

190
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:31,359
an optimal range would be

191
00:07:28,959 --> 00:07:34,719
okay that's a great question and and and

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,680
to begin with we we are lacking of uh

193
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:38,960
medical

194
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
scientific data about cannabis uh

195
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:44,159
in the literature typically when we

196
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,879
start a biotech company we're looking at

197
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,599
solutions that exist at medical

198
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,280
scientific paper any medical information

199
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:54,959
that we can have on that topic in uh

200
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:58,959
cannabis will

201
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,478
very much beyond behind actually those

202
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:03,120
those

203
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,598
knowledge so we have to discover those

204
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,918
biomarkers first or

205
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:09,038
before discovering even prove that they

206
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:11,359
exist

207
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:13,360
so what we do we we use technology

208
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,000
called mass spectrometry

209
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:19,038
which analyze metabolite in saliva we

210
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,240
separate the metabolite again through a

211
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,159
a

212
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,800
liquid chromatograph that's the

213
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,960
technology and we have

214
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,639
we we we scan for about 1500 molecules

215
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:32,718
once we look so we look at those

216
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,719
molecules before medical cannabis

217
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,000
treatment and after medical cannabis

218
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,360
treatment and identified in that case in

219
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,200
15 kids we identified about

220
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,278
a 400 molecules that change

221
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
before and after

222
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,759
now we analyze those molecules the way

223
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,159
we analyze those molecule

224
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,399
we first of all determine that we are

225
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,559
interested in molecules that

226
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,440
exist at least

227
00:08:58,559 --> 00:09:04,239
at nine children out of the 15 so at

228
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,399
least nine children has those molecules

229
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
and they change

230
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:11,679
now we want we we want to compare them

231
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,640
to as you mentioned to the physiological

232
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,000
range physiological range we determine

233
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,319
by a

234
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,879
typically developing children

235
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,040
with the same boys to girls ratio and

236
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:24,559
the same age as the

237
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:26,000
studied group

238
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:27,759
and we we

239
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,639
look at we average

240
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,200
the value of those molecules at that at

241
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:36,559
the typically developing group

242
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,920
and determine the standard deviation

243
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,759
and in a

244
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:41,360
rule of thumb

245
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:43,360
one standard deviation is the

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,240
physiological range

247
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,120
so we call it a z-score

248
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,639
and z-score mean how many standard

249
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,080
deviations

250
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:54,159
the

251
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,839
children with autism

252
00:09:54,159 --> 00:10:00,079
away from the physiological range if you

253
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:03,360
if a child is above

254
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,000
a 2 or below 2 standard deviation that

255
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,839
means that his value is not in the

256
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,120
physiological range

257
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,880
if it's over four standard deviation

258
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,078
it's

259
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,958
significantly uh

260
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:20,958
in away from the physiological range and

261
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:23,439
we use our in-house algorithm to analyze

262
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,319
all the samples from all the children

263
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,200
and see which one of them were

264
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,399
far

265
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,640
before the medical cannabis treatment

266
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,919
and they got closer to the physiological

267
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,439
range

268
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:38,240
after the medical

269
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,680
cannabis treatment we choose after what

270
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,079
we call peak

271
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:45,120
at the time of each parent

272
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:48,159
reported that that the optimal time that

273
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,200
they see a reduced symptom

274
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:50,480
in these

275
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,720
children

276
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:56,480
so that way we identified about 65

277
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,639
uh new

278
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:02,560
cannabis of the first ever cannabis

279
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:05,439
responsive biomarkers that shows a move

280
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:07,919
towards the physiological range in

281
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,959
children with the autism

282
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,360
okay

283
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:12,838
so it sounds like so you started with

284
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:16,879
identifying the f

285
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,839
1500 biomarkers and then i narrowed that

286
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:21,039
down

287
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:23,200
to the 400 that are actually affected by

288
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:25,199
cannabis and then after

289
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,278
you know comparing the data from

290
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,040
from the children with autism and the

291
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:32,320
the other children you narrowed that

292
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:34,559
down even further to the 65 that are

293
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
um have some implication for

294
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,319
autism spectrum disorder and are

295
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:40,479
responsive to

296
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,839
cannabis treatment do i have that right

297
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:47,680
correct so so this is still temporary

298
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,560
because we need to increase the data

299
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:53,039
in one way to have a manageable number

300
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:55,119
of biomarkers but more important right

301
00:11:53,039 --> 00:11:56,399
now we still don't know within those

302
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,278
biomarkers

303
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:02,000
which biomarkers are more important

304
00:11:59,278 --> 00:12:05,600
and which one of them also which are the

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:09,679
biomarkers that associated with uh

306
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,839
symptoms or with phenotype of autism so

307
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:12,958
we still need to rank them and that

308
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:17,040
comes with

309
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:19,039
more with once we increase the study

310
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,439
we need to rank those biomarkers and

311
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:23,679
determine which are the most important

312
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,680
uh biomarkers

313
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,599
yeah so interesting

314
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,638
so one more thing

315
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,839
when we did the analysis one rule that

316
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,200
we had

317
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,639
was that uh each biomarker that we look

318
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:42,879
had has to exist in all the children

319
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:44,159
all the typically developing children so

320
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,919
we cannot

321
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:48,399
because sometimes you don't detect a

322
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:50,000
biomarker because of the level if the

323
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
levels are too low

324
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,600
you cannot detect the biomarkers but we

325
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,240
cannot do it with the control group

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,120
because we need to make sure that that

327
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,720
biomarkers is relevant

328
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,519
right that makes sense

329
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,000
so so you said

330
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,879
you kind of hinted into the next phase

331
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,240
of this study so so what is that what

332
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,000
where are you gonna where are you gonna

333
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
take this

334
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,240
so as a startup we are in the

335
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,440
fundraising it's always money and

336
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,720
funding

337
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,839
but the idea is that now we are

338
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:29,519
taking those biomarkers and the study

339
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:30,800
and increase it to about 200

340
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,240
people

341
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:37,199
it's gonna go beyond the six to nine

342
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,399
year old children we're gonna have

343
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,519
adults

344
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,519
a

345
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,240
more

346
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,480
variation with the medical treatment but

347
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:49,759
it's still under control of medical

348
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,639
cannabis treatment and 200

349
00:13:49,759 --> 00:13:56,958
participants will allow us to narrow

350
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:58,480
down to about 20 biomarkers those 20

351
00:13:56,958 --> 00:13:59,518
biomarkers

352
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,399
would be

353
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,720
in a way our first service once we rank

354
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,839
them and have those biomarkers also it's

355
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,240
important

356
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:10,880
for us to determine what is the

357
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,799
physiological range so it's going to be

358
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:14,838
and now there will be

359
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:16,958
more typically developing

360
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,360
participants to

361
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:21,679
make sure that the physiological range

362
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,800
could change between ages

363
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,120
gender

364
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,120
er sometimes even a

365
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:35,440
different ethnic groups so it all comes

366
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,360
with in i mean

367
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,279
the big picture it's how we're moving

368
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
toward precision medicine or

369
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:45,039
personalized medicine and and and

370
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,360
biomarkers are a part of this huge

371
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,559
a precision medicine model

372
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,800
so

373
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,799
so

374
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,519
we are

375
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,879
expanding it to that 200 and from there

376
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:02,720
once we have those values we can start

377
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:05,919
actually provide recommendation

378
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,839
for a patient that being treated with

379
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:11,519
the medical cannabis

380
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:14,079
either through a doctor or a

381
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,198
parents that do it without the doctors

382
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,198
we we can provide

383
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,800
how

384
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,839
the impact or how well the medical

385
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:26,559
cannabis treatment works the next step

386
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:29,120
after if we think about it probably

387
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:31,439
within once we have about a thousand

388
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,278
participants or between thousand to two

389
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
thousand participant

390
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:37,198
we can

391
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,799
actually start predicting

392
00:15:37,198 --> 00:15:42,240
and i think that's the beauty of the

393
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:45,039
system it's once we can look at the

394
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:47,919
pre-dosing we look at saliva before

395
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:51,360
medical cannabis treatment and decide or

396
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:54,078
recommend a certain

397
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,240
product or treatment the idea of

398
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:57,439
conformatics is to

399
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
provide

400
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:03,440
a range of products so a

401
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,600
patient or families could use either

402
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:10,000
edible or tincture we we will provide

403
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,000
both recommendation

404
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,799
to a product

405
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
right so so the goal is that you sort of

406
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,559
do the saliva test you get a profile or

407
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,958
so almost like a fingerprint of your own

408
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:25,439
biomarkers and then based on that

409
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:27,439
connect with a product that's that's

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,399
going to work for you correct

411
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,160
correct exactly it's it's almost like i

412
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:34,000
mean the idea is

413
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:37,919
when we go to a doctor

414
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,120
and we do a blood work and we see uh

415
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,278
we see

416
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,278
a

417
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:46,958
i would say

418
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:50,560
glucose at blood blood glucose or we see

419
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:52,958
cholesterol and the doctor has a range

420
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,039
and based on that we know

421
00:16:52,958 --> 00:16:56,559
if we need the treatment or we we don't

422
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,639
need the treatment and if we need the

423
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:59,679
treatment typically the doctor

424
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,159
knows

425
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,569
how much what type of treatment for a

426
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,838
certain

427
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,798
[Music]

428
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,439
range

429
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:09,838
a patient need

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,519
yeah and that's a good point too that i

431
00:17:09,838 --> 00:17:14,399
i wanted to talk about so so you've

432
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:17,359
identified the 65 biomarkers that you

433
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,038
know have implications here and you know

434
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:21,759
you mentioned that we don't really know

435
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:24,318
which ones are the most important but

436
00:17:21,759 --> 00:17:25,919
i'm i'm curious are you seeing that the

437
00:17:24,318 --> 00:17:28,159
cannabis is

438
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,799
sort of at least bringing all of those

439
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,558
into some sort of homeostasis and i

440
00:17:30,798 --> 00:17:34,879
guess that's that's the question i

441
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:36,240
wanted to ask was you know we've talked

442
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,400
to other medical professionals on the

443
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,038
podcast and they always talk about how

444
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,960
cannabis has this biphasic effect where

445
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,759
you know it can upregulate or down

446
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,160
regulate based on your you know whatever

447
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,960
your deficiency is um wondering if you

448
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:54,480
see that in your results as well

449
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,480
yes so i think the most interesting

450
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,880
biomarkers the first one or the most

451
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,599
significant that we found and that

452
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,880
basically with the algorithm

453
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,159
was a

454
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:08,640
a naa which is

455
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,640
n-actual aspartate aspartate

456
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
and that biomarkers

457
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:16,480
i think

458
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,599
in probably 12 or 13 kids out of the 15

459
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,919
change

460
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:22,319
but the change was a

461
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,919
four or five kids it significantly

462
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:27,519
decreased

463
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:30,160
at the same time we saw changes in about

464
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:31,279
four or three kids that it's actually

465
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,960
increase

466
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:35,440
and that's very rare

467
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,160
it's very rare because we typically

468
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,080
use kind of beta blockers we use

469
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,798
pharmaceutical treatment which are

470
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,119
reducing in general we know how to block

471
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:47,918
and reduce things it's very hard to

472
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,279
increase things and with cannabis we see

473
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,799
naturally

474
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,519
increases

475
00:18:50,798 --> 00:18:55,279
of molecules or decrease

476
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:57,599
now when we

477
00:18:55,279 --> 00:19:00,000
analyze this molecule actually in the

478
00:18:57,599 --> 00:19:01,038
literature there is disagreement because

479
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,839
some

480
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:06,079
studies showed that molecule without

481
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:07,918
not in the context of cannabis but just

482
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,279
as a biomarker for

483
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,919
autism

484
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:15,119
some claim that it's extremely high and

485
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,440
some claims were that it's a low

486
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,678
we saw both in saliva none of those

487
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,720
study were in saliva we sold both in

488
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,559
saliva but we saw that the increase to

489
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,360
the physiological or decrease to the

490
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:28,879
physiological range happen from both

491
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:29,918
direction

492
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,600
wow

493
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,520
yes

494
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,798
yeah and that's that's interesting and

495
00:19:33,519 --> 00:19:36,558
you know it's interesting you bring up

496
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,359
the difference between sort of candice

497
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:39,440
and

498
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:41,119
traditional pharmaceuticals one of the

499
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,038
other things that we commonly see with

500
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:46,239
traditional pharma is you know sort of

501
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:47,038
this idea of one compound one target

502
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,640
but

503
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,558
you know as we're seeing here where we

504
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,679
have multiple targets or at least we

505
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:53,759
think we do with these different

506
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,000
biomarkers and we have cannabis that's

507
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:58,879
affecting these multiple biomarkers it

508
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,679
has multiple compounds within it how how

509
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,880
do you start to unravel that whole

510
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,919
gordian knot of all different things

511
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:11,039
so i i like the quote from uh dimarzo at

512
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,919
1998 about

513
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:16,960
the endocannabinoid system and he said

514
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,200
he described it as relax eat sleep

515
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:22,240
forget and protect

516
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,558
and so we see the wide range of

517
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,960
activities or functions of the

518
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:28,000
endocannabinoid

519
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,000
system

520
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,200
so to begin with

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,839
treatment has a multiple effect

522
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:36,720
and we cannot take

523
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:39,678
and

524
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,759
not only autism most of the medical

525
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,240
condition that we're dealing with or

526
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,440
solving with medical cannabis are

527
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,400
typically complex medical conditions

528
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,840
and it

529
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:55,280
it's not so it's hard to

530
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:57,918
see that it's a one target one a

531
00:20:55,279 --> 00:21:00,319
compound will will fix it

532
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,000
you need more than that it's not like a

533
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:03,200
single shot

534
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,400
treatment

535
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,240
and i think cannabis has this potential

536
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,200
because of this

537
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:13,038
large collection of active ingredient

538
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,919
we still need to know which active

539
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:18,158
ingredient do what and also what are the

540
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,360
dosages that we need to take

541
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,960
but that's the the beginning that's the

542
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:25,519
starting point

543
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,919
in our study with

544
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,400
i would say with being very careful with

545
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,880
the limited data that we have we could

546
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,159
see that there are

547
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,400
at least specific biomarkers or cannabis

548
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,919
responsive biomarkers that responds to

549
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:43,840
thc

550
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,720
a specific one that responds to cbd and

551
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,839
that's the majority that we saw a

552
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,038
biomarkers that response is specific to

553
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:52,879
cbd

554
00:21:51,038 --> 00:21:55,279
and few that

555
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,400
responds to cbn

556
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:59,599
so

557
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:02,080
due to the small sample size and

558
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:03,199
not huge variation in the treatment we

559
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,079
could

560
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,240
only

561
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,519
at that point

562
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,159
see those

563
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,000
changes and as the data goes

564
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:16,159
increase we can get more and more

565
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,000
information about other a cannabinoid

566
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,000
the change but

567
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,480
definitely

568
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,200
it looks like full spectrum or

569
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:28,720
multi-component

570
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:32,000
will have better effect than a single uh

571
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,159
dose or a single active ingredient

572
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,798
right yeah so you you mentioned those

573
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,720
cannabinoids did you see any um

574
00:22:36,798 --> 00:22:41,839
any indications that terpenes are

575
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,839
playing a role

576
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:48,720
no we could not get into that resolution

577
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,879
because i think

578
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,440
most

579
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,880
i think most of the

580
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,038
children

581
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:58,080
use terpenes

582
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,839
so

583
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,279
it was very hard to er

584
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,359
the reason we can

585
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:07,839
typically we can

586
00:23:05,359 --> 00:23:08,959
see the differences is if we have a

587
00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:11,359
changes

588
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,519
in product a or

589
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:16,558
in children we detect changes in

590
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:18,240
children that not using thc for example

591
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:20,000
so we can compare the samples and

592
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,359
identify

593
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:27,038
we could not get to that resolution yet

594
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,959
but but terpin i mean they should work

595
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:31,440
and they should help because first of

596
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,640
all we know aromatherapy helps

597
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,200
and we know terpenes have chemical

598
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,240
characteristics that help a

599
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,720
a

600
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,759
soluble solubilized membrane and

601
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,038
allowing

602
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:46,400
thc or cbd to enter in the cell

603
00:23:45,038 --> 00:23:48,720
they also

604
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,200
working as anti-inflammatory

605
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,200
so

606
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,038
it's a treatment by itself i i think

607
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,000
it's just an add-on

608
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,440
and

609
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,440
to the cannabis

610
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:03,200
um

611
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,479
curious were there any patients that

612
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:06,000
were using

613
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
because you mentioned you know full

614
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,880
spectrum medicine were there any that

615
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,798
were using sort of isolated compounds or

616
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,159
isolates or was it pretty much across

617
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:19,200
the board uh full spectrum medicines

618
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,960
so some of them use isolate but it's a

619
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,400
combination so

620
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:25,600
you get at least three four

621
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:28,080
a

622
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:28,079
different

623
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,559
active ingredient

624
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:36,000
also often you see a

625
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:37,918
full spectrum

626
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:41,119
and then

627
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:44,159
add on another thc or cbd

628
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:47,678
uh but there were at least a i think

629
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,320
three or four active ingredient

630
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,679
one case there was only

631
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:53,519
one

632
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,480
active ingredient

633
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:56,079
uh

634
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,679
but again

635
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,798
we're talking about

636
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:02,000
autism which is it's a it's a

637
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,798
spectrum

638
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:07,919
so we cannot also it's a very it's a

639
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:10,798
complex medical condition and it is a

640
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:13,360
wide range of a

641
00:25:10,798 --> 00:25:16,319
different type of autism

642
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:18,240
yeah that yeah that makes a lot of sense

643
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:20,079
so i'm curious about

644
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,759
i mean so

645
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:23,918
we've talked about how you know full

646
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,200
spectrum products are are the way to go

647
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,799
especially with these kind of

648
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
multi-faceted

649
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,599
uh disorders

650
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,000
um what about

651
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:38,240
on the cultivation side what sort of

652
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,679
diversity should we be encouraging

653
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,319
cultivators

654
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,798
be growing in order to address some of

655
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:48,319
these um these kind of multifaceted

656
00:25:44,798 --> 00:25:48,319
conditions you have any thoughts on that

657
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,599
yes it's interesting i i started my

658
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:56,879
journey with cannabis i came from the

659
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,480
agricultural biotech world and i thought

660
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,080
that a

661
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,640
the way to go is to improve

662
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,278
the strain and and i came with ideas

663
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,480
that we bring from from that world how

664
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,038
to do it

665
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,798
and it seems to me that there is a race

666
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,519
for thc

667
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,240
right

668
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,720
and and and and the less for full

669
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,640
spectrum and once we start in a plant

670
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,960
once we start to

671
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,720
breathe towards thc

672
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,038
i think we're losing

673
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,200
all the other uh

674
00:26:27,038 --> 00:26:31,038
active ingredient because the plant

675
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,000
becomes a machine

676
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:36,720
only for thc so all the energy all the

677
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:40,480
metabolic pathways everything goes

678
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,720
to thc and we believe that

679
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:44,480
especially now we don't know we don't

680
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,558
know which active ingredients are

681
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,200
working better for any medical condition

682
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,399
we just know that there are hundreds of

683
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,880
a

684
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,880
hundred of active molecules of

685
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,120
cannabinoids in the plant the capacity

686
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:01,600
of the plant to

687
00:26:57,119 --> 00:27:04,158
synthesize uh those cannabinoids is huge

688
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:05,918
and we we're still talking iron

689
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,320
interestingly we we're still talking

690
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,840
about a plant that was already

691
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:15,359
domesticated probably for 10 000 years

692
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:18,720
so if we would go to the origin if we

693
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:21,918
can find the origin of those

694
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:24,079
plants they probably have even higher

695
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:28,159
capacity or more

696
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:31,519
diverse compounds to produce it we start

697
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,480
domesticating them to one direction so

698
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:34,639
even

699
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,549
we can think about medical conditions

700
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,759
that we're trying to

701
00:27:36,549 --> 00:27:38,960
[Music]

702
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:41,599
use now

703
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:45,278
for like like

704
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:47,839
cancer i would say maybe it's a good

705
00:27:45,278 --> 00:27:49,359
opportunity to go back and find

706
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,720
other

707
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:53,439
new

708
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,720
old molecules or molecules that exist in

709
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:59,679
the origin of those plants

710
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:03,839
so i think i i think that

711
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,320
yeah we're losing a huge advantage

712
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:08,240
because it's becoming more uh

713
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,558
therapeutics more

714
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
more uh

715
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,879
more like pharmaceutical and farmer

716
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,000
knows how to do a single molecule in

717
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:21,120
very high purity very reproducible and

718
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,359
probably cheaper than any other

719
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,278
industry

720
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:27,199
yeah absolutely and we've

721
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,000
we've had a guest on the podcast before

722
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,960
who

723
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,519
um

724
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,960
their company can actually train yeast

725
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:37,038
in order to create cannabinoids so

726
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,798
i mean with that in mind if if thc

727
00:28:37,038 --> 00:28:40,798
really were the end-all be-all and that

728
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,839
were the holy grail then you could just

729
00:28:40,798 --> 00:28:43,440
you know

730
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:47,278
feed the precursor to the yeast and have

731
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,320
it pump out thc but um i think i think

732
00:28:47,278 --> 00:28:50,159
you're right there's a lot more

733
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:52,079
therapeutic potential in the plant with

734
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,159
all these other compounds

735
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,798
and i got to imagine one of the at least

736
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,799
one of the challenges in sorting that

737
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:00,158
out is the fact that

738
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:03,278
there are a number of compounds that

739
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:05,200
we're not even testing for right now and

740
00:29:03,278 --> 00:29:07,278
so it could be that there is a lesser

741
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,798
cannabinoid in low concentrations

742
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:11,440
because we also see that as well that

743
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:12,879
low doses can be very effective

744
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,558
that could be doing a lot of the heavy

745
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,320
lifting here that we're we're just not

746
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:18,398
seeing yet

747
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,398
absolutely and and that's one of the

748
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,278
advantage that we uh

749
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:25,839
encourage uh producer processors to work

750
00:29:23,278 --> 00:29:28,960
with us because we first of all we can

751
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,639
see with biomarkers one of the things we

752
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,919
can see the

753
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,240
full picture

754
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:36,880
while when we do a observation or

755
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,359
self-evaluation

756
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,278
it's really a portion it's just the tip

757
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:43,119
of the iceberg so

758
00:29:41,278 --> 00:29:46,000
a person cannot

759
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:49,359
report how is inflammation or how we

760
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,640
feel is inflammation or or or

761
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:54,000
or a

762
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,759
dysfunctional mitochondria so so when we

763
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,000
when we

764
00:29:55,759 --> 00:30:01,119
using cannabis responsive biomarkers

765
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,919
with full spectrum or different

766
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:05,918
combination or different extract we can

767
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,120
start see

768
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:08,799
what

769
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,959
compounds help

770
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:14,000
which of those biomarkers

771
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:17,120
and that allow us really to dissect the

772
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:20,558
the response and create or even

773
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:23,278
custom-made a product that help pain

774
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:27,119
help anxiety help

775
00:30:23,278 --> 00:30:30,880
hail als all those products can help

776
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:33,599
a different or more specifically for a

777
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:35,520
medical condition that now

778
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:39,278
don't exist or

779
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,679
don't don't work or not optimized

780
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:43,759
yeah and that's a great point and i have

781
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,320
to imagine too that in a lot of cases

782
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:48,240
for patients it's difficult to

783
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,480
find consistency in their products as

784
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,399
well they'll they're finding they find a

785
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,640
product that works for them

786
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,839
they use it for a while then either you

787
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,919
know that product goes away or they have

788
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,558
different source material for for a new

789
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:05,200
batch and then um you know it doesn't

790
00:31:02,558 --> 00:31:07,440
work as effectively where i think that

791
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,000
you know if we have more studies like

792
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,840
this to really identify what those

793
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,079
compounds are and how they're actually

794
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:15,759
moving the different biomarkers then you

795
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,678
know that's a real strong indication to

796
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:19,359
those cultivators and those producers

797
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,519
that you know these are the types of

798
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:22,558
products that we need

799
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,759
correct

800
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:25,599
but but that

801
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:29,200
again it brings us to

802
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:32,719
where we started it requires r d

803
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:36,240
and it requires a

804
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,278
cash or finance it requires funding

805
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,679
and

806
00:31:37,278 --> 00:31:42,558
by the end of the day

807
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:44,000
we'll not always know how to produce

808
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,519
those molecules because we don't

809
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,919
understand how the plant does them so

810
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,480
some of the one of the reason that i can

811
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,200
see inconsistency is because we cannot

812
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,159
replicate the condition the condition

813
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,759
uh

814
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,360
to grow the plant

815
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:04,000
and to always get those uh

816
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:06,158
exact molecules and and some of them

817
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,200
what we call minor cannabinoid there is

818
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:09,120
a reason

819
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:12,319
why they're minor because the plant

820
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:14,558
doesn't make enough uh whatever it makes

821
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:15,359
it right now for those conditions is

822
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,759
good

823
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:20,240
and so we need to learn also it needs to

824
00:32:17,759 --> 00:32:21,759
come also from the the plant side and

825
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,399
understanding

826
00:32:21,759 --> 00:32:26,319
how to grow plants or how to stress the

827
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:28,879
plants these are stress molecules that

828
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:31,038
produce when the plant is stressed so

829
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
how to stress the plant

830
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,759
in order to get those

831
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,000
a

832
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:37,359
cannabinoid out and to get

833
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,359
a

834
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:41,759
consistency

835
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,599
in those minor

836
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,398
well yeah no i hadn't

837
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:48,959
i hadn't thought of that that

838
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:51,278
that there might be um certain stresses

839
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,038
or certain uh things that we can we can

840
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:54,640
do to the plant to kind of coax its

841
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,000
production of these minor cannabinoids

842
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,679
that's

843
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,679
interesting

844
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,840
yes i mean we have to remember the the

845
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:04,159
cannabinoids the

846
00:33:01,839 --> 00:33:07,918
plant doesn't make it for us

847
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:09,039
it makes it to deal with the

848
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,200
uv

849
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:13,839
or it makes a deal it deals with it

850
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,679
deals with the

851
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,599
insect uh

852
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,919
sometimes pollination

853
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:20,959
uh it depends on the plant and depend on

854
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,480
the

855
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,240
on the molecule but there are needs uh

856
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,038
during stress uh sometimes it's drought

857
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,319
uh

858
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:32,079
all kind of

859
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,319
plants don't work so when they're

860
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:36,240
exposed to to stress

861
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:38,319
whatever they have in their

862
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,278
in their arsenal that's what they can

863
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:42,398
fight with so that's why the the genome

864
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:46,079
is big

865
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:49,518
and and they create much more many more

866
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:52,079
a secondary metabolite like cannabinoid

867
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,839
so and we don't know and and that's a

868
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:55,278
basic science it

869
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:57,439
that we don't have

870
00:33:55,278 --> 00:34:00,079
and companies uh

871
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:02,558
typically don't do it it comes from the

872
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,678
academia but right now there is no

873
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:06,879
funding

874
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,878
for this type of studies

875
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:10,559
yeah that's the unfortunate place we are

876
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,719
right with the um

877
00:34:10,559 --> 00:34:14,719
with the legal framework the way it is

878
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:16,719
it's really kind of

879
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,398
hamstringing us on on what we can we can

880
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:20,559
find out about this plant but you know

881
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:23,358
thankfully there's there's folks like

882
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:25,838
like you and others who are attending

883
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,480
canmed who who are doing the work

884
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:30,398
um and sharing their their findings and

885
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,079
hopefully we can all advance this

886
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,918
together um

887
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:36,159
and make the best of the situation that

888
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:39,039
we have

889
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,159
it's uh yeah and that's why uh

890
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:44,800
the way we can informatics

891
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:46,559
does it we publish and we publish the

892
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,519
first paper about the cannabis

893
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:52,639
responsive biomarkers should be pretty

894
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:56,320
soon i hope a second paper coming

895
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,800
uh which we use a little bit of

896
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:02,320
we use a different

897
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,280
separation method and identify another a

898
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,720
group of cannabis responsive biomarkers

899
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,240
mainly from a

900
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,319
from lipid

901
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:13,199
and we're going to do it with any

902
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,320
medical condition that we're working uh

903
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:19,439
will try to publish as much as possible

904
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:22,880
because i think it's between companies

905
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,960
and producer processors right now and

906
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,920
in the whole industry

907
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,720
uh generate the knowledge uh

908
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,480
and

909
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,799
try to share it because everybody's

910
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,440
going to benefit from that

911
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,039
i

912
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,519
i agree with you and i guess that's a

913
00:35:35,039 --> 00:35:39,679
good segue if people want to learn more

914
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:42,480
about the work that you all are doing or

915
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:44,078

uh

926
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:13,199
the there is a link for paper and a also

927
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:14,559
a short video about the technology

928
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:17,358
