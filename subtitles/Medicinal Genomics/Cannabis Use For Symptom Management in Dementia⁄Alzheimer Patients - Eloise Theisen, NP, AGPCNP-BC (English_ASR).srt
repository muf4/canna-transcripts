1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:08,240
okay good evening

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,919
good day good morning who knows anymore

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,519
right we're in this cold dark room i

4
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:13,599
don't know

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,160
uh i'm gonna try to be funny but this is

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,839
actually a really serious subject and

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,359
something that's very near and dear to

8
00:00:17,839 --> 00:00:21,839
my heart

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,800
i had the great pleasure of starting a

10
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:27,039
cannabis practice in 2014

11
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,160
and at that time

12
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,240
i had

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,238
some early adopters in the assisted

14
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:34,479
living community who

15
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:37,039
wanted to consider using cannabis for

16
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:39,119
their residents and

17
00:00:37,039 --> 00:00:41,519
one of my very first patients was one of

18
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,359
my most successful and most profound

19
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,640
experiences

20
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,839
that i had

21
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,359
and for those of you who've heard me

22
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,039
talk before you'll probably remember

23
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,920
this story but

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,920
i met lucy when she was 89 years old

25
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,160
and she had been diagnosed with advanced

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,039
stage dementia and her daughter who was

27
00:00:56,159 --> 00:01:00,959
her durable power of healthcare said i'd

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,039
really like to try to get my mom off of

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,079
these pain medications she was taking an

30
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:08,560
exorbitant amount of

31
00:01:05,079 --> 00:01:10,719
antipsychotics gabapentin and opioids to

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,159
try to manage her pain and her pain

33
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:14,640
wasn't managed she'd suffered from

34
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,118
multiple sclerosis as well as migraines

35
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,840
for over 40 years

36
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,400
so we began working with her

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:25,359
and i did a very low dose 2.5 milligrams

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,640
of thc and cbd three times a day

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:30,879
and within a month we were able to wean

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,200
her off all of her medications that were

41
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:36,798
related to her pain

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,159
and she started to become more cognizant

43
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,000
she was more aware she was really

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,479
exhibiting signs that her dementia was

45
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,799
no longer an issue for her

46
00:01:44,478 --> 00:01:49,759
and her daughter had actually never told

47
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,118
her that she was going to be using

48
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
cannabis she said mom there's a

49
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:54,319
supplement i want you to use and she had

50
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,759
the right to make that decision for her

51
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,758
mom

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,239
and so one day one of the med techs came

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,239
and knocked on the door to deliver lucy

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:07,039
her cannabis

55
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:09,359
and she said lucy i have your marijuana

56
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,920
and lucy was now at this time she had

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,400
turned 90 and she was about a 4 foot 11

58
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:16,479
petite french woman from france

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,599
and she said oh no

60
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:22,079
i don't do the marijuana

61
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:23,679
so um we were like okay i guess it's

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,959
time to tell lucy what's been helping

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,120
her

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,000
so we had a conversation with lucy she

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,920
was so successful in her

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,239
use of cannabis we actually were able to

67
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:36,799
get her diagnosis of dementia removed

68
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,159
from her medical record

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:42,080
and she continued to do well she's 94

70
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,519
years old

71
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,879
and

72
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,879
that's why i do what i do

73
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:51,199
so for those of you who don't know me or

74
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:53,439
don't recognize me that is me

75
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,439
pre-pandemic

76
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:56,959
my name is eloise thiessen i'm an adult

77
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:58,719
geriatric primary care nurse

78
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,878
practitioner prior to coming into

79
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:02,639
cannabis i've been in mostly oncology

80
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:05,199
and palliative care

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:07,199
the average age of my patient is 76 i've

82
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:08,560
worked now with over 7 500 patients who

83
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:10,799
want to use cannabis as a treatment

84
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,640
modality and i have a small niche of

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,280
dementia patients

86
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:17,199
97 or 90 of my patients have never used

87
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,120
it before so their cannabis naive

88
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:20,958
predominantly female they don't want to

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,480
smoke it they don't want to get high i

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,479
mean if they're not dementia related

91
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,479
they're usually coming to me for pain or

92
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:29,039
sleep

93
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:30,318
these are my disclosures

94
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,719
these are some of the learning outcomes

95
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:34,318
that we're going to talk about today

96
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:36,239
i am going to be starting a new job at

97
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:38,719
stanford next month in the outpatient

98
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,799
palliative care department and

99
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:42,400
they did hire me because of my cannabis

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,159
background so i'm really excited to be

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,158
able to bring this expertise

102
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:52,079
into uh into that community and

103
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:54,158
hopefully change hearts and minds but as

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
we all know i probably am being overly

105
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,399
idealistic

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,640
um but hopefully we'll get there

107
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,560
so dementia at a glance we know it's an

108
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,079
age-related it's an irreversible

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,438
condition and it results in

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,200
progressively

111
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:09,598
progressive cognitive decline that

112
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:11,598
impairs a person's ability to perform

113
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:13,518
activities of daily living

114
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,280
and the clinical manifestations can be

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,319
things like memory loss impaired

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,160
judgment depression mental deterioration

117
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:22,240
and they often will have what we call

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,080
neuropsychiatric symptoms that typically

119
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,079
will manifest in the later stages and

120
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,719
that's what i'm going to focus on today

121
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:30,240
is the work that i do with these

122
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,320
neuropsychiatric symptoms

123
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,560
dementia is now the seventh leading

124
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:36,319
cause of death and one of the major

125
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,280
causes of disability and dependency

126
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:41,519
among older people and in 2019 the

127
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:45,119
estimated costs related to men to

128
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:47,359
dementia was 1.3 trillion

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,879
u.s dollars and we expect this to reach

130
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,199
2.8 trillion us dollars by 2030.

131
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:56,079
it's funny i'm like trying to click my

132
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,160
laptop here so bear with me we have

133
00:04:56,079 --> 00:05:01,198
different types of dementia

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,759
alzheimer's disease compromises 60

135
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,960
percent of cases and what i'm going to

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,479
talk a lot

137
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,159
i'm going to talk about alzheimer's and

138
00:05:06,478 --> 00:05:10,240
dementia today

139
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,919
most of my patients in their chart are

140
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,600
diagnosed with alzheimer's even though

141
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:15,599
they haven't actually had imaging to

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,759
confirm that diagnosis

143
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,400
and we also see vascular dementia which

144
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:23,038
is often comes from

145
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:25,359
cerebral vascular disease

146
00:05:23,038 --> 00:05:29,038
lewy bodies disease and parkinson's

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,120
frontotemporal lobal lobar degeneration

148
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,639
hippocampal sclerosis and mixed

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,038
pathologies those are the different

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,600
types of dementia we'll see

151
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:40,000
in 2021 65 and older people with

152
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:42,639
dementia will be about 58 million in the

153
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,399
united states only and we expect this to

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,280
reach 88 million by 2050.

155
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,000
and this year in 2022

156
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:54,000
65 and older with alzheimer's disease

157
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,560
yes

158
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,560
yeah no

159
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,519
still the wrong one

160
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,639
okay

161
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,680
we know that one in nine people over the

162
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,680
age of 65 have alzheimer's disease

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,720
and just to break that down about 27

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,000
percent are between 65 and 74.

165
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,440
um 37 are between 75 and 84 years old

166
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:20,160
and 35 are 85 and older

167
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,399
and by 2050 we expect to see 12.7

168
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,400
million people over the age of 65

169
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:27,359
diagnosed with alzheimer's disease so

170
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:29,279
it's only getting worse

171
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,199
there are seven different stages

172
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:32,719
according to the global deterioration

173
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,160
scale

174
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,080
and i just want to give some context

175
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,319
here because most of my patients come to

176
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,240
me in stage five through seven so stage

177
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:42,319
one is actually no dementia

178
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,199
or cognitive decline so i find that

179
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,039
fascinating um stage two is very mild so

180
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:49,120
this is usually age related right you

181
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:51,360
might be forgetting

182
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,959
a name or something like that you get to

183
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,639
stage three that's mild cognitive

184
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:56,478
decline and this is usually when other

185
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,800
people are noticing that you're having

186
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:00,879
some memory issues so you may be

187
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,000
performing poorly at work you may get

188
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:06,959
lost in certain locations

189
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,720
then we're going to get to stage four

190
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,399
this is often described as mild

191
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,800
dimension when i work with patients

192
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:15,120
who've gone through

193
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,280
you know a neurology

194
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,680
consultation they're usually described

195
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:21,359
in mild moderate moderate to severe and

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,038
severe they don't actually use these

197
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,960
stages

198
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:26,560
but we know in moderate you often you'll

199
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:28,000
see that they're starting to have a loss

200
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
of current events they're not as

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,800
knowledgeable about what's going on

202
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:33,038
around them maybe they're struggling

203
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
with their finances this is where you'll

204
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:36,639
start to see people have elder abuse

205
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,478
issues where you know they're having

206
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
people can take advantage of them with

207
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,800
scams

208
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,879
stage five is usually more moderate

209
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,919
severe cognitive decline and this is

210
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,520
where they're starting to need

211
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:49,598
assistance this is generally when they

212
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:51,120
end up in an assisted living community

213
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,279
or maybe the families are starting to

214
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,800
pay for them to have additional help at

215
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:56,559
home

216
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,800
and then when they get into stages six

217
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,478
and seven they're pretty severe

218
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,079
they're forgetting names of their spouse

219
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,918
at this point they may not recognize

220
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:06,478
them they may think it's their son or

221
00:08:03,918 --> 00:08:08,560
daughter or other family member

222
00:08:06,478 --> 00:08:10,000
they usually require assistance with

223
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,839
activities of daily living and they're

224
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,079
often incontinent

225
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:16,239
of bowel and bladder they usually need

226
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,800
help with eating so they might be doing

227
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,720
finger foods all right so in the stage

228
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,400
six and seven

229
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,160
again this is mostly where my patients

230
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,159
at sometimes i get them in that stage

231
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,439
five where they're just

232
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,960
you know needing a little bit of

233
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:30,478
assistance but not a lot and then of

234
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:33,038
course by stage seven they're pretty

235
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,519
severely um

236
00:08:33,038 --> 00:08:38,639
demented and often can't even utter more

237
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,879
than a word or two

238
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:43,278
so what kind of options do we have for

239
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,600
these patients well in my opinion not

240
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:46,958
great ones we do have some fda approved

241
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,080
drugs that are

242
00:08:46,958 --> 00:08:50,639
you know

243
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,040
supposed to be used for things

244
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,278
treatment of dementia but i just want to

245
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:57,838
make a point that none of these drugs

246
00:08:55,278 --> 00:09:00,159
actually slow or stop the damage or

247
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,320
destruction of the neurons that cause

248
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,000
alzheimer's disease okay

249
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,000
but we know here that some of these may

250
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,480
actually temporarily improve cognitive

251
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,159
symptoms by increasing neurotransmitters

252
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,480
they may block certain receptors in the

253
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:14,319
brain from excessive stimulation and

254
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,080
then our newest one there and most

255
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,240
controversial one

256
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,160
claims to possibly slow the progression

257
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,959
of the disease but i do think the jury

258
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:23,838
is

259
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,838
out on that one

260
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,799
and just some interesting you know

261
00:09:26,799 --> 00:09:31,278
research around well how effective are

262
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:32,719
these drugs will the acetylcholinase

263
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:34,159
inhibitors approved for memory

264
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,040
improvement

265
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,879
some of them have very low demonstration

266
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,599
of actually improving cognitive

267
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:45,360
cognition scores in fact 26 percent

268
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,200
that's our irrecept um and then 30 to 37

269
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,039
and many of my patients when they come

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,640
to me and they're stage six and seven of

271
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:54,240
dementia are still on these medications

272
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,720
so one of the things i like to get them

273
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
off as soon as possible so how do we

274
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,560
manage their symptoms

275
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
well not well

276
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:04,319
we use antipsychotics which come with a

277
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,480
black box warning and that black box

278
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,920
warning says well if you use these in a

279
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,920
patient who has dementia they have a

280
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:11,838
higher risk of death

281
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:15,199
we use antidepressants we use

282
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:17,440
anti-anxiety and hypnotic medications

283
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,000
but these are not fda approved so we

284
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,320
have no fda approved pharmaceuticals for

285
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,919
agitation or any of the neuropsychiatric

286
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,079
symptoms in dementia alzheimer's

287
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:28,799
patients so we'll see things again

288
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:31,599
agitation restlessness i see screaming

289
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:33,759
and yelling sleep disturbances sun

290
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
downing and wandering

291
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,439
and on very rare occasions i will see an

292
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,479
increase in sexual

293
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,360
um

294
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,278
behaviors as well and that's usually

295
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,519
i'll talk a little bit about that

296
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:48,159
can be interesting with thc

297
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:51,120
um common in all types of dementia we'll

298
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,719
see these neuropsychiatric symptoms

299
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,879
like i said they can manifest like

300
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,879
agitation anxiety

301
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:59,919
aggression depression these are usually

302
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,759
what are the most disruptive to the

303
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:03,439
assisted living communities the families

304
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:05,600
and the caregivers

305
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,959
they present significant physical risk

306
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,839
to the patients because they can

307
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:12,159
actually become violent right they're so

308
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,920
um anxious and agitated they can scratch

309
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,600
they can hit

310
00:11:13,919 --> 00:11:17,039
they can be at risk for falling and

311
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,320
injuring themselves because they'll get

312
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,919
up and

313
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
move really quickly

314
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,078
often worse in the afternoon that sun

315
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,839
downing can happen anywhere between 1 pm

316
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,359
and 5 pm

317
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,640
it's poor quality of life and it's

318
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,879
really hard to watch your loved ones

319
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,679
suffer like that

320
00:11:30,879 --> 00:11:35,360
and it's really hard to try to identify

321
00:11:33,679 --> 00:11:36,799
what their needs are especially in

322
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
assisted living communities where the

323
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,919
staffing is so low

324
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:42,000
they don't get the attention that they

325
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,879
need

326
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,320
so first i'm going to talk about

327
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:46,799
dimension again

328
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,720
on tuesday i mentioned this can of keys

329
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,039
which facilitates access to public

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,600
science and aggregated critical data

331
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:56,240
points when you put in dementia there's

332
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,879
a very few studies actually looking at

333
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,079
dementia

334
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,600
so i want to talk just a little bit

335
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:03,599
about these studies and it'll be

336
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,120
interesting because when we look at

337
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,200
alzheimer's there's actually quite a bit

338
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,879
more because people ask me all the time

339
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,040
okay how did you figure out what to give

340
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,120
them eloise well there's a little bit of

341
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:15,039
data out there particularly looking at

342
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
synthetic thc

343
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:19,199
and this was a six week study that was

344
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,680
done in 2018 and it was a small study of

345
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,360
just 39 patients but they used synthetic

346
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,638
delta nine thc i believe it was

347
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,399
dernavanol

348
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
and then game of placebo for about six

349
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,720
weeks and they noted that the agitation

350
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,639
was significantly improved in these

351
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,920
patients who had the delta nine thc

352
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,919
complete compared to the placebo

353
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,958
it actually helped with other symptoms

354
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,519
as well shocking right

355
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,679
and this was done in 2014

356
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,120
it was a retrospective systematic chart

357
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,519
review of 40 patients who'd been

358
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,278
diagnosed with dementia again

359
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,639
small sample size but they were using

360
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:56,320
dronabinol

361
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,480
again found significant improvement in

362
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:02,560
agitation sleep and eating

363
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,240
this was a study done in 2017 to

364
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:06,799
determine that chronic low doses of

365
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,240
delta 9 thc restored cognitive function

366
00:13:06,799 --> 00:13:09,759
in old mice

367
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,240
and actually reversed age-related

368
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:14,639
decline in cognitive performance of mice

369
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,079
aged 12 and 18 months what do you think

370
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
the number one

371
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:18,879
thing that i'll hear from other

372
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,040
clinicians when i want to consider

373
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:24,078
cannabis in the older adult what do you

374
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:25,679
think their stigma says

375
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:26,459
yeah you're going to make their memory

376
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,919
worse

377
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,839
[Laughter]

378
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:31,278
i'm like really that's our that's our

379
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:33,680
objective here

380
00:13:31,278 --> 00:13:35,679
delta 9 thc we know binds with cb1

381
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,199
receptors and the restoration of cb1

382
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:39,439
signaling in older adults might be

383
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,759
effective strategy to treat age-related

384
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,600
cognitive impairments now i focus

385
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,439
predominantly on symptom management my

386
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,600
practice but i will show you a couple

387
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:48,720
studies about can we use cannabis to

388
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,759
prevent

389
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,480
dementia alzheimer's disease

390
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:55,439
this study done at harvard in 2016

391
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,199
looked

392
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,120
it was again a very small one but they

393
00:13:57,198 --> 00:14:01,439
found that cognitive function improved

394
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,560
and 24 adults who smoked cannabis for

395
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,399
three months

396
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:08,078
of course they also reported better

397
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:09,679
sleep less depression and a significant

398
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,159
decrease in their use of medications

399
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:15,039
such as opioids

400
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:17,679
i really do want to use cannabinoids to

401
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:20,078
describe in my patients

402
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:22,239
when they're on polypharmacy

403
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:24,319
so this was a meta-analysis system a

404
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,759
systematic review performed they're

405
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,680
looking to determine the level of

406
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,240
evidence both qualitative and

407
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:32,319
quantitative to support the efficacy and

408
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,959
safety of using cannabinoids and as a

409
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,480
treatment for neuropsychiatric symptoms

410
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,638
it was actually hard for them to draw a

411
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,759
conclusion so they had nine publications

412
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:44,720
including data from six clinical trials

413
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:47,439
with 422 patient treatments psychoactive

414
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,199
cannabinoids or placebo

415
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,800
so they couldn't draw a conclusion

416
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,639
whether or not

417
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:53,838
the psychoactive cannabinoids were

418
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,480
effective in the treatment of

419
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:59,760
neuropsychiatric symptoms particularly

420
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,680
agitation and aggression

421
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,480
this is a pilot study done in geneva

422
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:06,879
only 10 females and actually dementia

423
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,039
does affect females more than males

424
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,958
about 60 to 40 percent

425
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:12,958
and i definitely see that in my practice

426
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:14,879
i have more women than

427
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:17,039
men with dementia

428
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:17,838
so in these 10 patients they were trying

429
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,078
to

430
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,480
treat their severe behavioral problems

431
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:24,399
they started out with an oral thc cbd

432
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:27,039
extract and you can see the progression

433
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:29,519
here between two two weeks to two months

434
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:31,519
they did do some dose escalations here

435
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,278
um and ended up with about a two to one

436
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:36,078
cbd to thc

437
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,799
i keep pushing this so if i fall over

438
00:15:36,078 --> 00:15:40,799
just you know we'll have fun with it

439
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,958
they actually had a 40 reduction in the

440
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,120
cohen mansfield agitation inventory

441
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:49,518
score after two months with a

442
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,519
cbd two to one thc ratio

443
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,680
another systematic review of clinical

444
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,198
effectiveness and guidelines for medical

445
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,519
cannabis treatment and dementia this was

446
00:15:55,198 --> 00:16:01,359
done in canada and they looked at 12

447
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,679
studies from 97 to 2019 so that included

448
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:06,159
six randomized controlled trials two

449
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:10,159
cohorts four case studies for a total of

450
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:12,719
178 patients 65 years and older and they

451
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:15,198
had administered cannabinoids including

452
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:18,560
dronabinol as well as plant derived

453
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:21,758
delta 9 thc and nabalone which is also

454
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:24,399
synthetic thc it's known as sesame

455
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,639
and their dosages range from 2.5 to 7.

456
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,879
these are low dosages right so i you

457
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,639
know when dr goldstein was up here

458
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:33,039
earlier talking about having

459
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,560
poor access to low thc products i have

460
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:36,799
the same issue

461
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,638
for my older adult patients my dementia

462
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:40,958
patients it's incredibly hard right now

463
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,799
because i as you'll see i start them on

464
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,439
two milligrams it's hard to find

465
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:48,000
products i can't do tinctures and i'll

466
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,759
talk about that in a minute why

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,839
four of the seven sorry four of the

468
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,159
twelve primary studies noted significant

469
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,240
improvement of the neuropsychiatric

470
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,600
symptoms in the cannabis group

471
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,278
and eight studies didn't find any

472
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,040
evidence to support cannabinoids in the

473
00:16:59,278 --> 00:17:04,798
treatment of dementia so the question

474
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:06,798
for me here is are we looking at um

475
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:10,000
issues because there's a

476
00:17:06,798 --> 00:17:11,838
full spectrum versus an isolate here you

477
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,119
know do we see better results and i'm

478
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,519
going to talk about what i see in my

479
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,519
practice

480
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,240
so looking at you know can cannabinoids

481
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,919
actually help in the treatment or

482
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,199
prevention of alzheimer's disease

483
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,759
there's some

484
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:27,360
pre-clinical research that's promising

485
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,079
we know that cannabinoids have been

486
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:31,678
shown to cause vasodilation of brain

487
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,000
blood vessels and increased cerebral

488
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,679
blood flow so there's the possibility of

489
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,839
using cannabinoids and alzheimer's

490
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,320
disease where cerebral flow

491
00:17:37,839 --> 00:17:41,839
is decreased and could improve cerebral

492
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:43,599
perfusion

493
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:46,079
and there was a study that found cbd

494
00:17:43,599 --> 00:17:48,319
reduced the infarct volume in animal

495
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:51,038
studies with focal or global cerebral

496
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:53,359
ischemia and the authors suggested that

497
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,599
cbd could potentially prevent vascular

498
00:17:53,359 --> 00:17:57,038
dementia those patients are incredibly

499
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,240
hard to manage

500
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:00,558
um

501
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:04,240
and so are the fronto

502
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:04,240
temporal lobe dementia patients

503
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,919
so then we have cannabis and alzheimer's

504
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,440
and now look at the research

505
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:14,000
go back to my dementia slide it was

506
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,600
eight primary studies we have 68 primary

507
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,640
studies when it comes to alzheimer's

508
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,959
disease

509
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,200
so better research here

510
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,798
but again as i said most of my patients

511
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,759
are being diagnosed with alzheimer's

512
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:29,359
disease but don't necessarily have

513
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:31,200
the imaging to support that diagnosis so

514
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:33,119
we know that cbd can demonstrate

515
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,919
neuropath neuroprotective effects

516
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:37,439
similar to vitamin e and vitamin c so

517
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
similar to current pharmacological

518
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,600
options but without the toxicity

519
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:43,600
but we don't have any studies to

520
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:45,839
currently examine cannabis as a

521
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:46,959
treatment for alzheimer's disease in

522
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,798
humans

523
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:51,519
cbd can inhibit plaque buildup in the

524
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:52,879
brain and thc competitively binds with

525
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,720
acetylcholine or

526
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,240
acetylcholinesterase

527
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,679
i should have practiced and prevents

528
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,480
plaque buildup

529
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,960
and i need glasses in one study with 78

530
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:05,519
patients thc reduced nighttime agitation

531
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,519
so again this was gernabinol just at 2.5

532
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,759
milligrams it was all they were giving

533
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:13,200
of thc over four weeks very low dosages

534
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,879
and this is one of the more famous

535
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,840
studies that people have known about at

536
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,559
the salk institute where they determined

537
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:22,639
that thc promotes the removal of toxic

538
00:19:20,558 --> 00:19:24,558
clumps of amyloid beta protein in the

539
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,640
brain which is thought to be contributed

540
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:27,759
to alzheimer's disease although i think

541
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
that this is

542
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,599
being reviewed right now as to whether

543
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:33,279
that's actually true

544
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,279
researchers stated that cannabinoids

545
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:37,200
might be neuroprotective against the

546
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:39,200
symptoms of alzheimer's by reducing

547
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,840
inflammation and amyloid beta

548
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,360
accumulation in nerve cells

549
00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:44,879
and i do have a lot of people who come

550
00:19:43,359 --> 00:19:46,399
to me when they

551
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,640
i'm working with their

552
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,720
their family member who want to consider

553
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,120
cannabinoids as a preventative and it's

554
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,798
really hard for me to to work with them

555
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:56,639
so i won't be focusing on any of that

556
00:19:54,798 --> 00:19:58,079
because again the data is not really

557
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,520
there

558
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,720
and this is a study being done in

559
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:02,079
australia

560
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,839
and it's going to look at just 50

561
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:07,038
participants 65 and older with mild

562
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:08,399
dementia living in assisted living

563
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,200
communities and they're going to use a 3

564
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,880
to 2 thc to cbd oral spray so it'll be

565
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,038
good to see that when that data comes

566
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,039
out

567
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,038
so in my practice now

568
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:23,120
i've got about 76 patients in california

569
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:25,119
that have been

570
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,879
predominantly coming from the assisted

571
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:29,839
living communities again most of them

572
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,880
are 65 of them are female their average

573
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,158
age is 83 by the time they come to me

574
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:36,559
most of them are diagnosed with

575
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,039
alzheimer's disease about 92 percent

576
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:42,079
have a small amount of vascular dementia

577
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,519
frontal lobe and lewy body disease

578
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:45,119
mostly starting their treatment when

579
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,639
they're at stage six or remember they're

580
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:49,279
pretty dysfunctional at this point they

581
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,280
need a lot of assistance with adls

582
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:53,759
their typical behaviors are anxiety

583
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,519
agitation aggression obsessive

584
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:57,200
compulsive behaviors

585
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:58,639
they're very disruptive right they're in

586
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,720
these assisted living communities

587
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,559
they're yelling out they're walking into

588
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,839
other residents rooms they're yelling at

589
00:21:02,558 --> 00:21:07,839
them and it's it just anxiety causes

590
00:21:05,839 --> 00:21:10,000
more anxiety so sometimes it can just be

591
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,918
very very upsetting

592
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,440
most of them have tried about four

593
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,200
different types of pharmaceuticals to

594
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,759
manage their behaviors before they come

595
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:19,200
to cannabis and they're often coming to

596
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,798
me because they want to try something

597
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,960
quote unquote more natural something

598
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:25,839
that may not have as many side effects

599
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:27,120
the antipsychotics can be very

600
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:28,240
sedating

601
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:31,199
and often

602
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:33,679
zombifying for their loved ones

603
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:35,840
most the time they are

604
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,759
in an assisted living community about 75

605
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,199
percent those that are not an assisted

606
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:40,960
living community are trying to keep

607
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,360
their loved ones at home

608
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:47,360
by managing their behaviors

609
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:47,359
with cannabis versus pharmaceuticals

610
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,678
um so this is an 83 year old male who

611
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,159
came to me with vascular dementia stage

612
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:56,159
six he was living at home with his wife

613
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,840
his caregiver came in about four hours a

614
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,679
day he was verbally aggressive and

615
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,599
anxious although i never witnessed it

616
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:04,880
every time she brought him into my

617
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:06,000
office he was the nicest politest man

618
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
and she would look at me and she said

619
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,960
always i swear i'm not making this up i

620
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,480
said i know i believe you

621
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,558
you can see right here if you look at

622
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,480
his medications his dosages are

623
00:22:14,558 --> 00:22:18,399
incredibly low for what we would

624
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
typically prescribe so she had

625
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,200
verbalized with me my father is

626
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720
incredibly sensitive to medications

627
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,640
and i said okay and she said that's why

628
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,480
i'm terrified of putting him on any of

629
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:31,200
these antipsychotics i want to try

630
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,279
cannabis i said okay

631
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:35,360
so we started out with a 10 to 1 cbd

632
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,720
very very small improvements that we saw

633
00:22:35,359 --> 00:22:40,879
and i thought okay

634
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,600
i like thc in these neuropsychiatric

635
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,120
symptoms so let's let's increase his thc

636
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:47,918
a little bit we'll try a four to one

637
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,918
tincture actually increase disagitation

638
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,840
um pretty quickly within the first day

639
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,759
so then i said okay let's take it the

640
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:55,038
other direction and go higher cbd less

641
00:22:53,759 --> 00:22:57,038
thc

642
00:22:55,038 --> 00:22:59,279
we did eight drops just once a day he

643
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,200
was a little less anxious but agitation

644
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:02,798
started to increase when we tried to

645
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
increase either the frequency or the

646
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,839
dose

647
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,919
so i wasn't able to increase the dose or

648
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,319
add any additional dosages due to his

649
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,280
increased symptoms but the daughter was

650
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:13,599
really

651
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:15,038
really keen on trying cannabis she said

652
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,079
is there anything else we can try and i

653
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:17,519
said well

654
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:19,359
since he seems to be sensitive to

655
00:23:17,519 --> 00:23:22,639
medications why don't we try a product

656
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:26,558
that might bypass the liver so we

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:28,640
decided to try a cbd transdermal patch

658
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:30,319
and you know knowing that he had been

659
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,919
sensitive to medications i said okay

660
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:34,158
wait let's take this patch and cut it

661
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,280
into 10 strips we'll start with one

662
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,039
milligram

663
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:40,000
transdermal

664
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:41,119
it caused severe incontinence of his

665
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,038
bowel

666
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:45,918
he had quite a bit of diarrhea and

667
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:48,480
shakiness but his mood was improved

668
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:50,080
and she was like oh my god

669
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,558
if i can just deal with this you know

670
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:53,918
incontinence of of diarrhea i don't know

671
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:56,079
i think we're onto something and i'm

672
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:57,520
like oh my god

673
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:58,879
so i checked in with her another day and

674
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,558
she's like yeah it's pretty bad eloise

675
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,120
he's

676
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,960
constantly in a brief and i said okay

677
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:06,959
let's try a lower dose

678
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,759
so i took the one milligram sections and

679
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:13,120
had them cut into thirds

680
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:15,200
so 0.33 milligrams cbd every 72 hours

681
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:17,839
now the manufacturer recommends that you

682
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:19,360
put one patch on every eight to twelve

683
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:21,359
hours

684
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:22,879
he had significant mood improvement

685
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,798
throughout the day and his side effects

686
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,240
of the diarrhea and incontinence even

687
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:30,000
resolved that was his dose

688
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,440
incredible

689
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,038
so when my patients tell me that they're

690
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,640
sensitive to medications i believe them

691
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:38,879
this is a 72 year old female with

692
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,278
dementia she was residing in an assisted

693
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,278
living facility progressive symptoms of

694
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,640
mood swings anger yelling out at the

695
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:45,919
facility

696
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,320
they were trying to manage her symptoms

697
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,840
with gabapentin and quetiapine

698
00:24:48,319 --> 00:24:52,558
they were helping but the husband didn't

699
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:53,439
want to increase the dose

700
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,278
so

701
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,000
i actually recommended thc for her

702
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,000
agitation and aggression and initially

703
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,720
the facility refused to allow the

704
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,720
resident to have cannabis as a treatment

705
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:08,479
so

706
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,640
after realizing you know that they

707
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,278
weren't going to allow for it

708
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,360
i said what about cbd hemp it's legal in

709
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:16,880
the state of california you're actually

710
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,479
a national

711
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:23,360
company and i work with other facilities

712
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:25,360
in other cities that allow me to

713
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:28,158
write recommendations for your patients

714
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:29,678
to have this medication dispensed and

715
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,400
she said

716
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,798
i'm the danville location

717
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,000
these are my rules and i went

718
00:25:34,798 --> 00:25:39,119
no they're not

719
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,038
so i called the oms budsmen and talked

720
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:44,479
to them and said the neurologist has

721
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:46,480
signed off on it cbd hemp is legal it's

722
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:49,200
been descheduled and so we were actually

723
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:52,159
able to start cbd for her

724
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,080
because it's what the husband wanted

725
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,240
so we started with 10 milligrams daily

726
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:58,079
and increased to 30 milligrams daily

727
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,919
with good effect and we were able to

728
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:02,399
actually

729
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,480
stop any increased dosages of the other

730
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:07,278
medications he didn't want to take her

731
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,880
off her other medications you know i

732
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:10,960
really allow the patients and family

733
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,640
members to share in that decision

734
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,278
because sometimes

735
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,720
when we do describe their symptoms can

736
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:18,319
get worse and we have to play around

737
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,200
with the dosages and sometimes they're

738
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:20,879
just

739
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,880
happy that the quality of life is

740
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,880
improved

741
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
this was a 78 year old female who had

742
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,919
lewy body disease he was a retired

743
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
pediatrician and he was also residing in

744
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,440
an assisted living facility

745
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,359
he was one of the ones that would wander

746
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,480
into other residence rooms and he was

747
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,839
very

748
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,679
destructive

749
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:41,519
and disruptive he would actually break

750
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,919
things in the rooms and it would have

751
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:45,440
this domino effect and at the end of the

752
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,200
night you know it's like when you have a

753
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,600
kid that cries and it causes all the

754
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,798
other kids to cry

755
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:53,119
you know so they would actually have to

756
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:54,720
call the wife every night and she would

757
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:57,038
have to come down and calm him down that

758
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,960
was the solution

759
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,440
so he was getting quetiapine and

760
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,038
lorazepam as needed they weren't really

761
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,120
effective she was the only thing that

762
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,798
was effective and she was tired when i

763
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:10,319
went and met with them she just started

764
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,400
crying i cannot do this anymore eloise

765
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:14,399
um so i put him on a one-to-one cbd to

766
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,240
thc of just two and a half milligrams

767
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
each three times a day and within two

768
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,880
days the wife stopped getting phone

769
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,558
calls

770
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,278
she was actually able to have her own

771
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:25,839
quality of life his dose remained at

772
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:28,159
that for five years until he passed away

773
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:30,398
i never had to do any dose escalations

774
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:32,000
with him

775
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:35,678
and we successfully weaned him off

776
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,599
quetiapine and lorazepam

777
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,600
so you know when looking at using

778
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:41,678
cannabinoids for dementia patients these

779
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:43,918
are just some of my pearls here

780
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,640
for thc i usually start at about two

781
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,320
milligrams two to five depending on the

782
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:50,640
severity of their agitation whether or

783
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:52,720
not they've experienced any had

784
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,640
experience with cannabis before

785
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:56,558
and i often schedule it after lunch and

786
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,038
dinner to cover the sun downing time

787
00:27:56,558 --> 00:28:01,119
usually they're okay in the morning

788
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:02,879
if it's cbd that i'm going to start with

789
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,479
it's usually between 10 and 25

790
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,000
milligrams starting dose and that's

791
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
usually if they're not candidates for

792
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,278
thc

793
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,000
um the the conversation i have a lot of

794
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,240
time because the the way that um the

795
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,759
phone calls go is hi eloise i'm calling

796
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
you about my mom i want to put her on

797
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:19,759
cbd like they're already telling me what

798
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,519
they want right i was like okay so then

799
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,119
i you know do the consultation and i'll

800
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:25,679
say well

801
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:27,199
you know your mom seems pretty miserable

802
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,440
and a little bit of thc might make her

803
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:31,679
laugh again and it she might be more

804
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,200
pleasant to be around and she might be a

805
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,600
little bit more con

806
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,679
conversational with you um she might eat

807
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,959
better she might sleep better

808
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,880
and they're like oh

809
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,558
well that doesn't sound so bad

810
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,840
you know i'm like yeah you know i tell

811
00:28:42,558 --> 00:28:45,839
them all the time we know so much now

812
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:47,519
about thc and dosing that we can often

813
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:51,599
control their experience and really

814
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:53,038
avoid them from having adverse effects

815
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,959
my personal experience is that full

816
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:56,640
spectrum products do appear to work

817
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,640
better and they're less likely to need

818
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,600
dose increases and i can keep their dose

819
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,440
low

820
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:03,038
so on average my dementia patients do

821
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,240
well with around anywhere from four to

822
00:29:03,038 --> 00:29:08,558
fifteen milligrams of thc daily divided

823
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,519
in about two to three doses and about 15

824
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:13,119
to 50 milligrams of cbd daily divided in

825
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:15,200
two to three doses

826
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:17,839
i don't do very many combinations or

827
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,519
ratios of cannabinoids

828
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:22,720
because what i've actually found is that

829
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,639
women respond best to low dose thc cbd

830
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,720
can actually increase their agitation

831
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,320
anxiety and aggression

832
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:30,240
i've seen it over and over again so i

833
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,519
just tend to go with thc in very low

834
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,038
dosages

835
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,558
it doesn't create a lot of side effects

836
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:36,480
the other

837
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:38,158
concern that a lot of times other

838
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,759
clinicians will have is they're afraid

839
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,720
it's going to increase their risk of

840
00:29:39,759 --> 00:29:43,278
falls

841
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,600
i'm not saying that either

842
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:47,359
men with anxiety and dementia tend to

843
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:49,199
respond best to low to moderate levels

844
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,119
of cbd

845
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,038
sometimes like i said cbd may increase

846
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:55,199
agitation in particular in those who are

847
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:58,879
already taking quetiapine so i do try to

848
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,360
advocate to reduce or remove that

849
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,200
again with the quality of life the

850
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,479
describing really is depends on the

851
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,159
patient and family members wishes

852
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,319
but if they are having significant side

853
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,399
effects i do try to encourage them to

854
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,599
consider reductions and i usually wait

855
00:30:12,398 --> 00:30:15,439
about

856
00:30:13,599 --> 00:30:19,038
two to four weeks of putting them on a

857
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:20,558
regimen before making those changes

858
00:30:19,038 --> 00:30:22,720
not only do i not see falls i don't see

859
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,480
drug-to-drug interactions like i said if

860
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,278
there is some increased agitation with

861
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,960
quetiapine we can usually modify

862
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,880
the dose of quetiapine or even the

863
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,640
cannabis if we need to and resolve that

864
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,640
pretty quickly

865
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,200
and family members and assisted living

866
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,120
community staff say that they see such

867
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,038
dramatic improvements in moods and less

868
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,639
resistance to care

869
00:30:41,038 --> 00:30:44,879
and now they've become my strongest

870
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,640
advocates and talking to family members

871
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,640
about getting their

872
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:51,440
residents on some sort of cannabinoid

873
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,038
regimen

874
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,960
what are the challenges and barriers

875
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,960
well you've heard a lot today about

876
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,720
berries but not many practitioners are

877
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,159
willing to venture into cannabis

878
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:04,558
medicine so i'm sort of their unicorn

879
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,320
in the bay area for being able to offer

880
00:31:04,558 --> 00:31:08,240
this to these

881
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:10,639
residents in the community

882
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,720
an order is required so somebody has to

883
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,080
write an order for them to be able to

884
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,440
dispense it

885
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,879
if they go into a skilled nursing

886
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,038
facility it often cannot be continued

887
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,559
it's still federally illegal

888
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:25,200
and in california we have to follow

889
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,960
title 22 for cannabis administration so

890
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,880
that means that labels are required on

891
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:30,960
the product just like it would be any

892
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,799
other controlled substance and this is

893
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,240
why i can't use tinctures

894
00:31:32,798 --> 00:31:35,918
because they have to be able to count

895
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,159
the product at the end of the day to

896
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,600
make sure that if they had 25 thc

897
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,360
edibles and they administered three

898
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,038
doses that they have 22 at the end of

899
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:44,719
the day and they can't really do that

900
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,879
with tinctures which is

901
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,200
makes my

902
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,919
availability of products even smaller

903
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
because of that

904
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,799
and these are just some of my

905
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,559
recommendations for practice so again

906
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:59,278
consider an oral regimen if the patient

907
00:31:56,558 --> 00:32:01,038
can tolerate oral administration

908
00:31:59,278 --> 00:32:04,000
i'm not opposed to inhalation but it's

909
00:32:01,038 --> 00:32:06,640
not really something that's available in

910
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,558
the communities that i work with

911
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,399
consider a transdermal patch if they do

912
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:13,038
have issues with

913
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,038
medication um you know if they are

914
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,240
sensitive to it consider a transdermal

915
00:32:15,038 --> 00:32:18,000
patch

916
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:21,038
they are expensive so they can be

917
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,558
difficult for people to afford

918
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:24,798
consider low

919
00:32:22,558 --> 00:32:26,480
thc start low and slow but but don't be

920
00:32:24,798 --> 00:32:28,879
afraid of it it seems to work really

921
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,798
really well for a lot of these

922
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,960
patients and follow up based on the

923
00:32:30,798 --> 00:32:34,398
severity of the symptoms often it takes

924
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,319
me

925
00:32:34,398 --> 00:32:38,239
sometimes the i get it right right away

926
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:39,359
sometimes it takes me three or four

927
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,278
weeks

928
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,038
to get them on a regimen but often once

929
00:32:41,278 --> 00:32:46,319
they're on a regimen they do well for

930
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:48,000
years without needing any dose changing

931
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:49,759
and it's not a great business model for

932
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,278
me because they don't come back you know

933
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:54,558
i mean they're not coming in a lot but

934
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,720
it's really satisfying as a clinician

935
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:58,158
and those are my references and i know

936
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,798
to whoever's up next i'm sorry we had

937
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,370
technical difficulties but um

938
00:33:00,798 --> 00:33:04,720
i guess that means no time for questions

939
00:33:04,369 --> 00:33:09,748
[Music]

940
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,749
