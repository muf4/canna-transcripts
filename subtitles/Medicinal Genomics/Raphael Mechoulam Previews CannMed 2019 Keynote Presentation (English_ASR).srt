1
00:00:02,448 --> 00:00:08,609
so there are many things that still are

2
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:11,279
not known in the field of cannabis the

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:14,399
plant produces a group of compounds

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:17,669
called cannabinoid assets the assets

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,890
were not investigated until recently not

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,480
very thoroughly at least because they

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,550
are not stable they break down the

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,079
medical industry the major medical

9
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,149
industry want to have pure compounds

10
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,210
that have been investigated they have

11
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:36,530
been thoroughly tested so a few years

12
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,660
ago we decided to go and then try to

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:42,179
stabilize this asset and we were able

14
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:45,058
chemically to stabilize them and now it

15
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:48,960
is possible to investigative companies

16
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:51,119
that I worked with EPM works on the

17
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,489
assets of the cannabinoids we are

18
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:56,369
looking into the activities of these

19
00:00:53,488 --> 00:01:01,378
assets and they seem to be important

20
00:00:56,369 --> 00:01:04,469
very important in a variety of fields so

21
00:01:01,378 --> 00:01:08,548
chances are that here we have something

22
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:12,140
and of considerable medical importance

23
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:15,420
and I'm sure that there will be ways to

24
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:19,618
introduce these compounds as medical

25
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,509
agents collaboration is absolutely a

26
00:01:19,618 --> 00:01:27,930
necessity yes there is a meeting now of

27
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:30,950
can met and EP em together and it's

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:33,360
going to take place in Pasadena and I'm

29
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:35,700
going to fly there right to give a

30
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:38,219
general picture of what we've been doing

31
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,670
and what I hope will be done in the

32
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:42,929
future

33
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:46,890
I expect to show that cannabis and

34
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,140
cannabinoids are not a tiny project one

35
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:53,368
compound for one disease but to show

36
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:58,618
that it is really a very very wide field

37
00:01:53,368 --> 00:02:02,549
of research we need good new drugs in a

38
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:06,769
huge number of fields it's an open field

39
00:02:02,549 --> 00:02:09,810
for new drugs new preparations and

40
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:11,849
believed there will be a lot of work in

41
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,949
this field over the next decade was

42
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:19,650
so maybe two victims

43
00:02:12,949 --> 00:02:21,709

44
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,709
