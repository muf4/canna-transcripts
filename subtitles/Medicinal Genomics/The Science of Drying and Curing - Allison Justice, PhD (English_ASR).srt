1
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:06,639
all right welcome everybody

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,440
um

3
00:00:06,639 --> 00:00:12,000
we are gonna shift gears and you know

4
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:13,359
take it from from the human and go back

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,640
to the plant

6
00:00:13,359 --> 00:00:18,480
um and talk about what we've seen what

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,960
we're going to work on with with drying

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,960
and curing

9
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,759
all right so to give you a little bit of

10
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
my background and just an idea of

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,760
of where i come from and and where some

12
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,000
of the this research comes from you know

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,440
i grew up in south carolina

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
you know we're able to grow hemp there

15
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:37,759
but no cannabis

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,200
after grad school went to san diego

17
00:00:37,759 --> 00:00:41,199
worked there for about three and a half

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,440
years in the medical industry

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,280
and then bounced back to my home state

20
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,599
south carolina

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,960
where now we grow hemp

22
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,640
large scale production of liners so

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,759
clones

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
lots and lots lots of other plants

25
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,759
we're vertically integrated so we do a

26
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,920
little bit of everything

27
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:03,839
but you know my passion always goes back

28
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,879
to the research and so i'll talk about

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,799
the

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,880
the

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,560
research group we've formed

32
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,399
later but you know of course that's

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,439
where my passion is and and that's where

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,439
this data comes from

35
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,000
all right so

36
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,399
you know drawing and curing what is it

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,359
um you know i was asking this question

38
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,560
back in 2016 when i was

39
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:28,640
in san diego

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,640
and you know the i think the answer then

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,640
was a lot of i don't know but i think da

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,478
da da da and i think that answer mostly

43
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,118
is still i think but dah dah dah

44
00:01:36,478 --> 00:01:40,799
we've got a few answers um

45
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:43,200
like the last speaker speaker was saying

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:45,200
one good study just makes you have more

47
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,000
questions and more things to figure out

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,880
so

49
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,319
this is just um a bite of where

50
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:55,839
hopefully you know will be a long run uh

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:55,839
lots and lots of answers

52
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,679
okay so

53
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:03,280
you know if you think about a quality

54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,280
smokable flower because that's what this

55
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,318
talk is about you know it's not about

56
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,399
extract it's about the flower you know

57
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,719
no matter where it's grown

58
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,360
harvesting and having it do something

59
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:17,680
else in another situation

60
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,440
but like anything you know it's it's not

61
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,760
just about

62
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,919
um you know the second it goes into the

63
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:26,318
dry room you know if you want a quality

64
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,639
product it you have to start well from

65
00:02:26,318 --> 00:02:31,359
the get-go you know you need

66
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:33,839
disease and insect-free plants you need

67
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,879
to harvest delicately because you'll

68
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,039
knock the trichomes off um and then you

69
00:02:36,878 --> 00:02:44,000
go into drying and curing which is all a

70
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:44,000
part of a path to a high quality product

71
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:48,159
and so you know why do we care about

72
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,399
this why do we care about you know we

73
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:52,400
grew a beautiful plant

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,680
you know post harvest why does that

75
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,599
matter

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,000
well to some extent

77
00:02:55,598 --> 00:03:00,799
um you know this is for preserving a

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,120
color if you dry fast or if you dry

79
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,840
improperly you might turn a really nice

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,560
green flower to brown

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,560
you may handle it roughly and so you're

82
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,239
beating the trichomes off and so again

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,920
the flower may turn brown maybe for a

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,480
different reason

85
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,399
you're wanting to preserve the smell

86
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,158
terpenes you want to preserve those and

87
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,840
the other secondary metabolites that

88
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:23,120
lend to that smell

89
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,039
um

90
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,560
talking about smokable flour you know

91
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:31,280
you want it to be a smooth smoke

92
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,280
this is one key part that we just do not

93
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,719
quite understand you know what is it

94
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,799
that

95
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:38,639
what is it that's happening when you put

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:41,360
the flower in a bucket that is going to

97
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:43,518
make it a smooth smoke or not

98
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,680
um we don't know

99
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,920
uh and potency you know potency is not

100
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,760
necessarily affected by as far as

101
00:03:47,919 --> 00:03:52,479
cannabinoids go it's not

102
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:53,679
affected by the the drying and curing

103
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,919
um

104
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,680
but of course really rough handling you

105
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:00,559
knock trichomes off

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:04,480
you are you are in fact reducing potency

107
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,479
just because of that mechanical damage

108
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:09,759
all right so you know i come from the

109
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,438
ornamental industry did a lot of work in

110
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:13,280
post-harvest of

111
00:04:11,438 --> 00:04:16,079
unrooted cuttings you know shipping them

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,759
all over the united states you know and

113
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,639
we we would look at

114
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,960
you know how do you ship them properly

115
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:25,120
what do you need to take away you know

116
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:26,478
the the ethylene gas there's gas that

117
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
builds up you know if you think about

118
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:30,639
bananas you know you you take the at the

119
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,959
lean away if you don't want them to

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,400
ripen you add ethylene if you want them

121
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:37,359
to ripen

122
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:39,599
and so you know how how does that apply

123
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,600
to

124
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,600
buds right because you're not keeping

125
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,120
the plant alive which you're wanting to

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,040
do with rooted cuttings or if you think

127
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,800
about cut flowers you're not necessarily

128
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,800
wanting to save the cut flowers to have

129
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
roots but you want to prolong them where

130
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,879
they're pretty

131
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,879
and so you know research for these sorts

132
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:59,680
of things have been happening for a long

133
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,360
long time and so you know we try to

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,879
combine the research that's there on

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,199
those flowers

136
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:07,199
and plants and figure out how can we

137
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,038
apply this to cannabis and figure out

138
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
what's going on in the drying of curing

139
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:14,079
so that kind of gives us our paths of

140
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,959
what we need to explore but it's not

141
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:16,959
exactly the same

142
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,800
and so a couple

143
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,478
a couple words i want you to know and

144
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,319
understand going through this talk

145
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:27,359
because they're important

146
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,918
all right if we think about

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,240
transpiration that's basically just the

148
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:33,198
plant losing water

149
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,600
um

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,199
you know this could be a natural thing

151
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,879
this could be because of

152
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,400
really it's really hot you know it

153
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:42,959
happens at different speeds but

154
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:45,198
basically um in short you're thinking of

155
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:47,279
the water coming through the roots up

156
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,759
the plant which is how a lot of the

157
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:51,839
nutrients are are translocated up

158
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,960
through the plant um and then out the

159
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:55,119
top

160
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:57,198
all right so if you cut the roots off of

161
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,360
a plant if you have a bud

162
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,800
it can still transpire but it's not

163
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,639
going to take up more because it doesn't

164
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,120
have roots

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,840
all right and then respiration so

166
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,800
pretty much photosynthesis right the

167
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:10,478
plant

168
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,520
takes in oxygen

169
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:16,399
and spits out carbon dioxide

170
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:19,359
i got that backwards it takes in carbon

171
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:20,879
dioxide and gives us oxygen

172
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
um

173
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:25,519
but you know what this is is the plant

174
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,319
making use of of those ions and the or

175
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:29,918
those photons in the sky and and turning

176
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,039
it to sugar so

177
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:36,240
you know that's important to remember

178
00:06:33,038 --> 00:06:37,839
i'll know some of the new next slides

179
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,400
all right um

180
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:42,560
so the harvest part's easy um i'd say

181
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:45,038
it's the least complicated you can

182
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,680
harvest the full plant you can break off

183
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:50,079
limbs and harvest individual

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,000
you can even harvest the buds and dry

185
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,159
them individually you know i think the

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,279
biggest takeaway here

187
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,039
is you know be delicate if if you're in

188
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,879
hemp like you see in this picture you're

189
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:02,879
not delicate you do not care how they

190
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:05,120
look you're just extracting for for

191
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,079
cannabinoids but if you are going for

192
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,519
smokable flour you know not throwing

193
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:13,680
them on top of each other um

194
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,879
really removing those trichomes because

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
that's important i'll show you on a

196
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,439
slide later how important that is

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,598
something until recently i didn't

198
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:24,719
realize how significant

199
00:07:21,598 --> 00:07:26,319
trichome loss is to potency reduction

200
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,599
the other big thing a cultivator would

201
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,560
want to think about and that kind of

202
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:31,360
matters

203
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,439
is leaf removal so if you have a drying

204
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,560
facility that you know is struggling to

205
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,240
keep up as far as reducing humidity

206
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,800
you know one easy thing you can do is

207
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,360
just remove more of the leaves prior to

208
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,199
putting in it to the dry room so less

209
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,840
less physical material to actually have

210
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,840
to dry out

211
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:53,839
okay so why do we dry you know of course

212
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:55,439
number one is this is how we preserve

213
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:57,198
the plant

214
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:59,839
this is how

215
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:04,000
you know think about raisins or coffee

216
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,038
you know all food products uh have to be

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,439
um

218
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:11,038
have to have the water removed in order

219
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,959
for it not to spoil to rot

220
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,279
um you know

221
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,478
back in 2016 when i when i joined the

222
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:18,638
industry and

223
00:08:16,478 --> 00:08:20,878
and actually today it is a pretty decent

224
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,800
indicator but you know when i would ask

225
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,520
well how do we figure out when dry is

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,598
dry you know what is that factor and

227
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:28,560
they would say well you snap the stem

228
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:30,959
snap

229
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,360
which you know i thought was outrageous

230
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:35,199
at the time but now it kind of it it

231
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,360
correlates pretty well to the to the

232
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,800
data we took to back that up so that's

233
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,599
kind of cool to see over time

234
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,439
but the two common methods are

235
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,000
water activity i think it's getting more

236
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,040
and more popular which is what the food

237
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,360
industry uses and then moisture content

238
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:55,838
and those do correlate pretty pretty

239
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,839
well together

240
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,159
but you know water activity is super

241
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,800
important because it's not just

242
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:04,639
it's not just the water that's there and

243
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,039
in the cells it's the water that those

244
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:08,799
microbes could physically grow on so

245
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:09,919
once you get down to a certain water

246
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,319
activity

247
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:13,838
you know you may have spores or whatnot

248
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,600
still they're present but they're not

249
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,800
going to continue to grow and

250
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,360
peripherally peripherally

251
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:23,599
so here's just a quick example you know

252
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,399
like i said other other

253
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,639
food industries make use of this it's

254
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,399
very important it's very well known

255
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,000
where it needs to be for certain things

256
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:36,000
not to grow

257
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,278
we've got some solid ideas for cannabis

258
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
i think

259
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:42,559
more so on the how it looks

260
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,800
and consumer preference not necessarily

261
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:46,239
how it correlates with microbial growth

262
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,639
i think that's going to come out where

263
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,680
we have a standard of it has to be at

264
00:09:48,639 --> 00:09:54,000
this point minimum um of course if it's

265
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:56,159
bone dry we know we're there

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,399
but you know

267
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:00,559
cannabis is different you know it's it's

268
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,679
big and it's got different levels

269
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:06,000
um it's not just a you know a flat piece

270
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:08,719
of dried fruit let's say

271
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,679
it's complex

272
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:15,680
so this is a

273
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:17,759
a graph i found quite a few years ago

274
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,559
and it this is kind of what really got

275
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:23,600
my my brain spinning of what's happening

276
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,199
in curing specifically so you know if

277
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,278
you look at the bottom axis you've got

278
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,560
your water activity

279
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:30,559
and then you have all the other

280
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,759
reactions that are hap that's happening

281
00:10:30,559 --> 00:10:36,078
this is just in plants in general

282
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:37,838
at these different water activities and

283
00:10:36,078 --> 00:10:39,359
so you know

284
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,279
one being

285
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,680
straight off the plant you know of

286
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:45,600
course it's wet

287
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:48,159
it's going to have the capability to

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,159
feed those microbes so you have a much

289
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:53,759
higher chance have the higher water

290
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:56,319
activities as you go down you have a

291
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:58,480
better chance of not having continual

292
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
growth of microbes but you're still

293
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:02,159
getting some of this

294
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,039
enzymatic activity that's happening

295
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:04,958
that

296
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,759
you know we're contributing to this

297
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:08,879
change this improvement and curing

298
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:11,519
um

299
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:13,120
and then of course you have well

300
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
it's not always it doesn't always match

301
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:18,240
what the consumer wants and and what

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,920
science wants per se so then you have to

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,000
include that all right well is this too

304
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:24,799
dry for the consumer is this too wet for

305
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,480
the consumer so throwing that into the

306
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,679
the race as well

307
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
and then of course once you get to a

308
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:31,359
certain drying point that enzymatic

309
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:34,000
activity stops

310
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:36,480
um so you know this is kind of

311
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,879
the big picture of of what to

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,720
investigate how to investigate and and

313
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,838
how it's shaped around

314
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,839
water loss basically

315
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,240
all right so i made this a few years ago

316
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,440
i've learned a lot since then but it's

317
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,320
still

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,680
a rough guide right so

319
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:00,079
step one you harvest your plants and you

320
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:03,359
want to get out water as quickly as

321
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:05,759
possible to stop microbial growth and

322
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:07,680
it's it's a tricky balance because if

323
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,639
you're drying fast

324
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:12,000
it may be harsher conditions meaning

325
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,240
you're losing your terpenes that you

326
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
want to save

327
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,560
but in order to not have a ruined crop

328
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,360
you know very fast getting down to that

329
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,919
water activity where at least botrytis

330
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,560
is not going to grow anymore

331
00:12:23,919 --> 00:12:29,039
holding on to a higher water activity

332
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:30,078
level for those enzymatic activities to

333
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,719
continue

334
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:34,399
and then of course drying it low enough

335
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,639
to

336
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,958
to be at the consumer preference so this

337
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:40,639
is just a rough guide there's still tons

338
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,679
of work to add to this

339
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,720
um

340
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,399
but

341
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:48,160
this is this is what we're looking at

342
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:51,120
for for food safety purposes really

343
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:53,278
and so you know what is drying it's

344
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:56,240
it's basically the same thing we do for

345
00:12:53,278 --> 00:12:58,159
living plants you know we've got our

346
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,399
humidity that we want to reach we've got

347
00:12:58,159 --> 00:13:01,360
our temperature that we should reach

348
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,839
but

349
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,000
the easier thing to do is to

350
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,000
combine those two things basically and

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
look at it as as

352
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,159
the vapor pressure deficit so

353
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,600
you know you've got the green you've got

354
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:16,399
your bud

355
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,560
you think about high humidity well the

356
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,519
plant is going to

357
00:13:18,559 --> 00:13:23,599
lose the terpenes in the water slower

358
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,639
makes sense it's trying to homogenize to

359
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,959
its environment um lower humidity same

360
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,200
thing but then you throw the the

361
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,838
variable of temperature into that

362
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,240
it changes it as well so you know i know

363
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,519
a few large growers actually are

364
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,519
monitoring their dry room by vpd um but

365
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,639
i think it definitely will become more

366
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,480
and more popular over time

367
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,480
um and so just as a you know in case uh

368
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,440
you aren't a cultivator you know the the

369
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:58,320
norm the what you shoot for is really 60

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:01,440
60 so 60 humidity 60 uh fahrenheit so

371
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,440
pretty cool temperatures

372
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,078
all right and so this is

373
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,480
part from the study we did with the

374
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:09,919
cannabis research coalition

375
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,720
looking at

376
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:12,319
well

377
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
how how can we

378
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,199
take those two variables as well as

379
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:20,320
adding time and see how long does it

380
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:23,359
take to dry at different temperatures

381
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:27,440
and and relative humidity so we graph

382
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:29,600
this out you know makes sense

383
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,720
you know very very relevant but this

384
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,800
data in a whole allows us to

385
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,278
shape a shape

386
00:14:34,799 --> 00:14:38,159
a creation of a vpd chart

387
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:39,519
that

388
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,198
if you're a grower you've probably seen

389
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
this for your grow room where there's a

390
00:14:41,198 --> 00:14:47,838
there's an area you want to stay in for

391
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:51,278
vpd in order for the plant to

392
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,279
lose the moisture or

393
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,278
not to lose moisture i guess we could

394
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:57,359
put it but it's a little different

395
00:14:55,278 --> 00:14:59,759
because these these don't have roots you

396
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,919
know we're not growing that we're not

397
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:03,600
putting it in a condition to

398
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:07,919
continually grow we're putting it in a

399
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,920
condition to dry the way we want it to

400
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:16,240
okay so obviously you know

401
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,799
you're you're getting into a really long

402
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,240
days of drying because it stayed very

403
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:21,359
moist in the room

404
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,159
um

405
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,079
too slow high risk of botrytis and then

406
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:28,319
if you're drying it really fast

407
00:15:26,078 --> 00:15:31,439
obviously negative negative things

408
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,160
happen loss of terpenes

409
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:37,120
it gets very crumbly lots of reasons why

410
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,919
we need to understand this middle ground

411
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,799
to

412
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:41,759
to

413
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:44,078
end with a nice product

414
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,800
okay and so this is not perfect there's

415
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:48,958
lots more rips that need to go into

416
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,198
making sure this is perfect but we've

417
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:53,439
got to start somewhere so this is the

418
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:56,159
vpd chart looks just like the one that

419
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,040
you would use for a grow room

420
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,198
and so we're understanding you know how

421
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,439
can we really change our humidity or

422
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:05,758
temperature depending on what our

423
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,880
facility can achieve

424
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,320
to have a certain vpd to lose that

425
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,320
moisture

426
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,440
so you know this is still in the works

427
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,440
but

428
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,920
it's definitely a guide we need as an

429
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,920
industry

430
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:21,838
okay

431
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:23,360
i've been i've been working a lot with

432
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,839
terpenes

433
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,560
the last couple of years mainly because

434
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,320
you know i'm in hemp and uh

435
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:32,559
we play with smokeable flour but

436
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,920
terpenes are also very exciting

437
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:37,679
and so you know this is a study that you

438
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:39,278
know i first looked at

439
00:16:37,679 --> 00:16:41,359
and you know of course you think well

440
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,480
you're drying even in a great condition

441
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,720
you're drying and you're going to lose

442
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,000
terpenes you're smelling them they're

443
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:48,320
leaving

444
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,440
well how much are you actually losing

445
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,278
that

446
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,639
and so in this study you can see the

447
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:57,039
citation there in this study even at

448
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:59,680
really good drying conditions you know

449
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,360
the the best a cultivator could provide

450
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:02,719
you're still losing over half of your

451
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,439
terpenes

452
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:08,720
it's very significant and so if i'm a

453
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:11,199
hemp farmer growing for terpenes

454
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,160
this is this is significant you know i

455
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,519
have

456
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,759
three acres of of plants and i want to

457
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:20,558
extract terpenes well am i going to go

458
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:22,240
through the steps to dry it lose half of

459
00:17:20,558 --> 00:17:23,439
my terpenes and then extract the

460
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
terpenes

461
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,720
maybe you want to extract them fresh

462
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,200
so this got my mind turning

463
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:34,240
and we did a few experiments to kind of

464
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,240
follow on top of it

465
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,919
all right so this is you know the

466
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:40,639
thought well

467
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,400
why why even dry

468
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,160
and there's different purposes for this

469
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,519
and i'm sure a lot of you have heard of

470
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,160
you know people are going down the road

471
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,639
of cryo drying and and that sort of

472
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,440
thing um but this is a study that was

473
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,880
done

474
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,038
by lindy who is a gas company

475
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,679
um they they sell nitrogen so they were

476
00:17:57,038 --> 00:18:01,599
very interested in in doing this

477
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,000
i read a red arrow is a marijuana

478
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,678
company in michigan and then

479
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,319
marcus over at cd

480
00:18:06,679 --> 00:18:10,480
cbdvl

481
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:13,038
we actually work together down in san

482
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,038
diego

483
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:17,918
but what this study looked at was

484
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,080
with the different ways of drying how

485
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,840
does it change cannabinoids

486
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,399
with different ways of drying how does

487
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:25,439
it change your terpenes

488
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,038
and so

489
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
um

490
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,119
what i just want to make sure that you

491
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,280
you know if you're not a scientist if

492
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:35,119
there's anomalies

493
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:37,440
ask more questions if you if you know

494
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:39,279
the the author so for example if you

495
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,798
look at the total cannabinoids it looks

496
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:43,918
like okay well

497
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:46,240
freeze drying you know you're

498
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,679
you're losing a lot

499
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,839
how could that be

500
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,600
well when you dig in a little further

501
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,839
what happened in that situation if you

502
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:56,959
look at the picture on the bottom left

503
00:18:53,839 --> 00:18:59,678
the uh the freeze dryer was pulling way

504
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
too hard and so you know the tube from

505
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:04,798
the vacuum was just covered in trichomes

506
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,600
there was trichome loss so it's not that

507
00:19:04,798 --> 00:19:10,400
this the freeze drying itself was

508
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:13,918
was lowering potency it was a it was a

509
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:16,880
mechanical problem

510
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,280
next we look at total terpenes and so

511
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
you know again the one that circled wow

512
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,678
freeze drying is

513
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,640
growing terpenes

514
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:30,798
but this is in fact not true as well

515
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:33,280
because the fresh flower in this study

516
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,639
was not supposed to be dried at the

517
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:35,759
laboratory

518
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,559
and it was

519
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:39,359
so

520
00:19:36,558 --> 00:19:41,359
you know it lost some terpenes at the

521
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:42,159
testing facility

522
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:43,038
so

523
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,519
you know

524
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:48,960
whereas there's lots of holes as there

525
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:51,038
is and a lot of research you you take

526
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,360
those holes and you fix it for the next

527
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,000
experiment and then you work off that so

528
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:56,000
that's what we did

529
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,000
all right so we did

530
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:05,519
an acres worth

531
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:08,240
we looked at oven dried flour we looked

532
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:09,119
at freeze-dried flour we looked at flour

533
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,200
that

534
00:20:09,119 --> 00:20:14,399
was

535
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,640
ran through a liquid nitrogen

536
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,080
conveyor and then freeze-dried which

537
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,720
saves a lot of time because you're

538
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:23,439
putting in flour this already froze

539
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,880
and then i

540
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,880
i had

541
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:28,559
fresh flour tested at the testing

542
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,000
facility and i made sure they did not

543
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:32,158
dry it

544
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,038
which meant i had to do math to account

545
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,799
for

546
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:36,960
the moisture the dilution that they were

547
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:39,038
they were showing not perfect

548
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,679
um but we don't have our own testing

549
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:43,119
facility so this was the best we had

550
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,159
you know again these are this is for

551
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:46,319
hemp

552
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,200
but i think the the big takeaway that we

553
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:50,879
saw with cannabinoids is that

554
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,519
you know unless you're being

555
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
mechanically abusive to the plants

556
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:56,639
um

557
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,079
all that different drying methods are

558
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,559
actually doing is

559
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,599
decarboxylating it or not

560
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:03,519
and so

561
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:06,639
you know for for him

562
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:11,119
it's not a big deal either way um for

563
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
for marijuana i guess it's situational

564
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,679
but terpenes is where it got really

565
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,120
interesting

566
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,600
so the first

567
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:21,519
the n2fd that's

568
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:24,240
nitrogen and then freeze-dried

569
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:25,038
freeze-dried oven and then baseline

570
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,759
so

571
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:30,640
theoretically the plant if not

572
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:33,038
manipulated should have about 2.5

573
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:35,360
percent terpenes by dry weight so that's

574
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:38,158
the bottom number there

575
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:39,839
obviously if you dry it with an oven at

576
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,120
harsh temperatures

577
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,319
you're losing a lot a lot

578
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:49,038
freeze-dried um it's better but you're

579
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:50,720
still going to lose something

580
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:52,879
and then of course if you're instantly

581
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,839
freezing it right out the field and then

582
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,440
freeze-drying it um you know that that

583
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:01,519
was the least lost terping content

584
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,840
and so that's kind of the high level

585
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,519
look at this experi experiment but it

586
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:08,879
gets even more interesting when you look

587
00:22:05,519 --> 00:22:10,000
into the individual terpenes

588
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,840
all right

589
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,440
and so this this data just came to us

590
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:16,079
like last week so

591
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,558
um i haven't ran

592
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:20,158
statistics thoroughly but i think

593
00:22:18,558 --> 00:22:23,038
the takeaways here

594
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,679
kind of speak for themselves so

595
00:22:23,038 --> 00:22:27,279
if you look you've got you know a

596
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:30,000
baseline

597
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:32,079
of each terpene by dry weight which is

598
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,119
in that flower

599
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:38,960
at the bottom you can see the the red

600
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,798
indicates the loss of terpenes compared

601
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,759
to the baseline

602
00:22:40,798 --> 00:22:45,519
and the green is the gain of terpenes

603
00:22:43,759 --> 00:22:47,519
compared to the baseline

604
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:49,839
and so you know this you know what we're

605
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,759
looking at here is not just well it was

606
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:53,918
you know two and five percent

607
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:55,599
differences these are significant

608
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:58,000
differences

609
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:59,519
you know we're looking at

610
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,319
humulene

611
00:22:59,519 --> 00:23:04,879
as it's oven dried it increased by 84

612
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:04,879
percent

613
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,798
i'm not a chemist

614
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:11,119
but i

615
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,400
will definitely be running this across

616
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:15,918
chemists i know and biochemists to to

617
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,840
help understand you like what's

618
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,799
happening here you know

619
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,839
there is

620
00:23:18,798 --> 00:23:22,480
conversions happening

621
00:23:20,839 --> 00:23:24,879
um

622
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,720
but yeah very very very interesting so i

623
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,880
think you know this

624
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,120
you know what the story is here is that

625
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,080
no matter how you're drying it

626
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:36,558
the terpene profile that the plant has

627
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:39,199
as a fresh plant

628
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:41,440
is going to change

629
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,440
so

630
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,760
yeah basically understanding

631
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:49,440
how you how you want it to smell

632
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:51,440
based off how you dry

633
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
you know you can you can kind of tweak

634
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:56,798
because you'll end up with something

635
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,799
different with each drying technique

636
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,000
okay so curing

637
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,640
you know this is this is something that

638
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,798
for years i questioned is it

639
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,440
is something actually happening here or

640
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:13,038
is it just homogenation

641
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
well you know

642
00:24:13,038 --> 00:24:16,839
is it removing uh excess water

643
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
is it

644
00:24:16,839 --> 00:24:21,199
homogenizing throughout

645
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,080
the the container

646
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:25,919
um you know what is ethylene doing in

647
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,480
this process

648
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,759
are the plants still alive once they've

649
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,919
got down to this 0.6 water

650
00:24:31,759 --> 00:24:36,158
water activity you know what's happening

651
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,960
with the carbohydrates the ph the

652
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,278
organic acids there's so much to

653
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,759
question and once we understand that

654
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:47,038
then we can optimize and speed things up

655
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:49,359
and be efficient

656
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:51,278
okay so this is the easy one this is a

657
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:54,000
very easy one so this was the ver the

658
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:55,759
burp process project

659
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:59,599
if you look at the bottom axis we have

660
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,558
different types of burp so you know

661
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:02,558
once

662
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:03,519
open the bucket for 30 minutes once a

663
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:05,359
day

664
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:06,319
no open

665
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:09,519
you know

666
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:11,918
an hour for three days etcetera etcetera

667
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:14,558
but again the the really big takeaway

668
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:17,038
here is that the bottom portion of the

669
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:18,480
graph it shows the water activity

670
00:25:17,038 --> 00:25:20,960
at um

671
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,079
at the beginning of curing right so

672
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,880
we've got

673
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:24,879
pretty big

674
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:32,319
ranges of samples so if you see the um

675
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,640
oh gosh what's this called the variance

676
00:25:32,319 --> 00:25:36,480
so you know pretty big variance of

677
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:40,240
samples water activity

678
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,038
but after it stays in the buckets for 14

679
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,480
days you go back you take water activity

680
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:46,319
measurements again

681
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,360
and at first glance it looks like well

682
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:48,960
these

683
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,639
these flowers are

684
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
gaining moisture

685
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,000
but that's not actually the case what's

686
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,919
happening is you know when you're drying

687
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,759
in an environment the big flowers and

688
00:25:55,919 --> 00:25:59,200
the small flowers everything's drying at

689
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:01,839
different rates

690
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,558
and it comes from the outside of the bud

691
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,439
first so the insides are all different

692
00:26:04,558 --> 00:26:10,240
depending on bud size structure etc but

693
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,000
when you put them into a chamber where

694
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:14,079
they all experience the same humidity

695
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,278
they have time to homogenize throughout

696
00:26:14,079 --> 00:26:17,359
the plant

697
00:26:15,278 --> 00:26:19,679
meaning you know the flower

698
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:21,839
within the bucket should be the al

699
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:26,600
should have all of the same moisture

700
00:26:21,839 --> 00:26:26,599
content within so it's homogenization

701
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,200
that one's very easy to quantify

702
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:35,439
but then we get to the chemistry side of

703
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,319
it and

704
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,720
where do you start so we look at plants

705
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,798
that are similar

706
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,839
but nothing is exactly the same as

707
00:26:42,798 --> 00:26:45,679
cannabis

708
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:47,678
but you again you've got to start

709
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,278
somewhere so we look at the curing of

710
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:50,720
tobacco

711
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:53,759
you know

712
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,919
there's lots of ways to cure tobacco but

713
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,319
some of the takeaways here are well yeah

714
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,400
it's done for flavor and smoke ability

715
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:02,158
but they don't care about terpenes

716
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,440
um

717
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,880
you know it

718
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,159
for for

719
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:10,320
um for tobacco you know they're they're

720
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:13,440
using this process of it kind of being

721
00:27:10,319 --> 00:27:15,678
alive getting rid of the chlorophyll uh

722
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,840
being in this zombie state to achieve

723
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,519
the enzymatic processes they're looking

724
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,319
for

725
00:27:19,519 --> 00:27:23,599
but our flowers stay green

726
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,240
so we're

727
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:28,719
though we may change

728
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,278
chlorophyll and and harshness is it

729
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,278
actually related to chlorophyll content

730
00:27:31,278 --> 00:27:35,278
it's still green

731
00:27:33,278 --> 00:27:38,319
um you know other things that are looked

732
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:41,119
at within the tobacco industry are you

733
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,079
know starch to sugar conversions

734
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:45,599
um

735
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:47,678
degrading uh carotenes

736
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,119
you know leaf maturity you know all

737
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:53,840
these things have different impact of

738
00:27:51,119 --> 00:27:55,519
what the tobacco industry looks as as a

739
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:56,879
great product

740
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:02,000
again there's things we can pull from

741
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,039
here to test but it's not a one for one

742
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,960
so

743
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,960
where do we start

744
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,720
we just want to see what's happening you

745
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,278
know but we can't do experiments until

746
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,240
we have a little idea of what's going on

747
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,440
so

748
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,278
we got

749
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,960
gas

750
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:23,119
gas sensors co2 o2 and ethylene

751
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,120
and we put them into these sill jars

752
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:29,918
all right so

753
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:31,038
obviously you put a fresh bud into a

754
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,038
sill jar

755
00:28:31,038 --> 00:28:35,599
it's going to mold and rot

756
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:37,278
it's too wet but we wanted to understand

757
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,839
what's happening with ethylene what's

758
00:28:37,278 --> 00:28:41,919
happening with o2 and so remember back

759
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,959
to the definitions

760
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,919
all right we're going to look at the

761
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,240
step by step the yellow line is humidity

762
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:49,919
so this is a fresh bud it's pretty much

763
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:51,759
100

764
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:55,440
um ethylene

765
00:28:51,759 --> 00:28:57,119
this bud is alive we just picked it

766
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,798
if you're good at rooting you might even

767
00:28:57,119 --> 00:29:00,079
could make this be another plant it's

768
00:28:58,798 --> 00:29:02,558
kind of hard when it's in the flowering

769
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:04,879
stage like that but in theory it's still

770
00:29:02,558 --> 00:29:07,038
in a live plant

771
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,640
ethylene goes crazy

772
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:09,679
you know these numbers we're seeing of

773
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,880
ethylene

774
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,038
in this

775
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,520
fresh stage meaning

776
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:17,839
high ethylene in the the drying room

777
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:22,319
because it's not dried yet

778
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:24,720
um ethylene in your grow is super high

779
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,759
and so if if you're in a situation and

780
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:29,200
you're growing facility where you're not

781
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:31,200
bringing in fresh air because you're

782
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,558
wanting to ramp up your co2

783
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,880
you know how high are you getting the

784
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,558
ethylene in there

785
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,559
i'm not sure this is something i want to

786
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:40,240
understand and then is it bad or is it

787
00:29:38,558 --> 00:29:43,918
good that it's in there or do we want to

788
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,679
tweak it right when it's ripening

789
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,960
but takeaway is

790
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:50,880
in a jar it gets very high in ethylene

791
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,759
the other takeaway here is you know

792
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,080
looking at o2 and co2

793
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,599
this plant is still alive because we see

794
00:29:56,079 --> 00:30:01,519
it breathing

795
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:05,678
you know we see there is active

796
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:09,000
co2 there is active o2

797
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,000
being produced

798
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,360
okay and so

799
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,000
this on the other hand is

800
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:22,158
a graph showing

801
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:24,079
co2 and oxygen after he hits 0.6 percent

802
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,600
so we've dried it we're at the end of

803
00:30:24,079 --> 00:30:26,639
our dry

804
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:30,798
is dead

805
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:33,840
it's not necessarily breathing anymore

806
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,679
but that does not necessarily mean that

807
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:36,558
there could be other microbes on the

808
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,559
plant

809
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,158
doing certain things which

810
00:30:38,558 --> 00:30:42,079
we've got some research coming out kind

811
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,640
of looking at that of of that

812
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,639
interaction

813
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,200
so respiration is insignificant

814
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:55,278
so that's looking at co2 and o2 but if

815
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:57,679
we look at ethylene ethylene is still

816
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:58,798
being produced

817
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,679
so again

818
00:30:58,798 --> 00:31:02,240
why

819
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,240
not sure

820
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:06,640
if we manipulate it a certain way will

821
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,798
we get one result versus

822
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,480
the other better or worse we don't know

823
00:31:08,798 --> 00:31:12,639
but at least now we have a target of

824
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,599
what's happening and so from here we can

825
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,159
shape

826
00:31:13,599 --> 00:31:18,480
uh manipulation to see what will make

827
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
for a better product

828
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,440
then the question is well what does a

829
00:31:19,839 --> 00:31:24,480
better product mean because then you got

830
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:27,038
to get people involved to give opinions

831
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:31,480
that's harder than this

832
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:31,480
props to the speaker before me

833
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:40,000
yeah so you know from from these very

834
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:42,079
upfront quick experiments to lead into

835
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,839
the next ones that will have more

836
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:45,519
significance you know what we found is

837
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:48,079
that there's a lot of water there's a

838
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,720
lot of water in the flower you know

839
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:53,599
almost 80 percent

840
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,960
moist buds have high respiration so in

841
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,678
your dry room where you think

842
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,798
the

843
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,120
it's ambient to maybe outside it's not

844
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,960
there's a lot of respiration going on

845
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,959
there's a lot of ethylene being produced

846
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,200
but once you get it to you know the

847
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:13,759
water activity where you would want to

848
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,519
put it into the next stage the curing

849
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:17,839
you know it's not

850
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,440
which was surprising to me i figured

851
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:21,038
there would still be a lot of gas

852
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,798
exchange happening

853
00:32:21,038 --> 00:32:25,599
you know meaning

854
00:32:22,798 --> 00:32:27,599
we burp we burp and so

855
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,199
you know is burping actually important

856
00:32:27,599 --> 00:32:31,839
and is there a gas

857
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:33,278
that we're not tracking that is

858
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,918
making this

859
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:39,759
uh you know the the theory that

860
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,399
curing is making for a better smoke

861
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:44,000
so as you can see a lot of

862
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:45,759
yeah it did this but

863
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,640
what's next

864
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,720
um

865
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:51,360
so you know going back to this there is

866
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,278
there's so much more to investigate

867
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,599
um

868
00:32:53,278 --> 00:32:56,558
it's it's been a lot of fun

869
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:59,439
but

870
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:01,359
so the the way our research works is uh

871
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,960
the hip mind which is my company and

872
00:33:01,359 --> 00:33:03,839
clemson university is where i went to

873
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,798
school

874
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:06,398
um

875
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:08,480
with my old major professor we've

876
00:33:06,398 --> 00:33:10,479
actually created

877
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,798
a coalition called the cannabis research

878
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,399
coalition

879
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,278
that

880
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:18,319
looks at that includes the cannabis

881
00:33:17,278 --> 00:33:21,119
industry

882
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,278
um it funds the research and then the

883
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,759
research goes to those members

884
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,398
um you know this is this is

885
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:30,158
stakeholder focused you know this is not

886
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,079
just research that other researchers

887
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,000
want to read this is research that is

888
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,519
going to tell you all right well

889
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,720
if you give the uh if you give the

890
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,558
plants

891
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,519
two more hours of light per day you're

892
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,960
going to increase your yield by 20

893
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,120
and if you're a multi-million dollar

894
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,558
company that 20

895
00:33:45,119 --> 00:33:47,599
is a big deal

896
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:50,000
and so

897
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,879
you know we want to provide research

898
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,558
that

899
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
yes is is

900
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:58,000
is science-based as you saw but we want

901
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,558
it to be very applicable immediately to

902
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:02,640
a grower you know what rooting hormone

903
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:05,440
to use you know what's what's going to

904
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,840
take you from having 70 percent success

905
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,000
and rooting to ninety percent

906
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:12,000
um things like that that will strengthen

907
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,440
the industry immediately

908
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,519
um you know

909
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,000
now of course a university is involved

910
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:20,000
meaning they're going to publish but as

911
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,838
you know not a lot of people are in a

912
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,679
hurry to get publications so it could

913
00:34:21,838 --> 00:34:26,878
take a year or two to get those out

914
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,599
meaning those members do get that very

915
00:34:26,878 --> 00:34:32,239
early perk one-on-one

916
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:34,559
of what they could potentially do to

917
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:37,759
to use science to make their grow more

918
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,759
efficient or profitable

919
00:34:39,039 --> 00:34:41,679
and that is it

920
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,388
i don't know if we have any time for

921
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:50,568
questions

922
00:34:43,389 --> 00:34:50,568
[Applause]

923
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:57,440
thank you very much for your work i

924
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
appreciate it as a registered nurse i i

925
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,880
did presentation on this for the

926
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,560
american cannabis nurses association but

927
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:06,880
i digress what is your opinion of the

928
00:35:04,559 --> 00:35:10,000
new boveda packets and those humidity

929
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,880
packets that are we find so often in our

930
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:14,400
thc products in colorado do you find

931
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:17,039
that that is going to

932
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
cause issues long term i just want to

933
00:35:17,039 --> 00:35:19,599
hear what you have to say about that

934
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,480
thank you

935
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,800
yeah

936
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,800
um

937
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:27,039
i

938
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,359
so i haven't done a lot i can't speak to

939
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:31,599
the microbial effect of it

940
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,960
um

941
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,640
in theory you know they're they're

942
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,199
there's different choices of humidity

943
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:43,440
packs you can use so if if you're able

944
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:45,919
to stay under that you know 0.6 or 0.6

945
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,400
water activity then in theory you

946
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,800
shouldn't be you know introducing water

947
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,639
to in increased microbial growth

948
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:56,560
you know i have seen

949
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,799
with that said i have seen very dry

950
00:35:56,559 --> 00:36:00,559
crumbly flower you know become a better

951
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,839
state with these

952
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,400
um

953
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:06,880
we are actually working with boveda

954
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,039
that's where some of the the funding

955
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,680
comes from um

956
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,599
and so you know they're looking to make

957
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,519
themselves better by having you know

958
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,359
very nitty-gritty data

959
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:19,199
so

960
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:21,440
yeah yeah i've seen good things and in

961
00:36:19,199 --> 00:36:22,319
theory it should not be have a negative

962
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,920
effect

963
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,920
for health safety i guess i could say

964
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,480
great thank you for your work and a

965
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,480
great presentation um i'm will vasuete

966
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,000
from buyer scientific and we do

967
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,760
measurements of emission rates in the

968
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,119
ambient air and we see significant

969
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,040
emission rates almost an order of

970
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,200
magnitude higher in the drying room than

971
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:43,279
we do in cultivation and so my question

972
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:45,039
is have you thought about or have you

973
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,359
done anything about using ambient

974
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:50,079
measurements not the terpenes in the

975
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,039
plant but in the air to try to optimize

976
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:53,599
or look at

977
00:36:51,039 --> 00:36:54,960
optimal drying rates and also have your

978
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:56,720
alternative drying rates done anything

979
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,400
with odor emissions those are the two

980
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,639
questions

981
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:03,358
oh goodness um

982
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:04,639
so yes the one of the next steps for

983
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:06,960
this research

984
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,559
is looking at the headspace in the

985
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,920
curing containers

986
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:14,000
to see you know because you open a jar

987
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:16,559
and you smell it you know it's it's

988
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:18,480
combing out it's volatilizing and so

989
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:21,199
understanding you know what are we

990
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,280
losing through this this process as far

991
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:25,838
as individual terpenes and what is being

992
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,440
left in the flower and and what makes

993
00:37:25,838 --> 00:37:30,159
that difference and and how can it be

994
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:31,760
manipulated

995
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,118
what was your other

996
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,839
odor

997
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,400
odor

998
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:42,239
so you know to be honest

999
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,240
in him nobody cares about odor um and

1000
00:37:42,239 --> 00:37:46,719
everywhere i've worked uh as far as

1001
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:48,319
marijuana goes that's that's not been a

1002
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:50,319
a requirement

1003
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,800
so i've i've not had to go down that

1004
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,480
road of figuring out how to stop it

1005
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:57,119
i guess i'm i'm just trying to figure

1006
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,119
out how to keep it

1007
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,119
is the mic one

1008
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,079
as far as

1009
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,078
terpenes or

1010
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:30,799
we haven't looked at that specifically

1011
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,079
but there is a huge difference in drying

1012
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:34,240
you know if you're if you're pulling off

1013
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:36,560
just the stems um

1014
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:39,199
you're you're usually leaving the large

1015
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:42,320
bases behind and so we're definitely

1016
00:38:39,199 --> 00:38:44,799
able to dry faster because there's less

1017
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,880
physical water to remove

1018
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,480
um

1019
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,880
anecdotally not set experimentation

1020
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:56,400
we've not seen much difference as far as

1021
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,400
cannabinoids or terpenes

1022
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,598
so not exactly

1023
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,280
great presentation thank you quick

1024
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:07,119
question if you can prevent botrytis in

1025
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:09,519
the drying stage does a longer dry

1026
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,039
period lead to a better end product

1027
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:13,039
past like the 15 day point

1028
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:19,039
right i've i've seen people cure for

1029
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,639
six months you know and i've seen people

1030
00:39:19,039 --> 00:39:21,838
cure for three days

1031
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:23,759
and again

1032
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:26,159
by nose

1033
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,800
i've seen the three-day cure smell just

1034
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:30,639
as good as you know months and months of

1035
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:33,599
cure

1036
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:36,078
but that's just aroma

1037
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,240
is there is there a longer stage where

1038
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:41,119
some of these conversions could happen

1039
00:39:38,239 --> 00:39:43,598
for a maybe a better smoke which then

1040
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,200
gets very tough because that's

1041
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:49,599
you know that's that's qualitative of

1042
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:50,559
how it makes you feel

1043
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,599
but

1044
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:52,960
at least

1045
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,800
on data

1046
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,880
i've not seen a big difference between

1047
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,800
the two and i think with starting to

1048
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:01,760
understand this more and more we

1049
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,119
eventually will be able to say okay well

1050
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,640
you're seeing this effect from three

1051
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,400
months

1052
00:40:04,639 --> 00:40:08,400
but it's because this is happening over

1053
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,079
three months but now since we know

1054
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,639
what's happening let's do it in three

1055
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,400
days and achieve the same end result

1056
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:16,318
so that's that's kind of the goal is to

1057
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,639
be able to to understand it fully where

1058
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:20,239
we can guide those things because i mean

1059
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:23,039
people aren't curing for three months

1060
00:40:20,239 --> 00:40:26,159
just for fun i mean i'm sure they've

1061
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:28,639
seen differences over time that that are

1062
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,000
have that are allowing them to to make

1063
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:32,318
that call

1064
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,838
because if you're a if you're a grower

1065
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:36,000
i mean that's a long time to wait for

1066
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:37,838
your money for your crop so

1067
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,039
i imagine there's a there's a reason

1068
00:40:37,838 --> 00:40:40,318
it's been done

1069
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,769
traditionally

1070
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:43,949
thank

1071
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:43,949
[Music]

1072
00:40:51,280 --> 01:21:57,520
when we were you

1073
00:41:06,239 --> 00:41:12,239
yes there are actually companies that

1074
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,960
that make these automated devices um i

1075
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:16,479
think autocures one where basically it's

1076
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,240
a container and

1077
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:20,240
you know if humidity gets to a certain

1078
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:23,358
amount or it could be on a time or where

1079
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:25,679
it just it purges

1080
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:28,239
but that's the thing we

1081
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,639
i have anecdotally seen

1082
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,559
by smell a great difference between

1083
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,078
burping and not

1084
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,318
but i haven't been able to put a data

1085
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,079
point behind that yet to match it

1086
00:41:36,318 --> 00:41:39,599
so you know at this point in time i

1087
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,720
can't tell you

1088
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:45,039
on from science experience that

1089
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:46,799
that is a something you should do

1090
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,440
but as you should do it

1091
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:52,160
but my science can't tell you why

1092
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,159
okay thank you

1093
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:56,799
all right thank you um

1094
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,559
curing and drying has fueled many

1095
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,079
conversations in the cultivation

1096
00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,519
community and we all have our opinions

1097
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:03,440
and i'm one of those guys that believes

1098
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:05,519
in a long slow cure my flower stays on

1099
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,720
the stick for over three months

1100
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:08,639
and one thing that we've noticed

1101
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,480
anecdotally among all of us when we

1102
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:12,639
break out our bags and our boxes and we

1103
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,800
start sharing with everybody is we've

1104
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:17,118
noticed a difference in plants that are

1105
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:19,599
grown full term and full sun

1106
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:21,680
retain and have a broader profile and

1107
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:23,760
retain that profile for longer than a

1108
00:42:21,679 --> 00:42:25,838
flower that's grown indoors from clone

1109
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,280
that has a forced photo period and we

1110
00:42:25,838 --> 00:42:28,960
call it the nutrient density of the

1111
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
flower you know taking that into account

1112
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:33,199
or seeing the information with that and

1113
00:42:30,639 --> 00:42:35,039
also the curing versus on the stick

1114
00:42:33,199 --> 00:42:37,358
versus popping the buds off and curing

1115
00:42:35,039 --> 00:42:39,279
it that way we notice on the stick we've

1116
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:41,679
got uh longer retention of a broader

1117
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:44,400
spectrum but this is anecdotal

1118
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:47,118
no i i definitely believe that i

1119
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,358
if you were to take the same cultivar

1120
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,240
and put one outdoors and one indoors you

1121
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:54,960
know so many differences probably light

1122
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:57,598
levels spectrum of light all of that's

1123
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:59,199
going to affect it i mean even

1124
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:00,960
let's say you're growing under hps

1125
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:03,598
lights and you're very close well that

1126
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,519
that radiant heat is going to change the

1127
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:07,119
terpenes that are there because you're

1128
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:10,639
losing a lot more than you might would

1129
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,119
under leds and so all of that is

1130
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,598
changing you know to the extent where

1131
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,559
you you can measure that you know

1132
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:20,160
um so you know i definitely believe that

1133
00:43:18,559 --> 00:43:22,799
and you know i would ask you and your

1134
00:43:20,159 --> 00:43:25,199
experience because this matters to apply

1135
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,359
to the science you know why do you

1136
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:29,358
choose to do it three months

1137
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:31,279
uh i was trained by cultivators who have

1138
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,119
been doing it for generations and we

1139
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,720
have i have five-year-old flower that i

1140
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,119
smoke and it's beautiful wonderful you

1141
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,879
open the bucket and it smells amazing

1142
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,240
and it did we noticed like the

1143
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,400
difference between a triple second a

1144
00:43:40,239 --> 00:43:44,000
grand marnier you get that age with a

1145
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,280
wine or an alcohol and you find that it

1146
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,280
brings out other terpenes and i know

1147
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,119
frenchie cannoli did some studies with

1148
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,800
his hash where he's noticing new

1149
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,039
terpenes being produced like cashew

1150
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,880
sheen and so that agent in that

1151
00:43:53,039 --> 00:43:57,039
mellowing we find it's a mellower smoke

1152
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,079
and it's we consider it a connoisseur

1153
00:43:57,039 --> 00:43:59,440
class because we noticed a lot of the

1154
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,599
dispensaries specifically here in

1155
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,559
southern california they won't buy flour

1156
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,318
that's over

1157
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,880
six months old and they hate outdoor

1158
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,119
flour they want the blingy indoor flash

1159
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,280
fresh but we notice if you take a

1160
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,119
one-year-old bag of outdoor flower

1161
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:15,920
versus a one-year-old bag of indoor

1162
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,440
flower the outdoor still is almost like

1163
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,119
the day that you know you were working

1164
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:22,559
with the cure and the indoor doesn't

1165
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:26,000
seem to have the longevity

1166
00:44:22,559 --> 00:44:27,838
that's extremely interesting um

1167
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,519
again

1168
00:44:27,838 --> 00:44:32,239
i can't tell you what or why but

1169
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:35,519
hopefully in a year we'll have some

1170
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,519
some good data points but

1171
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,640
i mean what i would like to say is

1172
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:42,720
i would love to be able to sample from

1173
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:45,039
you know batches like this and us put

1174
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:46,719
some data points on you know what is

1175
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:48,159
being done

1176
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:51,118
legacy style

1177
00:44:48,159 --> 00:44:52,239
um and and and figure that out so now's

1178
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,000
the time to do it there's a whole lot of

1179
00:44:52,239 --> 00:44:56,000
outdoor flowers sitting unused up north

1180
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:59,519
yeah

1181
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,000
wow okay yeah everything he just said

1182
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,679
also is uh very much pertinent but i

1183
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,440
really appreciate your work so much it's

1184
00:45:03,679 --> 00:45:07,598
really helped me over the past couple

1185
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,440
years understand post-production so i

1186
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:11,838
follow your research

1187
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,838
i guess my question would be around

1188
00:45:11,838 --> 00:45:16,318
ethylene blockers and if you have

1189
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:18,719
experimented with ethylene blockers in

1190
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,400
post-production yeah absolutely so

1191
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,879
that's that's something i just i just

1192
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,119
squeezed it in 30 minutes but we did um

1193
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,160
so in those still jars we would add one

1194
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,599
mcp so inhibits and then we actually

1195
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:32,480
added ethaphon so adding ethylene

1196
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:35,440
and

1197
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:37,838
as far as cannabinoids and terpenes

1198
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,400
there was no significant changes which

1199
00:45:37,838 --> 00:45:42,400
was extremely surprising

1200
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,240
we need to repeat that study

1201
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:47,358
um you know i want to look at it in

1202
00:45:44,239 --> 00:45:48,799
something bigger than a jar

1203
00:45:47,358 --> 00:45:51,358
you know i think there's some value to

1204
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,359
that but

1205
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:58,640
i think in in curing it's not as

1206
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:01,279
important as it might be in drying and

1207
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,118
in the grow

1208
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:05,920
you know we're not seeing those changes

1209
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,920
in curing but that doesn't mean that

1210
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,838
it's not affecting something differently

1211
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,400
that we hadn't measured yet so even

1212
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:15,119
though there's no change in terpenes or

1213
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,000
or cannabinoids well maybe that extra

1214
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,039
ethylene accumulation or release because

1215
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,239
we burp

1216
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:23,759
maybe that is contributing to

1217
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:24,799
it for example starts to sugar

1218
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,119
conversion

1219
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,880
and that's why it's good but if you're

1220
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,318
just testing those two simple things

1221
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:31,200
it's going to look like it doesn't

1222
00:46:30,318 --> 00:46:32,000
matter

1223
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:33,919
so

1224
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,519
that is next step next step is looking

1225
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,358
at headspace

1226
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,800
it's looking at some of those other

1227
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:40,880
factors so

1228
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,480
ph you know that's a really important

1229
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,720
one in tobacco

1230
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:46,318
is the ph you know that affects the

1231
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:48,480
smoke

1232
00:46:46,318 --> 00:46:52,719
looking at total sugars looking at

1233
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:55,440
nutrient content and pairing that with

1234
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:58,239
with flushing because yes if you flush

1235
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:59,679
it it takes down

1236
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,358
it takes down the actual nutrient

1237
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,879
content in the plant

1238
00:47:01,358 --> 00:47:04,639
but

1239
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,440
then what

1240
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:06,559
so

1241
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,159
thank you

1242
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,679
one more little bit is i really do think

1243
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,920
that it's incredibly important because a

1244
00:47:09,679 --> 00:47:14,559
lot of people are speaking to how

1245
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:16,400
product has to be so fresh in order for

1246
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:18,000
it to be sold and i do feel like we

1247
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,119
don't have science to back that up and

1248
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:21,838
there's a lot of people speaking

1249
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:24,000
publicly that this is a fact and it's

1250
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,599
not science so i'd love to see more

1251
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,719
around that and thank you for again for

1252
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,720
yourself yeah absolutely

1253
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,000
all right thanks everyone
