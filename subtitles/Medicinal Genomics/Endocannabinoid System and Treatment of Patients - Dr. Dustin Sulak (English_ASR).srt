1
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,680
thank you for having me what a great

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,679
conference so far

3
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:11,359
it is my honor to present to you a

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,280
little bit of what i've learned over the

5
00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:15,678
last six years in maine

6
00:00:13,279 --> 00:00:17,038
practicing cannabinoid medicine on the

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,118
front lines

8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,279
so uh just an overview of the next 20

9
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,800
minutes an introduction to my work

10
00:00:21,278 --> 00:00:25,198
and then some of what i've discovered

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,000
about cannabinoid dosing nuances

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,560
including

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
the nonlinear dose response

14
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,119
sensitization and tolerance

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,799
bidirectional effects and then i want to

16
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,759
talk a little bit about acidic

17
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:37,439
cannabinoids

18
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:39,039
which i've been seeing some great

19
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:40,960
results with in my practice

20
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,399
and then i'll end with three pediatric

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,520
seizure cases

22
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,520
and kind of the theme of today so

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,440
integrate is the name of my clinic we

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,800
started in manchester maine now we have

25
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:52,399
three practices

26
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:55,359
two in maine one here in burlington

27
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,719
massachusetts i work with about 16 other

28
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:59,039
medical providers

29
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,640
and together we take care of at least

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,239
eighteen thousand patients actually i

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,198
think it's closer to twenty thousand

32
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:05,359
patients now

33
00:01:03,198 --> 00:01:06,959
these are all real patients with real

34
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,599
medical conditions we're not in the

35
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:10,000
business

36
00:01:07,599 --> 00:01:11,839
of providing certifications for uh

37
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,680
personal adult use even though i don't

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,400
think prohibition is a very good public

39
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,880
health

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,680
policy in addition to medical cannabis

41
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:19,280
we practice

42
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,479
good medicine integrative family

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,159
medicine osteopathy which is one of my

44
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,239
loves and specialties functional

45
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,640
medicine mind body medicine

46
00:01:26,239 --> 00:01:30,478
and more you can see the age demographic

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
of our practice so it's mostly adult

48
00:01:30,478 --> 00:01:35,519
patients

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,359
in maine we have uh distinct qualifying

50
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,959
conditions for which we can certify a

51
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:40,959
patient to use cannabis

52
00:01:38,959 --> 00:01:43,280
and so here's the basic demographic

53
00:01:40,959 --> 00:01:46,399
about 72 percent chronic pain

54
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,799
13 ptsd and there's certainly an overlap

55
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
of people that have comorbid ptsd with

56
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,000
chronic pain

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,319
and then the rest is pretty much a big

58
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,599
mix of many other conditions but as a

59
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:57,758
clinician it's a

60
00:01:55,599 --> 00:02:00,078
incredible honor to be in a practice

61
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,159
where i see such a variety of pathology

62
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,319
and i get to apply all my skills

63
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,320
and what i can learn from the primary

64
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:07,839
research and from my clinical experience

65
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,679
to help different patients with

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,640
different conditions

67
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,479
so i'll back up for a second about two

68
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,359
or three years ago with some of the

69
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:19,119
documentaries

70
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,720
on cnn parents started coming to me

71
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,719
requesting that i treat their children

72
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,598
with cannabinoids for various neurologic

73
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:25,598
conditions

74
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,280
and at the time i was basically faced

75
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:28,959
with and a lot of the clinicians in the

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,800
room could probably appreciate this

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,479
a mom holding up a bottle of tincture

78
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,360
and saying how many drops of this should

79
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:36,079
i be giving

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,680
to my child which is uh puts a clinician

81
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,280
like myself in a very uncomfortable

82
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
position what's in that bottle how

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,598
potent is it

84
00:02:40,318 --> 00:02:45,439
and so forth so we did our best to start

85
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,598
tested labs and i believe that we're the

86
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:49,759
only medical practice in the world

87
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,439
that does cannabinoid medicine and has

88
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:53,598
in-house analytics

89
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:54,800
of the medicine that patients are using

90
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,799
this allows us to

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,000
discover new things about what's working

92
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,879
and what's not working

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,519
and also to really fine-tune the dosing

94
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,518
and

95
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,599
understand what's what's happening there

96
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,959
so we're making new discoveries

97
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,639
all the time and some of our best

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,039
discoveries come from

99
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,359
uh people's mistakes in the words of

100
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,120
someone i admire a lot bob ross the tv

101
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,920
painter with the afro he said there's no

102
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,759
mistakes

103
00:03:15,919 --> 00:03:19,359
there's just happy little accidents and

104
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,280
the worst thing that we can do is

105
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,040
learn a whole lot from them and

106
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:25,280
fortunately in cannabinoid medicine

107
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:27,759
that's the truth these substances are so

108
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,719
safe and non-toxic that even gross

109
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:31,120
errors are

110
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:32,560
typically safe and we we can learn a

111
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,000
whole lot from them

112
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
so it's really wonderful to be

113
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,280
experimenting clinically

114
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,360
with something with this type of safety

115
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:41,759
profile and just to show you

116
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,080
you know morphologically some of these

117
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,719
medicines can look exactly the same but

118
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,719
have

119
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:49,759
vastly different therapeutic effects so

120
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:50,479
here we have a flower that's mostly thc

121
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:52,000
dominant

122
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:54,399
here we have another one that's about

123
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,680
half and half thc in cbd

124
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,239
and here we have another one that's

125
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,840
almost all cbd and no thc

126
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,680
so for the people that in this room that

127
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,680
aren't actually handling the plants

128
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,519
please know you can't tell by looking at

129
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,360
it or smelling it what effect it's going

130
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:09,120
to have on someone we really need

131
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
the analytics to look at the medicine

132
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,360
and understand what it is

133
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:15,280
so also solving some of the biggest

134
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,439
problems we had practicing

135
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,839
cannabinoid medicine i came out with

136
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,639
healer.com which is a patient education

137
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,399
website

138
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,319
unlike other types of medicine with

139
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,399
cannabis i can't tell a patient

140
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,159
here take 10 milligrams three times a

141
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,120
day i might be able to say that as a

142
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,880
starting dose

143
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
but really cannabinoid medicine is

144
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:33,519
highly individualized and a lot of it

145
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,319
needs

146
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:37,439
dose titration and feedback with a

147
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,279
provider and most

148
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,639
clinicians don't have the time to do

149
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,399
that with their patients and don't have

150
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:44,160
the experience that i had

151
00:04:42,399 --> 00:04:46,000
that allowed me to do it so on

152
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,120
healer.com we have programs to take

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,800
someone who's never

154
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,639
used cannabis before who doesn't even

155
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,160
know what it is and walk them through it

156
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,800
kind of hold their hand and introduce

157
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,120
them to it

158
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,040
we have programs to take existing users

159
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,319
who are maybe using it recreationally

160
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,720
and want to start using it

161
00:04:58,319 --> 00:05:02,879
to promote health using it medically

162
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,800
switching from inhalation to tincture

163
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,399
non-psychoactive strategies and other

164
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,160
programs that can help patients

165
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:10,000
it's free so i invite you to check out

166
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,880
healer.com and share it with

167
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,160
your family friends and patients so

168
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,240
maine has a wonderful

169
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,639
medical cannabis program one of the best

170
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,478
in the country we have 13 indications

171
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,918
we'd like to see more but all the major

172
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:25,199
indications are on there

173
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:28,000
mds do's and mps are allowed to certify

174
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,319
we have eight dispensaries and over 2

175
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,199
000

176
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:32,879
caregivers home grow is allowed which i

177
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,560
like people can grow outdoors in the

178
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,240
summer and potentially produce

179
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,800
enough medicine to last them the whole

180
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,879
year donations are allowed so if a

181
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,800
patient or a caregiver has surplus

182
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:43,918
they can give it away freely without an

183
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,478
exchange of

184
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:48,000
value which is quite nice for the

185
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,839
altruistic

186
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,079
type of feeling that we get with

187
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:52,719
cannabis in the cannabis community out

188
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:54,719
of state

189
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,479
reciprocity so we have a lot of patients

190
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,840
from massachusetts coming to maine to

191
00:05:56,478 --> 00:05:59,599
access our program

192
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:01,519
i'm getting mainstream referrals from

193
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
the medical community all the time we

194
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:04,000
have

195
00:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,599
four pediatric neurologists in the state

196
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,478
they are all sending me their toughest

197
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,960
cases

198
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,959
and we have a collaborative grassroots

199
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,439
activism environment and i just want to

200
00:06:10,959 --> 00:06:13,439
thank

201
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:15,038
people like catherine lewis from medical

202
00:06:13,439 --> 00:06:17,439
marijuana caregivers of maine

203
00:06:15,038 --> 00:06:19,038
and glenn peterson both in the front row

204
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:19,759
these are fellow mainers we work

205
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,599
together

206
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:25,120
to create this good program and that

207
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,360
type of collaboration is essential

208
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,439
so dosing by the milligram i have found

209
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,600
in my practice that for the most part

210
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:34,639
the effective oral dosing range

211
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,280
goes from .05 milligrams per kilogram

212
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,360
per day

213
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,559
all the way up to 30 milligrams per

214
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
kilogram per day

215
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,600
so this would be like someone my body

216
00:06:40,478 --> 00:06:43,439
size taking

217
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
three milligrams of cannabinoids a day

218
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:48,160
and doing well versus taking

219
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,680
you know 1700 or maybe even two thousand

220
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,840
i will say it doesn't make a lot of

221
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,598
sense to dose adults by body weight

222
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:54,318
these compounds do go to the nervous

223
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:55,918
system and

224
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
i think our nervous systems all have

225
00:06:55,918 --> 00:06:59,839
pretty similar weights

226
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,918
but in in pediatrics we certainly need

227
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,918
dosing per kilogram

228
00:07:01,918 --> 00:07:05,198
this is such a broad dosing range we

229
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:06,079
really don't see this with other

230
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
medications

231
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:10,478
but we're still in a very safe range as

232
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,599
some of you know researchers have tried

233
00:07:10,478 --> 00:07:13,680
to kill animals

234
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,719
with high doses of thc and they simply

235
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,160
haven't been able

236
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,240
to do it including at you know 300 times

237
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,880
the dose that i'm seeing in my practice

238
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,000
at the high end let's see we've got a

239
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,240
little pointer here

240
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,720
so what i've also observed is this

241
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,280
biphasic or non-linear dose response

242
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,599
curve

243
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,159
where if someone starts at a low dose of

244
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,079
cannabinoids whether it's thc or cbd

245
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
and this isn't every case but a lot of

246
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:39,680
cases follow this trend

247
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
as they titrate up they'll get increased

248
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,840
efficacy up to a certain point

249
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,279
and beyond that point they'll start to

250
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:47,279
lose efficacy

251
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:49,198
everyone seems to have somewhat of an

252
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:51,359
optimal dose and i can't tell an

253
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,120
individual what their optimal dose

254
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,400
will be they'll have to find that out

255
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,240
for themselves so instead of

256
00:07:54,399 --> 00:07:58,079
recommending a dosage i recommend a

257
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,918
methodology for how to find

258
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:02,079
your optimal dosage and that seems to

259
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:04,318
work well the vast majority of our

260
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:05,839
existing cannabis users come here

261
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,439
and what we do for them is actually

262
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:09,679
reduce their dose so that they can

263
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,079
increase efficacy not only that they're

264
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,598
saving money and reducing side effects

265
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:15,439
this is well known in the animal

266
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:18,719
research so this is a study

267
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:21,038
on a lot of locomotor activity in rats

268
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,759
giving thc and you can see from the

269
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:26,318
baseline a very low dose of thc

270
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,240
0.2 milligrams per kilogram actually

271
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,160
decreased their activity level

272
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,080
then as the dose increased activity

273
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,080
level went up then as the dose

274
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
increased again activity level went down

275
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,680
again so this is

276
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,120
kind of a triphasic dose response curve

277
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
what's interesting is that at these

278
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,839
higher doses

279
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,278
five milligrams per kilogram they

280
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,440
weren't actually seeing the same

281
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,360
efficacy at these ultra low doses

282
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,120
but they were seeing the emergence of a

283
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,680
side effect in this case

284
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
catalepsy which is remaining still in an

285
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:54,719
unusual position

286
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:56,799
so i see this with my patients we can

287
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,959
get efficacy at higher doses

288
00:08:56,799 --> 00:09:01,199
but often at lower doses we get better

289
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,679
efficacy with less side effects and i

290
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,200
i believe that not many people in this

291
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:07,599
field are dosing as low

292
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,360
as i am this is also well established in

293
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,440
human data here's a trial

294
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,959
using nubiximals a one-to-one ratio of

295
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,200
cbd to thc

296
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,879
in patients with poorly controlled pain

297
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,399
already treated with opioids and here

298
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,559
you can see from baseline

299
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,399
the dose the group that was getting 20

300
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:23,919
milligrams did much better than the

301
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,200
group that was getting 52

302
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:30,079
or 83 milligrams less can be more with

303
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,080
cannabis it usually is

304
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,920
the entourage effect can also change the

305
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,800
dose response curve this was a study

306
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:37,759
from 2015 in rats looking at pain and

307
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:40,559
inflammation

308
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,360
and it showed that a full plant extract

309
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,319
of cbd

310
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
performed better than the individualized

311
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,519
cbd molecule

312
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,360
and with the full plant extract here on

313
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
the right we didn't see

314
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,120
this biphasic dose it just kept getting

315
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,159
better and better as the dose went

316
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,080
up so the whole plant entourage i think

317
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,559
can really change the dose response

318
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,240
curve

319
00:09:58,559 --> 00:10:02,000
and if we have the whole plant entourage

320
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,720
again i believe that we can get better

321
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,958
results

322
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,879
at a lower dose so for the patients that

323
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:08,159
are on too high of a dose i developed a

324
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:09,919
six day protocol

325
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,439
that gets them to lower their dose it

326
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:13,599
includes two days of cannabis

327
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,279
abstinence three days of very careful

328
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,360
titration and on the

329
00:10:15,278 --> 00:10:19,600
on the sixth day they go to the dose

330
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,919
that gets them the same benefit they had

331
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,920
uh previously and usually they've

332
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:25,599
reduced their dose by about 50 percent

333
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:27,519
doesn't work for everyone

334
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,278
but it it works for most people so

335
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,159
they're using less less side effects

336
00:10:29,278 --> 00:10:32,720
saving money

337
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:34,159
uh feeling more functional there is

338
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,320
supporting evidence

339
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:37,278
to this concept of sensitization to

340
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,278
cannabinoids

341
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:41,039
and most of you probably have your own

342
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,039
supporting evidence i think most people

343
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:45,360
for the first time when they try using

344
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:46,879
thc based cannabis whether it's in high

345
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,639
school or college or whenever

346
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,399
they don't feel anything the first time

347
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:51,679
and it's the second or third time

348
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,759
that they feel it maybe there's a

349
00:10:51,679 --> 00:10:54,879
sensitization process going on or maybe

350
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,720
they're just becoming

351
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,480
more aware of what those psychoactive

352
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,879
effects are like and how to describe

353
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,440
them

354
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:03,439
either way i think thank john mcpartlin

355
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,880
for these three references here

356
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,120
and this first one that just came out

357
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:07,759
this year so 48 hours of abstinence is

358
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,639
enough

359
00:11:07,759 --> 00:11:12,559
to return cannabinoid receptor levels to

360
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:13,439
their baseline after they've been down

361
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,278
regulated

362
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,440
due to thc tolerance but there's also

363
00:11:17,278 --> 00:11:21,679
evidence that thc can actually up

364
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,279
regulate the endocannabinoid system

365
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:27,039
at certain doses another

366
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:29,200
experience that i've had with thc

367
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,120
especially in cannabis naive patients

368
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,519
is this widening of the therapeutic

369
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,839
window over time so with any medicine

370
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,200
we have the effective dose and we have

371
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,880
the dose that's going to cause

372
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
intolerable side effects that's the

373
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,639
therapeutic window

374
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
with thc first of all cannabis naive

375
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:45,278
patients are much more likely to have

376
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,600
side effects

377
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:48,480
whereas regular users have much fewer

378
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
side effects

379
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,159
but over time thc can widen its

380
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,319
therapeutic window

381
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:55,759
people tend to build tolerance to the

382
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,000
effects of thc

383
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:59,759
at different rates and usually people

384
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,958
will build tolerance to the adverse

385
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,319
effects faster

386
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:04,879
than they build tolerance to the

387
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,278
beneficial effects so we can use this

388
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:09,200
understanding in our plan with patients

389
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:11,679
to help them get better efficacy

390
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,759
with less side effects there's also

391
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:14,958
bi-directional effects in cannabinoid

392
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:17,360
medicine and we see this

393
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:19,759
all over the place cannabis as martin

394
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,079
lee described it as a dialectical

395
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:23,360
substance or dialectical medicine so

396
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,679
first of all the same

397
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,480
medicine can have opposite responses in

398
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:28,319
different

399
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,000
individuals so you give it to someone

400
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,639
that's anxious it might make them less

401
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,839
anxious

402
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:33,600
but you give it to someone that's

403
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,720
relaxed it might make them more anxious

404
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,360
that's an old study

405
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,360
with thc from 71 but we see this all

406
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,240
over the place i give 9 out of 10 people

407
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,079
one strain

408
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,399
that gives them energy and the 10th

409
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,120
person it sedates them and it's all over

410
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,039
the place

411
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,879
in cannabinoid medicine it happens

412
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:50,399
within the same individual the same

413
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,159
medicine the same dose

414
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,839
give it to someone in a relaxing

415
00:12:52,159 --> 00:12:55,439
environment and they'll get even more

416
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,880
relaxed give it to someone in a

417
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,000
stressful environment

418
00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,159
and they'll get more anxious also the

419
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,360
different doses of the same medicine in

420
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,759
the same individual

421
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,720
can cause completely opposite effects

422
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:09,039
and with cannabis

423
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,519
overdose especially orally we tend to

424
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,799
see the symptoms that cannabis would

425
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,278
tend to treat

426
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:16,479
so if at a low dose it might reduce

427
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,519
anxiety reduce

428
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:21,200
pain reduce nausea at a high dose it'll

429
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,600
cause them to get anxious experience

430
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,000
pain and start vomiting

431
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,839
so one of the discoveries that i made a

432
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,039
couple years ago came from a mom

433
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,519
who came back with her seizure child and

434
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:33,759
said

435
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,879
this cbd is really working well to

436
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:36,559
reduce seizures

437
00:13:34,879 --> 00:13:38,240
we had just started the lab up and i

438
00:13:36,559 --> 00:13:40,239
said well let's find out what's in that

439
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,198
cbd and how much of the cbd they're

440
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,879
actually getting

441
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:44,799
so we ran the test and we found that

442
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:45,439
there was no cbd in the bottle there was

443
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:48,319
also no

444
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,360
thc in the bottle and there was quite a

445
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,480
small amount of

446
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,759
thca and this was a very surprising

447
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
finding to me so

448
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,639
probably 99 of the research on

449
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,680
cannabinoids as they act on animal

450
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
physiology

451
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,239
has been done on the neutral compounds

452
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,759
that have been decarboxylated this

453
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,079
uh oops sorry about that this carboxylic

454
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,319
acid group

455
00:14:09,078 --> 00:14:14,078
decarboxylates uh when exposed to heat

456
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,079
and so any all the smoking all the

457
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,879
heating and so forth changes the

458
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,239
acidic cannabinoids to neutral there's a

459
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,639
little bit of evidence

460
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,159
about the therapeutic effects of thc and

461
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,039
it's actually summarized beautifully in

462
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:27,759
a paper

463
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:29,439
on a poster that's downstairs thank you

464
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:31,439
to the author of that poster

465
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,000
but for one there's really no

466
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:36,079
psychoactivity especially at these doses

467
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,320
which are relatively high doses tested

468
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:38,559
in

469
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,480
animals we also know that thca

470
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:43,759
suppresses tumor necrosis factor

471
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,480
alpha which is a an inflammatory

472
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,480
mediator that's part of the process of

473
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,680
many different conditions

474
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,000
it's uh both thca and cbd are cox

475
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:54,879
inhibitors so they have these

476
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,360
anti-inflammatory properties

477
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:58,879
and interestingly cbda is kind of a

478
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,480
cox-2 selective

479
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:04,159
inhibitor but we don't know

480
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,039
too much more of that so a couple

481
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:09,759
interesting studies from 2013 came out

482
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:11,919
looking at thca to reduce

483
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:13,919
nausea and vomiting behavior in rats

484
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,159
that were treated with lithium chloride

485
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,078
and what they found was that these tiny

486
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:20,399
doses .05

487
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,439
milligrams per kilogram of body weight

488
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,399
of thca

489
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,600
reduce the the gagging episodes

490
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,559
significantly

491
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,320
whereas 10 times that dose of thca

492
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,559
didn't improve efficacy

493
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,399
and the same dose of thc did nothing

494
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,278
actually it was 10 times this dose of

495
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,958
thc

496
00:15:35,278 --> 00:15:39,600
that did something so the researchers

497
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:42,799
found wow one tenth of the dose of thc

498
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,680
thca can actually suppress this nausea

499
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:45,679
and vomiting

500
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:47,679
and the next study they did actually

501
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:50,319
switched over to microgram dosing so

502
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:51,120
this .05 this is 50 micrograms per

503
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,199
kilogram

504
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
they repeated the study using even lower

505
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,319
dosages of

506
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:59,199
cbda and found that one microgram per

507
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,600
kilogram

508
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,799
of cbda could reduce seizures this is

509
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,519
tiny tiny

510
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:07,519
dosing of the raw cannabinoids now thank

511
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,919
you to ethan russo for providing me this

512
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:11,360
uh

513
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:14,799
photocopy of the scan of the paper from

514
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:17,440
19 where where were we 79

515
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,719
showing that relatively high doses of

516
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,360
thca

517
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,320
had an anti-convulsion effect in mice

518
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,759
200 and

519
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,680
400 milligrams per kilogram so what

520
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,039
i'm seeing clinically i'm going to

521
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:32,078
present to you now

522
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,759
uh regarding ultra low doses of thca so

523
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:36,319
this was a five-year-old boy

524
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,440
who failed six anti-convulsants a

525
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,278
ketogenic diet

526
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,800
and a frontal lobectomy he had both

527
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:42,559
autism and seizures

528
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,919
they came to me from out of state they

529
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:47,119
had illegally tried

530
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,439
cbd thc and thca all without

531
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,959
efficacy in this dosing range two to

532
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,240
five milligrams

533
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:55,439
per kilogram per day and that's similar

534
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,079
to what you've heard some of the other

535
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,320
presenters

536
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,719
uh describe today so i thought you know

537
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,879
i've seen some responses to ultra low

538
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,199
doses of cannabinoids let's try that

539
00:17:02,879 --> 00:17:09,439
here let's decrease thca

540
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:12,000
to i was shooting for .05 milligrams per

541
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,798
kilogram per day

542
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,119
but instead of taking the 0.3 milligrams

543
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:19,279
of thca three times a day

544
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,198
the parents made a happy little accident

545
00:17:19,279 --> 00:17:24,240
and gave it just once a day

546
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,279
and so this is 15 micrograms

547
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,919
of a milligram micrograms per kilogram

548
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:30,079
per day

549
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,280
and the seizures totally resolved so

550
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,439
we're talking about a third of a

551
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,918
milligram once a day of thca

552
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,759
seizures resolved they doubled the dose

553
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:39,440
and the seizures recurred

554
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:42,240
they cut the dose down again and the

555
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,320
seizures resolved again

556
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,519
hard to believe but what i've found is

557
00:17:44,319 --> 00:17:47,519
that that

558
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:48,639
previous dose response curve that i

559
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,440
described

560
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
is here and ultra high doses by the way

561
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,798
can be very effective

562
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
in different conditions but i believe

563
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,519
that there's a dose response

564
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,960
section a curve way down here in the

565
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:02,720
microgram dosing range

566
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,480
that's actually effective not for

567
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,640
everyone but for many patients

568
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,519
and most of us clinicians are probably

569
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,360
starting here

570
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:10,960
some of us clinicians are probably

571
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,639
starting here or here

572
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,038
and we're missing this whole low part of

573
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:18,000
the dose response curve

574
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,240
so there's also evidence that thc can

575
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,440
have effects at these microgram doses

576
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,720
this was mice

577
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,440
thc given two hours before myocardial

578
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,679
infarction

579
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
improved fractional shortening troponin

580
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,280
leakage infarct size

581
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,360
and inflammation in that area so

582
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:36,160
cannabinoids and tiny doses

583
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:37,199
can do things physiologically that are

584
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
quite powerful

585
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,558
here's another case the 13 year old girl

586
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,558
with dravet syndrome

587
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:45,200
failed about 20 drugs vagal nerve

588
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:48,480
stimulator ketogenic diet

589
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,640
she had tried cbd and had some initial

590
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,038
improvement in cognition but anything

591
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
above this very low dose would increase

592
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:57,839
her seizures

593
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,480
they found that thca at 80 milligrams

594
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,558
per day

595
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:01,919
was the best treatment and overall had

596
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:04,240
about 90 percent

597
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
seizure reduction and i want to thank dr

598
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,359
gaitanas

599
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,199
for connecting me with this patient who

600
00:19:07,359 --> 00:19:11,199
made a profound influence

601
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,679
on my career and my life and he cared

602
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:16,880
for her for almost her whole life

603
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:20,000
thc also this these this family were

604
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,480
pioneers in using thc as a rescue to

605
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,038
abort

606
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,440
generalized seizures uh rubbing 10 to 20

607
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:25,919
milligrams of thc into the gums or using

608
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,480
it

609
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,679
rectally would abort the seizure within

610
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,240
less than a minute

611
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,200
sometimes just seconds really powerful

612
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,160
and of course there's all the

613
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,720
neuroprotective

614
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
aspects of thc on board for the seizure

615
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
recovery

616
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,558
now interestingly while she was using

617
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:44,080
thca

618
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,000
they switched strains and found that the

619
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:47,678
subsequent strain was not as effective

620
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,519
as the previous strain

621
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,880
so we said well get your hands on both

622
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:52,798
we want to test this

623
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,480
so they tested both and what we what we

624
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:56,639
found was that the strain that worked

625
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,720
had very high levels of linalool

626
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
linoleul is a terpene that's found in

627
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,880
lavender it's known to have sedating

628
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,000
properties and also in a couple studies

629
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:07,520
anti-convulsant properties and animals

630
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,279
so you can start to see how the

631
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:10,879
entourage makes sense

632
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:12,720
when working with these terpene

633
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,559
compounds and cannabinoids

634
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,000
uh this strain worked well the other

635
00:20:14,558 --> 00:20:18,240
strain worked somewhat

636
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,079
but this this worked the best and just a

637
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,640
little tribute to cindy mae who died

638
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:24,720
a few weeks ago of sudden unexpected

639
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
death and epilepsy and we continue to

640
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,880
learn

641
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:28,399
from all that she taught us she was an

642
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:35,840
incredible patient and i'm

643
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:35,840
just so honored to be part of her path

644
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,720
so the last case that i'll present a

645
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:43,200
five-year-old with epilepsy having two

646
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,519
to thirty clusters of partial seizures

647
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
uh every day plus a ton of clonic

648
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,480
seizure each night

649
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:53,279
failed a few drugs and so we started thc

650
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,759
at this new low dose you know that was

651
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:58,158
about .05 milligrams per kilogram so

652
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,558
this is one milligram of thc

653
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,000
twice daily had an immediate effect four

654
00:21:00,558 --> 00:21:04,000
days seizure free

655
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,759
right after starting that it's so

656
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,960
surprising that one milligram can have

657
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:09,038
this powerful effect

658
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,640
we went up to two milligrams twice a day

659
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,919
all the seizures resolved except for

660
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,759
that nighttime seizure

661
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,520
which was now averaging every other

662
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:17,919
night instead of every night

663
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,798
and uh currently this family's tapering

664
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:23,280
valproic acid they've went from

665
00:21:19,798 --> 00:21:25,359
625 down to 125 milligrams daily

666
00:21:23,279 --> 00:21:26,480
we increased thca a little bit to

667
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:28,240
control seizures

668
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,400
and he's doing well they're very happy

669
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,960
with on the lower dose

670
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,159
that his hair is growing back so that

671
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,159
this family is

672
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,200
very enthusiastic so some of my take

673
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,720
home messages

674
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,038
there is a extraordinarily wide and safe

675
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,400
effective dosing range for cannabinoids

676
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:46,720
and i encourage

677
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,960
clinicians and also the people that are

678
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
designing experimental trials to explore

679
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,400
the edges of this wide effective dosing

680
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,279
range because there's some really

681
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,519
interesting

682
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:56,558
results we have these multiphasic dose

683
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:58,158
response curves

684
00:21:56,558 --> 00:22:00,158
we see bi-directional effects in

685
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:01,360
cannabinoid medicine it might be a pain

686
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,440
to control for those

687
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:06,399
in clinical trials but i think we have

688
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,240
to understand how this medicine works

689
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,320
very promising results with acidic

690
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
cannabinoids i encourage people to try

691
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:13,200
them

692
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,840
and of course the improved efficacy with

693
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:27,840
the synergy of the final constituents

694
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:27,839
thank you very much

695
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,918
you
