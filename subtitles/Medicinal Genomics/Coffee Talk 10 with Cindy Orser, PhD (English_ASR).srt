then you may not have heard

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,840
that can med 2020 has been postponed to

20
00:00:51,198 --> 00:00:54,799
april

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
2021 our team made the difficult

22
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:59,280
decision to push the event back

23
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,079
given the fact that california like most

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,600
of the u.s

25
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,198
is still battling the covet 19 pandemic

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,118
after speaking with the pasadena

officials

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,960
as well as the canmed team we felt that

30
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,640
moving the event to april 2021

31
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:17,039
would be the best way for us to provide

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,560
a safe environment for everyone

33
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,159

on this episode i had the pleasure of

58
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,959
speaking with cindy orser

59
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:15,519
chief scientific officer at clip labs

60
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,239
dr orcer has more than 25 years of

61
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,239
experience

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,640
innovating technologies related to

63
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,840
cannabis human diagnostics

64
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:25,679
and even detecting bio threat agents

65
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,520
we spent most of the conversation

66
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,000
talking about the panel cindy will

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,879
moderate at canmed 2021

68
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,199
titled the hitting costs of cannabis

69
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,359
environmental impact

70
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,518
in that panel she and her fellow

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
panelists will explore how current

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,599
cannabis cultivation practices

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,920
contribute to air pollution

74
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,119
water pollution and increased energy

75
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,479
consumption

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,519
and also how the federal ban on cannabis

77
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:56,238
is actually worsening those problems

78
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,480
we also talked about terpenes because dr

79
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
orcer co-authored a really interesting

80
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,000
article titled

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,040
making sense of cannabis strains through

82
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,158
chemometrics

83
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:07,840
in review cindy is a big proponent of

84
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,239
terping testing

85
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,759
and the way that it can help consumers

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
better understand the differences

87
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:17,120
between cannabis cultivars

88
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,000
she also cautions that without terpene

89
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
testing

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,199
consumers are blind to vape products

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,920
that may add

92
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,280
large unnatural amounts of terpenes to

93
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,039
the products

94
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,120
to date there hasn't been any research

95
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:30,959
into what if any health risks come with

96
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:34,319
inhaling those compounds in such

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,759
large concentrations before i get to my

98
00:03:34,318 --> 00:03:37,359
conversation with cindy

99
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,719

135
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,280
tremendous help to our team when it

136
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,359
comes to

137
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:11,198
evaluating the abstract submissions and

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,639

139
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,160
on behalf of everyone in the candidate

00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,840
team i want to thank you for that first

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,840
and foremost

142
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:21,038
yeah of course um

143
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:23,279
i'm really excited to talk with you

144
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:25,759
today because i know that you're leading

145
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,359
a very interesting panel at this year's

146
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,280
event that's all about

147
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,400
the environmental impacts of cannabis

148
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:32,399
cultivation

149
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:34,000
so i was hoping you could tell us a bit

150
00:05:32,399 --> 00:05:36,319
about what we can expect from that

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,918
discussion

152
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:43,120
yeah sure no i'm happy to do that um

153
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:47,038
when the canmed organizers asked me

154
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:49,038
for some ideas for panels you know what

155
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:50,879
i thought would be interesting

156
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:53,279
i mean this is something that's been on

157
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:57,038
my mind for a while

158
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,758
um because i think there just has not

159
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,360
been

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,439
much of any attention placed on

161
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,680
you know what is the true cost of

162
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:07,839
growing cannabis

163
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,639
you know in in this case we're taking it

164
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:13,918
from an environmental perspective

165
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,038
but i think because cannabis has been

166
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:20,399
under federal prohibition for all this

167
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:23,519
while it's really hindered any research

168
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:25,918
into what the impact of what is now

169
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,000
a multi-billion dollar industry in the

170
00:06:25,918 --> 00:06:30,799
united states

171
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,399
on what is still a schedule one drug at

172
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,800
the federal level

173
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:35,679
so there's been very limited studies

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
that have

175
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:42,639
documented the environmental impact from

176
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:45,280
cultivation of cannabis and production

177
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,800
and there are some emerging human

178
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,359
environmental impacts

179
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,879
that we need to address we need to

180
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,160
categorize them

181
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:57,120
and we have to use them to inform

182
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
policies going forward of course if we

183
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,000
had

184
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,279
federal legalization i think it would

185
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,399
solve almost

186
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:06,559
all of these problems and we would

187
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:07,598
be able to come up with a cohesive way

188
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,360
of addressing it

189
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:15,598
there would be federal grant money made

190
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:17,919
available to study these impacts

191
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:18,800
and it's just way overdue you know

192
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:22,478
whether

193
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,639
we're looking at uh air pollution

194
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:30,478
land use to inform land use policies

195
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,038
energy consumption and water water usage

196
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,159
and

197
00:07:31,038 --> 00:07:36,639
water pollution those are just

198
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,599
you know the big ones there are other

199
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,800
ones that

200
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:45,038
we also don't talk about which is

201
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:47,918
just all the waste the packaging waste

202
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:49,680
the spent cannabis waste that's going

203
00:07:47,918 --> 00:07:52,000
unused uh

204
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,439
the exposure of cannabis workers in the

205
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,439
workplace

206
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:57,439
and of course you know the unknown

207
00:07:55,439 --> 00:08:00,160
long-term health impacts from

208
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,240
chronic administration of high potency

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,280
cannabis i mean there's a myriad of

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,759
topics

211
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:08,239
but we decided to focus it on the

212
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:12,160
environmental impact

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,079
so it i think it'll be very uh timely to

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,599
address some of these issues and get

215
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:18,000
some input

216
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,000
from some of the people who are studying

217
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,360
this now

218
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,478
right and it sounds like a lot of this

219
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,879
research

220
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:28,719
is sort of in its early stages that fair

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,080
to say

222
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:35,918
yes it definitely is um

223
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:39,440
you know it's really been uh

224
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:42,958
emanating from a handful of

225
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:47,200
academicians who've taken it up uh

226
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:50,639
because of their interests and

227
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,040
and state-based inquiries

228
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:55,199
like several states are now looking at

229
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:57,799
sustainability

230
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,839
and they've formed working groups on

231
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:03,120
sustainability

232
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:07,519
so there has been some effort put

233
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,720
out there to look at these enormous

234
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,519
energy and water costs

235
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,639
that go into the indoor grow environment

236
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:17,440
and of course

237
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,720
it takes us right back to that federal

238
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,040
prohibition

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,000
and the state spending for themselves

240
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:25,759
and coming up with

241
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,799
these incredibly complex regulatory

242
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:32,399
requirements for growing cannabis

243
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:38,079
that has forced the industry indoors

244
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:41,519
and so there's these intensive energy

245
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,240
operations that are kind of out of sight

246
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,399
right so

247
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,000
it's again one of those things that if

248
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,399
you don't see it if you're not

249
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,159
involved in the industry and you're not

250
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:54,240
aware of it you might

251
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:56,480
smell uh the effluent when you drive

252
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,080
by some of these big growth and then you

253
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,519
immediately know oh yeah there's

254
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,920
something gross here

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,639
but you don't even think about that

256
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:07,360
those

257
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:09,679
volatile organic compounds are actually

258
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,959
interacting with emissions from

259
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:14,159
automobiles

260
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:18,159
and forming destructive compounds

261
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:21,439
uh contributing to to ozone

262
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:24,000
so it's good to start to get a handle on

263
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,440
what are the levels of these vocs there

264
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,639
was a study done in colorado that showed

265
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,440
that

266
00:10:28,639 --> 00:10:32,240
cannabis indoor growth has probably

267
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,600
doubled

268
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,320
the volatile organic emissions there

269
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
and you know cities along the front

270
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,720
range

271
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,159
of colorado already are dealing

272
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,040
with air pollution issues so that's just

273
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:51,439
one example of course you move into

274
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,799
california the larger

275
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:59,040
issue is water and water

276
00:10:54,799 --> 00:11:00,799
theft and disastrous downstream water

277
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,559
consequences

278
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:07,039
killing aquatic life and

279
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:08,958
stealing water that would normally be

280
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:13,199
going to either communities

281
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:16,399
or to other agricultural operations

282
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,480
and of course energy's big one i've

283
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,679
heard some crazy figures and i don't

284
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,720
even know

285
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:26,559
how accurate it is but that

286
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,920
um energy consumption from indoor growth

287
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:30,799
is equivalent to about four percent of

288
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,759
all the

289
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,439
energy that's consumed in the us so it's

290
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,720
very significant

291
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,360
you go into the north west part of the

292
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,800
country

293
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
where energy is produced from

294
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,000
hydroelectric power so there you have

295
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,120
the intersection of both

296
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:52,078
energy production and water use and

297
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,078
you know how should water be used and

298
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:56,078
energy

299
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,078
consumption be used and how do we

300
00:11:56,078 --> 00:12:01,120
regulate it and it's just all so

301
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:04,559
chaotic and it would be ever so nice

302
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,480
if we could have a cohesive national

303
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:10,958
uh policy of on these issues

304
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,720
yeah that issue and many others in this

305
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:17,119
space unfortunately

306
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,560
yeah but right i'm curious so how many

307
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,278
or how much of this sort of

308
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,879
environmental impact is due to the fact

309
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:25,838
that a lot of these grows are

310
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:25,838
indoors

311
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:32,719
well i think that is

312
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:35,679
largely uh the source of the problem

313
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,160
right i mean what i keep trying to think

314
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:39,838
of

315
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:42,879
any other agricultural cash

316
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,399
crop that's this large right

317
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:47,200
the cannabis industry is multi-billion

318
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,320
dollar

319
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,839
that is being grown indoor under

320
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,399
intensive energy requirements

321
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,360
i just don't think there's any kind of

322
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,159
comparison

323
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,720
and of course the reason it's indoors is

324
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:04,000
because

325
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,519
states and localities when the industry

326
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,278
was standing up

327
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,440
nobody wanted to see it you couldn't

328
00:13:07,278 --> 00:13:11,360
grow it outdoors it's not allowed to be

329
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,720
grown outdoors and you have to have

330
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:18,240
these elaborate security systems

331
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:21,920
and it should be grown outdoors i mean

332
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:24,079
it's nuts and and you know combined with

333
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:27,439
the fact that we have these artifacts

334
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:30,559
artificial geographic boundaries that

335
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,920
oh you can't move cannabis across the

336
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,159
state line

337
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:35,838
so that requires every cannabis

338
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,719
complicit state

339
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,600
to have this very intensive agriculture

340
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,800
going on

341
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:45,199
you know for example i mean las vegas

342
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:48,319
why is las vegas growing

343
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:49,198
marijuana indoors i mean it's so hot

344
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,519
there

345
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:55,039
and lake mead is at its lowest level of

346
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,240
all times

347
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:01,519
and there's no other crop that it

348
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,560
has to be grown locally because

349
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:07,278
of lack of federal regulation right

350
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:09,679
right we don't like in vegas they don't

351
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,519
grow their own strawberries and grapes

352
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:14,000
and pears and almonds

353
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,879
but they have to grow their own cannabis

354
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,919
so it just

355
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:19,360
doesn't even make sense um and i think

356
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:22,078
part of it is because

357
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,000
we don't see it most people don't see it

358
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,719
because it's in these large warehouses

359
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,919
so you don't realize how absurd

360
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,199
it all is and the fact that these plants

361
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:34,559
should be growing

362
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:36,479
outdoors like we see hamp growing

363
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,719
finally now of course northern

364
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:43,759
california is unique because

365
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:47,519
i think there's something like 14

366
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:49,759
uh trespass grows on federal state and

367
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,879
private land up there

368
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:57,198
in california has this

369
00:14:52,879 --> 00:15:01,439
uh rotarian law that if you're

370
00:14:57,198 --> 00:15:05,198
um agricultural

371
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:08,320
plot comes in contact

372
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:10,159
with a waterway that you have a right to

373
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,360
use some of that water

374
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:14,639
so that's a very unique situation to

375
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,560
california that

376
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,839
has led to this massive depletion

377
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,198
and erosion of waterways and northern

378
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,920
california

379
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,240
and then and then because a lot of them

380
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,278
are

381
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,639
black market grows they use massive

382
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,159
amounts of pesticides and rodenticides

383
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,278
because they want to kill the small

384
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:39,838
rodents and then all of those chemicals

385
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:41,278
leach into the strains and kill the fish

386
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,920
and end up

387
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:46,240
you know downstream in somebody's

388
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:50,000
drinking water source so

389
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:54,720
if there's a domino effect here

390
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,879
um it's just time to address it i think

391
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,639
absolutely and it's it's interesting you

392
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,039
talk about

393
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,399
um the difference between cannabis and

394
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:04,639
hemp regulations where

395
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,078
hemp is is pretty much allowed to be

396
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,480
grown outdoors

397
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:09,679
uh i recently spoke with seth crawford

398
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,360
who's going to be our cultivation

399
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,078
keynote at canmed

400
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
um and he said one of the main reasons

401
00:16:14,078 --> 00:16:16,638
that

402
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,720
he and his brother founded oregon cbd

403
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,399
and kind of went into hemp is because of

404
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,199
the regulations were more

405
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,480
sort of relaxed and they could grow at a

406
00:16:23,198 --> 00:16:26,319
much larger scale

407
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,680
outdoors and sort of do the breeding

408
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,199
activities that they were really

409
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,599
interested in doing

410
00:16:29,198 --> 00:16:32,958
and that um he also highlighted that

411
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,079
it's it's sort of

412
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:39,518
madness that so much of the cannabis

413
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:43,198
is grown indoors and locally yeah

414
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,879
yeah it's it is mad madness

415
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:48,958
so it doesn't make sense yeah and so one

416
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:51,198
of my questions i was going to ask was

417
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:53,119
you know how is the impacts of cannabis

418
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,519
cultivation on the environment sort of

419
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,959
different or similar than other crops

420
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:57,839
and i think you already answered that is

421
00:16:56,958 --> 00:17:00,559
that you know no

422
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,240
other major crop is really grown indoors

423
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:05,279
correct

424
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:08,558
no i mean i i am hard pressed

425
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:11,038
to come up with anything i mean in the

426
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:15,359
u.s we used to grow

427
00:17:11,038 --> 00:17:18,720
um some ornamental plants and flowers

428
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:20,719
and greenhouses i mean growing in

429
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,919
greenhouses would be a step

430
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:27,038
forward from how it's grown

431
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:30,400
now with all the hvac

432
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,960
requirements in these hot climates

433
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,919
and you know the water consumption that

434
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,798
was the other

435
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
analogy i remember there's some

436
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:40,879
commercial

437
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:44,639
for california almonds and one

438
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:48,240
almond takes 26 gallons of water

439
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,360
well i was figuring out how much water

440
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,079
one cannabis plant would take

441
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:54,959
and it uses about six gallons a day so

442
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:58,558
even if it's

443
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,759
a short season of 100 days that's

444
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:05,200
600 gallons of water or

445
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:07,759
uh one cannabis plant that would make i

446
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,919
don't know two to five pounds of

447
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:15,038
flour i suppose so

448
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:18,480
water's a big deal and i think water is

449
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:22,798
is going to be a prime

450
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,798
topic of discussion going forward

451
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,039
there's more and more of the

452
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,480
arable land around the world

453
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:33,038
is going to become you know

454
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,480
uncultivatable

455
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:38,480
because of the lack of water

456
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,240
so i think we need to be smarter and we

457
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,079
certainly could be smarter if we had

458
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,480
some cooperation at the federal

459
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:45,839
level and that's interesting too because

460
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,880
i i imagine that

461
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,119
water consumption must be different in

462
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,960
an

463
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:53,319
indoor versus outdoor environment just

464
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,558
because indoor you might be growing

465
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:57,678
hydroponically

466
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,918
or in cocoa or some other

467
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,720
medium instead of planting directly into

468
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,640
the soil

469
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,240
is is that true is that fair to say

470
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,480
that's right you know that

471
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,000
that is and there are some innovation

472
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:11,440
trends out there

473
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,720
so uh for those cultivators who are just

474
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
starting out and can

475
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,400
build their facility in a smart way

476
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:19,199
there's

477
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,679
this cogen technology that's been around

478
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,519
for a while that combines heat

479
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:28,559
with power it was used originally

480
00:19:25,519 --> 00:19:31,420
to grow tomatoes next to

481
00:19:28,558 --> 00:19:32,639
power plants so you don't

482
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:36,880
[Music]

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,520
lose electricity over transmission lines

484
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,400
it's all

485
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:40,879
right there together and so i've seen

486
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,000
some

487
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:45,039
interesting uh cultivation facilities

488
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,440
that have been

489
00:19:45,038 --> 00:19:49,440
set up from the beginning that way you

490
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,160
can also have take a closed

491
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,880
loop approach where you are recovering

492
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:59,000
the water and you have elaborate

493
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,240
um water

494
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,119
reprocessing so you're collecting all of

495
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,599
that water

496
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,279
or the humidity that's being transpired

497
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,759
off the plants and you kind of have a

498
00:20:07,279 --> 00:20:10,798
closed

499
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:14,079
loop but if you're already in

500
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:17,200
a large indoor grow being

501
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:20,480
able to retrofit that into a more

502
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:23,519
innovative design

503
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,919
is prohibitively expensive and

504
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:28,400
and you know not to totally knock the

505
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
cultivation industry because they have

506
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,798
come up with innovation

507
00:20:29,839 --> 00:20:34,000
of course the biggest one was switching

508
00:20:32,798 --> 00:20:37,519
over to led

509
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
lights from fluorescent lights they

510
00:20:37,519 --> 00:20:41,279
cost more again to install but they last

511
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,640
10 times as long

512
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,839
they don't emit heat you can spectrally

513
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,960
tune them

514
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:53,119
they last 10 times longer

515
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,400
so and you most large growths now

516
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,599
have computer controlled cooling so it's

517
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,480
not just like an

518
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:02,158
on off switch it's only used when it's

519
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:05,519
when it's required

520
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:07,280
um and then you can take the entire

521
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:09,200
green approach if you're growing

522
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:12,639
outdoors with a closed loop

523
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:15,919
where you chop the

524
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,320
remaining plant biomass and you put it

525
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,520
back

526
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:23,759
into the soil or you use it to compost

527
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:26,000
and you can have a much healthier

528
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:27,440
approach to agriculture but again that

529
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,720
takes a lot more

530
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,000
a lot more time and input so your

531
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,038
profits go down

532
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
and and in these states where there

533
00:21:35,038 --> 00:21:39,200
hasn't been

534
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,599
any limit on the number of licenses that

535
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,640
have been

536
00:21:39,599 --> 00:21:47,439
issued for cultivation i mean the the um

537
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,840
competition is fierce and then on top of

538
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,360
that

539
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:52,000
you have these horrendous reoccurring

540
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,678
annual

541
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:58,798
fees and the taxes and

542
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:00,080
you know it's hard to compete with the

543
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,839
black market

544
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:05,839
especially in california oregon hawaii

545
00:22:03,839 --> 00:22:07,759
even in california i mean the black

546
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:11,678
market is still

547
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:14,158
large so i see that as

548
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,840
wrapped up into this entire problem of

549
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,240
what is the real cost of growing

550
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:20,000
cannabis it's also you have to take that

551
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,839
into account

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,519
yeah and as you pointed out earlier the

553
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:26,158
black market is certainly not

554
00:22:23,519 --> 00:22:27,759
um immune to some of these environmental

555
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,880
impacts even though they may be growing

556
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:30,879
outdoors they might

557
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,320
they have a whole whole other set of

558
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,679
issues

559
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:37,279
yes yeah so

560
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,960
so you sort of touched on this a little

561
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,319
bit but i don't know

562
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:42,000
forgive me if i'm putting you on the

563
00:22:40,319 --> 00:22:45,200
spot but if you were to

564
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,519
start a new cultivation um

565
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,798
operation what would sort of be the the

566
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:50,400
ideal setup

567
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:54,319
in terms of you know limiting the

568
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:56,720
environmental impact

569
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:56,720
um

570
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,840
well i you know if you could grow in a

571
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,038
greenhouse

572
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,279
if whatever state you were in if it was

573
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:09,599
allowed to grow in greenhouses

574
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:11,038
i mean that that would be the way to go

575
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:14,798
so at least you're taking

576
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:17,839
advantage of sunlight

577
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:20,879
so you don't have to have grow light or

578
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,879
minimal grow light you can

579
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,480
take advantage of the natural

580
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
ventilation system

581
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,279
that greenhouses offer and if you could

582
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,000
uh have some type of

583
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:36,000
water stream recovery so you're

584
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,839
recycling your water

585
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,279
i've always thought you know there's

586
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:42,319
these grows dump

587
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:45,359
so many nutrients into their

588
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:46,399
growing operations and usually it just

589
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,038
goes

590
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,080
into the sewage i mean there's like no

591
00:23:49,038 --> 00:23:53,839
reclamation

592
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:56,158
and most uh huge treatment plants water

593
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:59,918
treatment plants don't have a way

594
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:02,880
to reclaim those nutrients so

595
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,600
that leads to the common problem of

596
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:08,559
algal

597
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:10,399
blooms downstream of agricultural runoff

598
00:24:08,558 --> 00:24:12,879
i mean this is something

599
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,240
this is a sin that's not limited to the

600
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,840
cannabis industry

601
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,319
i mean it's been a problem with

602
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,240
agriculture for a long time is

603
00:24:18,319 --> 00:24:26,079
capturing runoff and these high levels

604
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:28,159
of nutrients that the plants just aren't

605
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,519
able to consume because of over

606
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,000
application

607
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,119
so that's something else that people

608
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,558
growers are getting

609
00:24:33,119 --> 00:24:38,479
smarter about is actually monitoring the

610
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:39,119
amount of nutrients that plants are

611
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,200
using

612
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:45,599
so that you're not over fertilizing

613
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,640
right yeah and i think one of the other

614
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,599
things you touched on

615
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,278
too is that part of the problem is that

616
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:52,879
you know cannabis cultivation has become

617
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,720
hyper localized just because of the

618
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,320
federal prohibition and i have to

619
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:00,319
imagine that once that

620
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:02,798
once that goes away then you know some

621
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:05,038
enterprising cultivator is going to find

622
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:07,359
the perfect environment to grow cannabis

623
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:08,240
in this country and then just kind of

624
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:12,240
dominate the

625
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:14,480
the scene and um yes yeah so then we'll

626
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,759
we'll have big ag moving in we'll still

627
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,319
have some of the

628
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:19,038
we'll have some boutiques greenhouse

629
00:25:18,319 --> 00:25:23,119
farmers

630
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:26,400
probably that curate uh specific strains

631
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:28,959
that their clients want or have

632
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,200
unique attributes of course we'll also

633
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:34,240
continue to have breeding efforts

634
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:37,679
that will maximize

635
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:40,240
some of the lesser well-known secondary

636
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:43,519
metabolites that this plant makes

637
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:46,960
but yeah and by in large part

638
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:48,798
it will move into big mechanized ag

639
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,720
as we've seen i mean it's already

640
00:25:48,798 --> 00:25:54,480
happening in the hemp world

641
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,600
pretty quickly um so

642
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,759
yeah i think that will be the evolution

643
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,480
of yeah yeah and then hopefully those

644
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:05,599
small boutique pros will really kind of

645
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,720
um be committed to sustainable

646
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:12,079
um type of agricultural processes so

647
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,278
hopefully that will yes but this is a

648
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:16,720
good segue you're talking

649
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:18,798
you're talking about um uh these smaller

650
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,038
growers and kind of maybe growing up the

651
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:21,918
more uh lesser-known cannabinoids and

652
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,200
things

653
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,440
one of the things i wanted to talk with

654
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,840
you about um was an article that i had

655
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,240
read on cannabis science and technology

656
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,759
which was titled making sense of

657
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:35,038
cannabis strains through

658
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,558
chemometrics in review um

659
00:26:35,038 --> 00:26:38,319
something that you had authored with

660
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,119
philippe henry who's another

661
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:41,678
another friend of medicinal genomics um

662
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:44,639
yeah

663
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:46,480
so i wondered if you could uh we could

664
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,320
talk a bit about that and maybe a good

665
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,960
place to start is to kind of explain

666
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:51,119
kind of

667
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,319
what is chemometrics and how can that be

668
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:54,879
kind of apply to

669
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:58,158
helping people make sense of the various

670
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,159
numbers of strains out there

671
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:06,158
yeah so i you know i have to say that

672
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,919
one of the reasons i got involved

673
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:13,039
in cannabis testing

674
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
was to bring transparency to the end

675
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:16,640
user

676
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:20,000
because it was so obvious to me

677
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,200
that this strain naming was just

678
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,880
ridiculous and and that even

679
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:30,080
indica and sativa basically had no

680
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:33,360
defensible scientific meaning anymore

681
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:36,639
and stray names had nothing

682
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:41,599
with nothing more than branding and

683
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:45,520
um so i set out to demonstrate that

684
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:46,558
this is when i was running digipath labs

685
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,158
in las vegas

686
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:52,639
and we had taken in enough samples

687
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:53,278
at the beginning that we had 400

688
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,480
different

689
00:27:53,278 --> 00:27:59,519
named strains and i

690
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,120
saw the chemical profile data so

691
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:04,639
chemometrics is just

692
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:07,278
looking at the chemical profiles for

693
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:09,759
plants and that's based on whatever

694
00:28:07,278 --> 00:28:13,278
analyte groups you're looking at

695
00:28:09,759 --> 00:28:16,720
and i had the good fortune of

696
00:28:13,278 --> 00:28:20,398
nevada including terpenes as well as

697
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,640
cannabinoids for chemical profiling and

698
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,158
i

699
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,240
certainly believe that the cannabinoid

700
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,960
profile combined with the terpene

701
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,319
profile

702
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,440
makes up the chemometric the

703
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:36,158
fingerprint of that strain so

704
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,919
we showed that if we just looked at

705
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:42,640
cannabinoid profiles

706
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:45,759
97 of all those strains from

707
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:48,159
the vegas area were identical

708
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:49,119
meaning they were all drug type one they

709
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,120
were all high

710
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:56,158
thc because for whatever

711
00:28:53,119 --> 00:28:59,918
misinformed reason uh

712
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:03,440
consumers of cannabis value

713
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:06,799
cannabis products based on how high the

714
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:10,320
thc content is

715
00:29:06,798 --> 00:29:13,839
and very few growers at that time

716
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:15,839
in vegas and even today were growing cbd

717
00:29:13,839 --> 00:29:17,199
dominance strains so they were all high

718
00:29:15,839 --> 00:29:20,959
thc

719
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:25,120
and then we did the same analysis on the

720
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,079
chirping profile across 19 terpenes

721
00:29:25,119 --> 00:29:28,959
and showed that they clustered into

722
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,158
three different

723
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:35,840
groups and then working with

724
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:39,039
medicinal genomics we genotyped

725
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:42,720
about 90 of those

726
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:47,200
strains and philippe

727
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:50,240
was able to identify 14 snips

728
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:54,319
through that data that we could also use

729
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,960
to assign a terpene cluster for

730
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,960
any given strain that we

731
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,038
had selected so it clearly

732
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,240
uh showed that terpenes were more

733
00:30:06,038 --> 00:30:11,679
informative if you wanted

734
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:14,720
to bring some order to all of these

735
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:18,000
strain names and uh

736
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:21,200
subsequent groups have done that

737
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,960
you know ethan rousseau and mark lewis

738
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,960
have done that and there are other

739
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,360
people who have

740
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:29,278
suggested very similar things about the

741
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:33,599
value of

742
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:33,599
clustering based on terpenes

743
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:39,919
and of course terpenes are the sensory

744
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:42,558
perception you have when you

745
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,360
smell cannabis i mean cannabinoids have

746
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:47,359
no odor

747
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,678
so you're perceiving that

748
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:52,079
strain through the combination of

749
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,440
volatile organics which are largely the

750
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,798
terpenes

751
00:30:53,440 --> 00:31:00,240
um that that particular strain

752
00:30:56,798 --> 00:31:02,519
produces right and what's more is

753
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,798
we we now know that terpenes are

754
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:07,839
physiologically active

755
00:31:04,798 --> 00:31:11,200
so that's why i'm a firm

756
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:13,199
believer that you have to know what the

757
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
terpenes are because it's actually the

758
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,159
terpenes that

759
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:23,359
impart the subtlety that uh

760
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,360
users uh perceive between strings

761
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:27,038
right um so i was wondering if you could

762
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,960
give

763
00:31:27,038 --> 00:31:30,558
maybe a little bit of a primer for maybe

764
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,720
the uninitiated

765
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:35,278
our podcast uh we have we like to think

766
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,120
we have a wide range of folks who are

767
00:31:35,278 --> 00:31:39,679
at various levels in their cannabis

768
00:31:37,119 --> 00:31:40,158
journey so um i think you did a pretty

769
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,320
good job

770
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,640
of laying out uh the difference between

771
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:47,678
cannabinoids and terpenes but maybe

772
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,440
maybe a explain like i'm five sort of uh

773
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:52,320
explanation would be in order here

774
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,320
before we get too deep

775
00:31:52,398 --> 00:31:58,558
um well so from a

776
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,679
chemical structural standpoint i mean

777
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:02,879
cannabinoids

778
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:06,320
are terpenes so terpenes are just a

779
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:09,840
group of chemicals that have

780
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:12,480
uh isoprene a five carbon structure

781
00:32:09,839 --> 00:32:13,359
as their building block and they can get

782
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,720
linked together

783
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:19,038
so they can be monoterpenes die

784
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,480
chirping sesquiterpene so they can get

785
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:23,679
bigger and bigger

786
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:26,880
um they're they're both made and

787
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:30,399
and collect in the trichomes so

788
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,159
um the you know the plant is making the

789
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,199
terpenes as

790
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,640
either to attract certain

791
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,360
uh pollinators or repel certain insects

792
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,679
so

793
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:42,798
you know plants don't move around so

794
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,360
they make these

795
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:47,038
volatile organic compounds as a way to

796
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,319
communicate

797
00:32:47,038 --> 00:32:54,640
with their environment and the

798
00:32:50,319 --> 00:32:56,798
organisms insects and predators or

799
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:57,759
attractants that are are in their

800
00:32:56,798 --> 00:33:01,278
environment

801
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:05,359
so it's actually really interesting and

802
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:09,359
um because you can

803
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:12,158
just smell terpenes

804
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:14,319
and you can then measure them in your

805
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:17,120
bloodstream so

806
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,599
you're bringing them into your body

807
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,798
through

808
00:33:17,599 --> 00:33:22,798
receptors in your olfactory and

809
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:26,798
because they travel throughout your body

810
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:30,158
we

811
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,480
now know that those same receptors exist

812
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,200
in

813
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
other organs of your body which gives

814
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,600
evidence

815
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,720
that they actually perform a

816
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,879
physiological function

817
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,480
and we know that more than anything from

818
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,840
animal studies

819
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:47,278
and the particular receptors that they

820
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,839
bind to

821
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:55,038
are a part of the glutamate

822
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:58,798
nmda they're all uh

823
00:33:55,038 --> 00:34:00,398
sedative by and large in the human body

824
00:33:58,798 --> 00:34:03,839
so they're binding

825
00:34:00,398 --> 00:34:06,158
to these neurotransmitter systems

826
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,199
so i like to see it you know very

827
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,159
simplistically

828
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,918
that the endocannabinoid system is the

829
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,240
big

830
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:18,559
overarching uh regulator

831
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:20,000
of uh neuroexcitatory pathways in your

832
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:22,320
body the dopamine

833
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,039
response and then underneath that you

834
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
have

835
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,279
the terpenes that are binding to these

836
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,800
other secondary

837
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,720
but extremely prevalent neuro

838
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,280
excitatory pathways so they you know

839
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:37,918
there's some people like the entourage

840
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,240
effect

841
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,279
uh term and some people don't but

842
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,959
clearly

843
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,679
uh these groups of chemicals are working

844
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,639
synergistically

845
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,358
and uh you know it's i think it's well

846
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,200
proven

847
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:55,759
that the more you purify

848
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,598
any one of the cannabinoids and remove

849
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,000
it from these other secondary

850
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,440
metabolites that the plant makes

851
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:06,800
the less of a beneficial effect

852
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:10,240
you have because you've like you know

853
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,079
taken it out of its um chemical

854
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:16,000
environment that it

855
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,480
more normally operates in

856
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,519
i think you're right and after doing

857
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,440
canmed for

858
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:23,440
for five years now i think we've seen

859
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,280
plenty of evidence to support the idea

860
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,358
of the entourage effect

861
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,480
but unfortunately unfortunately for the

862
00:35:27,358 --> 00:35:31,199
consumer

863
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,880
they're not really they're not often

864
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:35,598
kind of privy to that information

865
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,760
either because um the state doesn't

866
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,720
require them to test for terpenes or

867
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,480
it's only

868
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:44,000
a few a few of the major ones um

869
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,079
so i gotta imagine that's that's a huge

870
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,599
problem for um for folks when they're

871
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,160
really trying to figure out the

872
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,800
the product that's gonna work for them

873
00:35:50,159 --> 00:35:54,159
yeah no

874
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,000
it's it it's there's a huge gap um

875
00:35:54,159 --> 00:36:01,598
there needs to be a informed educational

876
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,079
component and you know i tried to do

877
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:05,440
that

878
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,039
through the dispensary owners

879
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:12,000
in vegas but again

880
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:13,679
everybody falls back to well what's the

881
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,800
percent thc

882
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:20,000
right that's for whatever reason

883
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,160
that's just a mindset and

884
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,358
it's it's like how we got into this

885
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,799
crazy mindset

886
00:36:23,358 --> 00:36:28,000
that that fat is bad and that you should

887
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,960
have a low-fat

888
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,480
diet or that salt is bad you shouldn't

889
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,599
have salt and it's just

890
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,719
ridiculous because we

891
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,920
need to consume fats and actually

892
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:44,000
moving toward low-fat diets has probably

893
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,200
led to some of the

894
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,000
mental health issues we have because

895
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:52,239
it's highly important to take in fats

896
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,880
and certain types of fats it's important

897
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:56,639
to

898
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:57,440
have salt now they've restricted salt so

899
00:36:56,639 --> 00:37:00,480
much in

900
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:03,599
some retirement uh

901
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,079
facilities that they're now giving

902
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:06,838
the um people who live their salt

903
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,839
tablets

904
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:10,719
because you need salt for your enzymes

905
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:14,159
to function

906
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:17,039
so you know these extreme

907
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,159
viewpoints that somehow get out there

908
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:21,039
and are promoted

909
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:22,078
are just are just erroneous and it just

910
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:25,119
takes too much time

911
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:28,240
to undo them right

912
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,599
and so is there any way that a consumer

913
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,759
kind of absent having

914
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:34,960
a good laboratory result saying that the

915
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,440
terpene concentrations can sort of

916
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,119
at least make an educated guess can they

917
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,599
just follow their nose is that a

918
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,119
reliable way to do it

919
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,240
well so yeah actually that's

920
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,240
what we've all been left to do is to

921
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:53,199
figure this out on our own

922
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:54,479
and particularly if you're if you're not

923
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:58,319
overly curious

924
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,280
and researching things online i mean at

925
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,559
least now there

926
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,160
are sources of information online you

927
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:08,159
can go on to leafly

928
00:38:04,159 --> 00:38:08,879
and if you have been buying say gorilla

929
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:11,598
glue

930
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,280
and you like that strain you can go and

931
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,599
look it up and you can see what are

932
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,880
those

933
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,800
terpenes and then you can

934
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,920
find other products that have those

935
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,640
terpenes

936
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,280
but you know the first step is to

937
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:27,039
educate

938
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,720
people that terpenes are contributing to

939
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:32,239
the physiological outcome of consuming

940
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,239
that particular

941
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,959
strain or product and you know now we

942
00:38:36,239 --> 00:38:39,838
see

943
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:42,240
and now that a lot of the producers have

944
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,759
kind of jumped onto the terpene

945
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:47,199
bandwagon

946
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,320
or good or bad they're

947
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:53,519
adding terpenes back into products right

948
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,400
and just like thc

949
00:38:53,519 --> 00:38:58,239
too much of a good thing is not is not

950
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,519
better

951
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:04,479
and um so

952
00:39:01,519 --> 00:39:07,199
we we had seen extremely high levels of

953
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:10,000
terpenes and certain vape cartridges

954
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:10,639
and you know it's it's just it's not

955
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,119
right

956
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:16,559
uh um to to just

957
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:17,920
indiscriminately be adding them and this

958
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,199
comes back to another

959
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:21,838
big problem within the industry is that

960
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:24,399
there's

961
00:39:21,838 --> 00:39:25,920
there's no requirement to list the

962
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,760
additives

963
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:33,519
that are going into these

964
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:37,040
extracts and i think that should

965
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:38,880
definitely be a requirement particularly

966
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:42,800
if you're in a state where

967
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,119
terpene analysis isn't required

968
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,119
then the testing lab would never even

969
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:49,280
see that

970
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,800
and you know we kind of got into that

971
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,000
issue when

972
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,200
some of the black market was uh adding

973
00:39:54,000 --> 00:40:00,239
vitamin e acidity

974
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:01,838
i mean a lot of harm can be done because

975
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:03,358
there's a big difference if you're

976
00:40:01,838 --> 00:40:05,759
ingesting

977
00:40:03,358 --> 00:40:06,400
a terpene or rubbing a terpene on your

978
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,240
body

979
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:13,760
versus inhaling it into your lungs so

980
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:18,639
we desperately need some

981
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:22,480
oversight as to what is going into these

982
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:24,480
high concentration vape cartridges

983
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,400
yeah that's an interesting point because

984
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,760
if i understand correctly the

985
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,280
the terpene levels are usually quite low

986
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:34,960
right like fractions of a percent so

987
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,640
um yeah that they're yeah they're

988
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,679
usually in flower

989
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:42,559
you know two to four percent oh okay

990
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,279
yeah but i can imagine that you know if

991
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:44,639
you're

992
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,480
if you're adding them to a vape

993
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:48,799
cartridge they could be

994
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,760
much higher than that and then to your

995
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,960
point sort of

996
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:56,319
what's what's the effect of that or

997
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,318
you know right because

998
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:04,079
because these concentrates are so

999
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,960
pure and so sticky and they need to be

1000
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,400
diluted

1001
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,318
and so now all of a sudden it turns out

1002
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:15,200
chirpings are a very effective diluent

1003
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:15,679
to dilute the product because like the

1004
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:19,838
like

1005
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:20,559
dissolves like and terpenes are a good

1006
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:23,679
um

1007
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:26,799
dilution uh component for

1008
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,919
concentrated cannabinoids but uh you

1009
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,720
know i i think

1010
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
anything above five percent is not a

1011
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:35,279
good idea

1012
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:39,200
we had seen um chirping concentrations

1013
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,960
as high as 26 25

1014
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,598
it's way too high but we don't know

1015
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,920
because

1016
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,200
oh nobody's ever done a study about oh

1017
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,720
you know

1018
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:53,118
is it a good idea to uh vaporize and

1019
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:55,439
inhale terpenes at that level yeah

1020
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:57,119
probably not

1021
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,639
sounds like a good topic for a canmed

1022
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,160
presentation

1023
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:04,559
yeah yeah yeah

1024
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:06,000
well all right cindy i want to be uh

1025
00:42:04,559 --> 00:42:07,358
