1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,928
welcome everybody as everybody's

2
00:00:01,889 --> 00:00:05,580
filtering back in I do want to start by

3
00:00:03,928 --> 00:00:06,269
giving a shout-out to the mckernon

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,960
brothers

5
00:00:06,269 --> 00:00:14,129
Brendan Brian and Kevin and they are the

6
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,949
prime movers of can med and they are an

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,449
amazing trio of brothers an amazing

8
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:23,060
group of entrepreneurial intellectuals

9
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,189
and it's been great to get to know them

10
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:28,559
last few years and to work with them my

11
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,000
family embarrass we would become good

12
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:32,058
friends and collaborators and I

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,710
appreciate their invitation for me to

14
00:00:32,058 --> 00:00:39,269
share some of our work at project CBD

15
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:41,628
and my focus lately on psychedelics you

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:45,180
know yesterday you heard a lot about

17
00:00:41,628 --> 00:00:50,308
cannabinoid acids so today you will hear

18
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:53,070
about acid and cannabinoids you know we

19
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:56,448
there is a sort of a revival of

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:59,730
scientific inquiry now into psychedelic

21
00:00:56,448 --> 00:01:02,159
therapy and its potential there what I

22
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,399
want to focus on and in this discussion

23
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:07,560
is how the endocannabinoid system

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,130
actually mediates many of the key

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:15,000
aspects of the psychedelic experience I

26
00:01:11,129 --> 00:01:16,739
won't ask for a show of hands of who is

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,150
familiar with this personally I don't

28
00:01:16,739 --> 00:01:23,188
think I can see the hands anyway because

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:26,400
of the light but so buckle up it's an

30
00:01:23,188 --> 00:01:28,559
interesting discussion so let's start

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,618
with the classical psychedelics in the

32
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,570
mid in the early 1950s it's really the

33
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:35,728
the classical psychedelics were grouped

34
00:01:33,569 --> 00:01:39,258
into three categories you have the

35
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:42,799
tryptamines that's DMT is the active

36
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:46,680
hallucinogenic component you know that's

37
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,590
the part of an ayahuasca by boga roux

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:52,829
there's the fennel fennel Iowa means

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:55,590
that's mescaline and peyote and the what

40
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:58,649
I'm calling but life Sergey means LSD

41
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,359
which interesting LSD is unless urja

42
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,799
casts it could be derived both from the

43
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:06,180
fungus and from plants the drive fungus

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,599
and also from the more in glory seeds

45
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,409
and the Hawaiian baby red worms

46
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:14,509
what's important about the early

47
00:02:12,409 --> 00:02:17,240
psychedelics is how they catalyzed that

48
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:20,419
the field of serotonin neuroscience in

49
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,640
1954 there were two scientists from

50
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:24,979
Rockefeller Institute Woolsey and Shaw

51
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:27,859
that drew attention to the structural

52
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:30,259
similarity of the LSD molecule and the

53
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:32,570
serotonin molecule you know at that time

54
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:34,429
this is really the beginning of the

55
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,909
whole discussion that when the lingo

56
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:39,530
that we're used to these days of new of

57
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,539
neurotransmitters and receptors that's

58
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,240
really where it all began in the context

59
00:02:41,539 --> 00:02:48,219
of the serotonin neuroscience of which

60
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,710
LSD played such a kettle catalytic role

61
00:02:48,219 --> 00:02:54,109
so the early LSD research at LSD was

62
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:56,360
really the star of the show in the 1950s

63
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:57,920
at least up until the very late 50s

64
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,630
that's really where the focus was in

65
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:01,659
terms of medical science research and

66
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:04,549
there's quite a bit of it

67
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:09,310
there were truly two ways of two

68
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:11,330
paradigms if you will of looking at LSD

69
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:13,250
initially it was really looked at as a

70
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,959
psycho to memetic age and something that

71
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:17,569
would mimic madness that would create an

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,310
artificial schizophrenia this gave rise

73
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:21,169
to some very interesting theories and

74
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,909
possibilities that if they could find

75
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:25,009
something that could be an antidote to

76
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,989
the LSD schizophrenia maybe it would

77
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:31,099
work for real schizophrenia and so forth

78
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:34,159
but as the as the 50s were preceded that

79
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:38,269
way of looking at LSD and psychedelics

80
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,579
was supplanted by what you could call

81
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:42,860
the the psychedelic paradigm if you will

82
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,450
it was dr. Humphrey Osmond who coined

83
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,370
the word psychedelic and it simply means

84
00:03:44,449 --> 00:03:48,469
mind manifesting it's a very neutral

85
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:51,170
term it doesn't have any associations

86
00:03:48,469 --> 00:03:53,989
initially with the 1960s and the

87
00:03:51,169 --> 00:03:55,729
Paisley's and dayglo and so forth it's

88
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:58,849
appropriate term maybe all it meant was

89
00:03:55,729 --> 00:04:01,609
that these drugs were psychodynamic and

90
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,969
had a way of bringing up making

91
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:08,150
conscious whatever is unconscious in

92
00:04:04,969 --> 00:04:10,759
almost value-neutral way and that's why

93
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:13,030
it was useful for therapy was seen in

94
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:16,699
terms of the therapeutic indications

95
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:19,100
initially with what doctors caught on to

96
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:21,060
in the early 50s as potential for LSD as

97
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:22,710
a treatment for alcoholism

98
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:26,459
and it was duck doctor I'm tree Osman

99
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:29,279
who also was involved in that research

100
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:31,319
very early on and it was very exciting

101
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,750
they had very good results that they

102
00:04:31,319 --> 00:04:36,509
couldn't really explain but it was so

103
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:38,790
substance abuse depression and trauma

104
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:42,750
were really the three areas that seem to

105
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:44,669
be indications that LSD was potentially

106
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:47,459
useful and useful for in a therapeutic

107
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:49,349
context so you had from the 1950s

108
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:51,930
through the 1960s you had more than

109
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,990
1,000 clinical papers about LSD and

110
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:56,040
psychedelics and they described 40,000

111
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:57,629
patients

112
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,480
there were several international

113
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:02,790
conferences about LSD therapy some of

114
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,530
these were actually sponsored by the

115
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,110
Central Intelligence Agency in the

116
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:09,359
United States overall there was a lack

117
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:10,919
of adverse reactions reported to LSD

118
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,160
when it was in a controlled clinical

119
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:16,349
setting and a meta-analysis that was

120
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,590
done and I guess 2016 looking back on

121
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,650
this research the meta-analysis of the

122
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:25,829
controls trial said that there was a

123
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:27,810
demonstration of a consistent and

124
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:31,529
clinically significant beneficial effect

125
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:33,810
of hide those LSD therapy so what

126
00:05:31,529 --> 00:05:35,609
happened was because of the 1960s and

127
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:39,600
the association of LSD with the

128
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:41,580
political turmoil during those years all

129
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,939
the psychedelic research was basically

130
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:47,728
put on hold and stopped and there was a

131
00:05:44,939 --> 00:05:49,379
hiatus that was really basically a

132
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:53,189
political reaction to the non-medical

133
00:05:49,379 --> 00:05:55,168
use of LSD in the 1960s and for two

134
00:05:53,189 --> 00:05:56,610
decades really nothing was happening in

135
00:05:55,168 --> 00:05:59,609
terms in at least in the United States

136
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:01,530
in terms of research into psychedelics

137
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,680
and the therapeutic potential and it

138
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:07,859
started up again in 1992 but instead of

139
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:10,530
the focus being on LSD that was

140
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,910
supplanted by a scientific research into

141
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:18,089
psilocybin the the magic mushroom

142
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:21,810
extract if you will and the the so there

143
00:06:18,089 --> 00:06:24,629
really wasn't much work on LSD its since

144
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,339
really the the mid 1960s but the work on

145
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:27,860
psilocybin proved to be very very

146
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:30,029
interesting you are two independent

147
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:31,908
randomized controlled trials and

148
00:06:30,029 --> 00:06:33,739
randomized control trials for

149
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:35,789
psychedelics are

150
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,550
obviously sort of challenging because

151
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:40,350
it's very difficult to hide from someone

152
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,060
the fact that they've been given a drug

153
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,860
if they're you know if they're tripping

154
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,269
out you know but nonetheless there's

155
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,009
been efforts made in this area they were

156
00:06:45,269 --> 00:06:48,779
two very interesting independent

157
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:51,360
randomized controlled trials that showed

158
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:54,299
psilocybin had significant long-lasting

159
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,100
efficacy against cancer related anxiety

160
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,900
and depression so it wasn't like you

161
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,189
take the dose and you feel better while

162
00:06:57,899 --> 00:07:02,039
you're under the influence of the drug

163
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:05,879
that the effect of the antidepressant

164
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:09,060
effect anti-anxiety effect lasted there

165
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,159
was a 2011 study at Johns Hopkins that

166
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,689
reported that psychedelics can trigger

167
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:17,900
contribute content type of experiences

168
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:20,310
and healthy people resulting in again

169
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:24,029
long-lasting sustained positive

170
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,339
personality changes a large percentage

171
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:28,169
of people in these studies rated the

172
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:29,729
psilocybin experience is one of the most

173
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:33,060
meaningful of their lives and that's

174
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:35,910
sort of a you hear that again and again

175
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:38,220
in this context just to look a little

176
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:40,020
bit closer at some of the interesting

177
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,680
work done with psilocybin before we

178
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:45,029
moved in into the endocannabinoid system

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,280
there was this study from Imperial

180
00:07:45,029 --> 00:07:52,469
ecology you see the the abstract is

181
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:56,399
posted where they actually used fMRI to

182
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:59,940
analyze brain activity brain frequency

183
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:01,500
in under the influence of psilocybin so

184
00:07:59,939 --> 00:08:04,110
you have this is your brain on drugs you

185
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,269
see some of the images there so the

186
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:08,400
study from Imperial College was

187
00:08:06,269 --> 00:08:14,209
psilocybin for treatment resistant

188
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:14,209
resistant depression and MI and I

189
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:20,850
looking at the MRI brainwaves so this is

190
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,799
at Imperial College they probe the

191
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,780
neural correlates of psychedelic

192
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,970
experience and they looked at the

193
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:28,589
changes in brainwave activity changes in

194
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,240
brain activity under the influence of

195
00:08:28,589 --> 00:08:34,129
psilocybin this is the first time this

196
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:37,440
was seen of this kind of imagery of

197
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:39,479
psychedelic experience a drawback of the

198
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,979
study there was no cluelessly bill

199
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:43,740
control for this it was a relatively

200
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,040
small number of patients but for all 19

201
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,919
patients that psilocybin experience was

202
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:52,198
see was was shown to be efficacious with

203
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:56,129
assistant psychotherapy along with it

204
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:57,809
there was always a a talking session

205
00:08:56,129 --> 00:09:00,059
that went with the therapy before and

206
00:08:57,809 --> 00:09:02,069
after and that was important that that

207
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,049
was part of it and so for

208
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,550
treatment-resistant depression for all

209
00:09:04,049 --> 00:09:09,120
19 patients that breakthrough

210
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:10,469
experiences and what what's the reason

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,870
for this why does this happen the

212
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:15,569
analysis given by the the scientists

213
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:18,839
from Imperial College they they felt

214
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:20,189
that what they saw with the imagery had

215
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:22,350
to do with something called the default

216
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,779
mode network of the brain which is not

217
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,970
so much a brain area as a bunch of areas

218
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:29,669
and the circuitry between the areas and

219
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,730
it's almost like that's what's what's

220
00:09:29,669 --> 00:09:35,309
going on when you're on automatic pilot

221
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:36,959
it's said to be the the neurological

222
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:39,869
basis for the self that might be an

223
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:42,239
overstatement I think but what they what

224
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:47,850
they found was that under the influence

225
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:50,299
of psilocybin the in the the default

226
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,528
mode network was basically suspended and

227
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,448
something else was going on it was a

228
00:09:52,528 --> 00:09:56,278
great deal of activity when ordinarily

229
00:09:54,448 --> 00:09:58,889
there wouldn't be so there was a

230
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,480
follow-up study or follow-up analysis of

231
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,209
the all the patients six months later

232
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,579
and again they found the antidepressant

233
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:07,469
effects lasted all this time from is

234
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:09,419
well actually they use ultimately two

235
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:11,519
doses in this so you have this long

236
00:10:09,419 --> 00:10:13,708
lasting effect as a result of this study

237
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,659
and others the FDA is actually

238
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:19,429
fast-tracked psilocybin as a treatment

239
00:10:15,659 --> 00:10:21,568
for a treatment resistant depression

240
00:10:19,429 --> 00:10:23,458
which is quite exciting that's in

241
00:10:21,568 --> 00:10:25,349
progress that we might see psilocybin

242
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:29,129
approved no there are some caveats there

243
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:32,790
with yet the approval and so forth but

244
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:33,990
the so that's what that's what they saw

245
00:10:32,789 --> 00:10:35,188
and this is what they've seen in other

246
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:37,110
studies it's not like that it's been

247
00:10:35,188 --> 00:10:39,240
extensive research with psilocybin and

248
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:41,100
since 1992 and it's started again but

249
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,589
there's enough to really you know raise

250
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,209
a great deal of interest in hope so I

251
00:10:43,589 --> 00:10:47,880
want to switch gears a little bit and

252
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:50,250
talk about ketamine another hallucinogen

253
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:52,828
at least in high doses it acts as a

254
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:56,059
psychedelic Ken Amin already is widely

255
00:10:52,828 --> 00:10:59,099
used as an antidepressant off-label

256
00:10:56,059 --> 00:11:00,039
ketamine is an FDA approved drug but not

257
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,500
for depression

258
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:05,439
it's it's approved as a dissociative

259
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,669
anesthetic as a painkiller and oh

260
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,100
there's been a couple of papers

261
00:11:06,669 --> 00:11:10,959
published within the last two years that

262
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,180
show that the pain-killing effects of

263
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:16,660
ketamine both in terms of central and

264
00:11:13,179 --> 00:11:18,569
peripheral based pain are both mediated

265
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:22,360
by through the endocannabinoids system

266
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:24,010
and I think that there's enough

267
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,129
compelling evidence to show that the

268
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:28,870
antidepressant effect from ketamine is

269
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:30,580
also mediated by the endocannabinoid

270
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,659
system ago going to that for a moment

271
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,420
Wow

272
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:35,949
what's interesting about the the the

273
00:11:34,419 --> 00:11:37,719
treatment centers that have popped up

274
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,640
all over the place now that people can

275
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,800
get Academy in treatment again they're

276
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:44,409
finding that the the effect of the the

277
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:46,539
the antidepressant effects lasts more

278
00:11:44,409 --> 00:11:49,029
than just the the drug itself it will

279
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:50,829
last for a week or two and for people

280
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:54,189
who are suffering from refractory

281
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:57,070
depression this is a godsend the other

282
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,360
thing is that they found in in the

283
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:00,040
research that n-doped the

284
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,800
endocannabinoids actually will

285
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:06,159
potentiate the effect of ketamine the

286
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:08,439
way this is working and and this is

287
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:10,899
actually I believe eyeglasses for this

288
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:14,230
one but you could see the title of the

289
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:17,259
abstract it's focusing on how the the

290
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,629
interplay between cannabinoids and the

291
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:22,419
NMDA glutamate receptor that's that

292
00:12:19,629 --> 00:12:27,639
glutamate receptor is a is actually an

293
00:12:22,419 --> 00:12:29,919
ion channel and what what what ketamine

294
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,669
does is it blocks this ion channel and

295
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:35,379
as a result of doing that it it triggers

296
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:38,740
the release of something called brain

297
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:41,230
derived neurotrophic factor and the NDF

298
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:43,720
has been described as fertilizer for the

299
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,600
brain and what it does it stimulates

300
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:48,550
neurogenesis the the creation of new

301
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,680
brain cells in particular areas of the

302
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:52,959
brain which what happens into adulthood

303
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:54,459
actually this process but what what

304
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,850
ketamine does it sort of boost this

305
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:59,650
effect and not just for neurogenesis but

306
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:02,860
neuroplasticity and synaptogenesis

307
00:12:59,649 --> 00:13:06,549
actually the growth of new new dendrites

308
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:10,029
on a cell so ketamine's rapid

309
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:12,429
antidepressant effect involved enhanced

310
00:13:10,029 --> 00:13:13,039
BDNF induced in neurogenesis and

311
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,679
synaptic

312
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:17,838
Genisys there was one study that showed

313
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,299
a 10 milligram and 10 milligram per

314
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:22,880
kilogram dose of ketamine produced a

315
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:24,708
robust increase in dendritic spine

316
00:13:22,879 --> 00:13:26,600
density meaning the growth of the the

317
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:30,068
dendrites that hung on the cell and the

318
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:33,199
prefrontal cortex of rats okay so

319
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:37,088
looking at this a little bit closer the

320
00:13:33,198 --> 00:13:39,198
DNF and the endocannabinoid system

321
00:13:37,089 --> 00:13:41,660
unfortunately I cannot read very well

322
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:45,799
because it's good but on the cellular

323
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:48,169
level the cannabinoid system regulates

324
00:13:45,799 --> 00:13:52,328
the expression of brain derived

325
00:13:48,169 --> 00:14:00,049
neurotrophic factor on a cellular level

326
00:13:52,328 --> 00:14:02,719
and that's and so what we have going on

327
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:04,939
here is a ketamine which is stimulating

328
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,610
a brain derived neurotrophic factor and

329
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,410
that that process is regulated by the

330
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:13,399
endocannabinoid system that's what this

331
00:14:09,409 --> 00:14:14,990
paper shows to explore this a little

332
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,139
more let's look at endocannabinoids

333
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:20,659
system in neurogenesis in general what

334
00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:22,909
we know from various research is that

335
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:25,610
the endocannabinoids signaling actually

336
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:28,610
choreographs the creation of the nervous

337
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:32,690
system in the brain in in the embryo so

338
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:34,399
it's involved in regulating the process

339
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:36,889
of creating brain cells and neurons

340
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:39,049
literally and that process while it

341
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,629
drops off significantly after birth it

342
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:43,759
does continue and there are two new

343
00:14:41,629 --> 00:14:46,220
what's called neurogenic niches in the

344
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,379
brain and in the hippocampus there's the

345
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:51,230
sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus

346
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,698
and the subventricular zone of the

347
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:54,589
lateral ventricles these are the two

348
00:14:52,698 --> 00:14:57,049
areas in the hippocampus that have

349
00:14:54,589 --> 00:15:00,170
identified is the areas where neurons

350
00:14:57,049 --> 00:15:02,028
are created and these are areas of the

351
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,938
brain that are heavily populated by

352
00:15:02,028 --> 00:15:07,639
cannabinoid receptors and it's been

353
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:08,990
shown that an activation of the cb1

354
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:11,959
receptor in the brain actually

355
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:14,389
stimulates neurogenesis and it's also

356
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:15,948
shown that cb2 receptors in the brain

357
00:15:14,389 --> 00:15:17,750
and there's some controversy if they're

358
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:19,278
generally in the brain cb2 if they're

359
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,318
only emerged when you have an injury or

360
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:25,340
when you need it to be there but that

361
00:15:21,318 --> 00:15:28,189
the CBD cb2 receptor the cb2 cannabinoid

362
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:31,759
two drives neurogenesis and improves

363
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,800
functional outcome after a stroke it's

364
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,470
also been shown that the pharmacological

365
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:38,419
blockage if they give a drug that will

366
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:40,970
block the cannabinoid receptors from

367
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:43,009
acting or if they create mice that they

368
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:45,980
have the cannabinoid receptors deleted

369
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:49,210
that results in impaired neurogenesis

370
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:51,649
chronic stress depletes neurogenesis

371
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:56,389
file which is the enzyme that breaks

372
00:15:51,649 --> 00:15:58,639
down Oh cannabinoid if you if you

373
00:15:56,389 --> 00:16:00,799
inhibit Fah and results in an increase

374
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,600
in neurogenesis so that really they've

375
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:03,319
determined this in various ways what's

376
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:07,430
going on

377
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:11,030
the scientists neurogenic activity is

378
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:14,929
most robust at least after the child is

379
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:19,909
born in during during childhood

380
00:16:14,929 --> 00:16:21,469
it tends to decline over age and it can

381
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:25,219
decline to the point of no activity

382
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:27,740
within an elderly person in the gradual

383
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,960
reduction in new brain cells creation

384
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:32,539
has been linked to cognitive decline and

385
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,940
neuro generative disease exercise

386
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:36,620
enriched environment mental engagement

387
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,160
intermittent fasting and a good night's

388
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,250
sleep

389
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,870
all those boost neurogenesis so again

390
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,850
this is a process that's continually

391
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,560
happening our brains to one degree or

392
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,210
another but there are certain things

393
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,739
that will boost that process and it

394
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:51,280
turns out that's like Adele of drugs do

395
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:53,480
as well as I'll show in a moment so

396
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,029
neurogenesis in particularly areas of

397
00:16:53,480 --> 00:17:00,580
the hippocampus but neuroplasticity

398
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:02,470
throughout much of the brain and the

399
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,459
endocannabinoid system regulates

400
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,769
neuroplasticity throughout the Blayne

401
00:17:04,459 --> 00:17:09,080
brain including the striatum where

402
00:17:06,769 --> 00:17:11,119
various forms of bride directional

403
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:13,549
endocannabinoid mediated plasticity

404
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,819
occur again this is what the science is

405
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:19,250
showing so in the cannabinoid attic

406
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:22,329
plasticity within the hippocampus is

407
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:24,680
well-documented synaptic plasticity

408
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:27,259
basically what that means is changes in

409
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,060
the strength between the the neurons

410
00:17:27,259 --> 00:17:31,250
themselves long-term potentiation

411
00:17:29,059 --> 00:17:33,829
involves strengthening connections

412
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:35,720
between neurons long-term depression in

413
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:37,789
the hippocampus basically means

414
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,809
weakening those connections or that's

415
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:41,359
how we

416
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:43,460
literally clear memory within the

417
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:45,379
hippocampus through a process known as

418
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,450
long-term depression we don't need to

419
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,310
remember everything things that are

420
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,220
important now we might you know

421
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,200
gradually those we asthma shulam says

422
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:56,150
nature is stingy if you don't need it we

423
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,000
don't use it if we're not using those

424
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,550
memories or relying them they fade away

425
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,430
as part of this process so

426
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:06,710
endocannabinoids signaling facilitates

427
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:09,019
adaptive learning the brain's ability to

428
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:11,210
make new neural connections and correct

429
00:18:09,019 --> 00:18:14,269
abnormalities from chronic stress and

430
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,910
it's the cb1 receptors that can happen

431
00:18:14,269 --> 00:18:20,480
on receptors in the brain that mediate

432
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,759
changes in synaptic plasticity it's been

433
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:29,019
shown that the cb1 knockout mice have

434
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:33,769
reduced dendrix dendritic activity and

435
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:37,069
within the prefrontal cortex again it's

436
00:18:33,769 --> 00:18:39,889
all ends up saying the same thing so

437
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:41,779
this looking at substance abuse because

438
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:44,030
recall now with LSD and the early

439
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:46,099
research substance abuse alcoholism was

440
00:18:44,029 --> 00:18:47,389
something that showed a great deal of

441
00:18:46,099 --> 00:18:50,599
potential in terms of what the

442
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:54,140
psychedelics maybe could do and there's

443
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:57,109
been interesting work on endocannabinoid

444
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:00,200
system in substance abuse this is one

445
00:18:57,109 --> 00:19:02,539
study from 2011 endocannabinoid mediated

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:06,410
synaptic plasticity and addicted

447
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:07,849
addiction related behavior to look at

448
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:13,279
this a little more closely in terms of

449
00:19:07,849 --> 00:19:15,639
alcoholism and neurogenesis what what

450
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,200
we've learned is that substance abuse

451
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:19,970
causes a disruption in the synaptic

452
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,830
plasticity of the brain circuits

453
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:24,339
involved in addiction with the

454
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:27,259
alteration of normal endocannabinoids

455
00:19:24,339 --> 00:19:29,809
playing a very important role the

456
00:19:27,259 --> 00:19:32,119
chronic alcohol exposure reduces

457
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:34,669
endocannabinoid activity and disrupts

458
00:19:32,119 --> 00:19:36,229
adult neurogenesis and the

459
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:38,420
endocannabinoid system is one of the

460
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,819
most relevant biochemical systems

461
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:43,759
mediating alcohol addiction adult

462
00:19:40,819 --> 00:19:46,549
hippocampus hippocampal neurogenesis is

463
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:48,859
a key factor involved in drug abuse and

464
00:19:46,549 --> 00:19:51,099
it may provide a new strategy for the

465
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:56,229
treatment of alcohol addiction

466
00:19:51,099 --> 00:19:58,899
and dependents in terms of depression at

467
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:01,240
Toronto a neuronal atrophy related to

468
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,880
depression a plasticity very you can

469
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:07,569
think of it as plasticity is is a sign

470
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:11,380
of health a dendritic atrophy is as a

478
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,190
of the standard antidepressants are

479
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:35,259
contingent on enhanced nor hippocampal

480
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,870
neurogenesis and they work by promoting

their Genesis and facilitation of

482
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:42,699

483
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:44,589
a treatment strategy for clinical

484
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:47,919
depression and for various neurological

485
00:20:44,589 --> 00:20:50,579
diseases like Alzheimer's MS Parkinson's

486
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:54,640
and so forth

487
00:20:50,579 --> 00:20:56,379
turns out THC promotes neurogenesis THC

488
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:00,280
enhances neurogenesis in the hippocampus

489
00:20:56,380 --> 00:21:02,110
improving cognitive function of rats THC

involved in all stages of neurogenesis

496
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:25,658
of the neurogenesis mechanism and as I

497
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:29,048
think it was Dustin pointed out earlier

498
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:30,820
today ultra low doses of THC have

499
00:21:29,048 --> 00:21:32,950
actually been proposed as a possible

500
00:21:30,819 --> 00:21:36,730
remedy for for brain injuries and

501
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:42,669
age-related brain decline ultra low

502
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:45,940
doses CBD is also neurogenic CBD induces

503
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:48,788
a rapid and sustained antidepressant

504
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:50,769
effect through increased BDNF signaling

505
00:21:48,788 --> 00:21:54,788
and synaptogenesis in the prefrontal

506
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:56,679
cortex the pro neurogenic effects of CBD

507
00:21:54,788 --> 00:21:58,658
might explain some of the positive

508
00:21:56,679 --> 00:22:02,290
therapeutic features of CBD based

509
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:04,570
compounds CBD attenuates the decrease in

510
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:06,700
hippocampal neurogenesis and

511
00:22:04,569 --> 00:22:09,908
right spine density induced by chronic

512
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:12,460
stress and load this is interesting low

513
00:22:09,909 --> 00:22:14,528
doses of CBD increased the cell

514
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,250
proliferation and neurogenesis while

515
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:20,589
higher doses decrease this and go back

516
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:22,119
again to what people have been talking

517
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:24,638
about at this conference in terms of

518
00:22:22,119 --> 00:22:26,168
dosing that often times less is more and

519
00:22:24,638 --> 00:22:29,918
that would that would seem to be the

520
00:22:26,169 --> 00:22:33,009
case in terms of CBD and neurogenesis so

521
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:35,288
here we have a paper that came out last

522
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:38,139
year by scientists from the University

523
00:22:35,288 --> 00:22:40,408
of California Davis and you can read the

524
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:42,668
the the title of the extract

525
00:22:40,409 --> 00:22:45,129
psychedelics promote structural and

526
00:22:42,669 --> 00:22:47,889
functional neural plasticity so there we

527
00:22:45,128 --> 00:22:50,408
have it to go into this a little bit

528
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:52,658
more psychedelics not just promoting

529
00:22:50,409 --> 00:22:54,278
neuro plasticity but neurogenesis that's

530
00:22:52,659 --> 00:22:55,840
part of the way they work and that's

531
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:58,388
part of how they confer an

532
00:22:55,839 --> 00:23:02,500
antidepressant effect so classical

533
00:22:58,388 --> 00:23:04,538
psychedelics upregulate BDNF and promote

534
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:08,369
enhanced neurogenesis and synaptic

535
00:23:04,538 --> 00:23:10,538
plasticity even more so than ketamine

536
00:23:08,369 --> 00:23:12,638
psychedelics promote changes in the

537
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:14,950
neural structure and didn't dendritic

538
00:23:12,638 --> 00:23:17,740
growth across vertebrate and

539
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,149
invertebrate species and that means it's

540
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,220
through an evolutionary conserved

541
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:23,648
mechanism which something that that

542
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:26,139
we've needed you know for millions of

543
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,209
years this it's something that's very

544
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:31,778
important that's and that's why it's

545
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:33,788
been conserved the positive impact of

546
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:35,679
psychedelics in terms of substance abuse

547
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,778
and depression is contingent on

548
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:40,690
psychedelic induced neurogenesis and

549
00:23:37,778 --> 00:23:42,638
neuroplasticity but it turns out there's

550
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:45,580
several species of non psychedelic

551
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:47,469
mushrooms that also promote enhanced

552
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:50,079
neurogenesis and neuroplasticity like

553
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:53,319
turkeys tail lion's mane cordyceps you

554
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:55,119
things that we were we were learning

555
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:59,769
about through paul statements and others

556
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:02,229
and then we can access legally i want to

557
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,628
focus for a moment now on the five h-2a

558
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:08,769
this is the the serotonin 2a receptor

559
00:24:04,628 --> 00:24:11,918
because that's the receptor that in 1998

560
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:14,829
france von Feder Swiss scientist he

561
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,389
showed that LSD and psilocybin they

562
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,769
exert there and they're potent

563
00:24:16,388 --> 00:24:20,619
hallucinogenic effects

564
00:24:17,769 --> 00:24:24,929
through this receptor so that serotonin

565
00:24:20,619 --> 00:24:27,159
2a is the psychedelic receptor and it is

566
00:24:24,929 --> 00:24:29,110
responsible when it's activated for many

567
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:30,820
of the signature effects we associate it

568
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:33,250
with psychedelic drugs so what what are

569
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:37,419
these signature effects well a vivid

570
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:38,950
kaleidoscope kaleidoscopic visions focus

571
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,220
for starters but that's only the

572
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:44,830
beginning a radically altered sense of

573
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:48,220
time experiencing the experiencial

574
00:24:44,829 --> 00:24:50,049
density dazzling immediacy this is what

575
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,539
we associated with the psychedelic

576
00:24:50,049 --> 00:24:56,740
experience and this is all being a

577
00:24:52,539 --> 00:24:59,619
mediated by the 5ht into a receptor it's

578
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,450
responsible for these effects and it's

579
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:04,689
also responsible interestingly for

580
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:06,759
changes in gene expression in in the in

581
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,860
the cerebral cortex and changes in

582
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:12,220
synaptic plasticity it's been linked to

583
00:25:08,859 --> 00:25:17,259
the distant receptor immediates it the

584
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:19,420
Hired 5-ht to a binding affinity like

585
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:21,490
LSD has a very strong binding affinity

586
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:23,500
that predicts a more potent neurogenic

587
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:26,710
and neuroplastic effects the greater the

588
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:29,259
binding affinity for the Ligon 5-ht to a

589
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:31,710
receptor antagonists blocked the ability

590
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:34,509
of psychedelics to promote neurogenesis

591
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:36,880
synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity

592
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:39,609
so it's again a confirmation this is the

593
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,820
pathway that the psychedelics are

594
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:44,109
conferring this effect aberrant

595
00:25:41,819 --> 00:25:46,740
serotonin 2a signaling is linked to

596
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:49,928
headaches mood disorders hallucinations

597
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:52,650
these receptors are dysregulated in the

598
00:25:49,929 --> 00:25:56,890
prefrontal cortex of schizophrenics

599
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:59,440
interestingly CBD also binds directly to

600
00:25:56,890 --> 00:26:02,770
this receptor so LSD and CBD bind

601
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:06,250
directly to this receptor CBD is

602
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:08,740
considered a more active at the 5-htt 1a

603
00:26:06,250 --> 00:26:09,819
receptor that's typically what we've

604
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,039
been hearing about at this conference

605
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:15,669
it's a receptor that mediates the

606
00:26:12,039 --> 00:26:17,558
anti-anxiety effects of CBD perhaps the

607
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,440
antidepressant effects I'm not so sure

608
00:26:17,558 --> 00:26:24,129
but it's one of the main receptor

609
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,080
partners for CBD CBD does not bind well

610
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:29,210
with the cannabinoid receptors but it

611
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:32,059
binds very powerfully with serotonin 1a

612
00:26:29,210 --> 00:26:35,150
less so with 2a but it does bind to it

613
00:26:32,059 --> 00:26:37,429
directly and it turns out that the

614
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:40,490
serotonin 2a receptor is more prevalent

615
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:43,100
in the brain and body than 1a it's

616
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:45,920
expressed in nearly every cell type as

617
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:53,869
highest density is in the neocortex

618
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:56,360
so CBD it exhibits enough affinity at

619
00:26:53,869 --> 00:26:59,089
this receptor to talk about it in the

620
00:26:56,359 --> 00:27:01,159
context of this is a meaningful of a

621
00:26:59,089 --> 00:27:03,439
pathway for CBD and it's not something

622
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:06,230
that's generally discussed much it's the

623
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:08,960
focus usually in terms of 1a but the

624
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:11,930
question is how is it possible that you

625
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,539
have LSD which is the most psychedelic

626
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:16,430
drug you can imagine and CBD is about

627
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:18,470
the most unsightly delicate drug you

628
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:20,600
could imagine how is it that they're

629
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:23,120
both binding to the same receptor and

630
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:25,490
having such different effects and that

631
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,559
obviously CBD isn't making a person trip

632
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:29,539
out and I think this is through

633
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,759
something called functional selectivity

634
00:27:29,539 --> 00:27:35,089
and you could see I wish I had the image

635
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:38,059
of up on the screen but if you have sort

636
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:40,909
of a highway and you're hitting this

637
00:27:38,059 --> 00:27:43,579
receptor and then with LSD and CBD on

638
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:45,290
either a lane and then it separates but

639
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:47,539
then it connects later downstream

640
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:49,940
because they both of them are promoting

641
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:52,220
neurogenesis and neuroplasticity but one

642
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,799
is intensely psychedelic and what is not

643
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:56,839
so functional selectivity what does that

644
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:59,539
mean that different ligands ligands are

645
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:02,029
the the key that's fitting into the

646
00:27:59,539 --> 00:28:03,829
locks so you have a different ligand CBD

647
00:28:02,029 --> 00:28:07,309
and LSD signaling through the same

648
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:09,939
receptor in this case 5-ht to a can

649
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:13,250
produce distinct physiological responses

650
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:15,410
that culminate in similar downstream

651
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,940
effects in this case the downstream

652
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:20,840
effects again neurogenesis and

653
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:23,390
neuroplasticity so no THC does not bind

654
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:27,079
directly to any of the serotonin

655
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:30,470
receptors unlike CBD but see about THC

656
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:34,399
does engage in what scientists refer to

657
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:35,990
as crosstalk between the or does between

658
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:38,210
the endocannabinoid system and the

659
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,529
serotonin system and it does this

660
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,470
through something called receptor

661
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:42,450
dimerization

662
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,250
and what that means when two different

663
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:47,309
receptors they kind of get entangled and

664
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:49,200
they they can join and it's increasingly

665
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,179
understood that this happens a lot but

666
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,210
it's not clear why it happens or exactly

667
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:56,490
what it means but the preclinical

668
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,370
research interestingly shows that this

669
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,099
that the cb1 cannabinoid receptor and

670
00:28:59,369 --> 00:29:03,529
the 5h - a Syrah tonin receptor when

671
00:29:02,099 --> 00:29:07,349
they form what's called a heterodimer

672
00:29:03,529 --> 00:29:10,769
that this is responsible for mediating

673
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:13,559
both th C's pain-killing effects as well

674
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:16,950
as its memory impairment effects and

675
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,079
that the cb1 v h to a receptor

676
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,910
heterodimers are expressed and

677
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:24,259
functionally active in specific brain

678
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:26,340
areas involved in memory impairment

679
00:29:24,259 --> 00:29:29,250
interestingly enough there's another

680
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:34,740
heterodimer between cb1 and adenosine a

681
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:37,740
2a that when CBD activates that complex

682
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:40,259
it has a restoreth memory and other it

683
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:45,059
counteracts th C's memory and pairing

684
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:47,369
effects so what about the cannabis now

685
00:29:45,059 --> 00:29:49,649
it can you consider cannabis to be a

686
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:52,769
psychedelic I think it's really a matter

687
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:55,380
of dose because small doses moderate

688
00:29:52,769 --> 00:29:59,129
doses are relaxing for most people fund

689
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:04,290
whatever but high doses can be

690
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:06,480
psychedelic and what I wonder is is is

691
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:10,950
this heterodimer between the cb1

692
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:13,470
receptor which THC will activate because

693
00:30:10,950 --> 00:30:14,750
it's linked now to 5h 2a is that

694
00:30:13,470 --> 00:30:18,440
responsible for the hallucinogenic

695
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:21,089
effects of very high doses of THC

696
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,559
there's some interesting research of all

697
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,659
places from the University of Kansas

698
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,909
they did a series of studies where they

699
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:31,080
showed that cannabinoid receptor

700
00:30:26,910 --> 00:30:34,890
agonists up regulate and enhance 5-ht 2a

701
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:36,539
receptor activity now they weren't

702
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:38,280
working with THC they were working with

703
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:42,149
sunette a synthetic activist but the

704
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:44,519
implication is possibly that cannabis

705
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:47,670
will actually operate a high dose will

706
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,930
up regulate the serotonin 2a receptor so

707
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:50,130
you have another connection there

708
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:52,710
between them

709
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:53,570
Fitzhugh ludlow was the first American

710
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:56,480
writer to write

711
00:30:53,569 --> 00:30:58,399
out hashish well this is from before the

712
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,460
Civil War II is this wonderful phrase

713
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:04,190
about how hashish loosens the girders of

714
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,779
the soul as I think that's maybe like

715
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:08,570
the default mode Network being

716
00:31:05,779 --> 00:31:11,049
suppressed or suspended but you know

717
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:13,509
this kind of experience of the high-dose

718
00:31:11,049 --> 00:31:18,619
cannabis or cannabinoids being

719
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:22,339
hallucinogenic like mushrooms well there

720
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:24,319
was actually a study done in 1969 by dr.

721
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:26,740
Harris Isabel who happened to be a key

722
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:30,349
player in the CIA's work with LSD

723
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:33,440
comparing high doses of pure THC to LSD

724
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:36,049
and he concluded that high doses of THC

725
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,370
are hallucinogenic and I don't know that

726
00:31:36,049 --> 00:31:40,430
there's been any other formal study

727
00:31:37,369 --> 00:31:43,459
other than this one going in 1969 so

728
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:45,110
it's my speculation that this conjugate

729
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,940
between the cannabinoid receptor and the

730
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:48,879
serotonin receptor this may be

731
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,080
implicated in the neurobiological

732
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,300
underpinnings of hallucinate ELISA

733
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:58,490
Nations caused by high dose THC teasing

734
00:31:56,299 --> 00:32:01,579
this out a little bit further this is a

735
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:04,279
really fascinating study by Dave Nichols

736
00:32:01,579 --> 00:32:06,529
and his group at Purdue from 2006 and

737
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:09,200
you read the title of the abstract what

738
00:32:06,529 --> 00:32:12,379
it's saying is that when you activate

739
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:15,380
the the serotonin 2a receptor it results

740
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:17,150
in the formation and release of

741
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:18,770
endocannabinoids so again you have this

742
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:21,019
connection between the serotonin system

743
00:32:18,769 --> 00:32:27,079
and the endogenous cannabinoids system

744
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:31,369
so CBD LSD and psilocybin activating 5h

745
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:33,619
to a 5-htt to a will will induce the

746
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:36,169
creation formation the release of

747
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:39,609
endogenous cabinets and in particular to

748
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:41,690
a G's the cannabinoid that's released

749
00:32:39,609 --> 00:32:45,439
there was a follow-up study

750
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,360
three years later basically affirming

751
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,480
the same thing that the serotonin

752
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:53,889
invokes and a cannabinoid release that

753
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,890
that results in

754
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,599
activating the cannabinoid receptors

755
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,400
that function in this retrograde map and

756
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:02,769
that function in a way to sort of turn

757
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,059
down a neuro transmission or like a

758
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:08,589
dimmer switch almost of other

759
00:33:06,058 --> 00:33:11,048
neurotransmitters but what I found

760
00:33:08,589 --> 00:33:13,269
striking in this this study it's data

761
00:33:11,048 --> 00:33:17,769
that based on the extensive distribution

762
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:19,418
of 5-ht to receptors and cb1 receptors

763
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:21,690
it seems likely that this mechanism

764
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:24,400
could mediate many of the actions of

765
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,210
5-ht to receptors throughout the body

766
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:30,490
and this could be one of the it could be

767
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:34,329
a possible answer to the puzzling

768
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:36,460
phenomena of how CBD seems to have to be

769
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:38,980
able to exert effects that are very

770
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:40,840
similar to the effects of the

771
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:42,849
cannabinoid receptors being activated

772
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:44,230
it's not understood how that works

773
00:33:42,849 --> 00:33:47,469
think of CBD doesn't really directly

774
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:49,298
activate them so it might be through

775
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,130
this channel it might be through the and

776
00:33:49,298 --> 00:33:55,058
so what we see really going on here okay

777
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:57,419
we have an agonist like LSD or CBD in

778
00:33:55,058 --> 00:34:01,000
binding to the serotonin 2a receptor

779
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:04,299
this releases endocannabinoids to AG

780
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:07,058
which then bind to cannabinoid receptors

781
00:34:04,298 --> 00:34:08,800
cb1 receptor which in which promote

782
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:11,889
neurogenesis that seems to be the

783
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:16,450
four-step pathway here so this is then

784
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:18,460
the last slide interaction between five

785
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:20,949
h-2a receptors and endocannabinoid

786
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,168
system is fundamental to the neurogenic

787
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:27,969
and antidepressant effects of classical

788
00:34:23,168 --> 00:34:30,219
psychedelic drugs a 5-ht 2a induced to

789
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:31,989
AG release promotes neurogenesis

790
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:33,969
neuroplasticity and new neural

791
00:34:31,989 --> 00:34:35,918
connections and that seems to lead

792
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:39,418
people to new perspectives on life

793
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:42,190
somehow there's a phrase in neuroscience

794
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:44,888
neurons that fire together wire together

795
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:47,608
the brain kind of gets get stuck in

796
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:51,789
certain habits and it seems that these

797
00:34:47,608 --> 00:34:54,159
psychedelic drugs can can you know sort

798
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:56,918
of catapult people out of the ruts the

799
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,750
brain ruts that they're in but with a

800
00:34:56,918 --> 00:35:00,519
very long-lasting effect and that's

801
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,760
what's so puzzling why do these things

802
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:04,440
have such a long lasting effect

803
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,280
and I don't think science really has an

804
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:11,460
answer to that and I think you probably

805
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:12,900
want to look at many different fields to

806
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:14,490
perhaps get an answer because this is an

807
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,470
existential thing we're talking about a

808
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:19,379
major life change that results from

809
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:20,759
these experience and I would look at

810
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,340
certain philosophers like the

811
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:25,050
phenomenologist like Mary Lou Ponte who

812
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,990
the phenomenology of perception

813
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:30,240
published in 1945 actually didn't talks

814
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:33,029
about mescaline very early on and what

815
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:35,250
he says interestingly is that one of the

816
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:38,400
key features of mescaline is synesthesia

817
00:35:35,250 --> 00:35:40,230
you know that you're seeing sounds

818
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:42,720
hearing colors that kind of thing that's

819
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,159
another signature effect and what would

820
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:46,199
he concludes in this massive

821
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:48,599
philosophical tome and he by the way was

822
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:49,980
the chair of the Sorbonne a philosophy

823
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:52,829
the department and he was leading

824
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:54,420
philosopher in France he said that

825
00:35:52,829 --> 00:35:56,460
basically synesthesia when you really

826
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,460
analyze it is the normal way of

827
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:01,530
perceiving that that that gets sort of

828
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,039
overlaid by conditioning as we go

829
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,960

00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,740
experience so I'll leave it at that take

832
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:14,840
some questions if you'd like

833
00:36:11,739 --> 00:36:14,839
