huge amount of education over the last

18
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:39,839
two and a half years because we've all

and hear what they have to say that

25
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,959
they've learned over the last two years

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,198
their latest publications where the

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,679
cultivation site is going where the

28
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,719
medical side is going and just looking

29
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:00,799
um

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,160

00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:03,679
yeah and

32
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:05,438

rousseau he's like our medical cannabis

37
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,520
guru and he's doing a talk on the latest

38
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,118
in um

39
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,118
for cannabis and psychiatry so i'm

40
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:22,239
really excited about that yeah yeah i

41
00:01:19,118 --> 00:01:24,640
spoke with him a little earlier today

42
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:27,438
yeah i'm looking forward to that one too

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,359
it's great to have a full hour of epa i

44
00:01:27,438 --> 00:01:31,919
think it's a treat for everyone

45
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:34,560
um so you're participating in the

46
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
medical practicum you're giving keynote

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,118
presentation as we mentioned and you're

48
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,399
participating on a panel so thank you

49
00:01:39,118 --> 00:01:41,920
very much for everything that you do for

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,118
here right so tell us a bit about what

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,118
you're going to be presenting about in

52
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:46,640
your keynote though i know it's about

53
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,438
pediatrics

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,359
that's right so i'm focusing on uh two

55
00:01:49,438 --> 00:01:53,839
conditions that are

56
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:55,920
very commonly treated now with cannabis

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,680
so one epilepsy

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,879
and uh certainly we're seeing great

59
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,159
results and very i'm very excited

60
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:03,599
because there's a ton of new research

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,000
that just came out in the last couple

62
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,359
years because this is still new

63
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,959
and now we're finally getting some

64
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:10,239
long-term results so i'll be talking

65
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
about that

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,680
and then also with autism i'm going to

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,760
be talking about some research that i've

68
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,920
done where we published two papers in

69
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,799
the last six months looking at uh

70
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:23,759
biomarkers collected in the saliva

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,760
that help um document the impact that

72
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:27,359
medical cannabis is having on children

73
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:28,959
with autism yeah

74
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,879
no it's good that you mentioned that you

75
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,560
know epilepsy that's sort of i mean

76
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:34,399
that's pretty well established right in

77
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,318
terms of using cannabis for epilepsy but

78
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
autism that's one that's really starting

79
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:39,039
to gain steam so it's great that you

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
have

81
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:42,639
this data now that's that's showing the

82
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,599
biomarkers you can really quantify that

83
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:45,759
really

84
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:47,839
that's right and what we're finding is

85
00:02:45,759 --> 00:02:49,518
that the biomarker improvements

86
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,479
correlate with what the parents are

87
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,039
reporting

88
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,399
so it's no longer anecdotal report we

89
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,878
now have

90
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,640
uh objective data which

91
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,518
you know really we don't have for

92
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,119
pharmaceuticals nobody's doing that so i

93
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,120
would say that this actually puts

94
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,280
cannabis on a even playing field with

95
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,599
pharmaceuticals to treat autism

96
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,120
excellent excellent

97
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:12,878
so let me speak a bit about the panel

98
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,719
that you're going to be on as well what

99
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,399
are the goals there

100
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:18,400
so i think with the panel i'm going to

101
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,120
be sitting with other clinicians

102
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,319
and we're just going to share our

103
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,400
collective experience treating thousands

104
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:27,839
of patients with medical cannabis and

105
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,200
what's interesting is that we all come

106
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,719
from different parts of the country

107
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:33,439
we're all working in our practices and

108
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:35,519
we're all finding very similar results

109
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:37,359
for people with dementia for people with

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,799
chronic pain for people with anxiety

111
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,760
depression

112
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,680
that cannabis is this unbelievable

113
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:45,518
um and

114
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,400
useful tool

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,799
for doctors to start incorporating

116
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,280
really you can't be a doctor anymore and

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,040
ignore the endocannabinoid system you

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,479
have to understand that this plays a

119
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:00,639
major role in human health and that

120
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:02,399
by not offering cannabis as an option to

121
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:04,639
patients especially to those who are not

122
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,719
finding good results with conventional

123
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:07,438
treatments you're doing a disservice

124
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:09,120
yeah

125
00:04:07,438 --> 00:04:10,719
no and i think it's important too that

126
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,719
even if physicians aren't going to

127
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:14,000
necessarily be recommending it to at

128
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,478
least be knowledgeable enough that if

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
your patient comes to you with questions

130
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,000
you can answer them right you want to

131
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,000
have a conversation and this idea of

132
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
there's not enough research well one

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,439
could say that but i just had to race

134
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,439
through a presentation because there is

135
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:30,240
so much research that i i wanted to

136
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:32,478
share and again it's not a panacea for

137
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,360
everything this is just another tool in

138
00:04:32,478 --> 00:04:37,439
the toolbox of uh that physicians and

139
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,520
other healthcare practitioners uh should

140
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:41,120
be including in their practice yeah and

141
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,719
one encouraging sign that i noticed when

142
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,199
i was sitting in on the practice

143
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,880
earlier was when eloise was welcoming

144
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,160
everyone she had asked people to raise

145
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,159
their hand if this was their first

146
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,000
experience getting a medical cannabis

147
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
education a good amount of people raised

148
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,680
their hands

149
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:57,359
absolutely

150
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,720
when you're sitting in a room and a

151
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,240
patient asks you about something and you

152
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,320
don't know about it and then that

153
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,879
happens over and over again

154
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:07,120
as a scientist right doctors are trained

155
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:09,279
scientists we should know about this so

156
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,879
that we at least can have a conversation

157
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:11,839
with our patients that's meaningful to

158
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:14,399
them

159
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:16,159
so that we can help them and again not

160
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:18,000
everybody should be taking cannabis but

161
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,840
at the same time you want to be able to

162
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,680
be discriminating in those when you have

163
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,239
these conversations with patients who

164
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,879
might it help who might it not help

165
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,038
that's what you are are there to do with

166
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,038
your patients is to help them sort out

167
00:05:29,038 --> 00:05:32,159
all of this scientific data yeah

168
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:34,079
absolutely

169
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,520
one thing that you you mentioned too is

170
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,038
called the research

171
00:05:35,519 --> 00:05:38,000
and you know one thing that we find

172
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,240
especially you know with the

173
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,839
prohibitions on cannabis there's only so

174
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,360
much research that can be done and a lot

175
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:45,599
of it has to be done by these private

176
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
companies um much like you know

177
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,439
informatics and the study that you had

178
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,199
talked about earlier so

179
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,800
with that said how important is it for

180
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
these companies that as they're getting

181
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,360
new data to come to events like him and

182
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,879
share that because i mean obviously they

183
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,000
are privately funded companies they are

184
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:01,918
putting up their own money and they

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,399
might want to withhold that but you know

186
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:06,079
it is important to share absolutely and

187
00:06:04,399 --> 00:06:07,279
you know there's a statistic that says

188
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:09,359
that something published in the

189
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,758
scientific data takes 17 years to

190
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,199
trickle down to the clinician that's a

191
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,840
long time so conferences like this

192
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,720
are so important because

193
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:20,719
one

194
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,800
there's camaraderie and all of that but

195
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,039
at the same time we're all learning

196
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,560
about what other people are doing in

197
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:29,439
this um

198
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,639
very uh important field of cannabis

199
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:31,600
medicine

200
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,199
