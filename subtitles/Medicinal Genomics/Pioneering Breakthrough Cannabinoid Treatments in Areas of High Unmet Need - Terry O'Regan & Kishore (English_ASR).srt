1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:05,700
good afternoon

2
00:00:04,019 --> 00:00:08,160
um as you heard my name is Terry O'Regan

3
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,440
I am the president with brains

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:12,240
biosutical and

5
00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:14,399
um you know today we're just going to

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,980
continue with what Dr Kruger has just

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,339
been talking about right now is there an

8
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:24,480
echo no is there an echo

9
00:00:20,339 --> 00:00:25,320
I feel like I'm in I'm in duplicate here

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
um

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,359
let me go to the side and um we're going

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:33,359
to continue the conversation about how

13
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:36,300
to how to continue to advance the

14
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:38,460
cannabinoid scientific landscape and you

15
00:00:36,299 --> 00:00:40,619
know to help me do that

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,280
um I've got a friend and a research

17
00:00:40,619 --> 00:00:46,019
partner and Dr kashor Ali gopali who is

18
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,939
going to share with you some of the work

19
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,059
that they're doing in their in their

20
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:53,159
cancer research at shrin Therapeutics

21
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:55,619
and then also just how we can work

22
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:57,479
together to advance the scientific

23
00:00:55,619 --> 00:00:59,759
landscape so I'll be on in a little

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:02,759
while but put your hands together for Dr

25
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,759
kashokupali

26
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:11,459
so at scene Therapeutics

27
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:14,579
are established screen zero zero nine a

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:17,280
cannabidal based formulation as a part

29
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:19,259
of the therapeutic regimen for standard

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,900
care of cancer patients so it's a very

31
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,140
big goal we wanted to actually for the

32
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,118
Canada in in the front and center in the

33
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,340
mainstream therapy

34
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:33,180
so if you look at here

35
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:35,640
the U.S cancer statistics 2023 so what

36
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,979
you see here is you know males and

37
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,200
females uh you see something like a

38
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:43,140
million uh people get affected every

39
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,820
year these are new cases and uh females

40
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,579
you know again another close to another

41
00:01:44,819 --> 00:01:50,879
million and out of these two million

42
00:01:47,578 --> 00:01:53,039
one-third are basically going to die

43
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,500
so this is a really very very serious

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,860
issue and if you look at the all the 36

45
00:01:55,500 --> 00:02:00,899
major cancers uh the top five are

46
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,239
actually you know the melanoma lung

47
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,700
cancer colon cancer and of course the

48
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:07,978
gender specific cancer such as prostate

49
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:11,159
cancer in males and breast cancer in

50
00:02:07,978 --> 00:02:13,439
females and so on so we really wanted to

51
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:17,400
take these biggies and really kind of

52
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:20,219
subject to our screen based research

53
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,439
uh so if you actually look at the U.S

54
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,219
cases and compared to the rest of the

55
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:26,459
planet

56
00:02:23,219 --> 00:02:28,979
what you see is the same story

57
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,000
uh increased by an order of magnitude 10

58
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:32,699
times

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,479
but if you look at this uh uh the the

60
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:38,699
basically the landscape of uh various

61
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,639
countries you can actually see you know

62
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:44,159
the U.S and uh in Europe basically take

63
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:47,458
big part of this pie

64
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:51,359
and what people are predicting is that

65
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:54,180
uh by 2040 you see actually 28 million

66
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,879
cases as opposed to 18 million right now

67
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,219
so that means this is going to go more

68
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,979
and more so this is not just one year

69
00:02:59,219 --> 00:03:04,378
every year these millions of cases are

70
00:03:01,979 --> 00:03:07,318
repeating almost forever

71
00:03:04,378 --> 00:03:10,079
so this need to be stopped so can we do

72
00:03:07,318 --> 00:03:12,000
something with this uh cannabis based uh

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:15,180
medications

74
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,060
so what is the current therapies for uh

75
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:21,180
cancer so you have chemotherapy which is

76
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:25,439
a Cornerstone which kills good bad ugly

77
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,019
right and then you have uh radiation

78
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,120
and then you have surgery and then you

79
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,739
have immunotherapy and you have targeted

80
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,658
Inhibitors so you can if you understand

81
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:35,939
the specific pathway you can go with

82
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:39,179
these small molecules uh that can

83
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:41,878
basically break uh the pathway

84
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,920
and what is a major problem in the

85
00:03:41,878 --> 00:03:46,139
chemotherapy for example if you take

86
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:49,619
chemotherapy 75 percent of the people

87
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:51,539
with chemotherapy are going to suffer a

88
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:54,599
pain called chemotherapy induced

89
00:03:51,539 --> 00:03:57,298
peripheral neuropathy or chemotherapy

90
00:03:54,598 --> 00:03:59,579
induced neuropathic pain

91
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,260
so this actually happens in the first

92
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:03,659
one month you know you can see 75

93
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:06,899
percent of the people and regardless of

94
00:04:03,658 --> 00:04:08,639
uh the chemotherapy agents and which

95
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,280
actually goes down by three months you

96
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,559
know it can go down by uh 50 to 40

97
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,139
percent so the bottom line is that this

98
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,180
is a very important side effect one has

99
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,180
to uh deal with it

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:24,478
and so what is the problem with uh uh

101
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:27,060
can be down here is that while this has

102
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:31,079
an amazing molecule has an extraordinary

103
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:33,180
potential uh it has a few limitations as

104
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:35,758
you all know the poor water solubility

105
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:38,160
low bioavailability sub-optimal

106
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,199
bioactivity so that you can actually

107
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,240
develop a nice formulations like we have

108
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,400
developed and many people have developed

109
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,120
so I wanted to acknowledge the field in

110
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:49,439
general and there is a very different

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,240
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in

112
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:53,639
between males and females so these are

113
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,579
all important so what do we do

114
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,579
we basically made a formulation which is

115
00:04:56,579 --> 00:05:03,000
basically a nano formulation of 100 to

116
00:04:59,579 --> 00:05:04,620
200 nanometer nanosomes and you can

117
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,600
actually use this thing these are water

118
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:08,819
soluble you can adjust the dose you can

119
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,820
give oral and even these are can be

120
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:13,379
given injectables and what you see in

121
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,819
this case is that I wanted to kind of

122
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:17,699
show you the proof of principle with

123
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:19,860
this formulation we actually taken the

124
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,800
most biologically relevant melanoma

125
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,439
model which is basically brass mutation

126
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,439
so 50 percent of the melanoma has a

127
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:30,418
b-raph mutation in the 600 amino acid

128
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:34,319
position of the brav the value into

129
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:36,418
glutamic acid so single mutation and you

130
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:39,180
actually can take these Mouse melanoma

131
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:42,120
and actually implanted the synergenic

132
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,160
mice means the same genetic makeup and

133
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,620
then you can see actually how the tumor

134
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:49,560
grows and what you see in this red line

135
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:51,840
is that without any treatment you have a

136
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,060
very nice growth as you can see on the

137
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:56,060
x-axis process the y-axis the tumor

138
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:58,978
growth this is how a progression happens

139
00:05:56,060 --> 00:06:00,959
if you were to treat these animals with

140
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:03,120
CBD without any formulation that we have

141
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,099
done you can actually delay this

142
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,740
progression as you could see in the in

143
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,360
the Open Circles uh but if we make this

144
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:11,038
formulation is actually much more

145
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,860
efficiently so the idea of the

146
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:15,240
bioavailability of the potential

147
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,038
bioactivity has been significantly

148
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,220
increased while keeping the CBD

149
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:22,560
concentration uh exactly at the same

150
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:25,139
so uh one of our colleague and

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,660
collaborator uh in Philadelphia Dr Sarah

152
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:30,000
Jane what actually uh did a wonderful

153
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,280
study in the sipin models in the rat

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,560
models as well as the mouse models where

155
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:37,079
she has actually shown that you can

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,120
actually measure the Pain by measuring

157
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:40,800
the mechanical threshold of whatever the

158
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,500
one you are using to kind of cause the

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,400
pain so if you see on the on the very

160
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,918
first panel a you can give uh um the IP

161
00:06:47,399 --> 00:06:53,179
the CBD obviously these are treated with

162
00:06:49,918 --> 00:06:56,038
uh uh oxalate Platinum based

163
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,319
chemotherapy and as you could see when

164
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,439
you treat with uh more and more

165
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,840
concentrated CBD you can actually bring

166
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:06,418
this mechanical threshold back to normal

167
00:07:03,839 --> 00:07:09,478
indicating that uh you can actually

168
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:12,120
decrease the pain and you also can do

169
00:07:09,478 --> 00:07:14,159
the same thing in the oxapladin uh

170
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,259
induce the prevention so in this case

171
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,600
you know you basically treat them before

172
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,919
so you can actually prevent them and she

173
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,919
also has them with the

174
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,199
prevention uh in both models so what you

175
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:30,318
do in this case is that whether you

176
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:33,419
inject IV or oral you can actually

177
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,300
prevent a chemotherapy industry rapid

178
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:37,439
pain very nicely so having shown the

179
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:40,500
first part of this particular

180
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:42,899
formulation we actually hypothesize that

181
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:46,079
the formulated CBD is going to actually

182
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:48,538
work much more efficiently uh for the

183
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:51,418
chemotherapy induced neuropathic pain

184
00:07:48,538 --> 00:07:54,240
but now there's a problem so what

185
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:57,180
happens if you really wanted to do the

186
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,460
CBD treatment uh in the chemotherapy

187
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,199
context so is it going to be comparable

188
00:07:59,459 --> 00:08:03,299
or not that is a fundamentally very

189
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,759
important question that's precisely what

190
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
we have addressed we actually took the

191
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:11,160
melanoma the brass melanoma and what you

192
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:12,839
see in this case is that no treatment as

193
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,460
you could see the black dots you know

194
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:16,439
kind of going up with the faster

195
00:08:14,459 --> 00:08:18,439
kinetics and if you give the

196
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:20,639
decarabazine one of the choice of

197
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:23,240
chemotherapy uh you can actually

198
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:26,280
decrease them but what surprising

199
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,740
surprised us is that the two person CBD

200
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:32,299
containing so in formulation or six

201
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,560
percent worth actually out competing

202
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:36,859
significantly in statistics you can

203
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,458
actually see then the actual

204
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:41,038
chemotherapeutication this was

205
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:43,799
surprising and but when we actually put

206
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:46,439
the carnosine and the screen zero zero

207
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:48,179
nine what you see is a really kind of

208
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,279
inhibited the Tremor progression

209
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:52,859
significantly so this is extraordinary

210
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:54,600
so in basic research because I'm

211
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,700
actually a member of the chemical Cancer

212
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,580
Center one of the NCAA designated Cancer

213
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:01,560
Center at Thomas Jefferson University so

214
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,440
one of the way you can actually read out

215
00:09:01,559 --> 00:09:06,419
is that look how the growth the tumor

216
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,459
growth is happening and then you know

217
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:10,740
certain growth when it happens you have

218
00:09:08,458 --> 00:09:13,018
to euthanize the mice because there's no

219
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,879
point of return so that you can use it

220
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,399
as a survival so that is how all the

221
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:19,019
drugs are actually been approved so what

222
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,299
you basically do is that you actually

223
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:24,120
monitor the survival curve so you can

224
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:28,139
see the black line in the panel B

225
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:30,000
is that by 35 days or 33 days all the

226
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:33,139
mice basically die but when you treat

227
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,539
with just the CBD containing

228
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:39,720
uh009 uh you can actually increase the

229
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:40,980
uh the Survival by eight to seven to

230
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:44,759
eight days this is real and

231
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:47,519
extraordinarily uh uh uh improved uh

232
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:49,740
survival and then what we wanted to do

233
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:54,060
is that can we do for any other cancer

234
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:56,278
and or it is just for the melanoma so

235
00:09:54,059 --> 00:09:58,079
what we basically did is that we picked

236
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,360
it another cancer so the lung cancer

237
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:03,000
model this is what the actually the

238
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,980
model that made the approval of a lot of

239
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,240
lung cancer drugs including the

240
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,120
chemotherapy

241
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,959
and in this case the mutation is a Keras

242
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,139
mutation uh classic Keras mutation right

243
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:18,539
Downstream of the egfr receptor uh

244
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:20,220
signaling and even in this model what we

245
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:21,659
actually saw is that you can see the

246
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,480
black one you know that without any

247
00:10:21,659 --> 00:10:26,219
treatment kind of tumor goes on and when

248
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,100
you have the carbo pattern in this case

249
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:32,160
a car Platinum based chemotherapy is

250
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,600
actually the one that is a choice and

251
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:36,240
you can see the blue one is actually

252
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,459
kind of working pretty nicely but again

253
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,519
you know even in this model screen zero

254
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:45,899
zero nine actually out competed uh the

255
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:48,120
efficacy of ah the chemotherapy agent

256
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,940
but when we put both of them we got an

257
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:52,799
actually additive effect so by showing

258
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,860
these two models what I'm trying to kind

259
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,278
of convince you is that uh the

260
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:01,800
cannabidal based medication is actually

261
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:03,600
compatible with the chemotherapy and

262
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:07,679
also one more important thing you notice

263
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,259
here is that if really the seren 009 is

264
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,958
this efficacious you can probably

265
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:16,200
decrease the actually chemotherapy doses

266
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:18,778
by doing so you can actually eliminate

267
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:21,720
you know kind of eliminate a lot of

268
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:23,399
chemotherapy induced uh issues or at

269
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,720
least you can minimize you know this is

270
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:27,480
something very very important Point

271
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,100
again we did the survival curves you can

272
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,680
actually again see you know you have a

273
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,700
significantly improved uh survival even

274
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:37,859
in the uh KRS lung cancer model we went

275
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,600
on to go for a yet another aggressive

276
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:41,700
cancer model that is a colon cancer

277
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,040
model colon cancer is a very aggressive

278
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,040
model and even in this aggressive model

279
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:49,679
we have actually shown that screen has

280
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,620
uh continues to kind of decrease the

281
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,259
progression of uh the tumor and the

282
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,480
survival is also increase so this is

283
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,458
great so certainly what I'm trying to

284
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,700
kind of show you or convince you is that

285
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:04,679
a cannabidal based medication is

286
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:07,320
completely comparable uh with the

287
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:10,799
chemotherapy and then we wanted to kind

288
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,579
of look what kind of effects the uh CBD

289
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:17,159
based formulation has as you know uh the

290
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,599
CB2 receptor is on the immune system by

291
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:20,879
training for 30 years I'm an

292
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,639
immunologist so we wanted to really kind

293
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:26,100
of a look for the uh the the immune

294
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:28,139
related functions because immunotherapy

295
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:31,379
is actually becoming actually mainstream

296
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,179
for a lot of uh Cancer Treatments so

297
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:35,039
what we basically did is that we have

298
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:38,578
treated the mice with various

299
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:41,159
chemotherapy agents as well as in 009

300
00:12:38,578 --> 00:12:43,439
what you see here is that each dot

301
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:45,659
represents one animal and you can see

302
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,120
the erythrocyte count is something like

303
00:12:45,659 --> 00:12:49,919
a 10 on this particular scale and you

304
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:52,620
can see the chemotherapy agents

305
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,199
depending on what it is uh you have a

306
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,500
significantly decreased uh red cell

307
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,278
count suggesting that the erythropoysis

308
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:03,240
is significantly inhibited as you know

309
00:13:01,278 --> 00:13:06,059
chemotherapeutic agents work very

310
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,459
efficiently on on a cycling cell so as

311
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:10,919
as you know the erythropoysis is is

312
00:13:08,458 --> 00:13:14,278
being affected unlike the chemotherapy

313
00:13:10,919 --> 00:13:16,860
agents the screen 009 two different

314
00:13:14,278 --> 00:13:18,778
concentrations has no effect we also

315
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,300
measured the hematocrit which did not

316
00:13:18,778 --> 00:13:24,299
change and we also went on to look for

317
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:26,099
the the lymphocysis both B lymphop Isis

318
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,958
and stealing for poison because these

319
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,579
are the ones actually play a very

320
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:33,179
important role in tumor control and

321
00:13:29,578 --> 00:13:34,679
tumor tumor surveillance and even in

322
00:13:33,179 --> 00:13:36,659
this case what you see is that the

323
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:39,838
lymphocyte count was altered by the

324
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:42,778
chemotherapeutic agents but not by uh

325
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:45,060
caramel containing Serene zero zero nine

326
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:47,159
and now what happened what I showed you

327
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:50,039
is that the cell count significantly

328
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:52,860
went down but all these particular mice

329
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:55,559
that are treated with uh strain are

330
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:57,778
actually immunocompetent so what we

331
00:13:55,559 --> 00:14:00,299
basically did is an immune response to a

332
00:13:57,778 --> 00:14:02,759
foreign antigen and in this case you

333
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:05,159
know we have used a foreign antigen and

334
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:07,259
this antigen response is driven both by

335
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:09,419
the B cells as well as well as the T

336
00:14:07,259 --> 00:14:11,759
cells and some completely Journal Center

337
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:13,500
driven response in this particular case

338
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:14,879
you know as you expect you know Dark

339
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:17,519
Soul will be seen you know as you can

340
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:20,039
see lymphocyte comes went significantly

341
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,959
down so one quantitatively the immune

342
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,480
response should go down so that's what

343
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:27,479
probably you see here but screen has no

344
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:31,440
effect showing that it is compatible uh

345
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,659
with uh the immunotherapy uh so that is

346
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,700
the third thing I have actually shown so

347
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:38,338
here is basically pretty much my summary

348
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,139
uh is that the screen is comparable with

349
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,260
chemotherapy I showed you we wanted to

350
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:47,039
basically go after uh the radiotherapy

351
00:14:43,259 --> 00:14:49,379
and we also work on the uh chronic you

352
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:51,059
know surgical uh pain so we wanted to

353
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:53,338
kind of see whether it's also comparable

354
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:55,919
with the surgery uh but those surgeries

355
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,380
are not a painful surgeries otherwise uh

356
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:02,159
unlike other surgeries uh I assure you

357
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:03,720
that immunity therapy compatibility at

358
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,539
least you know expected immunotherapy

359
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:08,399
compatibility but it will also be

360
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:10,078
comparable with the targeted inhibitor

361
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:13,019
because I have shown you three different

362
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:15,859
models where the mutations are totally

363
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:20,220
different yet the efficacy is remarkably

364
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:22,740
uh uh fantastic so our ongoing actually

365
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:24,480
clinical studies are going with various

366
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:26,459
indications sipping is actually one of

367
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,560
the driver and we are actually ready for

368
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,599
the phase one phase two uh clinical

369
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,759
trials for this particular thing

370
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:35,220
obviously we need the Partnerships and

371
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:39,958
today I had a wonderful uh uh

372
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,959
interactions with Dr uh

373
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,698
Deborah him last and we wanted to really

374
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:47,278
work she's also a Philadelphia person

375
00:15:44,698 --> 00:15:49,859
like me and we are going to collaborate

376
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:52,259
and uh one more important thing I wanted

377
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:55,800
to do is that I wanted to acknowledge uh

378
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:58,980
uh gopali he is the one actually founded

379
00:15:55,799 --> 00:16:02,099
this company 2018 and recruited me a

380
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,860
week after and uh the second is me and

381
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:08,820
we have a CMO Dr Vijay sandilya he is

382
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,278
the CMO and he's our uh in-house uh

383
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:14,459
hematologist and oncologist and our

384
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:16,019
collaborator Dr uh Sarah Jane Wad and

385
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:18,000
another colleague of mine at Jefferson

386
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:20,639
you know Brooke Worcester some of you

387
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,198
probably know and she is actually the

388
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,759
director of the Cannabis medicine at

389
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:25,620
Jefferson and she's really kind of

390
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,899
pushing this cannabis medicine amazingly

391
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,600
and she's also the new director for the

392
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:32,399
supporting medicine and cancer server at

393
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:35,159
Thomas Jefferson University Hospitals

394
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:39,419
and last but not least I wanted to kind

395
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:40,458
of thank uh uh uh Terry origin and

396
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:42,899
brings

397
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:45,958
because they are the ones going to

398
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:48,299
provide us the API grade uh can be done

399
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:51,299
for the clinical studies we are going to

400
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:53,159
go forward and with this I wanted to

401
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:55,078
kind of ask you if you wanted to

402
00:16:53,159 --> 00:16:57,000
collaborate with us you're more than

403
00:16:55,078 --> 00:16:59,338
welcome and we are also interested in

404
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,139
any Venture partners that wanted to join

405
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:03,139
us thanks very much

406
00:17:04,318 --> 00:17:07,980
all right everybody and so I'm just

407
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:11,099
going to conclude this um very quickly

408
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,078
and um I just want to talk about how we

409
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,779
can collaborate together to advance the

410
00:17:13,078 --> 00:17:18,119
cannabinoid scientific landscape and why

411
00:17:15,779 --> 00:17:19,678
that is so important to me is because I

412
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:22,379
come from the pharmaceutical background

413
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,620
I have been in Pharmaceuticals for all

414
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:27,919
of my career and and I've joined brains

415
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:30,119
18 months ago because so many

416
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:32,400
oncologists and neurologists and

417
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:34,798
psychiatrists said Terry we know it

418
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,840
works but we just need somebody to do

419
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:38,819
the clinical studies to tell us how it

420
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,099
works where it works and how to use it

421
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:43,139
and that's what we're trying to do here

422
00:17:41,099 --> 00:17:46,319
at brains biosuticals

423
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:48,179
so um you know just

424
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:50,460
I'll go straight on this is the

425
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:52,919
challenge I am so grateful for everybody

426
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:55,620
that is providing medical cannabis at

427
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:57,600
the moment but I come from London and

428
00:17:55,619 --> 00:18:00,719
it's the second biggest medical cannabis

429
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,939
Market in in Europe and when I look at

430
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,460
the statistics only one percent of

431
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,340
patients are getting access to medical

432
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:10,919
cannabis from those that need it all

433
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:12,959
right so it isn't the solution it is a

434
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,140
solution it is making progress but it's

435
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,460
not the solution and that is where we

436
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:19,200
gotta you know I come from a

437
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,000
pharmaceutical background and where

438
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,100
we're saying okay let's play by the

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,960
rules that farmer understand the FDA

440
00:18:23,099 --> 00:18:27,719
understand and let's try and Advance

441
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,460
this in a different aspect to some of

442
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,079
what someone to what some of you are

443
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,720
doing but together we'll get there

444
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:37,079
ultimately it is about giving patients

445
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,419
access to these treatments so what we do

446
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:44,159
is is with our collaboration Partners

447
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:47,460
latran also with DSM and fuminous is we

448
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,038
we look at at all the aspects of a good

449
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,259
clinical program and you know it

450
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:54,179
sometimes breaks my heart to see these

451
00:18:52,259 --> 00:18:55,919
failed studies because people did some

452
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,200
guesswork or they didn't do enough due

453
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,840
diligence and so what we're looking at

454
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:02,100
is how we can provide this end-to-end

455
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,720
service

456
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,579
um you know in terms of the input

457
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,980
material stock right right from the

458
00:19:05,579 --> 00:19:10,079
start and then going into making sure

459
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:11,759
that it is a commercially viable asset

460
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:16,798
that you can progress and get funding

461
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:19,558
for and our partners DMS DSM have have

462
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:21,599
our world leaders when it comes to

463
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:23,700
formulation so how can you formulate it

464
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,740
in a way that is conducive to the study

465
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,900
that you're doing as well as potentially

466
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:29,640
strengthening your patent and then how

467
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,740
can you reduce the cost of clinical

468
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,799
programs looking at decentralized ways

469
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:37,319
of doing clinical programs and you know

470
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,298
we in the business of isolate because

471
00:19:37,319 --> 00:19:41,099
that's what the FDA understands you know

472
00:19:39,298 --> 00:19:44,579
they want to know exactly what is being

473
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:47,219
combined with what and so Rio making it

474
00:19:44,579 --> 00:19:48,538
a very doing an API starting with our

475
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:50,519
CBD

476
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,319
um but soon to have other cannabinoids

477
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:55,379
where we're looking

478
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:57,659
right how we can potentially provide the

479
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:00,000
best API available so that we do not

480
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,640
compromise the the clinical studies that

481
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,099
you guys are involved in as you can see

482
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:08,460
we can have we can guarantee consistency

483
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:10,918
as well as being rchq 7 compliant as

484
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,779
well as German deck pharmacopoeia

485
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:16,259
compliance so when you want to get into

486
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:17,940
Europe we meet those standards and then

487
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:20,339
just coming into a close you know we've

488
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,759
got a reference DMF so for people doing

489
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:25,980
clinical studies we've also got an asmf

490
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:27,599
um in in Europe and we're looking at

491
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,440
bringing other cannabinoids to the

492
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,339
market

493
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,600
my final Slide m is is from DSM they as

494
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,279
I said they are world leaders in

495
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,079
formulation and I know that that is

496
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,879
quite a big challenge but they're

497
00:20:37,079 --> 00:20:40,918
looking at ways in which we can improve

498
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,740
the bioavailability improve the

499
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,160
stability improve the loading and they

500
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:49,440
are pioneering in this area and Alex my

501
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:51,840
colleague has a poster right side if you

502
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,759
want to know more about that but finally

503
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,918
you know I think you know I heard

504
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:58,200
Brendan's story last night

505
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,940
um about his father and I heard Bruce's

506
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:02,640
story today about his wife who had

507
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:04,620
ovarian cancer and as I go through I

508
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,140
hear all the stories as to why we got

509
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,298
into this and all I can say is it's an

510
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,580
honor for me to step into the sector to

511
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:13,379
work with you and we're all doing our

512
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:16,199
part some of it is different but we're

513
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,720
all doing our part because ultimately

514
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,279
um leaders lead people in a better place

515
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,038
than when they found them and I know

516
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,298
together you are leaving patience in a

517
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,569
better place than when we found them

518
00:21:24,298 --> 00:21:29,559
thank you for your time

519
00:21:26,569 --> 00:21:29,559
[Applause]
