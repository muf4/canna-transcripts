1
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:09,039
well welcome to my coming out party

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,480
after six 26 months uh doing zoom

3
00:00:09,039 --> 00:00:12,079
meetings

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,240
um

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,719
this is welcome to cannabis and

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,839
psychiatry the final frontier

7
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:19,839
q sound effects

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,760
psychiatry

9
00:00:23,518 --> 00:00:27,919
the final frontier

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,039
these are the voyages of the starship

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,840
cannabis

12
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,640
its eternal botanical mission to explore

13
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:37,280
strange new worlds dimensions and

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,878
recesses of consciousness to seek out

15
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:42,000
better life and new models of

16
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:44,718
civilization to go boldly where no

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,200
tardigrade fungal mycelium

18
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,079
sentient being nor split infinitive has

19
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,079
gone before

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,799
a couple of disclaimers

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,840
[Applause]

22
00:00:54,799 --> 00:01:00,078
nothing i'm discussing is fda approved

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,559
your results may vary

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,359
i have as a [ __ ] of industry i have

25
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,959
many commercial relationships

26
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:09,920
but what i'm going to tell you is true

27
00:01:06,959 --> 00:01:12,000
to the best of my ability

28
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,280
i'll read this one there's a world of

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,438
difference between

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,920
recreational studies of cannabis wherein

31
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:19,519
the intention is to attain intoxication

32
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,879
release or an altered state of

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,798
consciousness

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:25,679
as compared to its therapeutic

35
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,759
application wherein the intent is to

36
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,799
attain symptom relief at much lower

37
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:34,159
dosages without adverse events including

38
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,159
psychiatric symptoms

39
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,879
to briefly introduce the canal

40
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,280
endocannabinoid system

41
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,599
uh it all began with a plant we call

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,478
cannabis it produces the glandular

43
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,719
trichomes and of course thc

44
00:01:46,478 --> 00:01:50,879
uh it works analogously to the

45
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,719
endogenous cannabinoids particularly

46
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,599
anandamide both

47
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,679
as

48
00:01:53,599 --> 00:01:56,959
weak partial agonists at the cb1

49
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,640
receptor

50
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:00,000
but there are many other components of

51
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,718
the system

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,920
that we'll discuss in another talk

53
00:02:02,718 --> 00:02:08,719
the cb1 receptor where anandamide and

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,360
thc work is densely packed in the

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:14,080
central nervous system particularly in

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,599
limbic areas that subserve emotional

57
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,959
function

58
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:22,878
it also is very important in regulating

59
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,878
the release of glutamate and

60
00:02:22,878 --> 00:02:30,159
gaba in particular so is neuromodulatory

61
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:30,159
especially on mood

62
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,319
what we know about cannabis extends back

63
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:38,318
at least 4 000 years in written

64
00:02:36,318 --> 00:02:40,639
documentation

65
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:44,958
on the right you see a tablet

66
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:46,958
from the sumerians in what is now iraq

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,840
and there were various descriptions of

68
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,640
what we believed to be cannabis

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,878
including this key line

70
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:57,919
for and against panic

71
00:02:54,878 --> 00:03:01,199
which is a 4 000 year old representation

72
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:05,359
of the biphasic dose response curve

73
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:09,280
of thc a little is anxiolytic

74
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,440
too much is anxiogenic

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,840
just a couple of historical references

76
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:18,560
to continue this is uh from the oral

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:21,280
tradition in china 2700 bce

78
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,439
fan taking much of it one may

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:26,878
make one the whole ghost which is the

80
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:30,000
chinese term for hallucinations

81
00:03:26,878 --> 00:03:32,479
and frenetically run about

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,239
protracted taking may make one fat

83
00:03:32,479 --> 00:03:37,039
strong and never senile a

84
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:41,759
neuroprotective effect

85
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:45,120
uh from the atarva veda in india uh five

86
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:47,598
kingdoms of herbs headed by soma

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:51,360
and including banga

88
00:03:47,598 --> 00:03:53,839
that may release us from anxiety

89
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,959
from the persian in the 18th century

90
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,280
maksan allahuia it is said that bang is

91
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,598
one of the best of god's gifts it

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,280
quickens the fancy deepens thought and

93
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:06,479
sharpens judgment

94
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,360
this is far from reefer madness

95
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:12,000
now numerous times you'll see slides

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,080
from this key paper

97
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,319
from 2017.

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,400
yes there's been additional information

99
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:20,560
since then but this is the best review

100
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:23,359
on the subject of mental medical

101
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,519
cannabis and mental health by zach walsh

102
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,199
at all

103
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:28,399
we're going to start off with

104
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,759
neurocognition

105
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:34,478
does cannabis produce impairment and

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,759
you'll see that he separates these into

107
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:41,039
therapeutic use and non-medical use

108
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,800
but as we'll demonstrate the results are

109
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
much milder

110
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,960
and surprising in terms of impairment

111
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,439
that

112
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:52,719
cannabis produces and whether that

113
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,959
remains with the individual or not

114
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,960
i'd like to review some studies that are

115
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,879
very little known these were actually

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,959
sponsored by the national institute in

117
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:03,038
drug abuse in the 70s

118
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:05,519
and after they did several of these and

119
00:05:03,038 --> 00:05:07,839
the results weren't what they wanted

120
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:09,680
they stopped funding them and these

121
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,638
books actually disappeared from

122
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:16,319
libraries it took me years to obtain

123
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:19,759
them on the antiquarian book market

124
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:24,000
this one jamaica ganja and jamaica

125
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:26,800
they looked looked at 60 men

126
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,439
and had them in the hospital to do all

127
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,400
kinds of tests they were using three

128
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,399
spliffs a day

129
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,000
we'd consider this low potency but i

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,840
don't know where they were getting their

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,399
spliffs there was better material

132
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:43,758
available in jamaica as i can attest to

133
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,560
personally at the time

134
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,479
but

135
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,680
the key thing for today is that there

136
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:49,399
were no

137
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,439
significant differences in

138
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,918
neuropsychological tests

139
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,639
the users of cannabis actually had

140
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:58,399
increased wechsler

141
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,478
adult

142
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,318
intelligence scales

143
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:03,758
on the digit span

144
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,400
something you think would be hard to

145
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:09,680
remember if you're high there was a

146
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,799
study from greece with hashish

147
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,360
again

148
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
moderately low potency but these are

149
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,240
people that used a lot

150
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:19,439
there weren't a lot of

151
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:21,600
electroencephalographic changes

152
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:22,800
on the neuropsyc testing

153
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,680
users

154
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,120
were better than controls on

155
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,079
the waist

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,079
similarities digits symbol substitution

157
00:06:30,079 --> 00:06:34,000
and verbal iq

158
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:36,159
these observations do not provide

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,199
evidence of deterioration of mental

160
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,000
abilities in the hashish users

161
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,919
another one from costa rica again

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,038
relatively mild quality cannabis

163
00:06:45,918 --> 00:06:52,000
but high volume of usage ultimately

164
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:53,399
enough thc was getting in

165
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
there were no

166
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:59,198
immunologic or endocrine changes on

167
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
neuropsych again quote we failed to

168
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,680
uncover significant differences between

169
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,000
user and non-user groups even in those

170
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,400
subjects who had consumed cannabis for

171
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,800
over 18 years

172
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:14,478
on this study from jamaica melanie

173
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,160
dreyer who became the dean of

174
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:21,360
nursing school subsequent to this

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,680
working meninganja

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,038
in the study she showed that the work

177
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,918
capacity for working in the fields in a

178
00:07:27,038 --> 00:07:31,120
hot

179
00:07:27,918 --> 00:07:32,719
humid environment was enhanced

180
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
by cannabis

181
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,440
and very interestingly among rustifarian

182
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,038
women who used high volumes of cannabis

183
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,439
ganja

184
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:46,318
but did not use alcohol

185
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,319
their children actually were advanced in

186
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,840
their

187
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:51,680
neurodevelopment as compared to control

188
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:54,318
children

189
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,918
a study that our group did in missoula

190
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,039
montana back in 2001

191
00:07:57,918 --> 00:08:00,878
we took

192
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:02,399
four patients

193
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,560
from the compassionate youth

194
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,439
investigational new drug program that

195
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,399
got legal cannabis from the government

196
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:12,639
again relatively low potency by modern

197
00:08:10,399 --> 00:08:14,719
standards but they were using upwards of

198
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,240
nine grams a day

199
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,360
and these are the profiles of the

200
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,519
patients

201
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,560
these are all the tests we subject them

202
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:25,359
them to excuse the 20 year old

203
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,560
technology but you see all the neuro

204
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,840
psychological tests that we did

205
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,679
quite

206
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:33,679
an intensive investigation

207
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,719
in those findings

208
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,519
all four patients had mild difficulty

209
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,159
with attention and concentration however

210
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,919
they were medicating the whole time that

211
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,919
we were doing this so this is not

212
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:49,759
surprising

213
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:52,838
there was at least minimal impairment

214
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:55,759
and acquisition of complex new verbal

215
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:58,160
material but the

216
00:08:55,759 --> 00:09:00,559
important things higher level

217
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,799
executive functions were totally within

218
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:05,439
normal limits and two of the four

219
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:07,039
and none were depressed i'll demonstrate

220
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:10,200
that later

221
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:12,000
on it was the judgment of the

222
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,320
neuropsychologists that there were no

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,080
attributable sequelae to their cannabis

224
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,200
usage

225
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:22,160
to follow up in 2018

226
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,480
and these are the ages patient a b and d

227
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:27,039
had lost access to knight of cannabis

228
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,639
but patient a continued daily use from

229
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:32,319
other sources

230
00:09:28,639 --> 00:09:32,319
possibly of higher potency

231
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,039
patients b and d were reported

232
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,920
cognitively intact

233
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:41,759
by the nurse on the study was mary lynn

234
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:45,360
mathery

235
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:47,278
and i interviewed patients a and c

236
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,480
and as a neurologist i can say that they

237
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,639
were quite sharp mentally patient c

238
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,080
is an active vice president of an

239
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
investment firm

240
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,399
so

241
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,720
people rely on him to manage their money

242
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,879
now some studies

243
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,839
poke at all and this is an older study

244
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,679
but

245
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,399
it's very well done

246
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:12,639
they looked at current and past heavy

247
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,720
users of cannabis with light past users

248
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:16,480
and got

249
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,278
neuropsychological tests there were some

250
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,159
cognitive deficits in the current heavy

251
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:26,000
users that persisted for a week

252
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:27,519
but were totally gone by 30 days quote

253
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,639
our findings do not support the

254
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,440
hypothesis that long-term heavy cannabis

255
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:36,720
use causes irreversible

256
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,040
changes excuse me

psychiatry at uc san diego

259
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,480
did this

260
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,440
meta-analysis

261
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,480
on

262
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,880
intensively looked at published studies

263
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,200
and crunched the numbers on them

264
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:57,278
quote the results of our meta-analytics

265
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,160
study failed to reveal a substantial

266
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:02,078
systematic effect of long-term regular

267
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:04,399
cannabis consumption on the

268
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:08,319
neurocognitive function of users who are

269
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:10,799
not acutely intoxicated and then a key

270
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,519
finding differentiating this quote

271
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,559
recreational usage from therapeutic

272
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,560
usage

273
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:18,399
quote these findings are not likely to

274
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,039
generalize to more limited

275
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,039
administration of cannabis compounds as

276
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:26,319
would be seen in a medical setting in

277
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:28,240
other words medical patients used less

278
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,879
and would be less likely to have

279
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,879
impairment

280
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,679
a more recent study with very big

281
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,360
numbers over 2000 cannabis users a young

282
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:48,439
age 20 compared to almost 7 000 controls

283
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:51,240
looking again at

284
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,480
meta-analysis of of studies of

285
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:56,959
neuropsychological function

286
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,879
in studies examining abstinence of

287
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:01,439
greater than three days there were no

288
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:05,439
significant difference from abstainers

289
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,920
uh the overall effect size was very low

290
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:12,000
in terms of any reduction of cognitive

291
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:14,719
function in frequent or heavy users

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,720
ultimately any changes between the

293
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,759
groups were below one-third of a

294
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,240
standard deviation meaning

295
00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:25,278
from a statistical standpoint there

296
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,759
there's no difference quote previous

297
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:30,159
studies of cannabis and youth may have

298
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:32,399
overstated the magnitude and persistence

299
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,039
of cognitive deficits associated with

300
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:37,200
use reported deficits may reflect

301
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,480
residual effects from acute use or

302
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
withdrawal

303
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,240
and quote these results do not support a

304
00:12:41,039 --> 00:12:46,319
heightened risk for for poor cognitive

305
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,240
outcomes and cannabis using adolescents

306
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,600
compare with adults

307
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,959
does that mean it's fine for teenagers

308
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,680
to do multiple bong hits after school

309
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,559
instead of doing sports is studying no

310
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:02,000
nobody was saying that however in terms

311
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:05,199
of damage

312
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,839
there's no evidence for the same

313
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,639
my colleague kirsten mueller fall in

314
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,800
germany has studied tourette syndrome

315
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:15,278
extensively

316
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:17,359
um they were using a pure thc

317
00:13:15,278 --> 00:13:19,679
preparation if there were going to be a

318
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,360
problem you'd expect it to be related to

319
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,078
that however

320
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,278
they saw no detrimental effects on

321
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:27,278
neuropsych function

322
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,839
our friend donald abrams

323
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,799
did a study of pain and

324
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,440
hiv this required smoking of knight of

325
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:42,319
cannabis all the patients had prior

326
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:45,279
experience with cannabis and it was

327
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,000
helpful in decreasing acute pain

328
00:13:45,278 --> 00:13:50,159
the problem was smoking isn't the best

329
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,679
way to treat most medical conditions

330
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:54,240
because of the rapid increase in

331
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:55,759
pharmacogenetics

332
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:59,519
pharmacokinetics

333
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:04,639
and as you see here there was 25 anxiety

334
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:07,198
54 percent uh sedation disorientation 16

335
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:11,839
percent this is not the kind of profile

336
00:14:07,198 --> 00:14:14,319
that the fda is likely ever to approve

337
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,880
um turning to some studies of

338
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:20,399
nabiximoles or sativex which is an ear

339
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:23,120
mucosal spray with equal amounts of thc

340
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:25,519
cbd scattered cannabinoids and

341
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,759
terpenoids this is a study of

342
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:30,078
neuropathic pain and multiple sclerosis

343
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:32,559
66 patients

344
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:36,159
there were no significant difference in

345
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:40,000
hamilton anxiety depression scores and

346
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:42,319
in neurologic disability scales

347
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,078
there was improvement in selective

348
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,920
reminding portion of the brief

349
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:49,439
repeatable misspelled battery of

350
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:52,719
neuropsychological traits

351
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,720
so that was encouraging

352
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:56,559
in this comparison

353
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,559
we looked at

354
00:14:56,559 --> 00:15:03,119
long-term use of nabixamol sativex as

355
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:06,479
compared to smoke cannabis in the dutch

356
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,399
and canadian programs over the long term

357
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:11,600
the hot

358
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:16,000
colors are the smoked cannabis and the

359
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,399
cool colors are nepiximals

360
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,120
as you see the side effects including

361
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:23,679
psychiatric associations were much

362
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,839
higher in smoke cannabis

363
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:27,838
and these were both medical populations

364
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,278
again looking at namixamols the

365
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:36,320
difference between early studies with

366
00:15:33,278 --> 00:15:38,799
fast titration and higher allowance they

367
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,800
found that more than 12 sprays which

368
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:43,919
would be about 32.4 milligrams of thc a

369
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:46,159
day

370
00:15:43,919 --> 00:15:49,120
above that you had more side effects

371
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,120
than benefits

372
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:53,919
when

373
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,000
a slower titration with limits were

374
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:59,198
placed on the studies you see that

375
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,320
dizziness fatigue somnolence etc were

376
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,319
cut markedly

377
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,759
um a very comprehensive study was done

378
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,360
post-marketing of nepiximals by recant

379
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,519
at all

380
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,000
and this was done in europe

381
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:18,000
they looked at 150 patients in clinical

382
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,198
trials and 900 post marketing

383
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,440
the doses that were used

384
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:25,439
in practice were actually lower than in

385
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,240
the clinical trials

386
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,600
there was one case of suicidal ideation

387
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,240
but that person was on placebo

388
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,159
long-term treatment with thc cbd spray

389
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,879
was not associated with cognitive

390
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:40,799
decline depression or significant mood

391
00:16:38,879 --> 00:16:43,039
changes

392
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:45,198
looking at driving another area of

393
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:47,759
contention

394
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:49,838
there was only one small decrease in

395
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:52,159
visual pursuit not statistically

396
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,480
significant you see that all the other

397
00:16:52,159 --> 00:16:57,600
parameters of driving were improved and

398
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,920
determination was statistically

399
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,839
significantly improved

400
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:06,000
these patients were better drivers

401
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,318
uh during their treatment after their

402
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,160
treatment of multiple sclerosis with the

403
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:13,038
big smalls

404
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,839
again neuropsychological testing this is

405
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:18,480
the passat the paste

406
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:20,958
auditory serial addition test

407
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:24,959
glad to get that out

408
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:27,120
no significant difference uh placebo or

409
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:28,880
after treatment

410
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:32,798
but these patients with multiple

411
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,520
sclerosis spasticity were clearly better

412
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:40,319
the general impression of change by

413
00:17:35,519 --> 00:17:40,319
patients physicians and their caregivers

414
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,440
side effects

415
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:47,919
in terms one person in 40 had

416
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,679
significant psychiatric

417
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,640
side effects

418
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:56,480
and xero in this cohort had

419
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,440
any suicidal ideation

420
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,360
a

421
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,440
study in children

422
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:05,279
from israel this was actually done with

423
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:07,840
delta athc but this was pure it would be

424
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:10,639
unlike preparations currently in vogue

425
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:12,480
in this country

426
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,840
they treated eight children with

427
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,160
hematologic malignancies there were 400

428
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,038
in total 80 dope

429
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:23,200
dose applications with

430
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,440
almost total

431
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,840
abrogation of the nausea and vomiting

432
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,840
associated with the

433
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:32,159
chemotherapy their doses were actually

434
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:34,240
very high compared to what happens in

435
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,720
adults and this points out that children

436
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,599
under 10 are highly resistant to

437
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,839
psychoactive side effects of thc

438
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:43,839
maybe kids are naturally high

439
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:49,759
um we've got a bunch of studies

440
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:53,280
observational work from israel

441
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:56,160
and this was cannabis and autism 180

442
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:58,639
patients mostly taking an oil cbd

443
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:02,320
predominant but with you know a decent

444
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:04,000
dose of thc three times a day

445
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:05,839
after six months

446
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,759
the vast majority were continuing

447
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:11,038
treatment their

448
00:19:07,759 --> 00:19:13,839
moods were improved in almost two-thirds

449
00:19:11,038 --> 00:19:16,720
improved activities of daily living good

450
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:18,720
sleep and concentration

451
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:21,279
eighty percent were significantly

452
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,279
improved

453
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:26,798
this is an old study

454
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:27,678
of sativax

455
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:30,079
and

456
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,320
you'll see that in almost every instance

457
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:34,079
in a variety of different conditions

458
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:37,119
there was improvement in sleep

459
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:39,279
parameters and almost every study of

460
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:42,319
cannabis use therapeutically will have

461
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,319
similar findings

462
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,120
now let's look at posttraumatic stress

463
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:56,319
previous research has been done in

464
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:58,879
either animals or humans um working

465
00:19:56,319 --> 00:20:00,558
animals showed extinction of aversive

466
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,840
memories which are a hallmark of the

467
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,038
disorder

468
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:08,079
also stress-induced analgesia was

469
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:09,599
demonstrated reduction in pain

470
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,639
and blew it

471
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:15,119
posited the idea of a central anatomic

472
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,679
deficiency predicting predicting

473
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:20,639
stress-induced anxiety

474
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,120
so let's dig into specific studies

475
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,680
this is walsh's review of the data

476
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,319
available then

477
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:29,279
[Music]

478
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:32,000
a substantial portion of people

479
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:34,480
with ptsd use cannabis with good

480
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
outcomes particularly improving sleep

481
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,759
and reducing nightmares one of the

482
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,319
effects of thc is reducing somewhat

483
00:20:39,759 --> 00:20:45,519
rapid eye movement sleep of dreaming and

484
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:46,879
night marriage so this is quite sensible

485
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,158
matt hillen

486
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:53,200
looked at world trade center

487
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,280
survivors uh compared the people who

488
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,720
developed post-traumatic stress to those

489
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:59,918
who didn't

490
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:04,480
and also normal controls

491
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:06,320
and they looked at anandamide levels

492
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,159
there was a negative relationship

493
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:10,480
between the inanimate levels and

494
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:12,559
intrusive symptoms

495
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,558
they felt that the results showed a good

496
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:16,960
correlation of lower

497
00:21:14,558 --> 00:21:18,000
anamide levels to

498
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,960
increase

499
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,359
cb1 receptor binding sites in the the

500
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
central nervous system in other words

501
00:21:23,359 --> 00:21:28,639
providing evidence for

502
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:31,439
clinical endocannabinoid deficiency in

503
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,840
ptsd

504
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,480
this was an imaging study

505
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:39,519
done with positron emission tomography

506
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,558
again in post-traumatic stress

507
00:21:39,519 --> 00:21:42,720
versus

508
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:45,359
trauma patients that

509
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,960
didn't have ptsd

510
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:48,959
again healthy controls

511
00:21:49,038 --> 00:21:53,599
this is complicated but the cb1

512
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,519
selective radial ligand showed a higher

513
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,879
volume of distribution with lower

514
00:21:55,519 --> 00:22:01,119
nandomite tone and ptsd that was highly

515
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:05,039
statistically significant over healthy

516
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:08,399
controls and the trauma exposed controls

517
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,879
that didn't have ptsd

518
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,440
and they went on to suggest that agents

519
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,400
increasing anandamide availability were

520
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,679
possible therapeutics that would include

521
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,080
things like

522
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:23,038
cannabidiol and

523
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,038
cannabidiol

524
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:31,759
what walsh had all said about depression

525
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:34,399
and there were improvements noted um

526
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:36,158
there have been allegations of an

527
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
association of cannabis use with

528
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,440
depression but no evidence specifically

529
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,200
of causation and this is always an

530
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,519
important distinction

531
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,919
so let's look back at the chronic youth

532
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:48,879
study

533
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,640
again

534
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:51,919
for patients

535
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,600
middle to

536
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:56,159
age to older

537
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,079
who are using many grams of nida supply

538
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,440
cannabis a day

539
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:03,519
they had very bad diseases that would

540
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,600
make anyone depressed

541
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,038
two of the four patients had been

542
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:12,240
addicted to opioids one intravenous

543
00:23:09,038 --> 00:23:14,158
opioids in the past none were taking

544
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,079
anything of the kind

545
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,640
so if we look at the depres

546
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:21,279
back depression inventory 2 mild

547
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,720
depression is is 18.

548
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:28,079
moderate 27 severe 34.

549
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,720
we had patient a with a score of six not

550
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:31,599
depressed and the other three scores of

551
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,279
zero

552
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:35,279
hardly at all depressed

553
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,359
um

554
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:42,960
this is a study i wish i'd done i had

555
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:46,519
this idea 20 years ago but no way to

556
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:48,840
look at it i was struck by the fact that

557
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:50,639
electroconvulsive treatment

558
00:23:48,839 --> 00:23:52,480
uh

559
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,038
shock therapy

560
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,159
is still effective in intractable

561
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,759
depression where drugs haven't worked

562
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,720
so what does it do

563
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,960
well people's mood improves

564
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,200
number one number two

565
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,038
when there's too much treatment they

566
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,080
have short-term memory impairment

567
00:24:09,038 --> 00:24:14,158
usually temporary what does that sound

568
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,759
like it sounds like

569
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,880
cannabis

570
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,599
um

571
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:21,440
so you know i thought if we could test

572
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:24,158
these people there's

573
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,080
a cerebrospinal fluid with spinal taps

574
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
lumbar punctures we could demonstrate

575
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,879
that but we'd never get it through

576
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,798
an institutional review board ethics

577
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,120
committee well they were able to do it

578
00:24:32,798 --> 00:24:37,679
in germany

579
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:40,158
so they looked at 12 depressed depressed

580
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,519
patients who had cerebral spinal fluid

581
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,400
exam before and after electroconvulsive

582
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:50,639
therapy

583
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,360
the ect increased anamide levels

584
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:56,400
significantly and nearly significantly

585
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:57,918
on the two-eric adonal glycerol

586
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
and

587
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,159
the number of treatments correlated with

588
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,440
these kinds of differences their

589
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:06,000
conclusion was that

590
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:08,400
electroconvulsive

591
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,359
therapy modulates the endocannabinoid

592
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,120
system to alleviate depression

593
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:15,839
well the whales are calling me but

594
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:15,839
they'll have to wait

595
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,038
looking at the issue of psychosis

596
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:27,278
everyone knows that too much cannabis

597
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:29,839
can make people crazy temporarily

598
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:31,440
but it's been much more controversial as

599
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,558
to whether you

600
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,440
generate de novo cases of schizophrenia

601
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:38,798
related to cannabis usage best evidence

602
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,320
is if there's an underlying

603
00:25:38,798 --> 00:25:43,759
susceptibility

604
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,798
it will unmask it earlier

605
00:25:43,759 --> 00:25:50,158
in this study done in the united kingdom

606
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:52,879
they looked at 600 000 patient visits

607
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,320
that represent 2.3 percent of the entire

608
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,400
population of the country

609
00:25:56,319 --> 00:26:00,720
what they noted was the incidence and

610
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,759
prevalence of schizophrenia was stable

611
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:07,759
or actually declined somewhat in the

612
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,919
10-year interval 96-2005

613
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,480
and this is keeping in mind that there

614
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,159
was an 18-fold increase in cannabis

615
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,640
usage

616
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,679
between 1972 and 2002.

617
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,400
so

618
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,759
schizophrenia incidents down cannabis

619
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,320
use up

620
00:26:23,759 --> 00:26:28,558
doesn't seem to indicate a problem

621
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:30,879
quote the most parsimonious explanation

622
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:33,359
of the results reported here are that

623
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,000
the schizophrenia psychosis data

624
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,439
presented here are valid and the causal

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,400
models linking cannabis with

626
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,278
schizophrenia

627
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:43,519
psychosis are not supported by this

628
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:45,599
study

629
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:46,639
another analysis

630
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:47,678
from

631
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,600
england

632
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,759
they looked at male heavy users of

633
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:54,678
cannabis and and looked at the number

634
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:56,480
needed to prevent a case of

635
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,600
schizophrenia

636
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:01,759
uh

637
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:05,278
and this ranged from 2800 to 4700 people

638
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:07,200
depending on their age and females

639
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,278
with somewhere between five and ten

640
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,319
thousand people you'd have to stop from

641
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:14,558
using cannabis at all to prevent a case

642
00:27:12,319 --> 00:27:17,519
of schizophrenia that's hardly

643
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:20,158
convincing as an association

644
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,038
how about therapeutic use well there

645
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,039
have been two randomized controlled

646
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,319
trials of

647
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:30,158
pure cannabidiol in schizophrenia both

648
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:32,319
phase two

649
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,200
using very high doses

650
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:37,678
on this one by levica at all in germany

651
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:40,558
800 milligrams of cannabidiol a day

652
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,640
compared to the atypical antipsychotic

653
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:45,839
amy sulpride

654
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:48,320
in 42 patients over four weeks

655
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:49,759
there were improvements in positive and

656
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:51,439
negative

657
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,720
syndrome scores

658
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,880
in each

659
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:57,600
but the negative symptoms were notably

660
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,840
better on cannabidiol and there were

661
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:04,558
many fewer side effects on prolactin

662
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:07,119
elevation the atypical antipsychotics

663
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,158
are tough drugs that produce weight gain

664
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,359
sometimes diabetes patients don't like

665
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:14,000
them

666
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,879
and we have a real possible alternative

667
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,519
here

668
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,720
the dosing probably could be a great

669
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:22,558
deal lower with a more complete whole

670
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:26,000
cannabis extract

671
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:27,678
another study from england

672
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,319
this time

673
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,919
a thousand milligrams of pure cbd

674
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:35,678
divided twice a day over six weeks

675
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:37,120
and they were compared to control

676
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,120
patients who were on standard

677
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,439
antipsychotics

678
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,879
positive psychotic symptoms decreased on

679
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:46,640
cbd

680
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:49,440
clinicians ratings favored cbd over

681
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,799
conventional agents and motor speed also

682
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
improved on

683
00:28:50,798 --> 00:28:53,440
cbd

684
00:28:54,159 --> 00:29:01,679
how about acute craziness what's called

685
00:28:57,038 --> 00:29:05,038
the toxic psychosis from excesses of thc

686
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,399
in this i compared

687
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:11,679
marinol which is pure synthetic thc

688
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:13,918
which has been known to cause

689
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:16,320
toxic psychosis

690
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:19,360
paranoia delusions

691
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:23,200
in patients with as little as 10 or 15

692
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:26,479
milligrams of pure thc

693
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:29,360
in the study by sellers we had to give

694
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,558
18 sprays all at once

695
00:29:29,359 --> 00:29:33,519
to show that there were no heart rhythm

696
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:36,639
abnormalities

697
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:40,319
and there were four episodes of toxic

698
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:44,480
psychosis out of 260 exposures so that

699
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:46,798
would be 48 milligrams of thc

700
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,480
sometimes in p people would never use

701
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:51,359
cannabis at all

702
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:54,079
but everyone was fine the next day

703
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:57,678
that's the difference that cannabidiol

704
00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:57,678
and terpenoids make

705
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:02,000
walsh on anxiety

706
00:30:00,398 --> 00:30:05,119
eight cross-sectional studies and

707
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,200
medical use to non-medical use

708
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,158
in the non-medical use there was a small

709
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:13,440
positive association between cannabis

710
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:16,159
use and anxiety but again no evidence of

711
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,960
causation

712
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:20,840
um

713
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,720
a lot of work on cannabidiol was done in

714
00:30:20,839 --> 00:30:25,519
brazil

715
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:27,278
this was another study with pure cbd and

716
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:29,490
they were looking at social people with

717
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:30,558
social anxiety

718
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:33,200
[Music]

719
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:36,158
something a lot of people have a small

720
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:38,080
study normal controls and 24 with social

721
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,200
anxiety

722
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,879
some got

723
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,679
cbd and some

724
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,919
didn't but they use 600 milligrams of

725
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,480
cbd that'd be an awful expensive

726
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,679
proposition to use regularly

727
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,319
cbd pre-treatment before trying to make

728
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,880
them anxious

729
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,200
significantly reduced anxiety cognitive

730
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,039
impairment and discomfort in their

731
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,038

performance

733
00:31:03,038 --> 00:31:08,240
i'm speaking today without benefit of

734
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:11,278
cbd or anything else i've just gotten

735
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,159
used to this over time

736
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:16,079
study of feingold

737
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:19,278
looking at cannabis use

738
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:22,038
in people with anxiety disorders they

739
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:26,000
started with a large sample 3

740
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:27,440
723 americans a small percentage had a

741
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,558
diagnosis

742
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,880
of uh anxiety disorder and were using

743
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:34,798
cannabis regularly but there was no

744
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,600
significant difference

745
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:40,319
in anxiety remission rates compared to

746
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:43,839
other users and non-users

747
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:47,038
no significant difference on suicidality

748
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:49,359
on quality of life emotional and mental

749
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:51,759
health sub skills and functioning scales

750
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:54,000
were significantly higher

751
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:56,960
in the cannabis users than people who

752
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,919
did not use it

753
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,278
in this study in canada

754
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,159
again

755
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:08,558
big numbers 888 people with anxiety

756
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:10,640
looking at their use rates of other

757
00:32:08,558 --> 00:32:12,558
drugs

758
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,440
61 percent

759
00:32:12,558 --> 00:32:17,918
had completely replaced a drug that was

760
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,399
prescribed for their condition

761
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:24,240
obviously the most frequently replaced

762
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:27,639
were antidepressants and benzodiazepines

763
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,640
as you see

764
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:36,000
what about abuse

765
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,480
um this was from the clinical trials of

766
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:40,319
uh nepixemol satellites that were done

767
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,399
in this country

768
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:44,158
and this was the only episode

769
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:46,319
in uh

770
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:48,320
some hundreds and hundreds of patient

771
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:51,038
exposures uh

772
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:53,359
attempted abuse in the big smalls

773
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:54,558
uh but the perpetrator didn't get inside

774
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,959
the bottle

775
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:59,440
and there he is

776
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:02,000
a little white dog

777
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:05,120
so there was no abuse or diversion in

778
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,880
the entire program of of three

779
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:08,879
phase three clinical trials

780
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:14,398
um historically

781
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,640
uh interesting relations between

782
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,839
cannabis and addiction

783
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:23,120
j.b madison uh who worked in

784
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:26,158
st louis on the 19th century

785
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:28,558
he used cannabis to treat cocaine

786
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,880
chloral hydrate and opiate addiction

787
00:33:28,558 --> 00:33:35,038
quote in these often it has proved an

788
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:38,880
efficient substitute for the poppy

789
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:40,398
uh crothers wrote the key textbook on

790
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,360
addiction

791
00:33:40,398 --> 00:33:46,000
from the early 20th century

792
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,319
the only mention of cannabis was not as

793
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,640
a drug of abuse but rather as a

794
00:33:48,319 --> 00:33:52,720
treatment for other addictions quote

795
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:54,159
cannabis indica can often be used with

796
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,640
very good effect

797
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:58,880
in treating morphinism

798
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,919
especially the temporary removal of the

799
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,919
worse symptoms

800
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:07,199
can someone use cannabis medicinally if

801
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:10,078
they've had a prior problem with

802
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,079
cannabis or opioids

803
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:14,879
well yes they can be used quite

804
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,960
successfully together even people have

805
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,559
had medical dependency on one or the

806
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,119
other

807
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:23,039
but after a point at which the patient

808
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,480
has improvement in their symptoms most

809
00:34:23,039 --> 00:34:27,918
notably pain

810
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:30,240
it's reasonable to taper the opioids but

811
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:34,078
many patients do this on their own and

812
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:37,118
clinicians here will attest to this

813
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:40,159
if someone has a clear cannabis use

814
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:41,679
disorder or it displays tolerance to

815
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,240
high doses

816
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,519
dustin sulak has a resensitization

817
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,678
procedure

818
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:50,239
which you can find online basically as

819
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,398
them stop for just 48 hours

820
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:58,239
and resume at half the prior dose and

821
00:34:54,398 --> 00:35:00,838
usually with equal protection against

822
00:34:58,239 --> 00:35:04,399
the problem for which they've been

823
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:06,400
treating these are again from nepyximal

824
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,559
studies

825
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:10,559
addiction usually comes from some kind

826
00:35:08,559 --> 00:35:12,719
of intoxication well if you're not

827
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:15,119
intoxicated you're highly unlikely to

828
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:18,959
become dependent on the bottom you'll

829
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:22,800
see intoxication scores of nebyximals in

830
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,760
clinical trials compared to placebo

831
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,720
20

832
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,000
on this scale visual analog scale

833
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:31,919
is you feel something 80 is what a

834
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,480
person usually wants

835
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,159
if they're using cannabis recreationally

836
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,960
and you'll see that we're looking at

837
00:35:36,159 --> 00:35:42,239
single digits no significant difference

838
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,800
between placebo and nubiximals

839
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:46,319
addiction usually implies dose

840
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,839
escalation

841
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:52,720
on top we see number of sprays a day of

842
00:35:49,838 --> 00:35:55,119
nabiximals over a year and a half

843
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,679
and what you see is the slope actually

844
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:59,760
goes down a little over time people find

845
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,799
that they do with less and don't

846
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,440
increase

847
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,839
their use rates

848
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,760
another study from israel

849
00:36:05,838 --> 00:36:09,759
looking at pain and quality life

850
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:17,039
166 israeli patients with pain that

851
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,320
qualified for treatment with cannabis

852
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:23,519
average of just a gram and a half a day

853
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:26,400
of mainly by smoking

854
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:29,039
pain symptom scores improved along with

855
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,400
family social disability emotional

856
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:33,599
disability

857
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:38,079
outcome satisfaction and sleep problems

858
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:40,000
of the 73 patients were on opioids 44

859
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:43,039
discontinued them that was highly

860
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,280
statistically significant and the median

861
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:48,800
oral morphine dose equivalence decreased

862
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,400
from 60 to 45 milligrams a day obviously

863
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,400
less likelihood

864
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:55,920
of problems related to that

865
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,200
banky at all

866
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,079
looked at opioid usage in again in

867
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:05,679
patients with chronic pain

868
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,720
118 patients there was a 64 reduction in

869
00:37:05,679 --> 00:37:11,118
opioids and a 45 increase in quality of

870
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:15,358
life measures some of that could be

871
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:17,760
related to um fewer side effects related

872
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:20,400
to the opioids but we'll take it any way

873
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,800
we can get it

874
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,639
the brilliant stacey gruber who we'll be

875
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,200
hearing from tomorrow

876
00:37:24,639 --> 00:37:31,199
did this study she always has funny

877
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:31,199
titles the grass might be greener

878
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,838
they looked at

879
00:37:33,838 --> 00:37:37,920
patients who were using cannabis

880
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:40,078
medicinally for a variety of problems

881
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,159
over three months

882
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,599
there were marked improvements on

883
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:48,319
depression on the back scale impulsivity

884
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:50,720
sleep quality of life

885
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,559
and energy fuse fewer physical

886
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:55,118
limitations

887
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,159
for patients who are in opioids the

888
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,880
intake was reduced almost by half again

889
00:37:58,159 --> 00:38:03,879
almost by half on benzodiazepines

890
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,079
a quarter on antidepressants and mood

891
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,280
stimulizers after three months of

892
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,400
treatment

893
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:12,880
and again some improvement

894
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:17,358
in cognitive function could be

895
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:21,119
because of reductions of other drugs

896
00:38:17,358 --> 00:38:23,119
another observational study from israel

897
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,920
these are patients with cancer and

898
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:29,519
associated pain

899
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,639
of the 344 patients that were on opioids

900
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:35,679
beginning the study 36

901
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:38,239
discontinued them and only nine

902
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:41,118
nine point nine percent i'm sorry nine

903
00:38:38,239 --> 00:38:44,000
point nine percent decrease their dosage

904
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:47,280
only one point one percent increased it

905
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,358
and fifty one percent remain stable

906
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,280
meanwhile anxiety and depression

907
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:55,358
declined 84.2 percent

908
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,760
another study from israel this time in

909
00:38:55,358 --> 00:39:00,799
fibromyalgia

910
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:05,680
26 patients getting a mean dose of 26

911
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:05,680
grams a day so less than a gram a day

912
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:12,639
26 grams a month less than a gram a day

913
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,720
46 percent found their work capacity

914
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:17,440
increased and there was substantial

915
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:20,078
opioid sparing and decreased use of

916
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:23,358
adjunctive drugs you see under strong

917
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,160
opiates a p-value of zero

918
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:28,639
meaning no chance this was a chance

919
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:32,000
finding

920
00:39:28,639 --> 00:39:32,879
this was an animal study

921
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,119
from

922
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:38,720
xi'adol

923
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,838
looking at cb2 receptor modulation of

924
00:39:38,719 --> 00:39:44,399
cocaine activity in

925
00:39:40,838 --> 00:39:47,838
mice cb2 is expressed in the ventral

926
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:50,639
tegmental area and nucleus accumben

927
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:52,159
dopaminergic neurons that pertain to

928
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,559
addiction

929
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,118
so when cb2 is activated by the

930
00:39:54,559 --> 00:39:59,358
synthetic agent

931
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,920
it either

932
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:04,318
dosed systemically

933
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
in the nose or micro injection into the

934
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:10,719
nucleus accumbens and inhibited dopamine

935
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,640
release and cocaine self-administration

936
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:16,078
a natural agent in cannabis

937
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:18,639
caryophyllene is a

938
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,160
an agonist of the cb2 receptor and we

939
00:40:18,639 --> 00:40:22,159
believe would do the same thing

940
00:40:22,318 --> 00:40:27,199
this is from a prior paper just some

941
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,838
suggestions on what could be used from

942
00:40:27,199 --> 00:40:31,519
cannabis to treat different conditions

943
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:34,799
for depression

944
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:38,239
small amounts of thc cbd cbg and

945
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:40,960
limonene for anxiety cbd with limonene

946
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:44,000
and linalool i would add something we're

947
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,000
going to see in a moment

948
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:49,838
for agitation alzheimer's disease

949
00:40:46,719 --> 00:40:51,838
various things help thc cbd limonene

950
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:54,960
pinene

951
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:57,519
for sleep many different agents and for

952
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:00,400
addiction particularly cbd

953
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:03,679
and caryophylline

954
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,480
to finish up with

955
00:41:03,679 --> 00:41:07,440
some

956
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,838
new data give you something new this

957
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,159
study was published last year this was

958
00:41:09,838 --> 00:41:13,358
done with my colleagues

959
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:15,920
at the

960
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:17,759
washington state university in uc san

961
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,119
diego

962
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,560
it was the first study the

963
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,920
systematically examine cannabidiol

964
00:41:22,559 --> 00:41:27,519
in humans

965
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,960
127 patients

966
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:33,199
they were required to report only on

967
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,400
material that was at least 50 percent

968
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,919
cbg

969
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:37,680
so some had

970
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,119
pure cbg

971
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:43,919
uh with

972
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,960
uh terpenoids some were mixed with thc

973
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:48,159
um

974
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,318
you see this long list of conditions

975
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:52,879
that people used to

976
00:41:50,318 --> 00:41:54,400
treat it with cannabidiol

977
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:56,559
51

978
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,400
said that their use was medical

979
00:41:56,559 --> 00:42:00,880
only 6.3

980
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,400
claimed it to be recreational and for

981
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:06,400
36.2 percent both

982
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:10,240
the most common conditions treated were

983
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,760
anxiety pain depression and insomnia

984
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:14,838
um

985
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,920
but a whole bunch of other things were

986
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:20,078
tried what happened well the majority of

987
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:21,358
conditions were much or very much

988
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,599
improved

989
00:42:21,358 --> 00:42:26,318
the highest efficacy on a percentage

990
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,480
basis were for endometriosis

991
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:31,199
inflammatory bowel disease and irritable

992
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,240
bowel but those were low numbers among

993
00:42:31,199 --> 00:42:38,719
the high numbers the

994
00:42:34,239 --> 00:42:41,279
insomnia you see a p-value of .001

995
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,959
one chance in a thousand that this was a

996
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,480
spurious result

997
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,599
for depression and anxiety again

998
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,079
p-values of .001

999
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,280
in every instance

1000
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,119
patients felt that cbg was superior to

1001
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,599
conventional medicine that they'd used

1002
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,559
to treat their conditions

1003
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,800
and a lot got off of those other

1004
00:43:02,559 --> 00:43:06,960
medicines

1005
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,119
i'll close by saying

1006
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,039
this bugger you see depicted here is

1007
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,720
still around

1008
00:43:11,039 --> 00:43:17,199
um if you don't believe in vaccines

1009
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:20,399
please be advised that i'm a jewish

1010
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:22,078
space laser operator

1011
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,519
thank you for your attention i hope

1012
00:43:22,079 --> 00:43:26,519
we've left a little time for questions

1013
00:43:29,809 --> 00:43:36,239
[Applause]

1014
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:38,719
from the floor

1015
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:42,000
i think that they've got microphones set

1016
00:43:38,719 --> 00:43:46,159
up if you'd like to step up

1017
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,159
oh bad sign shy audience

1018
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,279
chella

1019
00:43:53,358 --> 00:43:57,199
hi thank you

1020
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,079
and thank you for all of this

1021
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:02,239
uh could you please let these folks know

1022
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,880
a little more specifically about how

1023
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:05,759
cannabis helps dementia

1024
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,559
sure

1025
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,760
um

1026
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:12,799
i wrote a paper basically on

1027
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:15,760
cannabis and neurology and its promise

1028
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,200
um i it really didn't fit into this talk

1029
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,319
well

1030
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:24,318
but there have been extensive studies

1031
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:26,318
that support the idea that both thc

1032
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:27,920
and cbd might actually be

1033
00:44:26,318 --> 00:44:30,559
neuroprotective

1034
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,079
in alzheimer's disease by preventing the

1035
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,078
buildup of toxic

1036
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:39,119
proteins in the brain that are part one

1037
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,240
of the hallmarks of the

1038
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,559
pathology of alzheimer's disease

1039
00:44:42,239 --> 00:44:46,358
we also know that both of them help a

1040
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:47,920
great deal

1041
00:44:46,358 --> 00:44:51,199
symptomatically

1042
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:53,039
uh in treating dementia

1043
00:44:51,199 --> 00:44:54,719
our friend

1044
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:55,759
jeff hergen rather

1045
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:58,159
treats

1046
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,079
a bunch of patients in a nursing home in

1047
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:02,799
sonoma county

1048
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:04,880
the nurses love it the families of the

1049
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,640
patients love it because the patients

1050
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,960
are more attractable

1051
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:11,920
they require less nursing care they

1052
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:14,318
sleep some of them sing some of them are

1053
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:16,639
showing a resumption of skills they'd

1054
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:19,440
already lost

1055
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,078
so there is practical information to

1056
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,519
support the use of specific

1057
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,599
cannabis based

1058
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:27,358
treatments in dementia for both

1059
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:29,519
symptomatic

1060
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:32,239
benefits and also as possible

1061
00:45:29,519 --> 00:45:34,800
neuroprotective agents so thanks for the

1062
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,358
question thank you so much

1063
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,519
i can't see because there's light in my

1064
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:42,000
eyes but please go ahead

1065
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:45,358
hi um in your presentation you

1066
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,159
referenced some studies there was a nida

1067
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:51,279
issued cannabis for these studies and i

1068
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:52,559
wondered um the amount of thc that was

1069
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,960
actually

1070
00:45:52,559 --> 00:45:55,920
administered or was a part of that study

1071
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,639
so

1072
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,960
can you estimate what is the

1073
00:45:58,639 --> 00:46:03,598
amount of thc in the national institute

1074
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,760
of drug abuse issued cannabis

1075
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:08,559
yeah it's a good question it's a complex

1076
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,200
one so you know the stuff was under four

1077
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,519
percent that they utilized but high

1078
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:15,679
volumes nine grams a day you can start

1079
00:46:13,519 --> 00:46:17,599
calculating even with a reduced

1080
00:46:15,679 --> 00:46:20,879
bioavailability

1081
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
uh in joints some

1082
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,358
you know

1083
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:28,880
at a minimum it had to be in the

1084
00:46:25,358 --> 00:46:31,519
30 to 50 milligrams of thc a day

1085
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,720
i'd say minimum

1086
00:46:31,519 --> 00:46:34,480
but

1087
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:37,039
the patients had almost complete

1088
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,519
tolerance to intoxication you know we

1089
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,599
could demonstrate minor differences when

1090
00:46:39,519 --> 00:46:43,440
they were actually smoking on the nerve

1091
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:44,400
psych test

1092
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,079
but

1093
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,358
they all functioned

1094
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,560
really well

1095
00:46:47,358 --> 00:46:53,039
and far better than they had

1096
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,719
before such treatment

1097
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:57,358
you know we're talking about miserable

1098
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,159
diseases to get into this program you

1099
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:03,279
had to exhaust every medical possibility

1100
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:05,920
and prove that to a skeptical government

1101
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:08,319
so it was a high bar indeed very helpful

1102
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,318
thank you

1103
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,200
thank you ethan wonderful presentation

1104
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,079
i'm over here

1105
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:17,519
ah i recognize the voice

1106
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,559
the um

1107
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:22,960
the need for safe and effective

1108
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:25,599
psychiatric treatments is probably more

1109
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,000
now than ever and the field of

1110
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:31,200
psychiatry from my experience is the

1111
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:34,239
most reluctant to even consider cannabis

1112
00:47:31,199 --> 00:47:36,239
as a useful option meanwhile physicians

1113
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:38,399
have the highest rate of suicide among

1114
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:40,479
any profession so we're

1115
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,800
we're also miserable in this field not

1116
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:44,400
us specifically but our colleagues are

1117
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,800
how do you see

1118
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,119
this information and this treatment

1119
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,240
making its way to the patients that need

1120
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:54,640
it how do you see at a macro level the

1121
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:57,279
the healing of this uh health care

1122
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:59,199
approach to mental health

1123
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:01,680
yeah it's really tough i mean i've been

1124
00:47:59,199 --> 00:48:04,078
doing this for 26 years and i have to

1125
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,118
say that the roadblocks to research

1126
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:07,039
remain

1127
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:09,680
largely the same as they were in the

1128
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:12,318
late 90s when i began this

1129
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,879
which is a very sad state of affairs

1130
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,358
we shouldn't be ceding the ability to

1131
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:18,800
investigate cannabis medicinally to

1132
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:22,558
other countries

1133
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:24,960
even now sue sicily did a recent study

1134
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:27,280
of post-traumatic stress she had to use

1135
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:30,480
knight of cannabis the study was not

1136
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,519
successful everybody knows that cannabis

1137
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:36,240
can be used successfully to treat ptsd

1138
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:41,519
so it's a severe mismatch here and it

1139
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:43,679
remains the case if i have a preparation

1140
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:45,679
that i think is going to be good

1141
00:48:43,679 --> 00:48:48,558
for treating a specific condition and i

1142
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:50,558
want to get fda approval

1143
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:52,400
can't be made in this country right this

1144
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:54,720
moment

1145
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,119
this explains why for a majority of the

1146
00:48:54,719 --> 00:48:58,799
last 26 years i've worked for foreign

1147
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,039
companies

1148
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:04,079
it's not the way it should be

1149
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:06,159
i think we have to be doggedly

1150
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,800
persistent

1151
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:11,199
i think i have been but you know i'm 70

1152
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:12,559
years old now and i'm get tired from

1153
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,439
time to time

1154
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,640
so

1155
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:15,760
we need

1156
00:49:14,639 --> 00:49:18,639
young

1157
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:23,040
physicians who are dedicated like

1158
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:25,039
dr sulak goldstein and many others

1159
00:49:23,039 --> 00:49:26,719
to carry on

1160
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:29,358
but

1161
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:32,078
it just takes

1162
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,199
dogged determination

1163
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:35,599
that's it

1164
00:49:33,199 --> 00:49:38,159
uh hopefully some legislative change but

1165
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:40,010
i wouldn't be hanging my hat on that not

1166
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:42,480
the way things are going

[Music]

1168
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,280
dr russo um

1169
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:49,680
can you cite some studies of the effect

1170
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:53,119
of cannabis on

1171
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:54,000
bipolar disorder types one and two

1172
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:55,358
um

1173
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,599
yeah that's

1174
00:49:55,358 --> 00:50:00,960
a tougher one um

1175
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:03,119
is hard to treat with anything

1176
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:06,480
you know we hear reports of benefit and

1177
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:07,920
specific patients everything is

1178
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,800
dependent

1179
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,079
on the preparation

1180
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,160
i would really have to think about um

1181
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:18,400
i think it needs to be individualized

1182
00:50:16,159 --> 00:50:20,639
with bipolarity there are

1183
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:23,519
just vast differences

1184
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:26,480
in the cycles that people have some are

1185
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:30,960
rapid cyclers some have predominantly

1186
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,800
depression some are predominantly manic

1187
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:36,000
for better or worse a lot of people with

1188
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,200
bipolar disorder don't want to medicate

1189
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,880
because they

1190
00:50:37,199 --> 00:50:43,199
like how they feel when they're manic

1191
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,200
so it's a very tough problem it doesn't

1192
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:48,558
mean it shouldn't be investigated it's

1193
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:50,159
just right now we have only anecdotal

1194
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:51,630
evidence

1195

00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,200
no worries um

1200
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,480
just the question kind of for the room

1201
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:05,118
um

1202
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:09,838
as far as the problem of studying whole

1203
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:09,838
plant or full spectrum products

1204
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,199
what do you think about

1205
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,639
so you can do a clinical trial of

1206
00:51:13,199 --> 00:51:16,799
marinol

1207
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,799
clearly it's done regularly

1208
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:19,839
you can also

1209
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:22,400
use

1210
00:51:19,838 --> 00:51:24,799
full spectrum hemp extract so the below

1211
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:28,240
the 0.3 thc

1212
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:30,318
and that's acceptable

1213
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:32,399
can you dial in the dose of thc that you

1214
00:51:30,318 --> 00:51:34,800
want mix that together with

1215
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:37,280
a full spectrum hemp extract as an

1216
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,200
excipient combine that product pretty

1217
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:41,359
much approximate a full spectrum

1218
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:42,399
cannabis product and do a study with

1219
00:51:41,358 --> 00:51:43,679
that

1220
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,838
and i would tell you that i've talked to

1221
00:51:43,679 --> 00:51:46,719
the dea and the fda on this and they

1222
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:48,719
have

1223
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,000
gone ahead and said yeah you can

1224
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:51,679
do that legally they don't have a

1225
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:53,920
problem with that what do you think

1226
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:56,558
about that as a potential way through

1227
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:58,639
the regulatory nuisance of

1228
00:51:56,559 --> 00:52:00,240
the federal government well

1229
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,920
what i'd say initially is you shouldn't

1230
00:52:00,239 --> 00:52:03,519
be having to jump through all these

1231
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,119
hoops

1232
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:06,079
but beyond that

1233
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,720
um

1234
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:11,200
i'm a firm believer in full spectrum

1235
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,759
products i'm also

1236
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:16,399
believe and you can mix and match

1237
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:19,280
for example it's not commonly known that

1238
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,079
nabiximals is a combination of

1239
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:25,040
high thc chemovar and a high cbd

1240
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:27,839
chemovar that's allowed as long as it

1241
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:30,480
comes from one species i.e cannabis

1242
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:30,480
sativa

1243
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:36,240
i have to make a bold statement which is

1244
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:38,559
i think that very few studies

1245
00:52:36,239 --> 00:52:41,118
of cannabis used therapeutically have

1246
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,000
used optimized preparations

1247
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,318
um

1248
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:47,039
i have strong opinions about what you

1249
00:52:44,318 --> 00:52:49,679
need for a given condition and

1250
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:52,800
the profiles of the materials used are

1251
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,519
rarely jibed with what i think is is

1252
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:56,400
going to be best

1253
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:58,079
but

1254
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,318
again

1255
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,640
i think the best approach is look at the

1256
00:53:00,318 --> 00:53:04,960
disorder what is needed

1257
00:53:02,639 --> 00:53:07,039
what is the combination of cannabinoids

1258
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:09,920
keeping in mind that

1259
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:12,079
if you need thc like with ptsd you've

1260
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,960
got to have thc for it to be effective

1261
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,760
you need to suppress dream and nightmare

1262
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,480
activity uh to some degree but tiny

1263
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:24,640
doses are necessary and maybe with

1264
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:27,280
higher doses of cbd uh canabaderol and

1265
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:29,199
with a good terpenoid profile

1266
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,160
you know that's an ignored

1267
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:34,960
aspect of this we have studies underway

1268
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:38,399
that we hope will definitively show

1269
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:41,199
the contributions and synergy between

1270
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:44,240
the terpenoids and thc

1271
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:46,558
so i i'd like to see a lot more thought

1272
00:53:44,239 --> 00:53:49,118
go into the preparations and not just

1273
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:52,800
some generic cannabis that

1274
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:52,800
comes from a barrel at nida

1275
00:53:54,318 --> 00:53:58,719
hi dr russo thank you for your speech

1276
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:01,280
today and all of your hard work um i'm

1277
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:04,078
very fascinated by this tolerance uh in

1278
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,519
adolescence under 10. i was wondering if

1279
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:10,000
you could elucidate upon any studies on

1280
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:12,639
longitudinal studies on psychiatric

1281
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:15,280
effects of use of cannabis from the age

1282
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:15,279
of 10.

1283
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:20,960
i'm not aware of any evidence of

1284
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:24,240
particularly in therapeutic use of any

1285
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:27,119
kind of neuropsychological sequelae

1286
00:54:24,239 --> 00:54:30,719
and again the evidence from if we look

1287
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:33,358
at the recreational data that we saw

1288
00:54:30,719 --> 00:54:36,399
with much higher doses and it would

1289
00:54:33,358 --> 00:54:38,000
include people that started at age 10 or

1290
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:41,920
12.

1291
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,159
there was no evidence of significant

1292
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:45,680
adverse effects

1293
00:54:44,159 --> 00:54:48,719
that were attributable to it that

1294
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:52,399
doesn't mean everyone should do it

1295
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:55,919
it means that cannabis is a

1296
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:58,240
reasonable and can be a safe alternative

1297
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,519
for treating serious medical conditions

1298
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:03,598
of children again under 10 it's not just

1299
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:05,119
that one study that showed the

1300
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,200
phenomenon that

1301
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,480
children are highly resistant to

1302
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:11,679
problems

1303
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,559
at a young age that was noted

1304
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:16,719
back

1305
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:18,160
in 1840 by o'shaughnessy in india

1306
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,318
they had a child

1307
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:23,519
infant in fact with convulsions that

1308
00:55:20,318 --> 00:55:25,759
took a dose that would have laid out uh

1309
00:55:23,519 --> 00:55:29,679
an adult um

1310
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,319
so it it can happen you know this idea

1311
00:55:29,679 --> 00:55:34,399
that we've got to protect the children

1312
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:37,838
usually you're treating diseases that

1313
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:40,639
are far worse and more dangerous um to

1314
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:44,558
their lives than cannabis would be in

1315
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:44,558
any preparation thank you

1316
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:49,358
so picking off of it sorry about that so

1317
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:50,318
piggybacking off of what alex said where

1318
00:55:49,358 --> 00:55:52,558
does

1319
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,239
uh where's cannabis role in treating

1320
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,680
this sort of pediatric mental health

1321
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:57,519
crisis that we're going through i'm

1322
00:55:55,679 --> 00:55:58,960
working a pediatric emergency department

1323
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:01,759
i can tell you that we're dealing with

1324
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,119
more and more issues and i know cannabis

1325
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,799
has a role i was curious to get your

1326
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,599
take on it

1327
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:10,159
i'm sorry um the monitors are in front

1328
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,000
of me and it's a little boomy uh if you

1329
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:15,519
could repeat

1330
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,880
sure sorry about that so essentially uh

1331
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:18,318
we have a mental health crisis

1332
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,160
particularly amongst pediatric

1333
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:22,639
population and i wanted to know your

1334
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,798
take on where exactly cannabis plays a

1335
00:56:22,639 --> 00:56:27,759
role and if it is

1336
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:30,639
cbd dominant type 2 type 3 et cetera

1337
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:34,160
ah sure you know at this point um

1338
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:37,759
cannabidiol as a pure preparation

1339
00:56:34,159 --> 00:56:40,159
epidialex 97 cbd is

1340
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,079
fda approved for gervais

1341
00:56:40,159 --> 00:56:43,598
and lennox gastow syndromes and

1342
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:44,880
treatment of seizures and tuberous

1343
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,240
sclerosis

1344
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:51,519
nobody objected much to that

1345
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:53,919
however pamplona indicated through his

1346
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:56,798
meta-analysis that similar results could

1347
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,039
be obtained with doses that were of cbd

1348
00:56:56,798 --> 00:57:01,519
that were about 80 percent lower

1349
00:56:59,039 --> 00:57:03,440
when it was a full spectrum

1350
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,798
uh preparation

1351
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:05,679
um

1352
00:57:04,798 --> 00:57:09,280
uh

1353
00:57:05,679 --> 00:57:12,719
you know using uh 1500 milligrams of cbd

1354
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,040
a day is prohibitively expensive

1355
00:57:12,719 --> 00:57:15,039
you know

1356
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:20,798
i think that we have to be more

1357
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:21,679
reasonable about the cost-benefit ratio

1358
00:57:20,798 --> 00:57:23,599
and

1359
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:25,679
whether it is

1360
00:57:23,599 --> 00:57:27,440
intractable seizures

1361
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:30,960
autism

1362
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:34,159
any serious disorder of childhood

1363
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:35,519
that cannabis might help i think is a

1364
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:38,318
proper

1365
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:40,559
area to investigate it's my feeling

1366
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,000
specifically related to mental health i

1367
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,920
was curious

1368
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,440
okay well you know if we have a

1369
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,720
self-destructive

1370
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,519
destructive autistic child um you know

1371
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,439
that

1372
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:54,079
is on the verge of being uh

1373
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,920
institutionalized

1374
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:57,280
yeah they should be treated with

1375
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,079
something that's going to work

1376
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:01,359
conventional medicine is notoriously

1377
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:05,119
poor

1378
00:58:01,358 --> 00:58:05,119
at helping those children

1379
00:58:05,838 --> 00:58:10,880
dr goldstein in particular can attest to

1380
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:12,318
the benefit she's seen in that kind of

1381
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,559
context

1382
00:58:12,318 --> 00:58:14,558
thank you

1383
00:58:14,798 --> 00:58:18,159
thank you dr russo judge thompson i'm a

1384
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:20,960
newbie to the conference and appreciate

1385
00:58:18,159 --> 00:58:22,960
the evolutionary aspect of the clinical

1386
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,039
studies that you presented

1387
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:26,880
i guess my questions from the health

1388
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:28,719
care utilization health services

1389
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:30,880
perspective is anybody doing work to

1390
00:58:28,719 --> 00:58:32,239
document reduction in health care

1391
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,079
utilization

1392
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,318
to quantify the cost effectiveness that

1393
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,480
you just mentioned and make the argument

1394
00:58:36,318 --> 00:58:40,318
for broader support yeah there's been

1395
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,240
good evidence um

1396
00:58:40,318 --> 00:58:43,599
particularly the studies of bradford and

1397
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,679
bradford

1398
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:49,200
looking at populate medicaid and

1399
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:51,679
medicare populations and use rates

1400
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:53,919
of narcotics

1401
00:58:51,679 --> 00:58:56,639
marked reductions have been noted in

1402
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:59,280
states with legal medical access

1403
00:58:56,639 --> 00:59:01,519
also reduction in overdose deaths now

1404
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,319
you have to be careful there the deaths

1405
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:06,559
have clearly gone down you can't claim

1406
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:08,239
causation but it's a reasonable

1407
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,359
inference

1408
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:12,639
that

1409
00:59:09,358 --> 00:59:16,159
the reductions might be due to cannabis

1410
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,679
availability and many of us believe that

1411
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:20,639
to be the case

1412
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:23,759
now i'm not sure how i'm we're cutting

1413
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:25,838
into the break by a bit i will defer to

1414
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:28,240
the powers that be to say when i should

1415
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,239
stop

1416
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:35,960
we're done

1417
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,960
okay thank you again for your attention
