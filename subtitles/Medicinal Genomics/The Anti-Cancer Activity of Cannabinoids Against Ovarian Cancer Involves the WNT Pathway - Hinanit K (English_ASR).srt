1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:09,059
hello everybody and good afternoon

2
00:00:06,599 --> 00:00:12,718
first of all I would like to thank the

3
00:00:09,058 --> 00:00:17,039
organizers for inviting me to give this

4
00:00:12,718 --> 00:00:21,740
talk and to share with you some of the

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,740
activity that we do in my lab

6
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,140
in this work

7
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,039
we are collaborating

8
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:37,500
with Michelle and Bruce Kendall

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:41,339
and this work

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:43,859
is the vision and Legacy of a very

11
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,180
unique lady

12
00:00:43,859 --> 00:00:47,659
both

13
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:47,659
please

14
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:54,539
[Applause]

15
00:00:51,058 --> 00:00:56,339
in early 2016 at just the age of 43

16
00:00:54,539 --> 00:00:58,198
Michelle was diagnosed with Advanced

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,660
stage ovarian cancer

18
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:02,039
she went through

19
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:03,419
conventional treatment and entered into

20
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:05,640
a you know

21
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,719
altering sequences of remission and

22
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,478
recurrence

23
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:12,118
in 2018 she stumbled across the then

24
00:01:09,478 --> 00:01:13,920
emerging literature on cannabis as a

25
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:15,420
potential treatment for cancers

26
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,920
and quickly got to the point of

27
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:19,740
realizing that

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:21,960
the responses of cancers to cannabinoids

29
00:01:19,739 --> 00:01:24,359
was specific to every Cancer so she came

30
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:27,239
to the question what do I need to take

31
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:29,099
to secure my cancer and ovary and cancer

32
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:32,819
at this point and some of you may

33
00:01:29,099 --> 00:01:35,219
remember her from can Med 2019 when she

34
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:37,500
was here with this glittery hat

35
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:40,078
um with a with a videographer in tow

36
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,379
handing out bumper stickers and asking

37
00:01:40,078 --> 00:01:48,199
everyone that she could could could find

38
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:48,199
who's working on ovarian cancer

39
00:01:48,659 --> 00:01:51,780
um and the answer what she got was

40
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:54,478
nobody

41
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,420
well so the film she did make her film

42
00:01:54,478 --> 00:02:01,799
um and it was ready to go on to the film

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:04,618
festival circuit

44
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,360
um in March of 2020 and of course that

45
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:07,078
all got canceled

46
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:11,098
um

47
00:02:07,078 --> 00:02:12,900
and then uh she turned and together we

48
00:02:11,098 --> 00:02:17,159
we turned and decided that it was going

49
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:21,420
to be up to us to find the research that

50
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:22,560
uh that that might cure her disease

51
00:02:21,419 --> 00:02:25,919
um

52
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:28,680
so at that point we um she she made

53
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:30,479
contact with with Hannah neet

54
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:32,879
um and we entered into an agreement

55
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,899
where we would we would fund the

56
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,818
research

57
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,620
um in in each lab to look at the

58
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:40,939
pre-clinical

59
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:44,519
um studies of cannabis on ovarian cancer

60
00:02:40,939 --> 00:02:47,400
both with the hope of helping saving

61
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,560
Michelle's life but also looking for a

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,539
cure to this terrible disease which has

63
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:55,699
a very high mortality rate because it's

64
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:55,699
almost always diagnosed to be on stages

65
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:59,518
um

66
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,500
this is the hard part

67
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,039
um

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,139
the

69
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:06,359
we had you know the internet went to

70
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:09,059
work very fast and we got some really

71
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,040
promising early results but by the time

72
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,640
we could turn those results into a

73
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:16,859
formulation that Michelle could use

74
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,158
um she had already progressed to organ

75
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,459
failure and it was just too late

76
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:29,219
um for this to save her life

77
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:32,519
but before she died in September of 2021

78
00:03:29,219 --> 00:03:33,180
three yeah 2021.

79
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,840
um

80
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,840
she asked both of us to promise to keep

81
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:42,299
pushing this work forward in the hopes

82
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,219
that we might find a cure for

83
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:44,819
all the other

84
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:46,378
um

85
00:03:44,818 --> 00:03:49,079
all the other women who are afflicted

86
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,579
with this disease so

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,480
in a neat

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:53,519
um

89
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:55,979
you know Nate and I are carrying this on

90
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,640
I'm is really mostly hiranit who is

91
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:03,079
doing the work but I'm so happy

92
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:03,079
that she's my partner in this

93
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,069
thank you

94
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:09,069
[Applause]

95
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,780
thank you both it's not easy to continue

96
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,780
after your your words

97
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,418
Okay so we are

98
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:27,779
we all cannabis and we know that

99
00:04:24,418 --> 00:04:30,319
cannabis produces hundreds of different

100
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:34,698
compounds

101
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:39,478
and that we are usually

102
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:43,978
not sure what compounds are a really

103
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:47,339
important and more more than that what

104
00:04:43,978 --> 00:04:50,459
is the the preferred composition or the

105
00:04:47,339 --> 00:04:54,679
best composition to confer the Entourage

106
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:58,198
effect that Dr Russo was talking about

107
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:02,100
and this is especially in light of the

108
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:05,879
of the of the variety of of different

109
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,860
strains can be strains that contains

110
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,180
different compounds

111
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:15,240
in my lab we ask what is the best

112
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,959
composition of active compounds for the

113
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,720
optimized treatment of each medical

114
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:25,079
condition

115
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:27,960
and to answer that in my lab what we do

116
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:30,300
is we extract canopies from different

117
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:31,038
strains

118
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,280
um

119
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:38,180
we separate the extracts to fractions

120
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:42,299
and by that we are able

121
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:44,280
to to simplify in a way the chemical

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,000
composition

123
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:50,159
and to ask the question

124
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,860
what compounds and what composition of

125
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:56,340
compounds are working based on

126
00:05:52,860 --> 00:06:01,199
biological essays

127
00:05:56,339 --> 00:06:03,978
of iron cancer indeed is a the second

128
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,600
most common and the most liver

129
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:09,000
gynecology

130
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:12,120
malignancy in the western world and and

131
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:17,399
very few women survive five years after

132
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:20,038
diagnosis there is only little little is

133
00:06:17,399 --> 00:06:23,399
known about the activity of cannabis

134
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:26,599
against the vine cancer definitely the

135
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:29,638
active compounds were not identified

136
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:32,460
before we started our work

137
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:35,400
so first of all we do

138
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:38,939
the four different strains in order to

139
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:43,198
find the best ones that are mostly

140
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:46,800
active against ovarian cancer cells we

141
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:51,600
looked for self-viability of ovarian

142
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:55,560
cancer cells of of several cell lines

143
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:58,879
and we were able to identify one of the

144
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:03,300
strains in this case it is DQ

145
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:06,600
which is a high THC strain and we found

146
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,360
that this strain is a highly active in

147
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,120
comparison to others then we

148
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,660
fractionated

149
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:18,780
the extract and were able to find and to

150
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:22,099
identify the actual fractions

151
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:26,459
that are highly active

152
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:30,538
following chemical analysis we were able

153
00:07:26,459 --> 00:07:33,079
to determine the API the formulation

154
00:07:30,538 --> 00:07:35,818
that is highly active in terms of

155
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:38,538
cytotoxic activity against of iron

156
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:44,160
cancer cells and the formulation

157
00:07:38,538 --> 00:07:47,459
contained a mostly THC some CBC and just

158
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,979
a little bit of CBG

159
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:53,579
in order to prove that indeed this is

160
00:07:49,978 --> 00:07:58,818
the active composition what we did is

161
00:07:53,579 --> 00:08:03,839
with then a used purified

162
00:07:58,819 --> 00:08:07,199
phytocannabinoids to a to a a in this

163
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,839
composition in this ratio in order to

164
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:13,939
prove that indeed this composition is

165
00:08:09,839 --> 00:08:16,739
the active one and indeed once we used

166
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:19,800
phytocannabinoids only and remember this

167
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:23,220
is originated from a fraction which

168
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:27,478
contains many more compounds rather than

169
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:30,500
only this but yet when we re-established

170
00:08:27,478 --> 00:08:34,500
this composition using purified

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:39,958
phytocurabenoids then activity was

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:42,120
gained as much as in diffraction so this

173
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:46,859
led us to the understanding that the

174
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:52,320
actual active compounds are these ones

175
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:56,180
in in this certain ratios

176
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:58,800
a following we have determined using

177
00:08:56,179 --> 00:09:02,399
antagonists and inverse agonists and

178
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:06,859
blockers we determined receptors that

179
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:11,580
many mediate a cannabis activity a F7

180
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:15,778
diffraction and also the standard mix SM

181
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:18,240
and we found that the CB2 is mostly

182
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:22,679
involved and there was some evidences

183
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,839
for trpv2 as well

184
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:31,379
however it is most reasonable that that

185
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:34,620
to treat patients we provide cancer the

186
00:09:31,379 --> 00:09:39,299
treatment will not rely on cannabis only

187
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:44,580
but rather cannabis will be a will be

188
00:09:39,299 --> 00:09:48,659
used as a core treatment with another

189
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:52,080
um a chemotherapy and indeed we have

190
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:55,159
examined the activity of cannabis of

191
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:59,778
diffraction and then the standard mix

192
00:09:55,159 --> 00:10:04,980
with a different chemotherapies we found

193
00:09:59,778 --> 00:10:05,580
a a Synergy with some of them

194
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:09,480
um

195
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:13,440
and in this talk today I will focus on

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:16,800
the pop one inhibitor near parib near a

197
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:19,380
parib is the second line of treatment of

198
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:22,859
ovarian cancer patients

199
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:24,419
what we could find is that the actual

200
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:28,440
diffraction

201
00:10:24,419 --> 00:10:31,079
diffraction and not the standard mix but

202
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:36,420
the fraction itself from the plant

203
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:39,959
led to Synergy with near a parib so what

204
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,879
we see here is sensitization of ovarian

205
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:46,159
cancer cells

206
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:46,159
to the papuan inhibitory

207
00:10:50,458 --> 00:10:56,039
then

208
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:59,100
we wanted to examine the activity of the

209
00:10:56,039 --> 00:11:02,159
combination of diffraction in the upper

210
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:05,579
rib against normal cells

211
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:10,679
we were able to show that this

212
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:15,599
combination was 50 times more active on

213
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:17,299
cancer cells than on normal cells these

214
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,659
workers

215
00:11:17,299 --> 00:11:20,659
in this case

216
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:26,819
and then we have

217
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,000
we were able to show that the

218
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:31,519
combination of cannabis fraction and

219
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,679
nervative

220
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:40,320
was indeed active more venerative only

221
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:44,639
on Michelle's cells

222
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:47,879
cells were isolated from Shell tumor and

223
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:51,980
were shifted to Israel to my lab and

224
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,980
indeed you can see the result

225
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:59,339
we've conducted in Vivo study and

226
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:01,919
conducting additional ones already in

227
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:05,399
the first experiment there was an

228
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:08,639
advantage for the use of cannabis with

229
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:09,720
Nila parib avastin was added in this

230
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,458
case

231
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:13,278
um

232
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:16,699
versus a treatment with

233
00:12:13,278 --> 00:12:16,700
neapolitanavastin only

234
00:12:17,578 --> 00:12:24,719
and and then we wanted to get deeper and

235
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,939
to better understand the mode of action

236
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,839
of cannabis and era parib against

237
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:36,300
ovarian cancer in Vito

238
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:40,579
first of all we showed that the activity

239
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:45,120
is a conveyed via apoptosis

240
00:12:40,578 --> 00:12:48,359
and not necrosis or other form of cell

241
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:52,500
death but travel indeed there is an

242
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:55,740
induction of apoptosis by the especially

243
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:58,440
by the combination of Nera parib and the

244
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,620
Cannabis fraction

245
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:05,519
foreign

246
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:09,179
we have looked at the wind pathway the

247
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:13,259
wind pathway is deeply associated with

248
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:15,679
cancer in general and ovarian cancer in

249
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:15,679
particular

250
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:23,839
a cannabis the the combination of F7 of

251
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:27,060
cannabis fraction in your parib led to

252
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,459
reduction to significant reduction in

253
00:13:27,059 --> 00:13:34,799
some of the components of the wind

254
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:38,159
pathway including the receptor which the

255
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:43,500
frizzled receptor FC in the in the

256
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:46,559
drawing here which is a essential for a

257
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:50,159
activation of the wind pathway so

258
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,979
cannabis by its own by the way and the

259
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:55,740
combination of cannabis

260
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:59,778
reduced significantly the expression of

261
00:13:55,740 --> 00:14:01,860
the receptor and additional components

262
00:13:59,778 --> 00:14:06,600
we've also

263
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:09,860
um showed that the combination of a

264
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,100
cannabis and neuroparib F7 in Europe

265
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:16,919
lead to relocation of proteins beta

266
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:20,360
Catalina in this case Again part of the

267
00:14:16,919 --> 00:14:21,979
wind pathway relocation to the cell

268
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:25,680
membrane

269
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:29,278
this this and others are very important

270
00:14:25,679 --> 00:14:33,620
features of their mesenchymal to

271
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:33,620
epithelial a transition

272
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:43,379
phenotype cells are those that are

273
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,259
related and responsible to metastasis

274
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:48,360
and Visa usually resistant to

275
00:14:46,259 --> 00:14:51,480
chemotherapy

276
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,278
once these cells were treated with F7

277
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:57,420
and Europa rib

278
00:14:53,278 --> 00:15:00,259
the mesenchymal features changed to

279
00:14:57,419 --> 00:15:03,539
epithelial features and this is

280
00:15:00,259 --> 00:15:07,259
associated usually with cells that do

281
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,879
not are not metastizing and are not

282
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,338
resistant

283
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,059
usually

284
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,060
so

285
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,100
indeed we suggested that cannabis

286
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,299
treatment of February and cancer cells

287
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:26,519
reduce the proportion of Amazon cell an

288
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:30,120
increased proportion of octotic cells

289
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:32,159
and this is by altering the wind pathway

290
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,000
and this is all published it was

291
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,819
published last year in molecules

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,019
but following we wanted to go even

293
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:47,459
deeper into the mode of action of F7 and

294
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:51,778
era parib and to do that what we did is

295
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:54,958
we sequenced a cells from two cell lines

296
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:59,220
of ovarian cancer that were treated with

297
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:02,059
the combination of F7 and near parib we

298
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:06,778
found hundreds of different

299
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:10,619
genes and several dozens of genetic

300
00:16:06,778 --> 00:16:12,419
Pathways that were significantly altered

301
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:16,440
by

302
00:16:12,419 --> 00:16:19,698
the F7 plus neuroparib treatment in both

303
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,699
cell lines

304
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,339
these

305
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:28,458
these biological and signaling Pathways

306
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:30,120
that were altered

307
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:33,838
suggested

308
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:38,159
some features of activity of F7 and

309
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:40,680
Europa rib that were verified and are

310
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:44,899
still being verified in an ongoing

311
00:16:40,679 --> 00:16:50,219
research and these included for example

312
00:16:44,899 --> 00:16:54,240
a inhibition of cell migration and

313
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,240
differences in cytoskeletons

314
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:59,698
acting rearrangement

315
00:17:00,778 --> 00:17:07,140
and led to a better and more

316
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:11,220
comprehensive understanding of the

317
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:15,900
activity of F7 and Nira parib and the

318
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:19,759
basis of the synergy and the ability of

319
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:22,679
cannabis to synthesize cells to

320
00:17:19,759 --> 00:17:25,099
chemotherapy PowerPoint inhibitor in

321
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:25,100
this case

322
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:32,840
so if I summarize in few words

323
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:37,079
we have started with many different

324
00:17:32,839 --> 00:17:41,220
compounds many different strains and the

325
00:17:37,079 --> 00:17:44,099
inability to to determine what compounds

326
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:47,460
are active in one com what compositions

327
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:50,099
are the optimal ones doing using

328
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:53,038
different bio essays chemical analysis

329
00:17:50,099 --> 00:17:57,178
we were able to get the formulation of

330
00:17:53,038 --> 00:18:00,779
API and get deeper into the targets and

331
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:04,140
mode of action

332
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:08,038
um this this of course have to go

333
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,520
through toxicity studies and additional

334
00:18:08,038 --> 00:18:16,200
in Vivo

335
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:18,179
to a to determine a a the actual

336
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,120
activity

337
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:24,960
and the ability

338
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:29,058
to go into clinical trials and and of

339
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:32,480
course only successful clinical trials

340
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,480
will prove

341
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:43,219
and then if the actual formulations that

342
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:48,298
were identified might serve as a base

343
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:51,419
for chemovas of cannabis that will be

344
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:52,859
optimal for treatment of this and other

345
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,559
diseases

346
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,240
so the information on the API

347
00:18:55,558 --> 00:19:00,538
formulation

348
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,900
may be translated and I hope it will be

349
00:19:00,538 --> 00:19:07,919
translated in the future not just into

350
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:12,780
new cannabis based products that will be

351
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:15,600
specific and a pharmaceutical grades but

352
00:19:12,779 --> 00:19:16,379
travel this information would serve as a

353
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:22,500
base

354
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:26,580
for breeding for new cannabis a chemovas

355
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:30,419
with a certain activities

356
00:19:26,579 --> 00:19:32,359
and with that I would like to thank

357
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:37,280
my team

358
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:37,279
in the lab and especially Norwich

359
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:45,538
which is with us today and she is

360
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,059
leading This research in my lab

361
00:19:45,538 --> 00:19:51,170
thank you

362
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:51,169
[Applause]

363
00:19:54,839 --> 00:19:59,459
do we have time for a question that was

364
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:04,140
really interesting

365
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:05,819
it blows my mind that this specific set

366
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,100
of cannabinoids in this ratio is

367
00:20:05,819 --> 00:20:12,960
suddenly so active

368
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:14,939
um how specific is it or how how have

369
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,460
you have you ever tested the tolerance

370
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:20,160
of these kinds of specific ratios to see

371
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:23,700
how close you have to get

372
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,038
absolutely absolutely uh what we did and

373
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,480
I indeed I did not show that yeah but

374
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:35,099
what we did is we determined the range

375
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:38,880
of of a of a ratios that we need to use

376
00:20:35,099 --> 00:20:42,119
in order to start to to to have Synergy

377
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,419
so definitely what I showed you is just

378
00:20:42,119 --> 00:20:48,538
an example rather and it's in estimate

379
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:51,660
so you can understand that free quarters

380
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:55,679
should be THC and a quarter should be

381
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:59,460
and so on CBC and so however we

382
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:00,798
carefully determined the boundaries of

383
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:04,620
synergy

384
00:21:00,798 --> 00:21:09,119
and by that using these four components

385
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:14,819
we could draw the Synergy in terms of

386
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:17,699
activity and a a between between the

387
00:21:14,819 --> 00:21:20,038
four cannabis compounds but also with

388
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,340
neuroparib

389
00:21:20,038 --> 00:21:26,179
okay so yeah

390
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:26,178
thank you

391
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,480
thank you
