2
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,559
um can you describe how ferium affects

3
00:00:13,119 --> 00:00:17,118
hemp plants um how does it infect and

4
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,919
you know what is sort of the

5
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:22,879
progression okay well let's start with

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,199
uh fusarium is a genus and it's a very

7
00:00:22,879 --> 00:00:27,160
large genus with a lot of complexes so

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,199
lots of species within a fusarium

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,518
complex so most people when they hear

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,640
fusarium they think fusarium Wilt and

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:36,679
that's fusarium oxysporum different um

12
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,558
different special forms but fusarium

13
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,640
oxysporum or fusarium Wilt is a vascular

14
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:43,439
disease it starts in The Roots it's all

15
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,039
born it moves its way up the vascular

16
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:47,920
system and it causes Wilt um because of

17
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,920
just blocking water and nutrient uptake

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,679
to the top of the plant and necrosis of

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,320
the of the xylem fusarium headlight is

20
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:58,920
fusarium garum so that is infecting

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,198
flowers and grain from the outside um

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,359
it's a very very pathogen and remember

23
00:01:01,198 --> 00:01:05,599
earlier I talked about fusarium salani a

24
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,920
Rootin Crown Rod so there are three

25
00:01:05,599 --> 00:01:12,079
major fusarium species that affect hemp

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:14,799
or cannabis um but back to fusarium

27
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,079
headlight uh the fusarium headlight

28
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,799
pathogens we have identifi five um

29
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:22,560
fusarium garum is the common one that's

30
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,840
the one that you read so much that

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:30,400
affects um wheat and Cal crops um so

32
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,719
fusarium garum will infect um flowers

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,359
and grain we have found it to infect um

34
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:39,679
growing tips and leaves but primarily

35
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:43,640
it's going to be a flower and grain

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:47,159
disease interesting so different type

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,680
different different species of fusarium

38
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,000
will kind of attack the plant from from

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,240
different angles that's right that's

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,680
right and to not just say fusarium

41
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:58,478
because when we started working on

42
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,759
fusarium headlight the Assumption was

43
00:01:58,478 --> 00:02:03,118
that it was the fusarium ox sisum the

44
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:04,519
fusarium W pathogen and they're very

45
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:06,319
very different even though that first

46
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:09,199
name even that though that genus is the

47
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:13,878
same interesting so what are some of the

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:17,560
economic impacts of fusarium on hemp

49
00:02:13,878 --> 00:02:20,598
cultivation um so fusarium headlight as

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,719
we call it will blight out um and and

51
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:24,878
blight is kind of a rapid necrosis

52
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:27,159
that's what that kind of term means a

53
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:30,639
fusarium headlight will blight out a

54
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,680
flower head or a seed head um so so uh

55
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:37,079
early shattering more

56
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:39,400
brittle more brittle flowers or or grain

57
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,120
heads but we can have it at very low

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,039
levels as well um so that's remember I

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:47,200
mentioned mot toxins earlier so um

60
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:49,719
fusarium griin arum produces two

61
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:53,759
different mot toxins so a Mot toxin is a

62
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:55,959
toxin produced by um a fungus um so mot

63
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:59,959
toxins there are there's a history of

64
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:04,840
MOT toxins in fusarium um species uh the

65
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:08,799
trines for example um that can cause

66
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:12,200
vomiting um digestion issues both in

67
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,799
humans and in animals so in in hemp I'm

68
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:17,439
sorry in uh any feed it's highly

69
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:21,040
regulated so uh even low levels of

70
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:22,280
disease can cause high levels of toxins

71
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:24,759
and that's something that we're not

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,360
regulating here in the US not in Helm

73
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:31,560
not in cannabis so everyone is really

74
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,959
interested in looking at um

75
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:37,519
apoxin or or some of those other um

76
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,519
toxins which we're not finding um but we

77
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,959
are finding those fusaria myotoxins from

78
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,400
the headlight pathogens so again all the

79
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,680
Fus areia out there but that's our Focus

80
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,799
because that's what we're seeing the

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,319
most and that's what we feel is the most

82
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:55,519
important especially as hemp as an

83
00:03:52,318 --> 00:03:57,958
animal feed is coming onto Market yeah

84
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,360
so you you mentioned that ferum could be

85
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,239
there in low levels so

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,360
might it sort of Escape some visual

87
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:07,840
detection and have some of those microt

88
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:10,519
toxins present I'm going to Spill the

89
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
Beans a little bit uh uh my graduate

90
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:15,640
student just came in with some year one

91
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,879
data from uh two different fields here

92
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:22,639
in um in Central Kentucky and he had

93
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:24,399
fusarium headlight at about 5% severity

94
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,918
so think about that whole seed head and

95
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:30,879
about visually 5% of that head had

96
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,959
symptoms um so very low something that a

97
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,399
grower would probably Overlook something

98
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,478
that I might have said oh well and he

99
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:42,439
ended up detecting um Dawn deoxy no

100
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:45,319
valinol uh he ended up detecting Dawn at

101
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:47,399
levels that are above the threshold for

102
00:04:45,319 --> 00:04:48,639
human consumption in other grains so of

103
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:51,679
course we don't have that threshold for

104
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,000
him but that that threshold would I mean

105
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:58,800
that would have failed um um uh QC in a

106
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,680
cial grain market and so we're finding

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,520
those high levels of toxins and and in a

108
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:09,280
year of drought and extreme heat this

109
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,279
year we had low levels of disease wow

110
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:23,310
