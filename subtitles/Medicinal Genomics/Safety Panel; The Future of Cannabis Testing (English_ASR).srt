1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:06,390
thank you everyone for joining us I am

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:08,609
being joined on stage for the panel

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:10,949
entitled the future of cannabis testing

4
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:13,468
although I would like to acknowledge

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:16,108
that these people have really been

6
00:00:13,468 --> 00:00:18,149
leaders in the industry for the past

7
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:19,800
five years I think everyone on this

8
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,329
stage has been testing cannabis and

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,868
stringent regulations were even passed

10
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:26,489
in the state so not only have they kind

11
00:00:24,868 --> 00:00:27,960
of driven the direction of where

12
00:00:26,489 --> 00:00:29,428
cannabis is going to be but they've

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,850
already kind of set the standard for

14
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:34,379
where it is now so for I would just like

15
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,880
to give them a couple minutes to

16
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,700
introduce themselves the audience so you

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:42,270
know who you're talking to so firstly we

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,210
know good morning I'm Savino seguirÃ¡

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:47,550
I've been testing cannabis in the

20
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:49,950
analytical setting for the last eight

21
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,229
years working on mostly method

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,429
development method validations according

23
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:57,390
to different state and federal

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:01:00,030
regulations everything from pesticides

25
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:07,859
to cannabinoids and everything in

26
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:10,379
between I'm Steven Goldman

27
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:12,359
I'm the laboratory director of a testing

28
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:17,069
facility in Denver Colorado called Fida

29
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:20,280
Tech we opened in 2013 so going on six

30
00:01:17,069 --> 00:01:24,478
years now and we've been lucky enough to

31
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:27,478
test over 150,000 compliant samples and

32
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:30,150
many tens of thousands more R&amp;D so

33
00:01:27,478 --> 00:01:32,188
starting to get to a place where we can

34
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:36,450
really leverage the data set that we've

35
00:01:32,188 --> 00:01:38,938
acquired good morning my name is Annie

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,609
ophea currently scientific director at

37
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:43,139
can a safe labs I'd like to believe the

38
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:46,680
largest lab and the world's first

39
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,629
accredited lab in cannabis current

40
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,670
market shareholder testing just about

41
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,810
over a third of the products that go

42
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,810
into shelves here in California

43
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:01,959
good morning I'm Cindy Orser i'm the

44
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:05,650
chief science officer for digi path labs

45
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:09,549
it's a testing lab in las vegas

46
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:13,289
I have been practicing science for over

47
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:16,570
30 years I got my PhD at UC Berkeley

48
00:02:13,289 --> 00:02:19,090
where I worked on a biogenic ice

49
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:21,909
nucleation which is a fascinating topic

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:24,759
I'd like to tell you all about one day

51
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:29,379
it's basically responsible for frost

52
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:32,949
injury worldwide I consider myself an

53
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:35,400
innovator starting with my PhD I came up

54
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:40,359
with a way to control frost injury but

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:43,750
the EPA prevented that product from ever

56
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:46,690
moving forward we actually filed the

57
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:50,259
first environmental impact statement for

58
00:02:46,689 --> 00:02:52,750
GMO so that was very interesting sort of

59
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:59,048
set the stage for my career I've worked

60
00:02:52,750 --> 00:03:02,769
across many disciplines from toxicology

61
00:02:59,049 --> 00:03:06,040
trying to create a way to measure human

62
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,879
mutation rate of describing D

63
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:11,280
halogenation reactions how

64
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:14,280
microorganisms co-opted existing

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,030
function to break down man-made

66
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,129
chemicals i've been valid developed

67
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:25,299
rapid Diagnostics for homeland security

68
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:27,459
for biological toxins and about six

69
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:31,829
years ago I fell into what I call the

70
00:03:27,459 --> 00:03:34,750
black hole of cannabis testing when a

71
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:38,700
headhunter contacted me and asked if I

72
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,829
would be interested in building out a

73
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:44,500
cannabis testing lab for a public

74
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:47,799
company in Las Vegas and actually one of

75
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:50,860
my first hires was any apphia and I

76
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:55,989
could not have done it without him it

77
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:58,500
was a amazing experience starting out

78
00:03:55,989 --> 00:04:02,110
with basically nothing there are no

79
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,539
validated methods there were few

80
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,660
certified reference standards so it

81
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:10,370
really was quite an undertaking

82
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:12,049
thank you so much and for those who

83
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,680
don't know my name is Andrew Pham from

84
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,030
Alchemist labs we are ad a registered

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:19,250
botanical testing lab of over 20 years

86
00:04:17,029 --> 00:04:21,888
of experience in the lab testing

87
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,810
industry and thank you all for joining

88
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:26,150
us thank you for caring about lab

89
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:27,709
testing there's a lot of reasons to care

90
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:29,870
about lab testing and I don't think you

91
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:32,719
need to go any further than to look at

92
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:34,280
the news and think about the vaping

93
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,230
crisis that's affecting hundreds of

94
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:38,209
people across the country the CDC's

95
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:41,480
reported over three to five hundred

96
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:42,259
cases for both nicotine and cannabis

97
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,580
related vapes

98
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,819
most of them sourced from the black

99
00:04:43,579 --> 00:04:48,709
market and I just really wanted to ask

100
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:50,480
the panelists do you think lab testing

101
00:04:48,709 --> 00:04:55,639
could have prevented this crisis or do

102
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:58,069
you think it's too soon to say well I

103
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:59,360
think that lab testing as it currently

104
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,490
stands wouldn't have prevented this

105
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,889
crisis because we're not looking for the

106
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:06,110
things that are supposedly causing this

107
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,899
vape crisis so we've heard a lot about

108
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:12,410
vitamin E acetate a little bit about

109
00:05:08,899 --> 00:05:15,259
mineral oil B and and other dope ins

110
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:18,169
being added to the vape carts in order

111
00:05:15,259 --> 00:05:20,689
to dilute the product or to keep a

112
00:05:18,168 --> 00:05:21,379
proper consistency but unfortunately we

113
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,850
don't

114
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,889
those aren't common things that are

115
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:29,750
tested for in an analytical laboratory

116
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:32,300
because they're not contaminants and as

117
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,829
well we a lot of the manufacturers don't

118
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,930
disclose the ingredients they keep them

119
00:05:33,829 --> 00:05:37,639
for Praia Terry and so a lab wouldn't

120
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:39,500
know and until regulations change in

121
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:41,930
which they have to start disclosing

122
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:46,279
these things we might continue to see

123
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:48,019
this yeah and in Colorado there are

124
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:52,219
about it's an open market so there's

125
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:55,069
about 3,000 licenses many but not all of

126
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:59,180
which test with our company and and you

127
00:05:55,069 --> 00:06:02,199
know less than 10% of them test what's

128
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:04,370
outside of the required testing panel so

129
00:06:02,199 --> 00:06:05,538
it's definitely the minority of

130
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:08,600
companies that are looking at these

131
00:06:05,538 --> 00:06:11,209
things we do almost zero raw materials

132
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:13,550
testing in the state you know a lot of

133
00:06:11,209 --> 00:06:16,038
the manufacturers are just now learning

134
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:18,829
what GMP or good manufacturing practices

135
00:06:16,038 --> 00:06:20,360
are so you know I think it's it's just

136
00:06:18,829 --> 00:06:22,639
in its infancy right now we're not

137
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,379
quite to the point where we're starting

138
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,139
to think about assessing risks and

139
00:06:24,379 --> 00:06:30,349
minimizing risks during manufacturing so

140
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:33,710
I agree I don't think testing would have

141
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:35,718
cut this process correct jumping on that

142
00:06:33,709 --> 00:06:38,448
lab testing wouldn't have prevented this

143
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:41,629
but it's important to note when the

144
00:06:38,449 --> 00:06:44,150
issue that began it was pertinent for

145
00:06:41,629 --> 00:06:46,699
labs to jump on it and provide as much

146
00:06:44,149 --> 00:06:49,310
information as possible know which kind

147
00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:52,400
of safe did quickly developing a method

148
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:54,319
for vitamin A acetate although it's not

149
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,628
known to be the culprit but it's a

150
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:00,020
common denominator in these illicit vape

151
00:06:56,629 --> 00:07:02,150
cards we actually went out and bought a

152
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:02,810
lot of illicit vape cards and tested

153
00:07:02,149 --> 00:07:05,508
them ourselves

154
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:07,668
along with some of our clients products

155
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:10,610
and notice that yes they contain high

156
00:07:07,668 --> 00:07:14,060
levels some up to 40% of atyminius State

157
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:17,419
oil with low label claims and pretty

158
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:21,379
much at least 10 to 20 different

159
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:23,688
pesticides so it's not quite known what

160
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:26,229
is the cause but contribution of all of

161
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:28,939
these factors could be very disastrous

162
00:07:26,228 --> 00:07:30,709
so it's important all the labs on tests

163
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:34,370
for this excipients and whatnot it's

164
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:37,098
important to jump on it as soon as we

165
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:39,588
feel that public safety is at risk and I

166
00:07:37,098 --> 00:07:42,228
think it's a responsibility for the labs

167
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:44,329
in the state to to get on this

168
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,810
additionally perhaps if the federal

169
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:50,718
government made this federally illegal

170
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:52,490
it would allow for or not allow for some

171
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:55,399
of these black market players to be in

172
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:01,990
the space and perhaps increase consumer

173
00:07:55,399 --> 00:08:03,709
safety yeah I think the whole vape

174
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:07,069
cartridge issue

175
00:08:03,709 --> 00:08:09,918
we're facing right now is was fully

176
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:13,580
expected by myself that's for certain

177
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:18,109
four years ago ago I wrote a blog on the

178
00:08:13,579 --> 00:08:20,750
hazards of vaping there's a myriad of

179
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:22,819
issues starting with the fact as was

180
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:25,310
already mentioned that the producers

181
00:08:22,819 --> 00:08:27,500
don't have to list the ingredients that

182
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:30,860
they put in there

183
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:33,289
state regulators are so far in over

184
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:35,899
their heads they don't even realize the

185
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:39,379
complexity of these products and the

186
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:43,519
pending health crisis that we could be

187
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:45,889
witnessing I think the industry for the

188
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,460
first time is going to see class-action

189
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:51,620
lawsuits because now these companies are

190
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:54,879
making enough money and there are enough

191
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:58,100
individuals that are being a being of

192
00:08:54,879 --> 00:09:01,100
impacted there was a case study that was

193
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,440
in the news from the UK a 19 year old

194
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:06,649
individual who had been vaping for two

195
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,300
years and they shared the x-rays of his

196
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:11,779
lungs

197
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:16,069
they were like half-full of a substance

198
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:18,500
that resembled bacon grease I don't

199
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:23,660
think it's a good idea to inhale lipids

200
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:27,919
or to inhale oil droplets and this

201
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:30,799
points to the lack of oversight and in

202
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:33,819
this industry and I think that we should

203
00:09:30,799 --> 00:09:36,349
all come together and and require

204
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:38,780
stricter standards there have never been

205
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:43,399
any inhalation studies I mean the

206
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:45,980
tobacco industry got off without having

207
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:48,679
to conduct these studies for decades and

208
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,470
decades I think that we should insist

209
00:09:48,679 --> 00:09:53,569
that we see some animal inhalation

210
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:55,840
studies done on the constituents that

211
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:58,310
are used in these products

212
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,840
honestly I'd like to jump on that that's

213
00:09:58,309 --> 00:10:02,179
important because I think a lot of

214
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:05,000
producers out there use ingredients that

215
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:06,949
you know they tout as grass that is by

216
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,769
the FDA you know generally recognized as

217
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:13,340
safe but those studies weren't done in

218
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:16,340
inhalation so yeah you can rub vitamin E

219
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,810
acetate or vitamin E oil topically but

220
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:21,080
it's never been started what happens

221
00:10:17,809 --> 00:10:25,389
when you ignite inhale right and there's

222
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:27,700
like no like in Germany there's a list

223
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:31,000
the ingredients that can go in beer and

224
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:33,280
here we like it's it's just totally up

225
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,259
to the imagination of the producer I

226
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:39,759
mean yesterday we heard in the terpene

227
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:46,210
talk that some of these babe fluids are

228
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:49,629
up to 60% terpenes so terpenes are also

229
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:53,500
oils and they can penetrate your skin

230
00:10:49,629 --> 00:10:56,649
they can coat your tissue I think one of

231
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:59,500
the positives from out of this could be

232
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:02,470
that there will be a return to vaping

233
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:07,500
flower which I consider to be the most

234
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:10,360
effective and safe way of using cannabis

235
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,009
all right so thank you very much for

236
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:14,050
your thoughtful responses it kind of

237
00:11:12,009 --> 00:11:15,970
seems like there's a very interesting

238
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:18,159
consensus here that you all acknowledge

239
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,600
that the current state of cannabis

240
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,939
testing probably wouldn't have prevented

241
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,519
this crisis from happening so in your

242
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,830
opinions what in the future do you think

243
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,179
what kind of new regulations or new

244
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:29,560
standards of testing should be

245
00:11:28,179 --> 00:11:32,319
implemented in order to prevent this

246
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,879
from happening well as far as

247
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,640
regulations go they could start

248
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:39,009
regulating what sort of deal you ins and

249
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,750
other additives ingredients should be

250
00:11:39,009 --> 00:11:42,639
allowed and it should be a very

251
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,200
restrictive list and it shouldn't be

252
00:11:42,639 --> 00:11:46,689
very many things we shouldn't be allowed

253
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:49,480
to add anything cheap or untested into

254
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:53,440
that even a lot of manufacturers will

255
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:55,450
use propylene glycol vegetable glycerin

256
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,280
and these aren't necessarily the

257
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:59,290
greatest things ever but they're highly

258
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,179
prevalent in the tobacco industry in the

259
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:03,819
- back in the nicotine vape industry and

260
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:06,519
so until all of these things start

261
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,850
coming under a set of monitoring lists

262
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:11,649
that that will look for some of these

263
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:14,529
additives and regulate them I don't

264
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:16,600
think there's anything we can do and as

265
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:18,220
an aside all of these vape cards were

266
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,899
all illegal they were they were not

267
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:24,009
being monitored they were not being sold

268
00:12:19,899 --> 00:12:27,789
on any legitimate market and so until we

269
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:30,399
make an effort to bridge the the legal

270
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:34,509
and illegal markets we won't be able to

271
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:36,519
control this yeah I would say you know

272
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:37,838
even simpler than that in Colorado

273
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,179
there's no

274
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,949
we'll process for a product so if you

275
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:43,870
want to make a product with the

276
00:12:41,948 --> 00:12:46,659
cannabinoid in it you do that and then

277
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:49,149
you sell it and and as long as you're

278
00:12:46,659 --> 00:12:51,039
not contributing you no flower to the

279
00:12:49,149 --> 00:12:53,589
black market there's very little that

280
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:57,129
will stop you to do that you know one

281
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:59,769
example of the openness of the market is

282
00:12:57,129 --> 00:13:02,620
our native nasal spray products which

283
00:12:59,769 --> 00:13:04,209
started appearing on the market and you

284
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,679
know we asked the regulators at the

285
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:09,878
Department of Public Health are you

286
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:11,528
concerned with applying products that

287
00:13:09,879 --> 00:13:14,980
could have you know very sensitive

288
00:13:11,528 --> 00:13:17,639
microbial agents in them directly on

289
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,600
someone's mucosal membrane and they said

290
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:21,519
they're selling those on the market

291
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,670
right now so there's there's literally

292
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:28,778
no oversight or product approval process

293
00:13:24,669 --> 00:13:32,438
or thought to what additives and risks

294
00:13:28,778 --> 00:13:35,259
are going into these products you know

295
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:38,379
we were discussing earlier whether these

296
00:13:35,259 --> 00:13:39,999
are acute toxicities or due to long-term

297
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:42,970
exposure I think Cindy kind of touched

298
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:45,159
on it earlier in that essentially we're

299
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:47,410
all you know guinea pigs in this right

300
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:49,299
so people have been vaping probably the

301
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:52,088
illicit black market material for quite

302
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:52,659
a while now and now it's becoming a

303
00:13:52,089 --> 00:13:54,790
problem

304
00:13:52,659 --> 00:13:57,929
so what other issues are we going to see

305
00:13:54,789 --> 00:14:00,370
from long-term exposure to these toxins

306
00:13:57,929 --> 00:14:03,128
Regulation wise it'll be very difficult

307
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:05,799
to enact regulation to stop some of

308
00:14:03,129 --> 00:14:08,079
these excipients or diluents from being

309
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,969
used because well to do that you need to

310
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:12,068
perform a study right and generally it's

311
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:14,829
a long-term thing and I don't see that

312
00:14:12,068 --> 00:14:17,610
happening overnight and you can't just

313
00:14:14,828 --> 00:14:21,609
you know handicap the cannabis industry

314
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:22,899
from producing vape products but I would

315
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:26,980
like to say this while you guys are out

316
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:29,078
here this city I don't believe has legal

317
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,550
shops yet so as you're you know enjoying

318
00:14:29,078 --> 00:14:32,409
your products just be careful what you

319
00:14:30,549 --> 00:14:34,740
buy out there that there are a lot of

320
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:38,519
illicit stuff out there even mimicking

321
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,519
licensed vendors

322
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:45,860
so I think first and foremost the

323
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:47,720
producers should be required to list

324
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,759
exactly what they're putting in their

325
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:53,930
products that would just be a first step

326
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:56,840
so full disclosure that you at least

327
00:14:53,929 --> 00:14:59,959
would know what you're vaping into your

328
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:02,690
lungs I think we probably have gotten to

329
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,330
this point because the industry has is

330
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:07,150
lightyears ahead of the regulators

331
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:11,629
because this is such a creative

332
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:16,699
fast-moving space but overall I think it

333
00:15:11,629 --> 00:15:19,639
points to the issues that surround this

334
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:22,070
industry because of the disconnect from

335
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:24,980
state and federal levels and I think

336
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:27,320
that's what has led the black market

337
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:30,620
explode and the vape cartridges they're

338
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,560
so easy to make you don't have to say

339
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:35,990
what's in them you know we have the

340
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:38,119
synthetic cannabinoid issue as well that

341
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,570
could be a culprit in this but it's

342
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:44,720
really because we have not had federal

343
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:47,480
public funding to do basic research so

344
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:50,840
that we can actually understand what are

345
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:53,090
the health impacts of not only the

346
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,310
cannabinoids and the terpenes but some

347
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:57,050
of these excipient so it would be just

348
00:15:55,309 --> 00:15:59,509
really great if there is a source of

349
00:15:57,049 --> 00:16:05,209
federal money so that we could do the

350
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:06,700
proper basic inhalation studies I think

351
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,470
a good word to touch on is probably

352
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,420
transparency then if they're required to

353
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:12,649
list what's in their product and I think

354
00:16:11,419 --> 00:16:14,500
manufacturers need to be more

355
00:16:12,649 --> 00:16:16,639
transparent in doing that and

356
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,049
cultivators need to be transparent and

357
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,149
how they grow their products as well

358
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:23,539
with pesticides you can stuff like that

359
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:25,069
but kind of pivoting just as importantly

360
00:16:23,539 --> 00:16:26,799
is that testing labs needed to

361
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:30,800
transparent with their methods as well

362
00:16:26,799 --> 00:16:32,539
so it's a very common complaint I'm sure

363
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:34,939
you've all heard this that can send a

364
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:37,519
sample to ten different labs and get ten

365
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:39,020
different results and some of that is on

366
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,210
us and some of that isn't but there's a

367
00:16:39,019 --> 00:16:43,309
million reasons why that happens and I

368
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:46,550
was wondering if you guys could kind of

369
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:48,649
share the intricacies of why there are

370
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:50,509
inconsistencies between results from

371
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,220
different labs and what we can do to

372
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:54,750
kind of fix

373
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,700
so it's it's definitely a multi-part

374
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:58,259
answer so first of all the plants if

375
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,360
you're talking about cannabis flower the

376
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:02,309
plant itself will very impotant see by

377
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,230
up to 15 percent that we found in some

378
00:17:02,309 --> 00:17:09,000
of our tests that we've done between

379
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:11,160
laboratories as sort of a gauge to see

380
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,660
okay everybody's testing this different

381
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,130
why is that so we send the same sample

382
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:16,620
to all these different laboratories and

383
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:19,110
see how everyone reports back and

384
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:22,319
different parts of the plant have tested

385
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:25,889
up to 15 percent of the value as being

386
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:30,659
different and this is talking about THC

387
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:32,280
percentage in particular and then the as

388
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:33,990
well you have the methodologies

389
00:17:32,279 --> 00:17:36,440
everybody's methodology comes with a

390
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:39,089
certain amount of what they call

391
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,580
uncertainty and so when you have a

392
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:43,949
certain amount of uncertainty that can

393
00:17:41,579 --> 00:17:46,230
make your release a result you say

394
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:49,950
that's 26% but actually it could be

395
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:53,700
really between 24 and 28 percent and

396
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:56,569
this exists in every other industry in

397
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,590
existing pharmaceuticals that exists in

398
00:17:56,569 --> 00:18:00,720
environmental lab testing and so that's

399
00:17:58,589 --> 00:18:02,669
what we need to educate the consumers

400
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,650
the cultivators a little more to say hey

401
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:06,720
when you get a result the result you

402
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:08,759
know it we report it as this but there's

403
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,039
actually a swing from here to here and

404
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:14,309
that really depends on everybody's

405
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,869
methodology equipment practices and

406
00:18:14,309 --> 00:18:17,519
whatnot but every laboratory should have

407
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:19,289
that number calculated and so it should

408
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:21,480
be known to anybody who is actually

409
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:25,589
compliant with BCC and ice ISO

410
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,460
regulations yeah in in Colorado the

411
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:28,309
Department of Public Health

412
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:31,890
actually mediates an inter lab

413
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,950
proficiency test study I think a lot of

414
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,990
you are familiar with the protocol but

415
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:38,220
there's a 13 page document that

416
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,640
describes how the Department of Public

417
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,259
Health

418
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,440
actually homogenized this flower and

419
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:44,940
sends it out to the lab so 13 pages just

420
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:48,480
to make sure that the sample is

421
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:50,130
homogeneous so it a lot - a lot does go

422
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,460
into it on the sampling side but you

423
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:56,310
know I do want to reinforce the idea of

424
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,049
transparency you know we're maybe a

425
00:18:56,309 --> 00:18:59,609
little too aggressive with our clients

426
00:18:58,049 --> 00:19:02,639
as well and trying to bring them into

427
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:03,429
our lab show them our methods you know

428
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,380
force them

429
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,720
look at our method validations to see

430
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,220
our method uncertainty because those are

431
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:12,029
the types of things that are gonna you

432
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:14,319
know bring awareness to the consumer end

433
00:19:12,029 --> 00:19:16,240
that that those are the questions that

434
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:19,750
need to be asked on the lab side as well

435
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,990
I think that's important you know meta

436
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:25,480
uncertainties is a required calculation

437
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,308
and the newest revision of ISO 17025

438
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:29,380
2017 and that's something we've

439
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:32,319
performed at our lab taking into account

440
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:34,480
all the different factors that may aid

441
00:19:32,319 --> 00:19:38,439
to uncertainties you know technician

442
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:41,170
pipetting whatnot and unfortunately it's

443
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,580
not reported in the co way due to

444
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,350
various reasons for one it's not

445
00:19:42,579 --> 00:19:47,740
required by the state but it can always

446
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,329
be asked by our client what does

447
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:51,759
uncertainty values are and you know

448
00:19:49,329 --> 00:19:53,889
savino they're totally right there's a

449
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:55,329
wide range and a lot of things factored

450
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:57,280
into that apart from your method

451
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:59,199
uncertainties is you know statistical

452
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:01,599
sampling generally when you get the

453
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,000
complaints it would be from a client who

454
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:06,819
sent one but one lab one but another lab

455
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,558
but there were two different samples so

456
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:11,799
you can't expect to get the same results

457
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:14,349
out of that even the spread of things

458
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:16,329
like mycotoxins or pesticides are not

459
00:20:14,349 --> 00:20:19,178
homogeneous throughout the plants if you

460
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:22,808
do apply them so it's really difficult

461
00:20:19,179 --> 00:20:25,509
to say that you know whether you can't

462
00:20:22,808 --> 00:20:26,619
compare apples to apples in this case so

463
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:29,379
I think it's important for labs to

464
00:20:26,619 --> 00:20:31,359
really work on not labs with industry

465
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:33,460
just think of statistical sampling

466
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,178
homogeneity well how does that play into

467
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:39,069
what values you get from the labs and

468
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:41,710
how are you really offering off that and

469
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:44,019
one way we see this difference is or one

470
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:46,360
group that does it well is let's say in

471
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:48,220
terms of the emerald testing running

472
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:49,928
that and sending to you know labs across

473
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:53,350
the nation and applying statistical

474
00:20:49,929 --> 00:20:55,900
analysis to the values that are reported

475
00:20:53,349 --> 00:20:58,329
what is the spread if we have a certain

476
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:01,750
margin a sample that sent through that

477
00:20:58,329 --> 00:21:03,759
would be the the factor to consider that

478
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:05,079
would be where to look how are the labs

479
00:21:03,759 --> 00:21:07,900
really different from each other apart

480
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:10,750
from their method uncertainties as

481
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,240
opposed to just a random you know sample

482
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:16,410
data client or somebody sent two

483
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,410
different samples to two different labs

484
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:22,290
obviously I agree with everything that

485
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:24,930
was said so you know collectively this

486
00:21:22,289 --> 00:21:27,690
is all called measurement uncertainty as

487
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:30,650
any set that's a term common in

488
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:34,170
analytical chemistry but not widely

489
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:37,920
understood by the regulator's and as any

490
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:39,660
said it is an ISO 17025 requirement now

491
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,150
to determine your measurement

492
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:45,450
uncertainty for every analyte you

493
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:48,870
measure in the lab and typically a

494
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:53,700
measurement uncertainty in our lab for a

495
00:21:48,869 --> 00:21:56,459
cannabinoids is six percent that's not

496
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:58,500
six points so it's not like twenty

497
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,690
percent versus twenty six percent its

498
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:07,440
0.06 of that twenty percent and and also

499
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:10,529
in analytical chemistry and a plus or

500
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,600
minus fifteen percent is pretty good so

501
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:16,170
if you are coming in with a thirty

502
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:19,559
percent THC a value that means you

503
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,600
should accept or expect a range of

504
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:25,019
twenty seven percent to thirty three

505
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:28,199
percent and in fact I have advocated

506
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:31,529
since day one and Nevada and I've

507
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:35,430
probably said it in Colorado is that we

508
00:22:31,529 --> 00:22:39,180
should be reporting ranges not an

509
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:41,880
absolute value because of all of the

510
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:44,430
kunal of the components that add up to

511
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:47,640
your measurement uncertainty and I would

512
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:49,769
also like to say that one of the biggest

513
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:54,180
contributors to the difference between

514
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:57,420
labs is which certified reference

515
00:22:54,180 --> 00:23:00,570
standards they're using a colleague of

516
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:04,550
mine Breanna Cassidy who's a lab

517
00:23:00,569 --> 00:23:07,829
director at CDX analytical and in

518
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:11,250
Massachusetts did a comparison of five

519
00:23:07,829 --> 00:23:13,619
different companies certified reference

520
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:17,940
standards for cannabinoids and she found

521
00:23:13,619 --> 00:23:21,329
a 17 percent difference so you can see

522
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:24,090
right there depending on which reference

523
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:26,269
standards your lab use this versus a one

524
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:28,878
you are comparing it to that

525
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:34,128
could could alone account for the

526
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:36,079
difference in the results so you all

527
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:38,538
touched on a very important thing and

528
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:42,168
it's statistics statistics can be used

529
00:23:38,538 --> 00:23:44,419
to kind of even out these results so I'm

530
00:23:42,169 --> 00:23:46,549
a lot of labs right now are reporting

531
00:23:44,419 --> 00:23:48,769
things as singular true values without

532
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:50,690
reporting that actual measurement

533
00:23:48,769 --> 00:23:52,969
uncertainty so what do you think it will

534
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,298
take for labs to actually report within

535
00:23:52,969 --> 00:23:58,759
a range rather than a single true value

536
00:23:55,298 --> 00:24:02,118
what it's going to take the regulator's

537
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:04,399
to allow that and it's going to take

538
00:24:02,118 --> 00:24:05,838
some public education to all of these

539
00:24:04,398 --> 00:24:07,939
clients that are getting the results

540
00:24:05,838 --> 00:24:10,578
that say okay what is this range mean

541
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:12,828
how do we interpret it why aren't we

542
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:14,058
doing a single number because when when

543
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:16,459
it comes down to it people are using

544
00:24:14,058 --> 00:24:17,989
this number to value the product and so

545
00:24:16,459 --> 00:24:20,209
they want to value it on a single number

546
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:22,038
because it's easy but unfortunately

547
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:23,538
things don't work that way it science

548
00:24:22,038 --> 00:24:26,209
doesn't work that way plants don't work

549
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:28,759
that way so we have to educate all of

550
00:24:26,209 --> 00:24:30,440
the the consumers as to okay well when

551
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:31,700
you have a range this is how you deal

552
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,048
with it this is you know it's it's

553
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,889
normal it's something that should be

554
00:24:33,048 --> 00:24:39,200
anticipated and you know you have to

555
00:24:36,888 --> 00:24:41,718
account for that saying twenty-five

556
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,578
percent versus twenty six percent is not

557
00:24:41,719 --> 00:24:45,078
significant in any of the context that

558
00:24:43,578 --> 00:24:47,450
we're talking about yet a lot of

559
00:24:45,078 --> 00:24:51,979
cultivators and dispensaries will use

560
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:55,940
this as a price breaking point you know

561
00:24:51,979 --> 00:24:58,219
luckily a lot of the industry on the

562
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,070
manufacturing side is moving towards GMP

563
00:24:58,219 --> 00:25:03,979
right and part of GMP is producing a

564
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:05,778
product to specifications specifications

565
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:08,450
obviously have a lower and an upper

566
00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:09,979
limit you know and so the concept of

567
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,399
these range is I think is going to

568
00:25:09,979 --> 00:25:14,778
become more and more comfortable on the

569
00:25:12,398 --> 00:25:17,088
manufacturing side making it more

570
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:20,868
acceptable for us to report it from the

571
00:25:17,088 --> 00:25:22,819
laboratory side so so luckily I think

572
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:25,069
over time this problem will probably

573
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:27,578
take care of itself but you know I agree

574
00:25:25,069 --> 00:25:31,428
that the regulator's have to be the one

575
00:25:27,578 --> 00:25:33,408
giving us the big initial push right

576
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:35,419
nothing more to I had essentially it

577
00:25:33,409 --> 00:25:37,969
will be up to the regulators because if

578
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:39,700
you look at it this way if my lab is

579
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:42,250
giving a certain value for so

580
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:44,380
crop and they additionally tested at lab

581
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,670
B with a higher value well the client

582
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,830
tends to go with that LabVIEW of a

583
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:50,590
certain higher percentage because well

584
00:25:47,829 --> 00:25:52,539
it's more value so until the regulator's

585
00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:54,689
can stop and ask for reporting in a

586
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:57,420
range based on your method uncertainties

587
00:25:54,690 --> 00:26:00,009
this will not change

588
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,720
another part another really important

589
00:26:00,009 --> 00:26:03,940
statistical thing that you brought up

590
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:06,880
Savino was kind of how things are

591
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,740
sampled before they get to the lab so I

592
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:11,260
know in California you were actually

593
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,539
required to send a sampler and they have

594
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:14,559
to follow that internal lab SOP and make

595
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,509
sure they get a statistically

596
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:18,279
representative sample but if you just

597
00:26:16,509 --> 00:26:19,930
have a client that's submitting one

598
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:21,970
sample and trying to do an entire

599
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,410
formulation on it what would you say to

600
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:25,240
them in order to get the best

601
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:26,740
statistically valid sample how would you

602
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:29,259
ask them to collect their sample before

603
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:31,569
it gets to your lab well if it's a

604
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:33,430
flower I would ask them to collect lots

605
00:26:31,569 --> 00:26:34,689
of different size buds from different

606
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:36,310
parts of the plan or if it's already

607
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:38,259
mixed up you know did select from

608
00:26:36,309 --> 00:26:41,259
different physical locations in the

609
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:42,849
batch if it were concentrated asked them

610
00:26:41,259 --> 00:26:44,740
to heat it up and try to mix it and

611
00:26:42,849 --> 00:26:47,379
homogenize it as much as possible same

612
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:48,880
with a liquid and sample from different

613
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,640
parts of that and and have them realize

614
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:55,510
hey this is as representative as samples

615
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:58,870
we can get but expected to vary by this

616
00:26:55,509 --> 00:27:01,390
much it may vary by 10 to 15% so when

617
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:04,000
making their formulations for edibles

618
00:27:01,390 --> 00:27:05,770
take that into account and not try to be

619
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,509
at the very edge of what's legally

620
00:27:05,769 --> 00:27:08,829
allowed of the 10 milligrams per edible

621
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:10,629
just realize hey there's a little bit of

622
00:27:08,829 --> 00:27:13,059
a swing if you try to make all of them

623
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:15,220
ten there's a possibility that one might

624
00:27:13,059 --> 00:27:17,470
come outside of an acceptable range and

625
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,089
I would try to work with them and do it

626
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:21,670
multiple times so that they really get

627
00:27:19,089 --> 00:27:23,199
used to how to sample and how to

628
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:25,180
properly submit them for testing and

629
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:27,850
then how to properly formulate their

630
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,759
final product yeah California has pretty

631
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:33,549
set rules for statistical sampling for

632
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:35,289
compliance but when it comes to R&amp;D you

633
00:27:33,549 --> 00:27:37,690
know it's up to the lab and generally

634
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:39,519
what we've seen is people make kilograms

635
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:42,250
of oil and they have in 15 different

636
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:46,269
jars but they will bring you you know or

637
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:48,670
a two gram sample - from one jar and

638
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:51,279
that's not representative of the whole

639
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:52,900
of the whole lot so we usually get to

640
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,480
each bottle Sam

641
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,860
from each bottle marginally and run that

642
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,660
because what has happened many times is

643
00:27:56,859 --> 00:28:00,579
you sample from one jar let's say for

644
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:03,220
contaminants it's you know

645
00:28:00,579 --> 00:28:04,689
clear clear of pesticides however

646
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,640
because you collected different

647
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:07,990
fractions through your run certain

648
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,850
fractions will have higher levels of

649
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,890
certain pesticide that you know was in

650
00:28:09,849 --> 00:28:13,769
the crop and now you've just completely

651
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,820
missed that and when it comes to

652
00:28:13,769 --> 00:28:18,519
compliance sampling now you're

653
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:22,119
statistically sampling it per California

654
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:24,819
rules of about 0.3% and now things pop

655
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:29,189
up that they miss in R and B because

656
00:28:24,819 --> 00:28:29,189
they did not sample Rd representatively

657
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:36,490
and in Nevada the regulator's tell us

658
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:39,700
what we can take which is 12 grams per

659
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:42,220
every 5 pounds of the labs do go out and

660
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:45,519
do this collect the samples themselves

661
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:49,210
but at the site we are supposed to just

662
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:53,319
take one gram from 5 pounds and that is

663
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:56,200
what is analyzed for micro so you know

664
00:28:53,319 --> 00:29:00,939
it's it's very arbitrary how that came

665
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:04,059
up was based on some sampling document

666
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:08,049
that somebody read about how they sample

667
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:10,179
you know pill manufacturers but actually

668
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:12,159
we need here from Colorado because I

669
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:15,279
think Colorado finally came up with a

670
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:19,509
good sampling strategy they did so we

671
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:21,879
have not man mandatory sampling so I as

672
00:29:19,509 --> 00:29:23,349
the laboratory and almost never go out

673
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,840
into the field and do the sampling it's

674
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:27,639
all in the manufacturers in fact if I

675
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:30,549
offer to go do the sampling I've never

676
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:32,009
never been taken up on it yet so the

677
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:34,599
samples that we get are pretty

678
00:29:32,009 --> 00:29:37,289
interesting in Colorado there are some

679
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:40,419
sampling SOPs that are pretty fantastic

680
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:42,549
where you take twenty nine half gram

681
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:45,820
samples from different points around the

682
00:29:42,549 --> 00:29:48,579
harvest if it's a flower harvest or

683
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:51,730
similar statistical methods for

684
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:54,699
concentrates but you know almost nobody

685
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,200
adheres to those SOPs right now so I'll

686
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:59,710
still get my

687
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,750
one very nice green flower for potency

688
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,049
and my one very nice brown flower for

689
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:05,190
microbial testing

690
00:30:03,049 --> 00:30:07,779
[Music]

691
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:09,670
so kind of pivoting a little bit I just

692
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:11,230
want to bring us back to one of the core

693
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,529
tenets of good science and that's

694
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:16,179
collaboration obviously to do good

695
00:30:14,529 --> 00:30:17,589
science you can either collaborate with

696
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:19,120
different minds different viewpoints

697
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:21,039
kind of see problems from different

698
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:23,259
perspectives and come together for a

699
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,759
certain solution but in the lab testing

700
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:26,980
industry it's a little bit hard to do

701
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:28,179
that a because you can't ship samples

702
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:30,610
across state lines because it's

703
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:32,290
federally legal be because we're

704
00:30:30,609 --> 00:30:34,119
actually in competition with each other

705
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:36,428
rather than kind of on the same side

706
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:37,899
from a business perspective that's kind

707
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:39,580
of in contrast with the spirit of

708
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,919
science but I think there are

709
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:43,569
opportunities for labs to collaborate I

710
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,910
think a lot of labs just don't know

711
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:48,460
about them so are there any ways in

712
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,290
which you think that collaboration would

713
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:53,710
both help your business and help your

714
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:56,349
science well I think collaboration would

715
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:59,200
absolutely help in a lot of ways one of

716
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:01,209
them is being able to share data about

717
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,308
contamination be able to share data

718
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,350
about some of the interferences that

719
00:31:03,308 --> 00:31:08,279
different instruments have with with

720
00:31:05,349 --> 00:31:10,990
cannabis so trying to find one pesticide

721
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:12,279
in particular cannabis strains with

722
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,109
different instrumentation I think it

723
00:31:12,279 --> 00:31:15,609
would be really beneficial for some of

724
00:31:14,109 --> 00:31:17,379
these laboratories to share and avoid

725
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:23,500
getting false positives or false

726
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:26,500
negatives and as well sharing a chemical

727
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:29,230
profile data terpenes cannabinoids and

728
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,369
whatever because really if these if

729
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,410
we're really gonna understand this plan

730
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:35,319
we definitely need to look at this data

731
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,390
in a big aggregated way and no one

732
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,519
laboratory has enough data to really

733
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:42,790
make a significant set to really tell us

734
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,558
something about the plant so alone these

735
00:31:42,789 --> 00:31:47,079
datasets aren't worth very much but

736
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:48,250
combined I think they they can do a lot

737
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:51,039
so we need to figure out a way to

738
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:53,349
incentivize laboratories to share data

739
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,009
and then share in whatever profits

740
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:59,740
couldn't possibly come from that data we

741
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:02,500
have 11 the numbers always fluctuating

742
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:05,200
but we have 11 laboratories performing

743
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,180
testing in Colorado at any time

744
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,910
we have formed a nonprofit organization

745
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:13,060
actually called the Colorado Lab Council

746
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:14,769
where all of the labs meet usually on a

747
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:17,619
monthly basis to discuss some of these

748
00:32:14,769 --> 00:32:21,129
issues and so that's one way that we've

749
00:32:17,619 --> 00:32:23,369
kind of organized a way that we can chat

750
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,560
and keep the lines of communication open

751
00:32:23,369 --> 00:32:28,839
but you know I personally don't believe

752
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:31,359
that you know I'm in competition with

753
00:32:28,839 --> 00:32:34,299
most of the labs out there right I need

754
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:37,179
them to exist myself right I couldn't do

755
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:39,009
it alone what I'm in competition with is

756
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:42,690
actually just bad science right and and

757
00:32:39,009 --> 00:32:45,339
so we've asked a lot of our competitors

758
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:49,960
to actually come into our lab into our

759
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:51,819
laboratory in in you know and ask to do

760
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,000
the same of their laboratories and so

761
00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:57,399
far only four of the other laboratories

762
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,769
have taken us up on that but you know

763
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,480
four is a lot better than zero right so

764
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,660
slowly we're changing I think the

765
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,569
perception of collaboration and and

766
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,279
transparency in the state yeah

767
00:33:07,569 --> 00:33:11,139
collaboration is very important I mean a

768
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:15,250
prime example is a heavy metals talk

769
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:17,080
that we just did with Kyle can a safe

770
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:18,970
kind of writes itself and is wanting to

771
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:21,519
do more of that in the future

772
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,920
collaborate with not just other labs but

773
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,289
other scientific minds and I think it's

774
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:28,750
important however there's a few things

775
00:33:26,289 --> 00:33:33,250
that kind of prevents you know data

776
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:35,500
sharing or analysis of data regulations

777
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:38,819
from the different states for instance

778
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:42,430
if we want to interpret cannabinoid data

779
00:33:38,819 --> 00:33:45,069
California requires moisture to test be

780
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:46,630
added so values are seemingly higher

781
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:48,700
than maybe Nevada that doesn't add

782
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:51,760
moisture or terpenes or using different

783
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,130
instrumentation I think until we kind of

784
00:33:51,759 --> 00:33:56,589
get to either a compendium method or are

785
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,460
more open with our methodology it'll be

786
00:33:56,589 --> 00:34:02,799
harder to evaluate that data accordingly

787
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:04,720
because of minor differences but it

788
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,059
isn't very important in the scientific

789
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,889
industry obviously to share data what

790
00:34:07,059 --> 00:34:11,710
that data has to be accurate and

791
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:13,719
reproducible and I might say that that

792
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,340
method method standardization helps that

793
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,378
a lot so as our methods become more

794
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,818
standardized

795
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:19,739
we're actually able to share that data

796
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:22,139
because we're not trying to project an

797
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:24,568
IP of a method where our IP is in the

798
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:26,399
rest of this laboratory and yeah that's

799
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:28,710
true that's true actually one thing we

800
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,868
usually encourage your clients if they

801
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:32,309
disagree with the data that I produce I

802
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:35,220
encourage them to send it to another

803
00:34:32,309 --> 00:34:38,429
accredited lab that I you know sir

804
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:40,138
trustworthy we've compared our values

805
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:41,970
are we looking at the same lob that look

806
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,999
use instrumentation similar methodology

807
00:34:41,969 --> 00:34:46,918
similar I ask my clients to actually do

808
00:34:44,998 --> 00:34:48,738
that and I think you know that's a way

809
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:52,048
to kind of bridge start to collaborate

810
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:54,239
slowly and start you know some somebody

811
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,798
new one said it's a co-op position and I

812
00:34:54,239 --> 00:35:00,690
think you know it's a very important

813
00:34:55,798 --> 00:35:02,880
phrase for sure the flap business

814
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:06,059
depending on where you're located can be

815
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,298
very cutthroat and very competitive but

816
00:35:06,059 --> 00:35:12,900
I've been able to find collaborators

817
00:35:09,298 --> 00:35:15,268
across the country and I feel like I

818
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:17,818
have a very rich experience because I

819
00:35:15,268 --> 00:35:21,659
have other lab directors that I can call

820
00:35:17,818 --> 00:35:24,719
up and and discuss certain issues for

821
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:27,149
example getting in a new edible every

822
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:30,869
edible we get in it's like a mini

823
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:33,838
research project we have to first pry

824
00:35:30,869 --> 00:35:35,759
out of the producer what they use to

825
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,578
make it and then we basically have to

826
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:40,440
deconstruct it and try and extract the

827
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:45,210
cannabinoids and terpenoids

828
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,729
that they expect to see so I think it's

829
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:51,690
changing I think you know the lab

830
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:53,968
business is not the segment of the

831
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,920
industry to be in if you're looking to

832
00:35:53,969 --> 00:35:58,229
make a lot of money because it's it's

833
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,039
just not happening in the lab business

834
00:35:58,228 --> 00:36:05,489
so I think because of that and the we're

835
00:36:02,039 --> 00:36:07,680
getting a higher quality scientists

836
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:11,130
involved so scientists are just

837
00:36:07,679 --> 00:36:13,199
naturally curious and they do like to

838
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:16,528
collaborate because science is a layer

839
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:19,739
cake and all of these different analytes

840
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:21,509
we've had to develop methods for it

841
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:25,139
works much better if you have

842
00:36:21,509 --> 00:36:28,420
collaborators to discuss it with

843
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:29,858
yeah so from a research standpoint you

844
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,139
guys are actually in a unique position

845
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:33,818
because if you're doing a federally

846
00:36:32,139 --> 00:36:36,159
sanctioned study and you can only get

847
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:37,778
raw materials from one source but you

848
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:39,179
guys are actually getting things from

849
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:42,179
your state that are hitting the shelves

850
00:36:39,179 --> 00:36:44,259
really high quality products and

851
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:47,469
presumably clean if they're actually

852
00:36:44,259 --> 00:36:50,170
hitting the shelves so do you think the

853
00:36:47,469 --> 00:36:52,959
labs have a certain kind of a advantage

854
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:56,829
in having in ways they can research

855
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,389
novel ideas and new products just

856
00:36:56,829 --> 00:37:01,298
because you're getting so much of these

857
00:36:58,389 --> 00:37:03,518
into your labs for example any you're

858
00:37:01,298 --> 00:37:05,940
doing the research on heavy metals and

859
00:37:03,518 --> 00:37:08,318
big it's a really great pilot study and

860
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,690
how would you say to other labs to

861
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:15,219
encourage them to do things similar to

862
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:17,139
that um honestly getting beyond simply

863
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:20,169
being there to make money

864
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:22,118
you have to generally are sciences are

865
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,489
here for the science you know making

866
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:27,130
money it's a bonus so we have to get

867
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:28,960
away from that mindset it's cannabis and

868
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,910
maybe we don't care or maybe we're here

869
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,999
to make money but that's not the case

870
00:37:30,909 --> 00:37:36,219
in my lab we generally we genuinely care

871
00:37:33,998 --> 00:37:37,748
and we have fun while doing it if you

872
00:37:36,219 --> 00:37:40,028
ever look at an Instagram post we have a

873
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:42,159
lot of fun but we care about the

874
00:37:40,028 --> 00:37:46,179
consumers in the industry and you know

875
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:48,399
the collaboration it I had the idea but

876
00:37:46,179 --> 00:37:50,949
I give credit to Kyle and Robert who

877
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,869
came to me with what they wanted to do

878
00:37:50,949 --> 00:37:54,939
and then we collaborated so it's being

879
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:56,499
open to people that are contacting you

880
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,639
or seeing what's out there what is a

881
00:37:56,498 --> 00:38:00,608
consumer safety risk

882
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:03,338
what can you study that would make a

883
00:38:00,608 --> 00:38:05,259
difference and I think the data that we

884
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:07,028
collect in the lab kind of gives you an

885
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:09,039
indication of what you can pursue next

886
00:38:07,028 --> 00:38:11,949
we were getting in a lot of vape cart

887
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:13,509
failures in heaven metals so while

888
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:14,889
something had to be done start studying

889
00:38:13,509 --> 00:38:17,199
what's going on with these vape cards

890
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:18,608
why are they failing so you know ideas

891
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:20,798
like that come up and you kind of pursue

892
00:38:18,608 --> 00:38:24,608
it and find some other brilliant minds

893
00:38:20,798 --> 00:38:25,659
to collaborate with yeah I would say you

894
00:38:24,608 --> 00:38:27,639
know we've never had the thought of

895
00:38:25,659 --> 00:38:30,190
competing with manufacturers right but

896
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:32,949
our goal is more to assist the

897
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:34,838
regulators right we have a pretty

898
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:36,069
limited list of solvents that we test

899
00:38:34,838 --> 00:38:38,769
for in Colorado

900
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:41,080
but you know analytically it's not it

901
00:38:38,769 --> 00:38:43,719
not much of a challenge to look a little

902
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:45,909
bit deeper right so part of the value in

903
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:47,379
our data set is actually providing that

904
00:38:45,909 --> 00:38:49,539
for the regulators and saying you know

905
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:51,010
hey maybe Athol acetate is something we

906
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:53,710
want to add to the list we're seeing it

907
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:56,890
so often and at such concentrations that

908
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:58,300
it may be worthwhile or maybe there's

909
00:38:56,889 --> 00:39:00,879
another solvent that we want to take off

910
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:02,440
the list because we never see it so we

911
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:05,440
see our data set as being a little more

912
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,240
valuable in that manner that we can kind

913
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,730
of drive public health in the direction

914
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:12,429
that we want to see it go and I just

915
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:14,590
want to add to that that most analytical

916
00:39:12,429 --> 00:39:17,440
laboratories are their main business is

917
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:19,390
the product analysis and so the time and

918
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:22,539
money to do any kind of outside research

919
00:39:19,389 --> 00:39:23,949
is very limited and so we cannot get to

920
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:26,590
the extent that you would see at a

921
00:39:23,949 --> 00:39:28,359
university or anything that had outside

922
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:30,070
funding for their research specifically

923
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,780
usually the chemists are trying to do

924
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:34,300
this in-between trying to handle their

925
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:37,960
clients and other samples so I think

926
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:40,269
that as the industry matures as a

927
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,940
competition kind of falls out and the

928
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:44,139
main laboratory players survive they'll

929
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:46,570
have a little bit more time and

930
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:48,309
resources to dedicate to this research

931
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:52,809
and I think we'll see more and more of

932
00:39:48,309 --> 00:39:55,840
that as as time goes on yeah and I will

933
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:59,259
just say that having the ability to

934
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:01,720
conduct Rd Studies for our clients and

935
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:04,720
things of interest to us is is really

936
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:08,379
what makes it palatable and the fact

937
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:11,559
that Nevada does let us use our retained

938
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:15,250
product for our indeed that's a

939
00:40:11,559 --> 00:40:18,309
legitimate use of it so that is one tiny

940
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:20,949
sliver of brightness in this industry

941
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:24,309
and I can tell you there are endless

942
00:40:20,949 --> 00:40:27,960
number of experiments that could be done

943
00:40:24,309 --> 00:40:30,130
it's so so that's exciting

944
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm something that's just on their

945
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:35,829
horizon is a hemp testing so it's kind

946
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,769
of like what the cannabis industry we

947
00:40:35,829 --> 00:40:40,449
hope will become in the future so right

948
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:43,329
now the big kind of a testing

949
00:40:40,449 --> 00:40:45,250
consideration for hemp is that the plant

950
00:40:43,329 --> 00:40:48,690
material itself has to have less than

951
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:50,250
0.3 percent THC on a dry weight basis

952
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:53,280
and this is actually way more

953
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:55,010
complicated than people think it is so

954
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,390
what kind of like technical

955
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:59,329
considerations do you undertake when

956
00:40:57,389 --> 00:41:02,639
you're testing have persons cannabis

957
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:04,440
well it's pretty much the same methods

958
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,480
as you would test regular cannabis

959
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:08,940
flower you'd make some alterations to

960
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:11,280
the sample prep and and that's about it

961
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,858
but they're very minor what the the big

962
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,890
issue becomes is that these regulations

963
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:19,048
and they say 0.3 percent THC these were

964
00:41:16,889 --> 00:41:21,568
set years ago when gas chromatography

965
00:41:19,048 --> 00:41:22,798
was the standard and so now that the

966
00:41:21,568 --> 00:41:24,960
industry has evolved over the last

967
00:41:22,798 --> 00:41:26,159
thirty years we need to go back and look

968
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,920
at those and say alright does that mean

969
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:32,519
just 0.3 percent THC or is that combined

970
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:34,460
THC THC a and I think that's how a lot

971
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:38,369
of people go about it just to be careful

972
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:40,500
but we really need to get clarification

973
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:43,829
and updates on those regulations to know

974
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,909
exactly how we should go about it so

975
00:41:43,829 --> 00:41:51,750
this is a special topic for me I'm

976
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:55,379
strongly advocating for the ability to

977
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:59,039
use molecular genetic screening to

978
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:04,769
distinguish industrial hemp from resin

979
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:07,349
CBD hemp and drug type THC cannabis

980
00:42:04,769 --> 00:42:10,679
because what we've shown we've actually

981
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:13,470
developed a a molecular assay called

982
00:42:10,679 --> 00:42:16,949
true hemp ID it's based on two genes

983
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:20,189
snips that can make this distinction

984
00:42:16,949 --> 00:42:23,129
across these three groups we've tested

985
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:25,789
over 500 samples and we have shown that

986
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:32,940
what is being grown in the US right now

987
00:42:25,789 --> 00:42:39,500
that 68% of it is over 0.3% THC and the

988
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:42,389
definition from the 2018 farm bill is is

989
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:50,849
decarboxylated THC were so we're talking

990
00:42:42,389 --> 00:42:53,848
about Delta 9 plus 0.8 7% of THC a-and

991
00:42:50,849 --> 00:42:55,859
and that is really shocking I mean you

992
00:42:53,849 --> 00:42:58,289
don't have to be an expert you can drive

993
00:42:55,858 --> 00:43:02,340
down the road at 35 miles an hour and

994
00:42:58,289 --> 00:43:03,900
you can tell that is resin CBD hemp

995
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,570
because they look like little Christmas

996
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,510
trees they basically look like marijuana

997
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:13,890
and it's not industrial hemp which is

998
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:16,320
more like an erect stock so I think this

999
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:20,789
is a critical issue for that for the

1000
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:24,750
hemp industry is that we get some levy

1001
00:43:20,789 --> 00:43:25,469
ation from that strict 0.3% cutoff for

1002
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:28,440
THC

1003
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:32,099
we actually are seen that a much more

1004
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:36,450
reasonable cutoff is 1% and the state of

1005
00:43:32,099 --> 00:43:38,789
Vermont has already adopted the ability

1006
00:43:36,449 --> 00:43:41,579
to use genetic screening as well and

1007
00:43:38,789 --> 00:43:43,650
we're just hoping that the federal USDA

1008
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:46,590
when they release their regulations will

1009
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:48,630
provide that alternative you know that's

1010
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:52,050
a very good point because from the

1011
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:53,910
testing we've done if you take a look if

1012
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:54,600
you have dried flower of this so-called

1013
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:58,109
hemp

1014
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:01,170
most of them are over 0.3% when it's

1015
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:02,970
dried and ready for consumption now in

1016
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,400
the CDP H Department of Public Health

1017
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:07,289
California said specific set of rules on

1018
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:08,880
how to test hemp here and matter of fact

1019
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:10,529
can't say if it's been testing a whole

1020
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,490
lot of compliance hemp lately from the

1021
00:44:10,530 --> 00:44:16,500
farms here and it's easier to be less

1022
00:44:14,489 --> 00:44:18,899
than 0.3% when you're taking into

1023
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:21,329
account the whole plant mass so the CA B

1024
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,090
pH says okay you have to dry this hemp

1025
00:44:21,329 --> 00:44:28,079
before testing to a certain consistency

1026
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:29,519
till the mass stops changing essentially

1027
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,170
and follow through the certain

1028
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:33,030
procedures but when you take the whole

1029
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,980
plant mass with the stems and everything

1030
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:36,690
on the leaves and test it generally yeah

1031
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:39,300
you'll be perfectly fine with a less

1032
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:41,070
than 0.3 percent THC however you get a

1033
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:44,100
dried but

1034
00:44:41,070 --> 00:44:46,170
trimmed maybe for smoking or whatever

1035
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:49,170
and you will find that it will be over

1036
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:51,059
0.3 percent THC so how do we deal with

1037
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,769
this arbitrary number I think you know

1038
00:44:51,059 --> 00:44:54,480
it's still a challenge and and that

1039
00:44:52,769 --> 00:44:56,610
reflects the older methodology that they

1040
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,469
used to use for testing cannabis that

1041
00:44:56,610 --> 00:44:59,940
was seized by law enforcement they used

1042
00:44:58,469 --> 00:45:01,379
to just put the stems and seeds and

1043
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,880
everything together grind it up if you

1044
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,340
look at a lot of an item methods from

1045
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,720
90s and 2000 they just ground everything

1046
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:08,789
up together which is not how anybody

1047
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:10,230
consumes it anymore right exactly and

1048
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,190
that's what we've been seeing and so

1049
00:45:10,230 --> 00:45:14,740
when you get that value and

1050
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:17,500
testing by HPLC represent that acidic

1051
00:45:14,739 --> 00:45:19,839
molecule and you know you'll have people

1052
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:21,670
asking well can you write by GC well

1053
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,900
generally people are not using GC

1054
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:25,389
because you want to see the full profile

1055
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:26,980
of the plant but it can't be done but

1056
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:29,049
you know it goes into what you were

1057
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:30,760
saying before when you do use GC and

1058
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,260
grind everything up you know there's

1059
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:34,330
other considerations as to whether

1060
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:37,750
you're actually accurately quantifying

1061
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:39,639
that THC with your GC and lead and the

1062
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:41,619
rotation whatever you gotta do and your

1063
00:45:39,639 --> 00:45:44,710
results are much less efficient than the

1064
00:45:41,619 --> 00:45:48,519
0.87 times th CA that they recommend of

1065
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:50,740
lines up being more like 0.5 yep so we

1066
00:45:48,519 --> 00:45:52,509
got time for I think one last question

1067
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:54,819
this is something I personally wondered

1068
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:56,800
what do you guys think is the most

1069
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:58,809
technically challenging part of cannabis

1070
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:01,830
testing and what do you think the

1071
00:45:58,809 --> 00:46:04,360
greatest demand for good scientists lies

1072
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:06,159
in the States I've worked no doubt the

1073
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:08,079
most technically challenging are the

1074
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:09,989
pesticides because basically you're

1075
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:14,199
looking for contamination that is a

1076
00:46:09,989 --> 00:46:16,299
similar molecular weight to the actual

1077
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:18,819
main ingredients and so you're looking

1078
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:22,030
for something in the parts per billion

1079
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,590
range in noise that is in that is way

1080
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,080
way higher thousands and thousands of

1081
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:27,610
times higher than that and so that that

1082
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,599
becomes a bit of a challenge and it's

1083
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:32,500
been a challenge in a lot of different

1084
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:34,360
states they set these pesticide levels

1085
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:36,429
really really low before actually

1086
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:38,140
testing to see whether they are actually

1087
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:39,639
possible with instrumentation that's

1088
00:46:38,139 --> 00:46:42,460
currently available and we've seen this

1089
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:44,289
in Nevada as well they took captain off

1090
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,360
the list because the state lab wasn't

1091
00:46:44,289 --> 00:46:48,070
able to see it consistently down to the

1092
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:50,559
level at which they demanded everybody

1093
00:46:48,070 --> 00:46:52,000
else do it for the last three years so

1094
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,519
there's a lot of learning there and I

1095
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:56,280
think to me pesticides is the most

1096
00:46:54,519 --> 00:46:58,090
challenging requires the most expensive

1097
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,070
instrumentation the most extensive

1098
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,050
instrumentation and I think the most

1099
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,539
sample prep and then these guys could

1100
00:47:02,050 --> 00:47:06,300
probably comment on that as well yeah I

1101
00:47:04,539 --> 00:47:08,829
think you know the battle between

1102
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:11,019
wanting to look as low as we can

1103
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:12,400
possibly look for for public health

1104
00:47:11,019 --> 00:47:14,590
versus achieving that in the

1105
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:18,730
laboratories you know never gonna go

1106
00:47:14,590 --> 00:47:20,250
away but I would think you know in terms

1107
00:47:18,730 --> 00:47:22,240
of someone who I want on my team

1108
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:23,239
communication to the industry is one of

1109
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:26,929
the most important thing

1110
00:47:23,239 --> 00:47:28,639
right oftentimes in a competitive place

1111
00:47:26,929 --> 00:47:29,929
if you fail somebody they're gonna go

1112
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:32,210
somewhere else where they don't get a

1113
00:47:29,929 --> 00:47:34,099
fail right so communicating that that's

1114
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:35,929
not a fail that's an opportunity to

1115
00:47:34,099 --> 00:47:38,239
improve on their manufacturing process

1116
00:47:35,929 --> 00:47:41,529
is a delicate one in something that's

1117
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:43,609
not inherent to a lot of scientists so

1118
00:47:41,530 --> 00:47:47,930
definitely something that we try and be

1119
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:50,750
really sensitive about I think it's any

1120
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:53,750
kind of touch it in earlier it is the

1121
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:55,849
various matrices that you get in every

1122
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:57,590
time you know I never cease to be

1123
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:59,059
surprised in this industry and it's it

1124
00:47:57,590 --> 00:48:02,360
is truly a little science project each

1125
00:47:59,059 --> 00:48:04,759
time a week ago we got a candle and

1126
00:48:02,360 --> 00:48:07,070
infused with CBD so imagine a candle

1127
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:08,570
infused with CBD now how are you really

1128
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,340
receiving the benefits but that's beside

1129
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:13,460
the point

1130
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:16,190
but then testing elucidating the CBD

1131
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:18,650
from this candle and all this there's

1132
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:21,079
all sorts of excipient source all sorts

1133
00:48:18,650 --> 00:48:23,300
of matrix interferences so we have to go

1134
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:26,150
in on low science project you know bring

1135
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:29,720
out the chemistry bird go back into how

1136
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:31,309
can I extract my CBD in the midst of all

1137
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:33,829
this interferences with compounds that

1138
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:36,650
are eluding at same retention time same

1139
00:48:33,829 --> 00:48:38,299
similar structures conflating results I

1140
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:40,970
mean we see everything from that

1141
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:44,510
toothpick suppository

1142
00:48:40,969 --> 00:48:46,549
you know gels just name it there I never

1143
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:47,630
seems to be surprised so it actually is

1144
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,760
what keeps this industry and it's

1145
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:52,160
exciting for me because never know what

1146
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,710
you're gonna get in the door that day so

1147
00:48:52,159 --> 00:48:57,039
that is a challenge on its own and it's

1148
00:48:54,710 --> 00:48:59,530
up to the most reputable labs or

1149
00:48:57,039 --> 00:49:03,500
thoroughly vetted labs to be able to

1150
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:05,750
accurately extract and analyze these

1151
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,039
compounds in these various matrices and

1152
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:09,710
that could lead to having you know

1153
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,779
hundreds of SOPs depending on you know

1154
00:49:09,710 --> 00:49:14,300
what you get in the door water is

1155
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:17,410
another big one not only are they

1156
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,070
infusing water but it's being

1157
00:49:17,409 --> 00:49:20,750
encapsulated so there are certain

1158
00:49:19,070 --> 00:49:22,220
encapsulations that you have to break

1159
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:24,739
membranes to be able to get at the

1160
00:49:22,219 --> 00:49:27,319
molecule or even concentrate down you

1161
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:29,358
imagine a 8 ounce or 16 ounce bottle of

1162
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:31,250
water and there's five milligrams of CBD

1163
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:33,319
in there and so somehow you have to

1164
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,239
concentrate that extracts from the

1165
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,088
membrane

1166
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:39,519
and report accurately so some of the

1167
00:49:37,088 --> 00:49:44,799
challenges remains but you know that's

1168
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:47,230
what makes this work fun I agree with

1169
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:52,150
all the comments I'm not sure I even

1170
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:53,710
remember the question but there are a

1171
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:58,630
lot of challenging things in this

1172
00:49:53,710 --> 00:50:01,210
industry and you know when when a state

1173
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:02,950
comes up with the list of pestis so on

1174
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:04,869
the issue of pesticides they come up

1175
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:07,629
with the list of pesticides these are

1176
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:09,760
the pesticides the lab is gonna spring

1177
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,550
for so great I won't use those

1178
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:16,480
pesticides you know there's a hundred or

1179
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:19,210
200 other ones so the pesticide game is

1180
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:22,210
a big issue and in nevada we're also

1181
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:24,789
actually instructed if we see another

1182
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:27,309
pesticide not on the list that we're

1183
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:30,309
supposed to say hey you know we saw this

1184
00:50:27,309 --> 00:50:34,079
and in fact we do and it's actually for

1185
00:50:30,309 --> 00:50:38,199
me it's really disappointing at the

1186
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,480
human level that growers are willing to

1187
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:43,598
use these pesticides that we know there

1188
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:46,150
are neurotoxins we know that no one

1189
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,730
should be inhaling them and we see them

1190
00:50:46,150 --> 00:50:52,630
pop up so that's one thing that's really

1191
00:50:48,730 --> 00:50:54,460
annoying that and disappointing it's

1192
00:50:52,630 --> 00:50:56,710
annoying and it's disappointing this

1193
00:50:54,460 --> 00:51:00,519
game that's being played with regard to

1194
00:50:56,710 --> 00:51:04,869
pesticides the other thing is because

1195
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:10,119
the value of cannabis is based on its

1196
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:14,380
THC content if a grower at some point

1197
00:51:10,119 --> 00:51:17,920
got a 30% THC a and we come back with 28

1198
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,670
he will go lab shopping to get to your

1199
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:20,889
point

1200
00:51:18,670 --> 00:51:23,320
Stephen you'll go lap shopping and he'll

1201
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:26,679
find a lab that will give him what value

1202
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:29,530
he wants because the frailty of human

1203
00:51:26,679 --> 00:51:32,649
nature we see the same spectrum of

1204
00:51:29,530 --> 00:51:36,430
personalities existing within the

1205
00:51:32,650 --> 00:51:38,079
cannabis testing space as well yeah it's

1206
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:39,789
a really interesting phenomenon it's

1207
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:41,289
like you go to a doctor and he tells you

1208
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:42,699
you have a disease and you're like I'll

1209
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:44,139
just go to a different doctor it tells

1210
00:51:42,699 --> 00:51:46,210
me I don't have it

1211
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:48,190
well it's just very strange but anyway

1212
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:50,220
so we're short on time I like to leave

1213
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:52,360
the rest of the time we have to open up

1214
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:53,709
questions for the panelists so if you

1215
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,809
want to make your way to the microphone

1216
00:51:53,710 --> 00:52:03,909
please do but in the meantime let's give

1217
00:51:55,809 --> 00:52:06,730
our panelists a round of applause first

1218
00:52:03,909 --> 00:52:10,179
one up good morning thank you through

1219
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:12,190
this wonderful panel so you've been

1220
00:52:10,179 --> 00:52:15,039
talking a lot the title of this panel is

1221
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,389
the future of cannabis testing and we've

1222
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,940
talked a lot about measurement

1223
00:52:16,389 --> 00:52:22,629
uncertainty and different matrix types

1224
00:52:18,940 --> 00:52:24,700
I was curious what you think about what

1225
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:26,980
Labs might look like in over the next 10

1226
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:29,259
years do you think Labs will start to

1227
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:31,449
specialize you know I could easily see a

1228
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,490
lab that only does flour and concentrate

1229
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:35,919
and then a lab maybe that's also

1230
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:37,779
registered with the FDA later testing

1231
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:39,700
mostly edible products could could you

1232
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:41,400
speak about how you see cannabis testing

1233
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:43,779
evolving over the next five to ten years

1234
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,460
well in every other industry you would

1235
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:47,769
see labs specializing you'd see a lab

1236
00:52:45,460 --> 00:52:49,690
specializing and doing pesticide testing

1237
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:52,150
you'd see a lab specializing and doing

1238
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,769
this and that and and if you submit your

1239
00:52:52,150 --> 00:52:55,059
stuff to a lab they could sub out to

1240
00:52:53,769 --> 00:52:57,579
other laboratories that's how you would

1241
00:52:55,059 --> 00:52:59,920
see it in environmental testing a lot a

1242
00:52:57,579 --> 00:53:01,960
lot of states especially California has

1243
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:03,490
specifically prohibited that but I think

1244
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:05,050
we'll see over the years that's starting

1245
00:53:03,489 --> 00:53:08,679
to change and having it start to mimic

1246
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:10,960
what we see in other industries for sure

1247
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:12,309
in a lot of the ways labs can

1248
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,490
distinguish themselves is by offering

1249
00:53:12,309 --> 00:53:16,329
other value-added tests and so I think

1250
00:53:15,489 --> 00:53:18,069
you'll start to see a lot of

1251
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:20,049
diversification that way you know some

1252
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:22,450
labs that will do lipid omics some labs

1253
00:53:20,050 --> 00:53:24,519
that will do full smoke and vapor

1254
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:27,549
testing and everything down the line

1255
00:53:24,519 --> 00:53:30,099
there most definitely once it becomes

1256
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:32,289
federal legal it essentially will be

1257
00:53:30,099 --> 00:53:33,969
necessary it's there's really no other

1258
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,469
industry where you're forced to use all

1259
00:53:33,969 --> 00:53:37,359
this different instrumentation in one

1260
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:42,730
space and still report those results

1261
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:45,490
within two days it'll change I think

1262
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:47,980
we'll see centralized lab testing

1263
00:53:45,489 --> 00:53:50,779
because the way it's set up now it's

1264
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:52,789
it's really rather absurd that

1265
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:54,710
at a minimum you need two million

1266
00:53:52,789 --> 00:53:57,289
dollars just for the basic

1267
00:53:54,710 --> 00:54:00,099
instrumentation the spectrum of tests

1268
00:53:57,289 --> 00:54:04,880
that have to be carried out is extreme

1269
00:54:00,099 --> 00:54:09,440
so centralized testing I think will also

1270
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:11,059
see an expansion of genotyping testing I

1271
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:15,460
mean a digit path we do a lot of

1272
00:54:11,059 --> 00:54:21,139
genotyping we do snip analysis so as

1273
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:23,480
growers want to protect their IEP or or

1274
00:54:21,139 --> 00:54:25,569
defend the fact that it's really is blue

1275
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:33,710
dream there will be more mandatory

1276
00:54:25,570 --> 00:54:35,210
mandatory genotyping I believe thanks hi

1277
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:38,059
my name is Garrett two quick questions

1278
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:41,090
in the state of California specifically

1279
00:54:38,059 --> 00:54:44,690
it's based in the BCC that we have to

1280
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:49,550
take up to 32 increments whenever you're

1281
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:53,240
sampling a batch large batch of flour up

1282
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:55,550
to 50 pounds realistically are you going

1283
00:54:53,239 --> 00:54:57,319
of looking at this 50-pound batch after

1284
00:54:55,550 --> 00:55:00,050
you confirm that it is indeed 50 pounds

1285
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:02,870
and taking 32 increments where we have

1286
00:55:00,050 --> 00:55:05,660
this competition between labs that you

1287
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:08,449
like you only only see them taking 11

1288
00:55:05,659 --> 00:55:12,829
grams to 13 grams in order to complete a

1289
00:55:08,449 --> 00:55:14,929
full panel well you do have to take

1290
00:55:12,829 --> 00:55:16,819
those increments and we actually do and

1291
00:55:14,929 --> 00:55:19,009
you know a lab should be recording those

1292
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:21,260
increments now you you're not

1293
00:55:19,010 --> 00:55:22,940
necessarily going to wait there 50

1294
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:26,000
pounds because you're not carrying that

1295
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:28,099
scale so you have to rely on the track

1296
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,719
and trace system such as metric that you

1297
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:32,179
know they are following those rules we

1298
00:55:29,719 --> 00:55:33,919
can't police all of that but you have to

1299
00:55:32,179 --> 00:55:37,190
take those increments and you really

1300
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,920
need that mass based on what the BCC is

1301
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:41,630
now required half gram minimum sample

1302
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,099
mass for each analytical test you'll

1303
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:44,570
find that you'll quickly run out of that

1304
00:55:43,099 --> 00:55:47,989
half man especially if you have to do

1305
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:49,880
replicate analysis which have to be in

1306
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:51,709
duplicate and have to concur and if they

1307
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:53,660
don't concur you have to repeat that so

1308
00:55:51,710 --> 00:55:55,940
if a lab is not taking the required

1309
00:55:53,659 --> 00:55:58,549
amount well you know kind of it's bad

1310
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:00,619
news for them and yeah thank you second

1311
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,960
question really quick what would you all

1312
00:56:00,619 --> 00:56:03,848
look for inside

1313
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:05,980
of a compliance officer for your boards

1314
00:56:03,849 --> 00:56:07,900
right because some control consultants

1315
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,550
are kind of saying that compliance is

1316
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:11,289
not science which is absolutely absurd

1317
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,690
it makes no sense inside of an

1318
00:56:11,289 --> 00:56:15,429
analytical lab but I've also seen the

1319
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,380
other spectrum where like the compliance

1320
00:56:15,429 --> 00:56:20,139
officer is like a full PhD statistician

1321
00:56:17,380 --> 00:56:21,880
modeling algorithms for diabetes and

1322
00:56:20,139 --> 00:56:23,558
their communication style isn't

1323
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:25,240
necessarily the best either so what

1324
00:56:23,559 --> 00:56:27,790
would be your sweet spot for your

1325
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:30,429
compliance well you definitely want

1326
00:56:27,789 --> 00:56:32,739
someone who has experience either doing

1327
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:34,358
compliance for a laboratory or working

1328
00:56:32,739 --> 00:56:35,439
or running a laboratory to the degree

1329
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:37,328
that they were they were themselves

1330
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,190
tracking all of this information that's

1331
00:56:37,329 --> 00:56:40,900
required to be tracked you definitely

1332
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:43,358
need some science literacy to be able to

1333
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:45,400
do this or either that or if you have

1334
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,558
just compliance experience you need a

1335
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:49,059
lot of training to be able to fully

1336
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:50,859
comprehend all this data that's coming

1337
00:56:49,059 --> 00:56:52,329
through and then check it every day

1338
00:56:50,858 --> 00:56:53,619
because as a compliance officer you're

1339
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:55,930
gonna be checking every single result

1340
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:57,760
that goes out and and trying to catch

1341
00:56:55,929 --> 00:56:59,828
mistakes that either the director didn't

1342
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:01,780
catch or the technician and you're

1343
00:56:59,829 --> 00:57:03,700
playing devil's advocate on your

1344
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:05,559
pretending to be the state and saying

1345
00:57:03,699 --> 00:57:07,058
okay if I were going through this what

1346
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:08,260
would I try to point out where all the

1347
00:57:07,059 --> 00:57:10,000
possible mistakes that could have

1348
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,380
happened here oh yeah it's very

1349
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,000
important I mean I can't say we have

1350
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,798
more than one compliance officer and you

1351
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,880
need a high level person you you're

1352
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:18,219
talking about the state requires that

1353
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:19,420
you produce a data packet per sample

1354
00:57:18,219 --> 00:57:21,068
that you produce out there in the data

1355
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:23,798
packet includes chromatograms your raw

1356
00:57:21,068 --> 00:57:26,349
data your Ben Sheets everything so you

1357
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:28,568
have this essentially 100 page packet

1358
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:29,980
per sample that you receive in and for a

1359
00:57:28,568 --> 00:57:31,719
lab that tests over a hundred samples a

1360
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:34,420
day you can imagine what kind of work

1361
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:36,519
that takes so you need a team and not

1362
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:38,440
just any you know Joe from the street

1363
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:40,480
being your compliance officer amazing

1364
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,940
thank you so much I think we only have

1365
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:45,429
time for one more question

1366
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:47,619
hello my name is Christian saucier my

1367
00:57:45,429 --> 00:57:50,289
question is we've heard over the last

1368
00:57:47,619 --> 00:57:53,710
two days a lot of call-outs for more

1369
00:57:50,289 --> 00:57:55,929
collaboration across competitors about

1370
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:59,650
data and more specifically even across

1371
00:57:55,929 --> 00:58:01,808
borders a lot of this is really relevant

1372
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:03,700
to clinical research obviously you guys

1373
00:58:01,809 --> 00:58:07,059
are potentially more on the consumer

1374
00:58:03,699 --> 00:58:09,088
side but are your labs involved you are

1375
00:58:07,059 --> 00:58:12,200
you seeing any sort of meaningful

1376
00:58:09,088 --> 00:58:14,360
industry-wide effort for third part

1377
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,669
independent third party obviously to

1378
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:20,090
help collaborate all this that that can

1379
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:21,860
help you aggregate once you know and

1380
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,780
while you retain ownership with it but

1381
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:25,579
help you as an apps to aggregate your

1382
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:29,120
data together so we can do proper

1383
00:58:25,579 --> 00:58:32,449
analytics in the future yes we we

1384
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:34,869
certainly are I mean we ourselves have

1385
00:58:32,449 --> 00:58:38,000
published two or three papers on large

1386
00:58:34,869 --> 00:58:40,489
datasets where we've analyzed the

1387
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:42,980
cannabinoid content versus terpene and

1388
00:58:40,489 --> 00:58:44,509
obviously the the terpene profiles are

1389
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:48,579
way more informative than the

1390
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:54,050
cannabinoid but from as a third party

1391
00:58:48,579 --> 00:58:58,130
companies like Leafly or even confident

1392
00:58:54,050 --> 00:59:01,100
cannabis we know that cannabis there

1393
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:03,530
they're making efforts on comparing

1394
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:05,960
datasets across the country actually

1395
00:59:03,530 --> 00:59:10,490
even the Emerald tests when they do

1396
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:13,070
these blinded tests where they send out

1397
00:59:10,489 --> 00:59:17,209
blinded samples and then you see where

1398
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:20,030
you come in across all of your peers and

1399
00:59:17,210 --> 00:59:23,269
they have the median and the

1400
00:59:20,030 --> 00:59:25,070
distribution and so little snippets of

1401
00:59:23,269 --> 00:59:28,719
data like that are incredibly

1402
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:32,000
informative but one of the barriers to

1403
00:59:28,719 --> 00:59:33,949
combining and compiling all of this data

1404
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,050
from different labs it's the fact that

1405
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:39,169
we're using different certified

1406
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:42,019
reference standards we're dealing with

1407
00:59:39,170 --> 00:59:45,170
this confusion of strain naming where

1408
00:59:42,019 --> 00:59:47,570
growers will change the name of the

1409
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:50,300
strain from when you pick up the sample

1410
00:59:47,570 --> 00:59:52,490
before you get back to the lab and so

1411
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:55,010
strain aims don't necessarily have as

1412
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:58,309
much meaning as they may have at one

1413
00:59:55,010 --> 01:00:01,940
time therefore the importance and need

1414
00:59:58,309 --> 01:00:05,659
to move toward incorporation of genetic

1415
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:09,079
testing with all of these samples but

1416
01:00:05,659 --> 01:00:10,579
the effort is is happening yeah and I

1417
01:00:09,079 --> 01:00:12,049
think the market is starting to demand

1418
01:00:10,579 --> 01:00:15,199
it more and more we're starting to see

1419
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:18,410
demands from cultivators manufacturers

1420
01:00:15,199 --> 01:00:21,500
to to sort of get together and see okay

1421
01:00:18,409 --> 01:00:23,029
how can you make your methods be more

1422
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:24,349
similar such that the data can be

1423
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:25,220
aggregated such that if we take

1424
01:00:24,349 --> 01:00:28,309
something from

1425
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:30,319
here and tested here and here that the

1426
01:00:28,309 --> 01:00:33,529
results will be not exactly the same but

1427
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:36,590
at least within a reasonable swing and I

1428
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:38,359
think it'll happen more and more as the

1429
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:40,750
industry grows and as everybody's data

1430
01:00:38,358 --> 01:00:44,179
set gets kind of bigger and as you have

1431
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:45,619
larger companies corporations that until

1432
01:00:44,179 --> 01:00:49,129
now haven't been getting into cannabis

1433
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:50,930
because of the federal ban on it

1434
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,460
you'll see them getting to banking now

1435
01:00:50,929 --> 01:00:54,440
they'll have their bank accounts we'll

1436
01:00:52,460 --> 01:00:56,480
be able to get into this industry and

1437
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,039
then they'll be able to purchase these

1438
01:00:56,480 --> 01:01:00,199
data sets or at least work with these

1439
01:00:58,039 --> 01:01:01,579
other laboratories to learn what they

1440
01:01:00,199 --> 01:01:03,379
learn and once there is a financial

1441
01:01:01,579 --> 01:01:06,799
incentive I think you'll see a lot more

1442
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:08,300
people collaborating you're done well

1443
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:10,220
that's all the time we have we will keep

1444
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:11,730
you from lunch but ladies and gentlemen

1445
01:01:10,219 --> 01:01:11,959
our panelists give them around the clock

1446
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:16,829
[Music]

1447
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,829
[Applause]
