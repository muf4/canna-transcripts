lineup so I want to give you an

89
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,120
opportunity to kind of talk about the

90
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,280
value of the practicum for folks who

91
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,199
might be interested in in attending sure

92
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,079
yeah we we received so much Fe good

93
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,879
feedback on the practicum last year and

94
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,959
it's always a mixed crowd you know we've

95
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,240
had some people in the audience that you

96
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:32,038
know could potentially be up on stage

97
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,519
helping teach you know experts with a

98
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:36,079
lot of experience in cannabis medicine

99
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:38,198
and um you know all the way to

100
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:40,120
clinicians that have never recommended

101
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,680
cannabis to a patient before that just

102
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,038
kind of like took the leap to come to

103
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,439
canmed to this event and and everything

104
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:48,599
in between and it's uh really nice to

105
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:50,839
get a mixed crowd like that uh you know

106
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,600
so much uh relating and learning I think

107
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:54,758
the the conversations that were going on

108
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:56,520
in between the lectures were just

109
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:58,560
fabulous really exciting and the

110
00:04:56,519 --> 00:05:02,439
feedback we got was great so the

111
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,959
practicum is uh Soup To Nuts kind of uh

112
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:06,000
you're a medical provider and you want

113
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,879
to know about cannabis and how to get

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,160
great results treating your patients

115
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:12,000
with cannabis know what the uh what the

116
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,439
risks are the contraindications how to

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,038
have a a conversation about it with your

118
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:19,560
patient but also know how to think about

119
00:05:16,038 --> 00:05:22,038
it like the uh physiology the

120
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,280
pharmacology and um and we we are able

121
00:05:22,038 --> 00:05:28,199
to pack that all into one day remarkably

122
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:30,198
there's always uh you know a lot of um

123
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:31,960
but it's it's just very con place and I

124
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:34,560
think that uh year after year we've been

125
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,918
able to refine it and get the curriculum

126
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,038
to a point of what's most relevant to

127
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:41,758
Medical providers and it's a yeah it's a

128
00:05:40,038 --> 00:05:44,959
great day it's amazing that we get that

129
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,759
much information across uh also uh

130
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:50,198
accepted and based on the feedback

131
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:53,759
retained in just one day yeah no and

132
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:55,720
it's a great sort of um prerequisite for

133
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,919
for the rest of the the conference too

134
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,000
gives you people a nice Foundation to be

135
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:02,918
uh for the the rest of the presentations

136
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,519
absolutely we we actually had quite a

137
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:07,519
few people that were not clinicians that

138
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:09,918
came in and were also just thrilled that

139
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:12,758
they had made the choice to do that uh

140
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:14,359
to to attend the the medical practicum

141
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,840
uh you know even just some patients and

142
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,360
they're like well this was so much over

143
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:20,959
my head but it really uh you know like

144
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,160
validated what I'm what I was thinking

145
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:24,758
about you know there there's people in

146
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,240
the Cannabis industry that are working

147
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:29,960
on other aspects of the industry not

148
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,319
like the provider patient aspect of it

149
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:34,879
and so I think for them to you know get

150
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
a a glimpse into what's in our world

151
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:38,199
what's important to us what we're

152
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:40,560
thinking and talking about it it really

153
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,720
validates and and kind of you know

154
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,879
solidifies their experience as part of

155
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:49,199
this industry of course yes and so

156
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,360
you're also going to be giving an oral

157
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,000
presentation at C 24 we've got you

158
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,879
working hard um it's about the Art and

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,199
Science of combining cannaboids for

160
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,800
treatment success and before we get into

161
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,120
sort of the benefits of com combining

162
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,960
cannabinoids I want to ask you about

163
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,360
just the sheer number of cannabinoids

164
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:09,000
that are available now and how has that

165
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,800
sort of changed since you first started

166
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
working in cannabis

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,680
medicine yeah it's um like we've known

168
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,000
for since I started that this plant was

169
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,360
a treasure chest of different medicinal

170
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,319
compounds but what we really had was THC

171
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:27,240
you know I started in 2009 in Maine and

172
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,160
it was um you know like sending letters

173
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,360
to people on the west coast asking if we

174
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,319
could get some of these CBD they weren't

175
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,520
really even CBD dominant back then it

176
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,479
was like more like type two chemo type 2

177
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,799
varieties mixed TC CBD there were a

178
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,199
handful of them available we really need

179
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,478
these in Maine we've heard this great

180
00:07:42,199 --> 00:07:49,598
stuff about CBD yeah you know and then

181
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:52,000
2013 we finally had access to CBD and um

182
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,759
thought that was great and thought we

183
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,680
knew what we were talking about when it

184
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,598
came to uh combining THC and CBD there

185
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,759
was this kind of you know somewhat

186
00:07:58,598 --> 00:08:04,199
limited black and white idea of what the

187
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:07,800
combination does together uh that has

188
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:10,000
persisted uh you know through now but

189
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,680
over the last you know five years or so

190
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,279
we've been working with uh

191
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:18,840
therapeutically relevant amounts of

192
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:22,799
thca cbda and CBG these are you know the

193
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:25,560
the more prominent newcomers uh CBN is

194
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,759
in there as well um you know there's

195
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:29,519
there's some isomers and synthetics

196
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
which are worth talking about even I'm

197
00:08:29,519 --> 00:08:32,838
not sure they're that valuable

198
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,639
clinically some of them probably have

199
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,880
some value um but then there's the real

200
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:39,838
mystery which is the combination of them

201
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:42,719
you know we can we can isolate them out

202
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,800
and uh do uh pre-clinical rodent

203
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,879
experiments and try to understand their

204
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,919
pharmacology but where the rubber meets

205
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:51,720
the road in the clinic you know

206
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,240
understanding

207
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:55,959
how how to make selections for what to

208
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,879
treat patients with and then how to

209
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,838
interpret the response to those choices

210
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,360
how to

211
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,839
kind of Orient around dosing and what

212
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,000
are some of the general strategies when

213
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,000
it comes to combining canavs this is

214
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,958
it's a whole new area of um medicine

215
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,759
that cannabis is kind of leaning us into

216
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:16,359
like maybe it's not new that there's

217
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:18,639
this idea of poly pharmacology or

218
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,320
network pharmacology using multiple

219
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:22,399
agents with different mechanisms of

220
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:25,120
action to get better results than

221
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,278
relying on a single agent that's not new

222
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:31,240
but um it's just amazing how cannabis

223
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,240
kind of Mand that we learn that and take

224
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,360
that approach and it's it's doing so

225
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,919
more and more all the

226
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,480
time and how is this you know kind of

227
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:42,479
expansion of available compounds and and

228
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,839
different combinations how's it made

229
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:48,278
finding the right medicine more

230
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:51,160
difficult for you and for patients and

231
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:52,919
consumers well it's yeah so there

232
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:55,039
there's more options certainly can be

233
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:57,399
more overwhelming if you don't have kind

234
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,799
of a methodical way of sorting through

235
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:03,440
it which is what I'm hoping to conin Bay

236
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:05,199
in my presentation um and and I think

237
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,680
cannabis was already overwhelming to

238
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,480
people even when they just had you know

239
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:13,199
few options so now they you know for

240
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,839
example if they look at uh our medicinal

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,519
products at healer you know we've got

242
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
all these different products right we

243
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,519
try to make a chart for how they can

244
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:23,919
sort through it but it is it is it does

245
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,078
get overwhelming for people on the other

246
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:29,240
side of it though what I think we're

247
00:10:26,078 --> 00:10:32,000
seeing as a benefit is that patients who

248
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:34,360
may not have responded to cannabis say

249
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,600
we were just using THC and we really did

250
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,399
our best to get THC to work for them and

251
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,959
it didn't work you know instead of

252
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,679
saying okay I guess you know you're one

253
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,599
of these very few people that just

254
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:46,120
doesn't respond well to cannabis and we

255
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:49,040
better try something non- cannabis next

256
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,200
um now we have more things to try and

257
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:54,278
and things that um from all that we know

258
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,920
these other options have a similar

259
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:59,919
safety profile and have uh a similar uh

260
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,759
capacity to help with this broad range

261
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:04,399
of conditions so it's it's not like we

262
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,919
discovered a new canabo that's perfect

263
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,000
for just this one diagnosis here we go

264
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:10,799
again with another compound that could

265
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,440
work in all these different you know

266
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:15,159
diagnoses all these different fields of

267
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:17,519
medicine it just adds to to the

268
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:19,360
complexity and until we you know I think

269
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,639
until we get like supercomputers working

270
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
on this problem where you know human

271
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:26,480
beings are going to be the best uh the

272
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,919
best one to uh kind of determine where

273
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
are we going to start what are we going

274
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:31,759
to try next what do we what's it going

275
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,360
to take for us to decide this really

276
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,639
isn't the right fit for you before we

277
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,639
move on these are the basic questions

278
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:40,120
that I'm hoping to help clinicians

279
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,200
answer excellent and now you mentioned

280
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,639
healer.com and and I'm glad you did

281
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:46,240
because I kind of wanted to ask you what

282
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,360
is your process for for adding new

283
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,159
products that like new cannaboids into

284
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,159
your

285
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:57,559
portfolio yeah um we had a big pipeline

286
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:00,319
you know the wish list is Big um um we

287
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,679
have prototypes and so you know things

288
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,360
that I find uh interesting based on

289
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:06,239
pre-clinical literature based on what

290
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:08,879
people are telling me we usually make

291
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,360
prototype and share it around with the

292
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,519
staff and with myself and some of our

293
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,399
colleagues and see what people think you

294
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:18,278
know a good example of this is our I

295
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,879
think it's our newest product still it's

296
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:25,759
a a combination of cbda and cbga so cbga

297
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,120
like who knows anything about cbga you

298
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:29,559
look in the peer review literature

299
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,198
there's so little on it um you know a

300
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:34,719
few a few more hits just this past year

301
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:36,359
but it's is it is it similar to CVG

302
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,040
which we also don't know that much about

303
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,440
but we know more is it different than

304
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:43,039
CVG you know a lot of unknowns there but

305
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,600
there was this um you know preclinical

306
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:48,159
study that gained a lot of headlines

307
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:51,920
about how it could inhibit the SARS Cove

308
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:55,198
2 virus in its infectious potential in

309
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:57,278
mice and in cells and so we thought well

310
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:59,120
you know we've seen such impressive

311
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:02,198
results with the acidic cannaboids the

312
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,120
thca and the cbda it kind of makes sense

313
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:07,719
for us to explore cbga next let's see

314
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,759
what it does we started playing around

315
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:12,680
with it and we found that in combination

316
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:15,360
with cbda it seemed to be doing

317
00:13:12,679 --> 00:13:17,919
something special um you know we weren't

318
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,000
testing it against SS you know like

319
00:13:17,919 --> 00:13:22,000
against covid uh we were just taking it

320
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,720
and see how we felt and people were

321
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,759
reporting very similar things that this

322
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,759
combination made them feel alert awake

323
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:32,759
focused like in the zone resilient to

324
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:34,360
stress you know I didn't expect that I

325
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:37,799
still don't exactly know what's the

326
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,680
mechanism of action um but enough of us

327
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:42,159
felt like well this is a prototype worth

328
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,759
bringing to Market that you know that's

329
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:46,958
what we did and we still have so much to

330
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,919
learn from it you know I mean even even

331
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,799
CBG I knew it had a lot of potential

332
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,879
what do we know about it in humans right

333
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,519
now other than the anecdotes almost

334
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:58,600
nothing right there's one survey study

335
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:01,120
and the people in that study weren't you

336
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:02,800
know the data is um just not very clear

337
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,440
like it's a good starting point but we

338
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:07,039
don't know exactly how much most of them

339
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,199
were taking or what what other you know

340
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,719
can avonoids they were taking it for uh

341
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:13,039
and and so because of that we have

342
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:17,278
currently have an ongoing uh another

343
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,759
survey of CBG users to try to to try to

344
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:21,278
clarify that but what it it seems like

345
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:23,680
you get you get something that's a hit

346
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:27,519
in a small number of people you allow

347
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:29,519
other kind of cannabis uh enthusiasts to

348
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,000
to start using it and before too long

349
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,078
we've got some signals that are worth

350
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,639
following then we do the observational

351
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:36,359
research we kind of confirm what we

352
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,519
think we're seeing and then you know

353
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:41,800
maybe that leads to more more clinical

354
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:43,399
trials or more animal research it's you

355
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:45,198
know it's so backwards with cannabis

356
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,440
that we start with humans and then we go

357
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:51,599
to to the after that right but but I

358
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,920
love it I love it so that that's kind of

359
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:57,440
our process and then also the the idea

360
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:00,159
that we just don't want to have too many

361
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,759
products like it it does get confusing

362
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:05,519
and overwhelming and there can be kind

363
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:08,000
of a downside where if people are you

364
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,440
know just looking at it and not sure

365
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
what to take or there's no good

366
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,240
algorithm for helping them make a

367
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,759
selection then they might make the wrong

368
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:17,480
selection and kind of rule out cannabis

369
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:20,240
say oh I tried it it this doesn't work

370
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,800
for me I'm not going to try anymore so

371
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,278
there there's a there's pros and cons of

372
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:26,198
everything in life yeah no and I kind of

373
00:15:24,278 --> 00:15:28,278
you know from a personal standpoint my

374
00:15:26,198 --> 00:15:29,439
mom has been dealing with some some back

375
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:32,480
pain

376
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:33,920
um and she's done physical therapy and

377
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,560
some things doesn't really seem to be

378
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,399
working and I was like well have you

379
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,078
tried cannabis and she was like well

380
00:15:37,399 --> 00:15:42,360
what do I get and that's where I was

381
00:15:39,078 --> 00:15:47,799
like well I don't know I mean is it THC

382
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,399
thca CBD cbda um a combination uh it it

383
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,439
can be a bit

384
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:53,919
overwhelming and that's where you know

385
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,800
that that's where I'm I'm hoping to

386
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:57,439
train clinicians to do that but it

387
00:15:55,799 --> 00:15:59,318
sounds like you know so say we take

388
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,440
someone like your mom with back pain

389
00:15:59,318 --> 00:16:03,278
maybe it's not a very complex case right

390
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,000
you know maybe I would get her in the

391
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:07,039
office and ask her a bunch of questions

392
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,559
and in the end she's just a lady with uh

393
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,559
you know some like intermittent back

394
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:12,559
pain there was no big injury I'm not

395
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:14,559
worried about any kind of like you know

396
00:16:12,559 --> 00:16:16,638
spinal stenosis or anything like that

397
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:18,758
she just got to SAR back and she did her

398
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:21,278
fpt and her exercise is not working what

399
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,278
can I use for pain you know I'm going to

400
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,958
have a very few number of questions that

401
00:16:24,278 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm going to need to know where to get

402
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:29,719
her started this is not going to be

403
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:31,519
rocket science my you know Ju Just to

404
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,278
use this as an example for our audience

405
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,879
today you know one question is going to

406
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,120
be is the back pain disturbing your

407
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:39,480
sleep or is your sleep Disturbed for

408
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,919
some other reason and if it is to me

409
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:45,319
that is the lwh hanging fruit if you can

410
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:46,679
get somebody sleeping better it's very

411
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:48,439
likely their next day is going to be

412
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,120
better it's very likely their their

413
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:52,480
healing system is going to take over and

414
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,318
fix the underlying cause of the problem

415
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,600
and in my mind T in my experience THC is

416
00:16:56,318 --> 00:17:00,719
still the winner when it comes to

417
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,839
improving sleep in just about anyone but

418
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,959
certainly in anyone whose sleep is

419
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,959
disturbed by either pain or anxiety

420
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:11,439
especially trauma related anxiety I'll

421
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:13,519
start with THC you know maybe your mom's

422
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:15,038
never tried cannabis before so I'm

423
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:17,160
talking to her I have no clue if she's

424
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:19,318
going to be a 2 milligram person or a 20

425
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,558
milligram person and because of that I'm

426
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:24,240
going to start her at two and very

427
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:26,119
gradually work up see see if she's a

428
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,720
responder when it comes to sleep and

429
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:29,678
then if she is we'll say okay let's

430
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,519
watch for a month or two see if your

431
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,798
daytime symptoms resolve if they don't

432
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:35,639
come on back and let's let's talk about

433
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:37,918
step two how do we treat you during the

434
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:40,320
day uh so that's just kind of my

435
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:43,720
clinical approach which I think doesn't

436
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:46,678
have to be exclusively clinical I do

437
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,679
think through education we can bring

438
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,600
that to the consumer and they can kind

439
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:53,038
of skip the clinician and uh and and get

440
00:17:51,599 --> 00:17:55,759
good results with with the right

441
00:17:53,038 --> 00:17:57,879
information that's my hope yeah no and

442
00:17:55,759 --> 00:18:00,519
it really seems like it's a process of

443
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,440
you know trying something for a period

444
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:03,879
of time really checking in with yourself

445
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,279
seeing how that's working and then

446
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:08,760
adjusting accordingly yep but uh how do

447
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:10,879
you you know shooting from the hip and

448
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:12,759
trying the right thing because there's

449
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,360
different personalities too right maybe

450
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:16,440
your mom's someone that loves doing

451
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:17,918
things methodically or maybe she's

452
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:20,159
someone that like if it's not going to

453
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:22,600
show her something some improvement

454
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:24,559
within four days she's done you know

455
00:18:22,599 --> 00:18:26,319
yeah and U you know that's kind of the

456
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:28,399
art in medicine is like figuring out

457
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:30,480
which patient is which and how

458
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,720
aggressive we need to be at at the

459
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
beginning but I will say you know all

460
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,960
these new canono inss are great they do

461
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,720
not replace THC not not one of them THC

462
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,400
is still such a powerful agent you know

463
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,440
if I could only choose one to work with

464
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,400
that would certainly still be it

465
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,679
interesting so yeah that's that's good

466
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,480
and that's a good segue because one of

467
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:51,960
the things I was gonna sort of ask about

468
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
is you know after we're talking about

469
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,000
the the variety of cannaboids sort of

470
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:59,558
narrowing things down a bit um and am I

471
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,400
correct in assuming that well you've

472
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:03,558
already confirmed that you know THC

473
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,960
being kind of one of the most well

474
00:19:03,558 --> 00:19:09,639
studied widely available um would you

475
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:13,480
also put CBD and potentially CBG in sort

476
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:16,038
of that category of sort of the um maybe

477
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,279
most effective cannabinoids or most

478
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:23,200
well-known canabo at least right

479
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:25,798
now welln for sure but I think if I you

480
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,679
know what I said about THC before if I

481
00:19:25,798 --> 00:19:30,960
could only have one what would it be you

482
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:33,080
know I think if if the if the offering

483
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,440
was for me to only have two you know if

484
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:38,439
it was THC and the second best what

485
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:42,840
would that be at this point I think I

486
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:45,640
would choose cbda over CBD it it seems

487
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:48,480
to me in most people to do just about

488
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,520
everything that CBD does but to do so

489
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,319
more powerfully and at a lower dose um

490
00:19:51,519 --> 00:19:55,079
it's not perfect it you know what I just

491
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:56,960
said does not apply to everyone there's

492
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,599
some people that try both and then go

493
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:03,240
back to CBD but the vast majority uh

494
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,519
will try both and say wow the cbda

495
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,240
actually worked a lot better I'm going

496
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:09,839
to stick with cbda and we know that um

497
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:13,919
at healer we offered cbda samples to our

498
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:17,558
CBD customers and most of them switched

499
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:20,440
over I will I will confess not confess

500
00:20:17,558 --> 00:20:24,359
but disclose I am a cbda user of healer

501
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:27,000
so um I'm a Believer you like it too and

502
00:20:24,359 --> 00:20:29,479
and then CBG you know I'm still figuring

503
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,960
it out it's certainly seems powerful

504
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:33,679
like it it sells well people get it and

505
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,679
then they want to get it again they

506
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,400
think that it's helping them I've seen

507
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:40,240
some remarkable results clinically you

508
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:42,240
know not not with everyone that tries it

509
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,919
I'd say a lot of people it's it's more

510
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,720
similar to a CBD is response we're like

511
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:49,080
yeah I tried the CBG it's helping me I

512
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:52,440
like it it's not like oh my God you

513
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:54,199
changed my life I feel like myself again

514
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,759
I've returned to work from being

515
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,798
disabled like those are the stories that

516
00:20:55,759 --> 00:21:00,720
we hear about with THC you know I I

517
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:02,599
don't get that much of that with CBG

518
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,279
except once in a while I do I do hear

519
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:08,359
something that's that's pretty profound

520
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:09,399
interesting and now so you mentioned CBD

521
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:12,000
versus

522
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:15,200
cbda um in that

523
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:18,159
scenario um do they have similar kind of

524
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:20,319
therapeutic or you know similar effects

525
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,159
um because I know that in some cases the

526
00:21:20,319 --> 00:21:23,480
neutral versus the acid they actually

527
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,000
have opposite

528
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,519
effects right so many of the targets of

529
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,519
CBD and CB da are the same they're

530
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:35,759
they're very similar and and so yeah if

531
00:21:32,519 --> 00:21:37,519
you look at THC versus thca and compare

532
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:40,119
their pharmacology in the body very

533
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:43,639
different and when people take them they

534
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:46,359
feel very different um CBD versus cbda

535
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,000
is much more similar and so probably you

536
00:21:46,359 --> 00:21:49,678
know one of the targets that's going to

537
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,759
be most important for for people that

538
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,360
are using this is the um the activity of

539
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:58,240
the serotonin receptor so they both can

540
00:21:55,359 --> 00:22:00,918
kind of reduce anxiety and improve mood

541
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,720
via that serotonin pathway there's

542
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:05,440
there's been a number of animal studies

543
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:07,600
looking at the two um sometimes not in

544
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,240
the same study but two different studies

545
00:22:07,599 --> 00:22:13,079
that have used the same model to

546
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,798
evaluate cbda versus CBD and you'll see

547
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:17,038
that they they can do the same thing

548
00:22:14,798 --> 00:22:19,839
they both can reduce seizures they both

549
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:22,720
can decrease inflammatory pain they both

550
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:24,678
can uh decrease nausea and vomiting you

551
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,679
know there's there's a lot of overlap

552
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,120
there uh mechanistically it's usually

553
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:31,840
the same targets the the way in which

554
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,759
they're achieving these outcomes is the

555
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:37,918
same but the dosing is often vastly

556
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:40,679
different with cbda requiring a much

557
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,640
lower dose suggesting it has uh well

558
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:44,720
what we know from the animal studies is

559
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,120
that it has both better bioavailability

560
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:49,798
so take a dose more of it's getting into

561
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:52,278
the body and then it also has more

562
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,639
potency once once it's in the body you

563
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:57,038
know if you look at brain levels or

564
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,759
blood levels of these compounds that are

565
00:22:57,038 --> 00:23:01,038
necessary to achieve their result you

566
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:03,200
need much less of it so more gets in and

567
00:23:01,038 --> 00:23:06,319
you need much less maybe one of the

568
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,798
downsides is that CBD seems to last

569
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:10,599
longer in the body cbda you'll excrete

570
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:13,720
more quickly you might therefore have to

571
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:17,399
take it more often but um but a lot of

572
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:18,919
overlap there yeah and then kind of one

573
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,519
of the Nuggets that I picked up watching

574
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:24,240
your presentation from last year was you

575
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:26,918
showed some graphs showing that

576
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
cbda um is actually better absorbed when

577
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:31,679
it's part of a full plan

578
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:34,038
extract but that is that that I mean

579
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,600
there's there's findings in rodents you

580
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:37,759
know we haven't proven that for humans

581
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:39,319
yet but based on what we're seeing when

582
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,640
people say you know we get we taking

583
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,720
these low Doses and they're working

584
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,360
really well and then there is a human

585
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,558
study that showed cbda absorption

586
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:49,240
through the gut was extremely high it

587
00:23:47,558 --> 00:23:51,079
didn't test it like it did in the rodent

588
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,400
study on its own versus in the in the

589
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,399
context of a whole plan extract but all

590
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,440
the information we have is pointing to

591
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:01,320
to what you said that essentially if if

592
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:04,960
there's a little bit of THC or

593
00:24:01,319 --> 00:24:06,558
CBG present with the cbda you might

594
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,840
absorb it or at least a rodent might

595
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:11,960
absorb like 15 times more of it with

596
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:13,439
just a little bit of THC or or CBG and

597
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,960
no one none of us would have planned

598
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,278
that but I think a lot of us would have

599
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:19,720
said there is a pretty good chance that

600
00:24:17,278 --> 00:24:21,400
for one reason or another taking this

601
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,558
thing in the context of the whole plant

602
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:26,080
is going to beat taking the isolated

603
00:24:23,558 --> 00:24:27,599
compound you know and that that's just a

604
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,158
lesson we've learned again and again

605
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,798
again there's going to be exceptions to

606
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:33,640
that lesson you know in certain

607
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,960
situations but typically that is the

608
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:37,480
case and once in a while we know why

609
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,600
that's the case this is one of those

610
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:43,200
scenarios where we we think we know why

611
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:45,240
that's the case right and that speaks to

612
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:49,640
the topic at hand here right this

613
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:52,159
combining cannaboids for Success yes so

614
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:54,520
um you know in the presentation we go

615
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:57,440
through the what we know about the

616
00:24:54,519 --> 00:25:00,319
pharmacokinetics so this is how do drugs

617
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,240
or compounds interact with each other as

618
00:25:00,319 --> 00:25:04,079
they're getting absorbed as they're

619
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,519
getting metabolized and as they're

620
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:08,639
getting excreted and we have quite a bit

621
00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,119
of information about these various

622
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,159
canabo and what some different

623
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:14,119
combinations will do

624
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,320
pharmacokinetically uh when when they're

625
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:19,158
in each other's presence so that's kind

626
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:21,200
of one chunk of what I'm presenting and

627
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:24,039
then another aspect of it would be the

628
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:26,159
phod dnamic interactions so these are

629
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:28,759
not about absorption and Metabolism but

630
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,278
about how they actually act their their

631
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:33,519
mechanism of action their pharmacology

632
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:35,159
and that when these two are present you

633
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:38,319
might see one thing compared to when

634
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,600
they're they're um you know on their

635
00:25:38,319 --> 00:25:43,038
own and then um you know strategy so

636
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:46,038
there's the pharmacokinetics the

637
00:25:43,038 --> 00:25:48,519
pharmacodynamics and then strategies uh

638
00:25:46,038 --> 00:25:50,000
for both clinicians and patients about

639
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:52,558
how are we going to sort through this

640
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,319
like what's step one what's step two how

641
00:25:52,558 --> 00:25:58,000
do we combine things so that that's the

642
00:25:55,319 --> 00:26:01,079
um main content in our presentation my

643
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,200
presentation excellent no

644
00:26:01,079 --> 00:26:07,278
and kind of the the process I'm very

645
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,200
interested in like is it better to I'm

646
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,119
sure it's always dependent on the person

647
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,519
and the condition but you know is it

648
00:26:11,119 --> 00:26:18,239
better to start with a combination and

649
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,839
then you know maybe zero in on um maybe

650
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,319
a single compound or is it better to

651
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,398
start with one and then start adding

652
00:26:21,319 --> 00:26:27,398
things in sort of how does that

653
00:26:23,398 --> 00:26:30,439
work yeah it it depends on some factors

654
00:26:27,398 --> 00:26:34,319
but I am very comfortable starting with

655
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,240
combinations and more simple cases like

656
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,319
if like if you just told me what you

657
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,240
told me about your mom and I started

658
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:42,278
saying Ben you know like tell me does it

659
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,880
radiate down her leg I don't know you

660
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:45,679
know does it disturb her sleep I don't

661
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,159
know you know like I couldn't get any

662
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,919
more information out of what would I do

663
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,760
yes I'd started with a combination I

664
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:56,320
probably recommend our formula that's

665
00:26:51,759 --> 00:26:59,640
like equal parts THC CBD cbda and c and

666
00:26:56,319 --> 00:27:01,798
um thca you know it's it's got like we

667
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,278
call the balance formula so it's only

668
00:27:01,798 --> 00:27:07,319
one quarter THC um it's you know not too

669
00:27:05,278 --> 00:27:09,480
strong easy for people to titrate in

670
00:27:07,319 --> 00:27:11,599
small increments it's literally made

671
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,480
from 19 different varieties you know

672
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:16,158
it's a huge shotgun approach uh would I

673
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,480
take that shotgun approach as my first

674
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:21,559
line with someone absolutely I've done

675
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,440
it plenty of times it works well no

676
00:27:21,558 --> 00:27:25,000
problem with that if it's a more

677
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
sensitive case maybe it's someone who's

678
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,880
already tried cannabis and hasn't really

679
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,519
succeeded or has a history of being

680
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,200
Ultra sensitive to cannabis or it's a

681
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:36,440
high stakes case where it's like we got

682
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,600
to get results fast or this person's

683
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,480
going south or their fames you know this

684
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:42,519
person's going to have to be

685
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,759
institutionalized or whatever you know

686
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,319
if there's some urgency there I might

687
00:27:44,759 --> 00:27:48,119
not just start with the shotgun approach

688
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:51,879
I might take a really kind of

689
00:27:48,119 --> 00:27:54,079
accelerated and targeted approach but a

690
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:56,000
lot of times I do what I what we talked

691
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:57,879
about before like I'll treat the Sleep

692
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,919
problem with THC and then look come back

693
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:02,240
and say like yeah I guess I got a few

694
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,799
little remaining things but bulk of what

695
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,519
I came to you for is is fixed or I'll

696
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:08,038
start with a balance formula kind of a

697
00:28:06,519 --> 00:28:10,480
shotgun approach and they'll say you

698
00:28:08,038 --> 00:28:12,038
know what that works really well and I

699
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,960
might say well you know is there some

700
00:28:12,038 --> 00:28:15,839
room for fine-tuning it are you having

701
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,558
any other symptoms and maybe we do a

702
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,720
little fine-tuning but a lot of times

703
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:22,359
that's that's not even needed so yes you

704
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,558
know short answer to your question is

705
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:26,558
sometimes combination is a Fine Place to

706
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,038
Start and that's good enough for a lot

707
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:30,000
of people

708
00:28:28,038 --> 00:28:32,440
excellent and now you hinted at

709
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,200
something earlier and I know I I read it

710
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,640
in your abstract too and I wanted to

711
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,519
make sure I asked you about it was that

712
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,200
there's some new research challenging

713
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:42,919
some old assumptions about the effects

714
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,319
of combining THC and CBD hoping you

715
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:49,679
might elaborate a little bit on that

716
00:28:45,319 --> 00:28:52,480
sure yeah the the kind of old adage of

717
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:55,480
CBD is going to mitigate the side

718
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,200
effects of THC while augmenting the

719
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:02,599
benefits of THC there is definitely some

720
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:05,519
truth there uh we've seen you know the

721
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:07,798
product satx designed by Ethan Russo you

722
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:11,000
know which combined the THC and the CBD

723
00:29:07,798 --> 00:29:12,599
in roughly equal p uh proportions and

724
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,880
that's been very successful it's helped

725
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:17,759
a lot of people um so so while there is

726
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:20,039
some truth to that statement there's a

727
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,359
lot of nuance and there are many

728
00:29:20,038 --> 00:29:24,038
situations uh that I've seen and that we

729
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:27,519
are now seeing in human clinical

730
00:29:24,038 --> 00:29:30,519
research where that is just not the case

731
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:32,919
adding CBD to THC does not mitigate this

732
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,038
the side effects it can actually enhance

733
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,240
the side effects and it may dampen the

734
00:29:36,038 --> 00:29:42,640
benefits in certain cases so um you know

735
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,720
like one example would be um a study of

736
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,559
people with fibromyalgia who have

737
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,960
vaporized either THC dominant or

738
00:29:48,558 --> 00:29:53,319
combined THC CBD cannabis they rate how

739
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,038
it affects their pain you know it's

740
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,839
blinded they rate how it affects their

741
00:29:55,038 --> 00:30:00,640
pain and they have their blood levels

742
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:02,639
measured to see you know H how much THC

743
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,600
and CBD in the blood are needed to

744
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,000
achieve these reductions in pain well it

745
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,319
it turned out based on the results of

746
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,278
that study that the presence of CBD in

747
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:15,119
the flour and in the blood actually

748
00:30:11,278 --> 00:30:17,440
limited thc's ability to treat the pain

749
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:21,439
you know we know mechanistically that

750
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:23,880
THC stimulates the CB1 receptor and CBD

751
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,720
turns down the activity of the CB1

752
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,480
receptor a little bit it's kind of

753
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,759
arrogant to think like the only way in

754
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,480
which it's going to turn down that

755
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:33,558
activity has to do with negative side

756
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,200
effects but turning down that activity

757
00:30:33,558 --> 00:30:38,480
is never going to bother the positive

758
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:40,519
effects no like it you know physiology

759
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,079
doesn't work like that mean maybe

760
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:47,319
sometimes it does but um there is

761
00:30:44,079 --> 00:30:49,879
evidence so I I I think that's a big

762
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:51,720
like you know people love grabbing on to

763
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:54,039
things in cannabis and running with them

764
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,240
I'm guilty of this also you know we all

765
00:30:54,038 --> 00:30:59,000
think like oh Mir scene means it's

766
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,519
sedating no miring means a lot of things

767
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,599
you know if it's present you know or or

768
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:05,519
like you know probably even worse than

769
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:08,599
that is the whole CBN story that people

770
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:10,319
are going for right now like um cbn's

771
00:31:08,599 --> 00:31:12,638
valuable it's naturally occurring it's

772
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:14,879
very similar to THC I'm not putting it

773
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:17,798
down you know what I might put down is

774
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:20,600
like dirty CBN that's been manufactured

775
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:22,599
in a way that might not be safe but CBN

776
00:31:20,599 --> 00:31:24,278
itself you know there's a couple studies

777
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:26,240
from like the early 80s that you know

778
00:31:24,278 --> 00:31:28,720
showed some people got sedated and maybe

779
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,000
some rodents got ated when taking it you

780
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,079
know they get sedated with thc2 but all

781
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,000
of a sudden that little bit of

782
00:31:32,079 --> 00:31:37,759
information turned into wow CBN is the

783
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:39,759
best for sleep right it's like it's

784
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:41,519
totally not I mean for some people it is

785
00:31:39,759 --> 00:31:43,759
some people are have really more

786
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,359
paradoxical reactions to CBN than they

787
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:49,278
do to THC and it and it wakes them

788
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:50,719
up it's less potent than THC so you're G

789
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,960
need a little more of it but in the end

790
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:57,360
it's very similar so yeah try to keep it

791
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:59,000
real like I'm I'm um you know also a

792
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,119
victim of that kind of thinking

793
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,038
sometimes you know like I I take what I

794
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:06,119
think I know and run with it and maybe I

795
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:08,679
don't question it enough um but as a

796
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,879
kind of a leader and educator in this

797
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:13,200
industry I really periodically like to

798
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,360
look at all of those assumptions and

799
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,840
challenge them and uh um you know the

800
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,839
The Challenge on that CBD THC

801
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,918
combination there there's a lot of data

802
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:24,240
to suggested is not that simple and

803
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,278
sometimes it might do the opposite of

804
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,200
what we hope yeah no I mean I think

805
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:31,480
we're all sort of guilty of that

806
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,278
especially in this industry where we're

807
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:36,360
learning and you know to keep saying

808
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:37,960
well it depends uh is a little

809
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,119
exhausting so when we can kind of grab

810
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:45,440
onto something as a bit of an absolute

811
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:47,359
um we do um but again it it

812
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,480
depends

813
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,359
absolutely all right Dustin I do want to

814
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,440
be mindful of your time but before I let

815
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,879
you go I want to give you the

816
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,720
opportunity to share any additional

817
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,200
resources related to some of the topics

818
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,360
we disc discussed or that your

819
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,880
presentation that you're going to be

820
00:32:59,359 --> 00:33:04,359
giving um and then of course any other

821
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,919
information about you or healer uh links

822
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:09,479
that I can put in the show description

823
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:12,759
please let me know okay yeah so the the

824
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:14,798
topics that we discussed this is um this

825
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:17,759
is like me pulling together a bunch of

826
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:20,359
threads that I typically cover every

827
00:33:17,759 --> 00:33:22,480
month uh you know individually on on the

828
00:33:20,359 --> 00:33:25,359
Healer webinars so what I do with these

829
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,200
free webinars every month is I go over

830
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:28,798
usually five or six different research

831
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,798
studies that have come out recently that

832
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:33,918
I think are interesting or clinically

833
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:36,079
relevant and so that keeps me on top of

834
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,360
the literature and it also keeps my

835
00:33:36,079 --> 00:33:41,240
audience up to date with what's new and

836
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,038
and then I you know what I've done with

837
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:44,720
this presentation is kind of zoom out

838
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:46,398
and say like over the last two or three

839
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,480
years what have I learned about

840
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,479
combining canabo how's that affected my

841
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,558
clinical practice and can I synthesize

842
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,519
this for an audience in a concise way uh

843
00:33:53,558 --> 00:33:57,638
but for people that are are excited to

844
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,880
be kind of like the first to know and on

845
00:33:57,638 --> 00:34:00,959
the front lines please check out

846

can join them and they happen every

849
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:08,240
month not going to happen in March

850
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,559
though because I'm having a baby so I'm

851
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:13,479
taking one month off um uh but we have a

852
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:16,799
lot of other resources on healer.com

853
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,599
dosage programs you know if um if if it

854
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,879
weren't you been someone that knows a

855
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,119
lot about cannabis but if it were

856
00:34:19,878 --> 00:34:23,480
someone else asking me about their mom

857
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:25,599
I'd say you know just send her to

858
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,960
healer.com tell her to to go through the

859
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:30,119
program called new to canab is you know

860
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:31,800
how to get started and um and I think by

861
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:33,480
the end of that she'll have a lot more

862
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,359
confidence a lot more understanding of

863
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:39,199
the basics without needing to become an

864
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,319
expert and what else the other thing I

865
