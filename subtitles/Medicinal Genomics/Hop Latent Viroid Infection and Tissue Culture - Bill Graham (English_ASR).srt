2
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:19,519
that the plant typically gets infected

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,719
it goes down to the roots stays there

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,719
for a little while and then it kind of

5
00:00:20,719 --> 00:00:25,439
proliferates throughout the rest of the

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,479
plant so is the idea being that like

7
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,518
you're trying to catch those tips before

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,480
the vroid has had a chance to get there

9
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:34,119
and then you're kind of constantly it

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,799
actually moves and down so even if it's

11
00:00:34,119 --> 00:00:39,959
in those limbs some of it moves down the

12
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:42,238
down tends to go down and stay down um

13
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:46,799
it could of course carry back up because

14
00:00:42,238 --> 00:00:51,359
the um xylem uh which will go back up to

15
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:53,319
the limbs uh is especially active during

16
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:56,198
uh it's active early on for you know

17
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,280
water and um and nutrient salts so of

18
00:00:56,198 --> 00:01:01,238
course it's the primary car carrier for

19
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,600
those in uh flowering especially in

20
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:05,879
cannabis it gets interesting because we

21
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:09,118
have a a new shunt and that is that uh

22
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:10,798
stored sugar uh the wood and and and

23
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:13,879
carbohydrates we're talking about in The

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,960
Roots and Stems begins to mobilize again

25
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:17,798
so it'll take complex carbohydrates and

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,679
turn into the simple sugars again and

27
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:22,920
start sending those up the xylem which

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,040
is when we suspect that the uh vroid is

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,759
going to be carried up as well you know

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,118
because you know sugar relatively large

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:32,920
organisms it's obviously metab uh

32
00:01:29,118 --> 00:01:35,599
metabolically driven um and uh we

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,759
suspect that broid is involved somewhere

34
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:41,359
in uh gumming up the metabolic process

35
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,478
um but uh it's first of all we're doing

36
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:44,679
it in veg when those things would not be

37
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:48,640
moving

38
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,600
anyway number two is just uh that all

39
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,840
that growth is coming from the tip it's

40
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:55,798
like trying to chase a rocket if you're

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,920
in its uh and it's and its burn stream

42
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,600
you know it's going to be

43
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,519
hard you know what was what was that

44
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:06,959
very tip growth yesterday is now

45
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:09,439
centimeters or inches higher tomorrow

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:11,479
that's incredible and considering we're

47
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,280
talking about uh things that are just

48
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:17,560
shared passively uh sell to sell and um

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
uh when you get up into growth that high

50
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
and then those brand new vascular

51
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,599
tissues is they are often missed is how

52
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:27,800
it goes and this is where the testing

53
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:29,079
comes in yeah because you know I I've

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,640
done this for a while and we were

55
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,280
sending in t uh testing from tips uh and

56
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:37,279
we're getting so much more negative

57
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,959
material and what's funny is you guys as

58
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,519
a testing agency were saying oh well you

59
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,800
you should either mix all of those

60
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:47,439
samples together or let's go for these

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,640
other high concentrated uh tissues which

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:52,239
is great again for identifying the

63
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:55,000
presence of the vroid in the garden I

64
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,480
would almost go ahead and say it's there

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,479
and if it wasn't virid it's something

66
00:02:56,479 --> 00:03:02,158
else um but you know let's uh if we

67
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:05,798
start doing it off of tips there is the

68
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:07,919
uh greater likelihood uh that given the

69
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:10,120
plant assuming the plant had vroid in it

70
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:12,598
at all that we're using uh material

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:15,158
that's so new uh and has grown so

72
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:16,959
vigorously that it is um thyroid free

73
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:18,359
and if we take that cutting with clean

74
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,000
tools now the part about this I had

75
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,519
mentioned is that to take that top off

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,840
your hands have been cleaned in bleach

77
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,759
water your tools clean and bleach water

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,759
actually have a vinyl apron with bleachy

79
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:32,158
sponges in it and three sets of tools

80
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:33,959
and gloves uh so I can do that and of

81
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:37,359
course from talking to zamir he said yes

82
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:40,199
thyroid can live and bleach as well but

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,760
not well and not for a long time so we

84
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,759
you know it's the best we have right is

85
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:45,919
to use that you know let's we're not

86
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:48,280
going to ask for trouble we're going to

87
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,719
do our best to eliminate it but that

88
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,000
will'll be cleaning the plant cleaning

89
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:53,000
the tools and then taking another

90
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,760
cutting

91
00:04:01,189 --> 00:04:08,759
