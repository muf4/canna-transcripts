uc berkeley

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:45,438
the cannabis research center uses an

45
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,759
interdisciplinary approach

46
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,359

of cannabis policy

48
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:54,000
the environment and cannabis producing

00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,599
discussion about the environmental

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,478
impacts of cannabis production

53
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:06,078
in our conversation we discuss why it's

54
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:07,840
important to better understand how

55
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:08,878
cannabis cultivation affects the

56
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,120
environment

57
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:12,000
how cannabis compares to other crops in

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,560
terms of its

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,840
environmental impact how outdoor

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,878
cannabis cultivation

61
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,360
affects rivers and streams the challenge

62
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,000
of collecting data on unpermitted

63
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
cannabis

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,598
farms and how easing the permit and

65
00:02:24,719 --> 00:02:27,759
licensure

66
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,238
requirements for farmers could lead to

67
00:02:27,759 --> 00:02:32,239
better environmental outcomes

68
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,400

butzik

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,560
good morning van thanks for joining us

104
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:54,318
my pleasure thanks for having me

105
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,598
all right and you are the co-director of

106
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,479
the cannabis research

107
00:03:55,598 --> 00:04:00,000
center at uc berkeley i was wondering if

108
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,719
you could briefly explain to the

109
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,680
listeners

110
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,280
what is the work that you do there sure

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,239
so the cannabis research center

112
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,640
is a group of interdisciplinary scholars

113
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,480
who

114
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:15,438
focus on the intersection of cannabis

115
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:16,238
cannabis policy cannabis producing

116
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,839
communities

117
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:22,078
and the environment so i think that the

118
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,758
sort of three most important parts of

119
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,199
our work is one we're interdisciplinary

120
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,680
we have natural sciences

121
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,439
people who are ecologists and freshwater

122
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,560
scientists we have social scientists we

123
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:32,800
have anthropologists

124
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:34,319
in our group we have people from the law

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,280
school in our group we have geographers

126
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,000
in our group we have

127
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:39,359
economists in our group so that's one of

128
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,839
the key things is our research really

129
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,479
tries to

130
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,679
take a 360 degree look at cannabis

131
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,319
issues

132
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,720
the second sort of important part of our

133
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:50,079
group

134
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,120
is that we're really focused on sort of

135
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:55,599
the communities that produce cannabis

136
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,879
the policies that impact cannabis and

137
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,199
then

138
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,279
broadly how they're all related to the

139
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:04,560
natural environment so we're interested

140
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:06,399
in sort of how policy changes how

141
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,478
farmers act and then how that

142
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,599
you know output leads to environmental

143
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:11,519
changes

144
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,039
um so we're we're sort of having an

145
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,839
issue we're not sort of focused on the

146
00:05:13,038 --> 00:05:15,279
health side

147
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:17,599
of things we're really focused sort of

148
00:05:15,279 --> 00:05:18,559
on this environment and community side

149
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,919
of things

150
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,680
and then the third thing that i think

151
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,198
makes our our center unique is we're

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,120
really interested

153
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:29,600
in being sort of active participants in

154
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,199
the cannabis space insofar as we're

155
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
interested in our research informing

156
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,879
policy

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,038
and public decisions so we do a lot of

158
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:38,959
outreach we try to make our research

159
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,639
accessible to the broad public

160
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,799
and try to make sure that our research

161
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,319
is useful to the policy makers and the

162
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,319
public as they make decisions

163
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:50,478
excellent and why do you think it's

164
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,560
important to

165
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,959
better understand the environmental

166
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:58,560
impacts of cannabis cultivation

167
00:05:54,959 --> 00:06:01,680
what's at stake that's a great question

168
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,519
um you know a bit of background so i

169
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,478
started researching cannabis probably

170
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,279
six or seven years ago and at the time

171
00:06:06,478 --> 00:06:10,240
we were seeing

172
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,599
a lot of really nice pieces uh in the

173
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
popular press about some of the

174
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,199
environmental impacts of outdoor

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
cannabis cultivation

176
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,038
and you know my thought as a researcher

177
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,319
was was this like really going on you

178
00:06:19,038 --> 00:06:21,759
know is this the case are we seeing

179
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,199
these big impacts and of course when we

180
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,720
started digging into it

181
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,120
uh what we found was was a pretty

182
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
complex story and we found of course

183
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,439
that that a lot of the

184
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,879
the information was just unknown right

185
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,360
there wasn't data about

186
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:36,319
these impacts so to a large extent a lot

187
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,840
of the work we've done

188
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,199
is just trying to set a baseline of

189
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:40,638
trying to understand like what's

190
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,280
actually happening

191
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,720
um with cannabis and the environment you

192
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:47,198
know are these effects something that

193
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,039
that we need to be focused on

194
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,560
um you know what's at stake with with

195
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,918
cannabis cultivation

196
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,839
and the environment i think is two

197
00:06:51,918 --> 00:06:57,279
things um

198
00:06:53,839 --> 00:07:00,638
first you know historically uh cannabis

199
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:02,879
has been cultivated in remote areas

200
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,160
of the world and this is true in

201
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:06,240
california where we have sort of

202
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
historical cultivation spots up in the

203
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
emerald triangle which

204
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,119
are really difficult to sort of access

205
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,319
but it's actually true sort of

206
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,079
internationally as well you know the

207
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
areas where cannabis has been grown in

208
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:18,399
thailand or

209
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,399
other other places across the globe are

210
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,679
usually you know in remote areas and

211
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,679
these remote areas also

212
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,439
are oftentimes of high sort of

213
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,319
environmental values right so these are

214
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:28,160
areas that

215
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,240
have a lot of natural value to us have

216
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,520
not been developed into cities and

217
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,639
suburbs yet so

218
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:34,879
there's sort of this natural

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,639
intersection of places where cannabis

220
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,000
has historically been grown

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:43,199
and at high environmental values

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
the second sort of part to the question

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,720
of what's at stake

224
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,120
is we think because cannabis regulation

225
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,919
is sort of starting from scratch

226
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,879
there's the potential for how cannabis

227
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:55,198
is regulated

228
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,439
as an agricultural crop relative to the

229
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,360
environment to change how we think about

230
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:05,120
sort of agricultural regulation broadly

231
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,120
so for example in california the

232
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,319
the environmental standards which

233
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,360
cannabis farmers

234
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,960
are held are are generally higher

235
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,479
than what we would see for other

236
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,399
agricultural crops right there's a lot

237
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:20,000
more permanent involved

238
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:21,758
it's basically all organic and you know

239
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,439
a big question is well

240
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,360
if we can figure out how to make the

241
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:26,719
cannabis industry successful

242
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
while meeting these really high

243
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,039
environmental standards can this be a

244
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,599
model that can be expanded to all of

245
00:08:31,038 --> 00:08:33,598
agriculture

246
00:08:35,918 --> 00:08:41,199
and how do you go about collecting the

247
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:44,639
data to do your analysis

248
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:46,320
so we use you know we have this

249
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:48,480
interdisciplinary team so we use sort of

250
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,800
mixed methods and so our data collection

251
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
involves a lot of different things so

252
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:55,278
you know personally

253
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,039
my work is basically used i i come from

254
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,159
a background of sort of economics and

255
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:59,679
geography

256
00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:01,120
and so the first thing i did was i

257
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:03,838
wanted to know well how many cannabis

258
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,639
farms are there and where are they at

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,800
and so we used remote sensing data high

260
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:10,319
resolution satellite data

261
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:11,838
basically what you see if you go to

262
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,600
google earth then you get the highest

263
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,680
resolution data possible

264
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
and we use that to identify cannabis

265
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,079
growth throughout

266
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:22,000
different areas of california so that

267
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,759
kind of gave us like a spatial footprint

268
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,958
of where these farms were how big they

269
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:30,639
were how they were changing over time

270
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:31,039
and then we have um there's starting to

271
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:33,439
be

272
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:34,319
some pretty good data coming from the

273
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,600
state

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,720
so uh in in california basically

275
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,360
cannabis users

276
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,360
are cannabis sorry cannabis producers uh

277
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,680
need to record their water usage

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,480
so we're starting to get a pretty good

279
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:48,399
um

280
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,480
idea of how much water cannabis

281
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
producers are cannabis producers are

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,800
using

283
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,480
and where that water is coming from and

284
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:56,399
so that's sort of data collected as part

285
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,600
of the permitting process in the state

286
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,679
there's a number of other sort of um

287
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,040
interesting data pieces that are coming

288
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:06,159
out from the permitting process

289
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:06,958
as well of course those don't that data

290
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,600
doesn't cover

291
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,799
non-permitted farms and so to get at

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
non-permitted farms

293
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:14,559
and and what non-permitted farmers are

294
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,440
doing uh we've done a lot of survey work

295
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:18,719
so we've

296
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,680
we've done two large surveys of cannabis

297
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,920
farmers

298
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,599
both permitted and unpermitted uh

299
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,159
focused primarily in california and a

300
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
little bit in southern oregon

301
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,480
and we're gonna have another another uh

302
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:33,199
survey kicking off next year so

303
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
basically this combination of like

304
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,440
satellite data so

305
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,720
collected from from satellites uh data

306
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,760
that we can we can get from the

307
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,000
permitted industry

308
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:42,958
through sort of uh records requests to

309
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,039
the state

310
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:46,000
and then the third one is sort of asking

311
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:49,199
growers

312
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
themselves through surveys

313
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:54,319
interesting i wonder what sort of um

314
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:58,239
incentives do you need to cert

315
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:00,320
to um what sort of incentives do you

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,000
need to use to encourage some of the

317
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,600
non-permitted people to

318
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,440
give up their information i imagine that

319
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,120
might be a little tricky

320
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,160
yeah it is tricky um you know i think

321
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,120
the the surveys we've done and what i

322
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,439
want to say that

323
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,759
we you know i think we've been able to

324
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,240
get pretty good participation

325
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,759
by non-permitted growers but i think

326
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,200
there's probably a certain type of

327
00:11:21,759 --> 00:11:24,720
non-permitted grower who we're not

328
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,720
getting participation from

329
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,000
right who just doesn't know it no

330
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,680
interest in

331
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
sort of giving this information i think

332
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:32,639
that the type of non-permitted farmer

333
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,360
we're getting

334
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:36,799
is someone who you know if if the

335
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
economic situation was a little

336
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:39,919
different in the permanent market and if

337
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,479
it was a little bit easier to get

338
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,199
permitted

339
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,480
might be interested in it you know but

340
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,800
uh for now

341
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,920
it is sort of you know staying on the

342
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:50,000
outside

343
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:52,000
um you know i think for a lot of

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,440
non-permitted farmers there they feel

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,919
like they're sort of

346
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,440
vilified right they're they're seeing

347
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,958
sort of this press about the the

348
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,600
negative impacts of cannabis on the

349
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,319
environment

350
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,159
and you know usually that is is blaming

351
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
sort of the non-permitted growers

352
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:07,360
and you know there's a lot of

353
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:10,639
non-permitted growers who

354
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:12,480
are are using you know totally totally

355
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
environmentally sustainable production

356
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,200
techniques

357
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
and are not getting permitted for other

358
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,639
reasons you know not related to

359
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
you know their care for the environment

360
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,839
at all and i think that there's

361
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,600
there's plenty of growers who want to be

362
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,519
able to tell that story and what

363
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,440
want that story told and so i think

364
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,159
that's the incentive for them to

365
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,399
to do the survey work do the surveys is

366
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,480
um you know if they feel like

367
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,000
they're not being represented fairly

368
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,800
this is a chance for

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,440
for the data to show you know what

370
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,240
they're actually doing

371
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,839
right that makes sense okay so we've

372
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,519
we've sort of set up what the mission is

373
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,720
for your for your group and how you're

374
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,078
collecting data

375
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:55,920
what have you found so far yeah

376
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:57,919
we found uh a number of things i mean

377
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:59,759
and i'm going to give a little bit of

378
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:02,559
plug here right

379
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,319
if the listeners want to check out um

380
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:07,759
our website which is

381
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,839
uh crc.org so this is

382
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,399
the crc the cannabis research center

383
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,639
crc.berkeley.edu

384
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,399
uh we have something we call our science

385
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,240
briefs which are basically

386
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,078
uh distilled versions of our

387
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,519
peer-reviewed work and i think we have

388
00:13:20,078 --> 00:13:23,199
three of them up right now we have two

389
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
more that are in production

390
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,639
and this will give you like a really

391
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,560
good overview of all the research we've

392
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,360
done without having to go read the

393
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:31,679
primary

394
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,120
academic work uh the primary academic

395
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:35,919
work is also on our website so you're

396
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,159
welcome to check that out as well

397
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:39,919
but what have we found uh generally i

398
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:42,000
think what we found is that

399
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,919
uh one there's a lot of cannabis farms

400
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,839
um you know

401
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:47,759
most of which are unpermitted in cal and

402
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,560
this is related to california so almost

403
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,639
all of our

404
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,679
research thus far has been california

405
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,320
focused

406
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:56,479
um there's a lot of research most of it

407
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,040
is related to

408
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,600
to california uh sorry there's a lot of

409
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:02,799
farms

410
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,278
most of the farms are are unpermitted so

411
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:06,799
you know probably a quarter maybe are

412
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:10,240
are permitted at this point probably

413
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,958
maybe less it's hard to put a a number

414
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,480
on it

415
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:15,278
now is that is that a number of farms or

416
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,440
is that just

417
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,480
sort of the percentage of the overall

418
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,480
kind of footprint

419
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,079
yeah no that's a great question so

420
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,839
that's the number of farms

421
00:14:22,078 --> 00:14:26,159
uh what we have found is that the farms

422
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,920
that get permitted are on average much

423
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,799
larger than the farms that don't get

424
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:31,919
permitted

425
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:35,919
so i think that the amount

426
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:37,519
of acreage that's permitted

427
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,078
is certainly higher than the number of

428
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,560
farms um

429
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,439
if that makes sense yeah that does make

430
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,719
sense i guess it would be

431
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,399
it's much harder to to hide a big farm

432
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,720
yeah i think it's it's about hiding and

433
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,879
it's also just about cost right so

434
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,320
i mean the cost to permit a big farm is

435
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,240
not all that different than the cost to

436
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,720
permit a small farm

437
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,639
um and and so you know you have some

438
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,399
economies of scale there

439
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,320
uh there are different sort of license

440
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,559
fees for different size farms but most

441
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,000
the the cost is not actually like the

442
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,719
fees you're paying

443
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,240
to the state or the county it's usually

444
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,320
the upgrades you have to make to your

445
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,000
facility before it can get permitted

446
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,160
and those oftentimes are not actually

447
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,198
related to the farm itself so a good

448
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,278
example is

449
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:22,559
you know in mendocino and humboldt

450
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:24,879
county

451
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,479
where a lot of people have sort of these

452
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:29,759
long private

453
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,399
dirt roads going back to the farms

454
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,759
to get your permit the whole road

455
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,159
leading to the farm

456
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,278
has to meet certain environmental

457
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:39,120
standards

458
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:40,720
and so you might have to replace you

459
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,560
know three or four or five

460
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:44,000
culverts along the road before you get

461
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:46,319
your cannabis permit

462
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,759
and so you know replacing those culverts

463
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
cost the same amount whether you're

464
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,959
permitting a

465
00:15:49,039 --> 00:15:54,958
quarter acre or two acres of land

466
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:56,399
and so you know i think this is there's

467
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:58,078
some real economies of scale and the

468
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,799
permitting process for the larger

469
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:00,799
larger farms

470
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:05,198
okay i didn't mean to derail you there

471
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:07,198
but i think you were you're

472
00:16:05,198 --> 00:16:08,479
yeah okay right so what did we find so

473
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,159
lots of farms

474
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
uh most of them are non-permitted and

475
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,679
most of them are still small

476
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,720
right so i mean relative to other types

477
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:17,838
of agriculture

478
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:22,399
so um you know most farms are still

479
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:23,920
less than an acre in california um

480
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,600
which is which is still you know really

481
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:28,240
small farm uh

482
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,240
space wise and even the larger farms are

483
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:31,839
still relatively small right even

484
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,720
i think the biggest farms you have are

485
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,440
maybe approaching 30 or 40 acres now

486
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,440
and that's still a pretty small farm um

487
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,680
you know related to farm size we see

488
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,959
a gradient basically with smaller farms

489
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,479
in the northern part of the state and

490
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:45,758
then the farm's getting larger as you

491
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,480
move into the

492
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,159
central coast and southern california

493
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,199
with santa barbara sort of having the

494
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,159
most acreage

495
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:55,039
um that area from an environmental

496
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:57,519
perspective

497
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,039
uh what does that mean uh basically it

498
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,519
means that we haven't seen

499
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:02,480
you know cannabis become like a dominant

500
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,078
land cover type

501
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,480
in most parts of the state we we haven't

502
00:17:06,078 --> 00:17:08,558
seen

503
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,759
huge amounts of timber removal from

504
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:12,879
cannabis although

505
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:12,879
we have seen some

506
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,279
on the water use side what we found is

507
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,439
that

508
00:17:17,279 --> 00:17:21,359
it's really about the timing of the

509
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,798
water use and not so much

510
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:26,479
the amount of water so cannabis

511
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:29,679
seems to use about the same amount of

512
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,000
water as any other agricultural plant

513
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,280
you know two to three acre feet of water

514
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,160
per year

515
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:38,240
um the conflict and this is somewhat

516
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,200
california specific but the conflict

517
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,519
occurs because um you know california's

518
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,558
grown in the summer

519
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,639
cannabis is growing in the summer

520
00:17:46,558 --> 00:17:49,839
in california we have drought conditions

521
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:51,120
every summer that's just we have a

522
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,798
mediterranean climate so we

523
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:55,839
generally don't get any any rain from

524
00:17:52,798 --> 00:17:58,720
say may till october

525
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:00,639
and so the plants require irrigation uh

526
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,279
this is the same time that of course the

527
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,000
streams

528
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:05,440
and rivers are at their lowest point um

529
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,558
because there hasn't been any rain for a

530
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,320
number of months and so there's a

531
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:11,119
conflict there

532
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:11,599
what we found is that this conflict can

533
00:18:11,119 --> 00:18:14,479
be

534
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:16,240
mediated through storage so if farmers

535
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
can store water in the winter and then

536
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,679
use it in the summer that works really

537
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,599
well

538
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,440
of course there's some some issues with

539
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:24,798
storage insofar as

540
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,798
it's expensive and you need to have

541
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,558
enough

542
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,240
but we have found that it does seem like

543
00:18:28,558 --> 00:18:30,720
some of these water-related conflicts

544
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
can be

545
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,880
can be mitigated uh through good

546
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,880
planning and investment in storage

547
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:42,079
yeah and that stood out to me when i was

548
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:45,678
reading the the brief uh

549
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:49,359
put together about water usage and

550
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,798
i i imagine from a cultivator standpoint

551
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:56,399
the fact that the summers are dry

552
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:58,240
in california is a good thing because

553
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,240
coming from the northeast and having

554
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,519
limited experience with

555
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,839
cannabis cultivation the hardest part is

556
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:07,119
when you have flowering plants and you

557
00:19:05,839 --> 00:19:09,439
get into the wet

558
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:10,399
and raw part of the year you have an

559
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,440
issue with

560
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,038
with mold and other unwanted effects

561
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,480
so um it's just interesting to me that

562
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,759
you know there's a benefit there but

563
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,599
obviously there's an

564
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,798
environmental trade-off with the water

565
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:24,399
usage

566
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:25,759
yeah no i think that's i think that's

567
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,360
probably right on i mean i think there's

568
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:29,919
a lot of benefits to the

569
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:30,959
the climate out here for growing and you

570
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,400
know having this low

571
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,480
humidity for for uh you know especially

572
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,000
the latter part of the season when

573
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,440
plants are flowering

574
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,119
um but yeah it it does

575
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,120
line up to exactly when you don't want

576
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,839
to be taking water from the environment

577
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:48,798
um so so storage is important we also

578
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:53,119
see a lot of people

579
00:19:48,798 --> 00:19:54,879
using uh groundwater so using wells

580
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,359
you know we have some concerns that you

581
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:59,280
know the wells are of course connected

582
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,558
hydrologically oftentimes to the surface

583
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:03,759
water flows

584
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,440
so um you know making sure that if

585
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,440
people are using wells there's not too

586
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,600
many wells on one stream and they're not

587
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,640
hydrologically connected to the

588
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:14,798
surface water um or the people are using

589
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,600
the wells in the winter to pump water

590
00:20:14,798 --> 00:20:20,480
into storage

591
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:22,558
which works works really nicely as well

592
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,240
and now i'm curious how do your findings

593
00:20:22,558 --> 00:20:26,480
change when you kind of look at

594
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,240
indoor cultivation versus outdoor

595
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,400
cultivation

596
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,919
so so far we haven't done a whole lot

597
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,000
with indoor cultivation

598
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,200
and there's a few reasons for that first

599
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,759
is that um

600
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,080
sort of indoor cultivation environmental

601
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:44,158
impacts are are more or less

602
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:46,359
regulated by the municipalities so um

603
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,559
you know for example water use a

604
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:51,038
municipality uh

605
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:53,839
you know is charging a rate for the

606
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:56,558
water use and the cannabis grower is

607
00:20:53,839 --> 00:20:56,959
is paying that rate using the water and

608
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:59,359
then

609
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,360
um you know it's probably going into a

610
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:04,240
sewer system where the water is treated

611
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,798
so we're not particularly concerned

612
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,919
about

613
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:10,240
the environmental impacts

614
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:11,679
of indoor cannabis production in the

615
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,038
same way we are

616
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,640
outdoor cannabis production just because

617
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:16,400
there's you know not a lot of exposure

618
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,720
to the environment

619
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,559
of course the caveat there is indoor

620
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,519
production can take a tremendous amount

621
00:21:20,558 --> 00:21:23,839
of energy

622
00:21:21,519 --> 00:21:24,720
and so broadly if we're interested in

623
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:28,399
energy use

624
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,159
and carbon uh carbon production

625
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,840
and being concerned about global warming

626
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,799
that's an area where sort of the indoor

627
00:21:31,839 --> 00:21:34,399
market

628
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:35,918
conflicts with sort of environmental

629
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,480
concerns

630
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,200
now we have not done a whole lot of

631
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,400
research

632
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,480
on that issue although i do suspect that

633
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,679
in the future uh

634
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,558
making indoor farms as energy efficient

635
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,600
as possible will

636
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,119
will be something that state

637
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:58,399
and local governments look at as they

638
00:21:53,119 --> 00:22:01,519
try to reduce carbon emissions okay

639
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,400
and you had mentioned that part of your

640
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:06,158
your research has to do with policy and

641
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,240
regulations and sort of how that

642
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,320
impacts the industry and i know it's

643
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,440
been four years since

644
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:16,000
adult use was approved in california

645
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,320
how if at all has the environmental

646
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,919
impact of cannabis cultivation changed

647
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,639
in the last four years that's a great

648
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:26,400
question

649
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:29,440
and i'm not sure we can answer

650
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,798
um sort of quantitatively

651
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,200
but i think we can give some some

652
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:36,558
qualitative answers to that

653
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,400
uh first i think that pretty much any

654
00:22:36,558 --> 00:22:41,440
permitted

655
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,640
cannabis farm in california

656
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,038
is going to have minimal environmental

657
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,559
impacts um the regulations are set up

658
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:50,640
such that if you're

659
00:22:48,558 --> 00:22:52,158
following the rules and you're able to

660
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
get your permits which means you know

661
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,600
your site was approved for cannabis

662
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
production

663
00:22:55,599 --> 00:22:58,639
the odds that you're doing something

664
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,400
that

665
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,919
is really environmentally harmful i

666
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:05,038
think are pretty low

667
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,559
um i think the rules are set up to to

668
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,640
sort of prohibit that

669
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:10,399
so in that way i think that probably you

670
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,919
know cannabis you're buying on the legal

671
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,519
market in california

672
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,799
that's outdoor grown or mixed light

673
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:15,599
grown which is sort of what we've

674
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:18,319
studied

675
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:20,399
um it's probably you know i i would not

676
00:23:18,319 --> 00:23:22,079
worry about its environmental footprint

677
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,240
too much i think it's probably pretty

678
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,918
good

679
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,440
uh sort of where there's been a where i

680
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:30,799
think there's a lot less known

681
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,759
is because the environmental regulation

682
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:33,519
i mean partially

683
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:35,839
because environmental regulations have

684
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,798
been so difficult for many growers to

685
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:40,639
meet

686
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:41,278
um you know as i said most farmers are

687
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,960
still

688
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:44,558
not doing it in the permanent are not

689
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,798
growing in the permanent market

690
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,639
and so you know we don't really know

691
00:23:46,798 --> 00:23:50,960
what the environmental effects of

692
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,880
those farms are that's what we're you

693
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,640
know we're still trying to quantify that

694
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,400
um i think it's sort of a balancing act

695
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,559
by the state to try to

696
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,080
on one hand you you want to get people

697
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:02,639
compliant and get them in the legal

698
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,038
market

699
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:06,240
which is is you know then we can sort of

700
00:24:05,038 --> 00:24:10,079
assure that they're

701
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,079
having high environmental standards

702
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,839
uh yet if you make the environmental

703
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:15,278
standards too high and too costly for

704
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,918
people to comply then they're

705
00:24:15,278 --> 00:24:20,079
they're more willing to stay outside you

706
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,400
know and not join the permitted industry

707
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:24,079
so it's a it's a fine line that the

708
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,679
state's trying to walk there to both

709
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,519
encourage compliance

710
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,640
um while also maintaining a high

711
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:30,639
environmental standards

712
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,400
so for those of us who aren't

713
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:36,159
cultivators in california what are some

714
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,880
of those standards and which ones are

715
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,679
sort of the hardest ones to meet

716
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,679
yeah i mean basically you need to i mean

717
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,320
and i'm not i'm not a lawyer so if

718
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,798
you are a cultivator in california uh

719
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,879
you know

720
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:49,839
talk to talk to a consultant or a lawyer

721
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,559
before you uh

722
00:24:49,839 --> 00:24:54,079
you know say oh this is all i have to do

723
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,200
but essentially i mean you need to get a

724
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:58,158
permit from

725
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,400
um oftentimes three different uh sort of

726
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,000
state groups so you need your local

727
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,038
permit which is

728
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,558
from your local government

729
00:25:05,038 --> 00:25:07,679
you know if you're in rural california

730
00:25:06,558 --> 00:25:08,480
that's usually going to be your county

731
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,080
government

732
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,839
and the county government will also will

733
00:25:10,079 --> 00:25:13,519
often say we'll also

734
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:15,359
often have some type of zoning that will

735
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:16,639
say okay you can only grow cannabis on

736
00:25:15,359 --> 00:25:20,158
land that's

737
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,278
zoned this way has this soil type and

738
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,520
this slope

739
00:25:21,278 --> 00:25:25,119
is located so far from public land and

740
00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,519
so far from schools and

741
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:28,558
you know all of these other things so

742
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:30,158
you know basically

743
00:25:28,558 --> 00:25:32,879
that sort of first level of regulation

744
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:35,440
the zoning regulation makes it so that

745
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,400
you know you're not going to permit a

746
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,640
farm

747
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,559
on land that's that's not appropriate

748
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:43,120
for agricultural production

749
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,119
right so if you meet that first standard

750
00:25:43,119 --> 00:25:48,000
it basically means you have a

751
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,879
parcel that your local municipality has

752
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,119
said okay

753
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,640
this is set up to to successfully grow

754
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:54,479
cannabis without there being too much of

755
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
environmental threat

756
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,278
so that's the first step and that's

757
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,000
actually a pretty you know for a lot of

758
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:00,000
farmers

759
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,440
there's still most counties in

760
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,038
california do not allow cannabis

761
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:06,240
cultivation so

762
00:26:03,038 --> 00:26:07,759
um outdoor cannabis cultivation

763
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,519
and so that's actually really a big

764
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:12,400
challenge

765
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:13,599
then you oftentimes need to show uh that

766
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,080
you have a water right

767
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:17,759
right so that you you have enough water

768
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:18,319
to grow cannabis before you can get a

769
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:20,879
permit

770
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,000
and so this can be sort of a combination

771
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,840
of

772
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,440
dealing with the state water boards as

773
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:26,639
well as the department of fish and

774
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,798
wildlife

775
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,120
and i don't understand completely the

776
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:32,319
minutia of all of the regulations there

777
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,158
but essentially

778
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:36,960
um you know you need to show that you

779
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,440
have enough water to grow cannabis

780
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,440
without

781
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,960
taking water from streams at the time of

782
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,759
year where

783
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,480
it would be impactful so you know a good

784
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:47,038
example

785
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:49,360
of uh you know the difference between

786
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,599
cannabis and other agriculture is

787
00:26:49,359 --> 00:26:53,278
you know all of these north coast farms

788
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:55,359
some of them have water rights to

789
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,200
to draw water from the rivers to

790
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:59,038
irrigate their crop

791
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,960
but they're not allowed to draw water

792
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,599
during the summer so they can only draw

793
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,600
water from

794
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:07,199
essentially november until march

795
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:08,798
of course when they need the water is

796
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,000
the summer which is

797
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:13,759
uh and so that that means essentially

798
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,038
their water right is only good to take

799
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,400
water out for storage

800
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:18,640
it's not good to actually irrigate

801
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,679
directly on plants where you know most

802
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,840
other

803
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,600
farmers in california they're irrigating

804
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:24,319
in the summer directly on their plants

805
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:26,158
you know from

806
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,359
from the the water system the water

807
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,640
right that they have

808
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:31,359
so this is you know one of those

809
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,640
differences uh you also need to

810
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,639
you know when you're going through and

811
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,200
getting your permits you need to

812
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,759
have um you know your roads need to be

813
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,558
up to

814
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:40,558
to standards

815
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,960
and this is somewhat disputed and i've

816
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:47,759
heard lawyers say both things but

817
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,720
if you're doing any production or any

818
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:51,440
manufacturing

819
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,159
or processing on your farm and it

820
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:55,519
becomes

821
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:57,520
a sort of a manufacturing center

822
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:58,798
then all of a sudden everything in your

823
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:01,839
facility needs to be

824
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:02,798
ada compliant so you need to have an ada

825
00:28:01,839 --> 00:28:04,959
bathroom

826
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:06,879
you need to have you know parking spots

827
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,558
for for handicapped people

828
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,559
and you know this is all fine but if we

829
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:13,038
think of this as all just happening at a

830
00:28:10,558 --> 00:28:14,240
small farm out in the woods

831
00:28:13,038 --> 00:28:16,000
you know all of a sudden that's a big

832
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,679
burden when you know somebody would

833
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,119
normally just let the person trimming go

834
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,038
to the bathroom in their house

835
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:22,479
and now they have to build a ada

836
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,319
compliant bathroom

837
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,919
to have the trimmer go to the bathroom

838
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:28,000
somewhere you know it becomes it becomes

839
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,278
difficult

840
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
so there's you know sort of all these

841
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:32,240
different layers of regulations that i

842
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,759
think have made

843
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,798
have made uh the process uh both

844
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:39,359
uh high performing so if you meet the

845
00:28:38,798 --> 00:28:41,519
standard

846
00:28:39,359 --> 00:28:43,599
i think you are performing really high

847
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,679
but the bar is also so high

848
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:47,038
for some growers it's it's just very

849
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,960
difficult to

850
00:28:47,038 --> 00:28:52,079
to figure out how to meet the meet the

851
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,079
standards and get the permits

852
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:55,839
okay well now i'm going to put you on

853
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,319
the spot and give you

854
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:59,038
the magic wand and then if you were in

855
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:02,158
charge or you're

856
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:04,319
able to either remove some

857
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:06,000
regulations or maybe enact some new ones

858
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,319
to really sort of

859
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,599
um reduce the environmental impact of

860
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:12,639
cannabis cultivation

861
00:29:09,599 --> 00:29:13,119
what would you what would you do i mean

862
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,759
i think

863
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,479
for for me it's it's the main thing is

864
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:19,599
getting

865
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,640
um getting more people into the

866
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,158
regulated market

867
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,200
and i think we do that probably through

868
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,720
um two things first

869
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,319
we need to have uh more help for farmers

870
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,798
who are trying to join the regulated

871
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:35,519
market

872
00:29:32,798 --> 00:29:37,278
i mean if you think of a small cannabis

873
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:38,960
farmer who's been growing cannabis for

874
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,038
10 years in humboldt county

875
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,240
and they have a good supply chain on the

876
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:44,960
unregulated market

877
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,440
and they can sell it for cash and you

878
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,679
know

879
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:49,519
they know what they're doing the

880
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,120
incentives to join the regulated market

881
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:53,119
are not that high

882
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:54,558
and and and the barriers to get there

883
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,678
are pretty high as far as getting

884
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:58,000
you know just working through all the

885
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:59,919
permits especially

886
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,038
if we think about you know not you know

887
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,880
i don't want to generalize about

888
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:03,440
cannabis farmers but many of the people

889
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:07,120
who have been

890
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:09,278
active in the in in in illicit industry

891
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:11,199
probably don't have you know the

892
00:30:09,278 --> 00:30:13,200
networks and connections that make it

893
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,519
easy to join the permitted industry

894
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:17,759
and so i think the state can step up and

895
00:30:15,519 --> 00:30:20,639
as far as like helping

896
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:23,119
lower those barriers to compliance so

897
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:24,880
you know having some free consulting for

898
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:26,719
cannabis farmers

899
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:29,200
um you know having peer-to-peer

900
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,000
mentoring for cannabis farmers

901
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,679
having some programs that um you know

902
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,640
where the state is willing to pay for

903
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,679
some of the cost

904
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:39,919
of of helping these farmers get into the

905
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,880
regulated market so that's the first

906
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:44,159
thing i would do is

907
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:46,559
is somehow reduce the barriers to

908
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:48,240
to compliance and i think the state can

909
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,960
do that without lowering their standards

910
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,200
through

911
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:52,079
through supplying supply and health to

912
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,399
the farmers

913
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,000
um you know to work through this process

914
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:59,278
for the first time

915
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,159
and then the second thing is um you know

916
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:01,679
eventually

917
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,320
there needs to be some type of

918
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,200
enforcement on the non-regulated farmers

919
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,639
right so that

920
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,880
that they don't have the incentive to

921
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,559
stay in the regulated market

922
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,960
this is a really tricky question because

923
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:14,319
a lot of the unregulated farmers are not

924
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,240
doing anything

925
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:18,158
uh environmentally wrong you know we

926
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,159
know many of them are sustainable

927
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:22,559
farmers and they're just making a living

928
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:25,120
you know on these small farms and so

929
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:26,639
you know we don't want to sort of uh

930
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:29,918
bring the hammer down on people

931
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:32,640
at the same time without

932
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,360
without some threat of of enforcement

933
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,759
against

934
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:38,158
non-regulated farms it's hard to see why

935
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:41,759
a lot of people would would get into

936
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:43,200
the regulated industry so part of the

937
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:45,119
problem and this is sort of the

938
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,399
elephant in the room that you know

939
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:48,558
policymakers have

940
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,518
always struggled to deal with is the

941
00:31:48,558 --> 00:31:51,839
fact that camp

942
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,640
california just produces far far far

943
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:57,038
more cannabis than it consumes

944
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,759
so right now there's no way to

945
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:00,480
distribute

946
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:02,558
cannabis that's legally grown in

947
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:05,839
california outside the state

948
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:06,639
right so we can't sell our cannabis to

949
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,959
illinois

950
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,799
even though it's not legal to smoke

951
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,278
cannabis there right

952
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:14,480
and so basically that means that if

953
00:32:13,278 --> 00:32:17,119
every farmer

954
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,880
were to uh join the legal market there

955
00:32:17,119 --> 00:32:19,759
would simply be way too much cannabis in

956
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,399
california

957
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:23,519
you know it would swamp the legal market

958
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,918
um

959
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:28,558
and so eventually there needs to be some

960
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:30,880
way for cannabis farmers in california

961
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:31,839
to sell their cannabis legally outside

962
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:35,919
of the state

963
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:38,398
um federally that's not possible though

964
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:39,840
um again i don't know the minutia of the

965
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:42,000
laws but

966
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:43,038
that's really sort of one of the

967
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,599
underlying

968
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:47,119
problems is simply there's an oversupply

969
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:52,158
of cannabis for how much is

970
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:53,678
is consumed in california and um

971
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,679
there needs to be some way for

972
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:56,640
california farmers to sell outside of

973
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:59,200
the state

974
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,559
and once there's a legal pathway to do

975
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,120
that then i think we'll see

976
00:33:00,558 --> 00:33:05,599
more farmers get on board and join the

977
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:07,119
regulating market

978
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:09,199
yeah it's a really it's a really

979
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:12,158
interesting point and

980
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,679
i always find it interesting to think

981
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:14,320
when cannabis does finally become

982
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,399
federally

983
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:17,678
legal and you can sell across state

984
00:33:16,398 --> 00:33:20,000
lines you know

985
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,720
where is the napa valley of cannabis

986
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,759
going to crop

987
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:25,519
up i i suspect there'll be uh quite a

988
00:33:23,759 --> 00:33:26,640
bit of cannabis coming from california

989
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,759
just with the

990
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,399
experience of the growers out there yeah

991
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:32,720
i think so

992
00:33:30,398 --> 00:33:33,839
and i think that you know that's that's

993
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,399
really the

994
00:33:33,839 --> 00:33:38,398
i mean that's really the the long-term

995
00:33:36,398 --> 00:33:40,558
solution right is

996
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:41,918
some federal legalization in some form

997
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,798
such that

998
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,360
farmers in california can export legally

999
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,398
and

1000
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:49,918
um and when that happens i think

1001
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:53,119
we'll probably see a lot more people get

1002
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,120
into the legal market

1003
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,200
all right and wrapping up here i was

1004
00:33:56,798 --> 00:34:01,359
curious to ask you sort of how has

1005
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:04,240
cannabis cultivation if at all how have

1006
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:06,079
the the practices changed over the years

1007
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,960
and have those changes been better or

1008
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,519
worse for the environment

1009
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,079
that's a great question and i mean one

1010
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,119
thing

1011
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:17,280
that i would would say is we still

1012
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,720
as sort of a research community are are

1013
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,079
just scratching the surface to

1014
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:23,759
understand the cultivation

1015
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,839
methods um i think relative to

1016
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
other agricultural crops there's just a

1017
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,039
huge diversity

1018
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,440
in the way people produce cannabis and

1019
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:33,440
grow cannabis on farms i think every

1020
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,119
i mean every it's one of the delightful

1021
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,800
things about working in this area is

1022
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,440
every cannabis farmer has sort of their

1023
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
own secret twist right that they like to

1024
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,039
do that they think helps helps them

1025
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:45,200
produce the best cannabis and

1026
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:46,960
you know whatever little niche ecosystem

1027
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,439
they're growing and so

1028
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,639
you know there's this huge um

1029
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,838
heterogeneous

1030
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,720
sort of movement and or uh

1031
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:57,920
this big diversity of growing methods in

1032
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,919
cannabis

1033
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,599
um you know the one thing that we've

1034
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,240
been able to sort of quantify a little

1035
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,880
bit

1036
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:06,000
through the satellite imagery that we

1037
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,320
use is

1038
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,599
um during earlier times in california

1039
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
essentially

1040
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:15,599
during during medical cannabis you could

1041
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,079
grow up to 99 plants and feel

1042
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:19,920
pretty safe of not having enforcement

1043
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,680
actions against you

1044
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
and so then you know because it was

1045
00:35:21,679 --> 00:35:27,039
regulated by the number of plants

1046
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,358
a lot of people grew these massive trees

1047
00:35:27,039 --> 00:35:32,400
they were you know interested in how can

1048
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:34,000
i get the most production from 99 plants

1049
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,200
and the way to do that was to just grow

1050
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:38,000
these really

1051
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,759
really huge cannabis plants um the new

1052
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,960
regulations in california are all based

1053
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,880
on square foot

1054
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,159
so you know you don't you can grow as

1055
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,400
many plants as you want

1056
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:47,440
but you do it in you know ten thousand

1057
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,119
square feet or

1058
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,559
twenty thousand square feet or five

1059
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,838
thousand square feet depending on the

1060
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:54,000
permit you have

1061
00:35:51,838 --> 00:35:56,078
and so the production practices have

1062
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,199
changed um

1063
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,000
to much smaller plants um

1064
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:03,199
and sort of packing them in tightly the

1065
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,960
other thing

1066
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,559
and so you know we've seen the we've

1067
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,400
seen a shift from

1068
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:10,239
you know a number of big plants to many

1069
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,519
many more smaller plants

1070
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,279
i mean and then the other thing that

1071
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:16,400
we've seen is uh

1072
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:17,680
mixed light and double cropping becoming

1073
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,880
really common

1074
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:24,239
so if you can do some type of

1075
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:25,039
uh light depth you can in most of

1076
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:28,239
california

1077
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:30,400
get get two crops this season and

1078
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,358
and this is becoming super common and

1079
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,800
and i would say

1080
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:34,480
i don't know if the majority of farmers

1081
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:36,480
are doing it yet but but certainly a

1082
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,639
large percentage of farmers are

1083
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,519
are now doing more than one crop a year

1084
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,559
um

1085
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:44,239
by doing some like manipulation yeah

1086
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:48,159
and i'm curious are they using

1087
00:36:44,239 --> 00:36:48,159
autoflower varieties more often too

1088
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,960
that's a good question um and i've

1089
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:56,719
talked to some growers who

1090
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:57,838
are uh but i i wouldn't be able to put

1091
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:00,639
sort of a percentage

1092
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:03,199
on that at all i would have no idea

1093
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:05,118
that's a good question

1094
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,239
yeah sure no i'm just i'm curious i know

1095
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,480
that the folks up at

1096
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:09,519
oregon cbd we've talked to seth crawford

1097
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
before and

1098
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,159
uh they're really big believers in

1099
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,039
autoflower that that's going to be the

1100
00:37:12,159 --> 00:37:14,960
future but

1101
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:16,480
maybe they're maybe they're a little too

1102
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,240
far ahead maybe that hasn't caught up

1103
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:20,880
quite yet but

1104
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,679
it's no it is definitely an interest

1105
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,200
interesting

1106
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:29,039
technology and and something that um

1107
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:32,399
yeah i mean i i if if it works right

1108
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:34,838
then i think i think um yeah there

1109
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:36,079
it certainly fits that style of

1110
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,000
production

1111
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,119
yeah and as you mentioned too some some

1112
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,679
of these folks have been

1113
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
growing cannabis for decades and they

1114
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,279
have their methods

1115
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,640
that work and maybe they're not willing

1116
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,480
to change quite yet too

1117
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:50,078
which which is fine there's definitely

1118
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,119
something to be said for

1119
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:53,119
for experience

1120
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,199
finally one more thing i wanted to ask

1121
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,079
you are there any new

1122
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,838
innovations in cultivation um that have

1123
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
you excited or that you're particularly

1124
00:38:01,838 --> 00:38:05,838
interested in

1125
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,480
that's a great question um

1126
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:16,159
it's okay if there's not no i mean

1127
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,679
there's i mean i've seen some really

1128
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:19,519
cool things i mean some of the i mean

1129
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,679
one of the neatest things i've seen is

1130
00:38:19,519 --> 00:38:24,320
is there's actually some some dry

1131
00:38:21,679 --> 00:38:26,719
farmers up in humboldt county who

1132
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:29,440
who cultivate with no irrigation at all

1133
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:32,078
and it's a very specific area where they

1134
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,639
they have uh they're on this like flood

1135
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,760
plain

1136
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:39,679
basically and um the

1137
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,560
the water table's uh fairly shallow

1138
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:43,440
and it's this really fine porous soil

1139
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:46,639
and they basically

1140
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:48,320
plant right into this poor soil and as

1141
00:38:46,639 --> 00:38:48,639
the the top of the soil and they leave

1142
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,400
it

1143
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,159
they make everything bare underneath the

1144
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,880
cannabis so like there's no

1145
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:57,039
it's just bare soil and basically as the

1146
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,920
as the soil heats up it pulls up water

1147
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,079
from below

1148
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
and basically irrigates the plant that

1149
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,680
way

1150
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,960
and um it's really cool there's some

1151
00:39:03,679 --> 00:39:06,960
great videos if you just hook up

1152
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
dry farming cannabis humboldt county

1153
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,440
you'll find some great youtube videos of

1154
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,199
it

1155
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,358
it's totally wild i mean it looks it

1156
00:39:11,199 --> 00:39:15,679
looks totally totally different

1157
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:17,039
um and so i guess that's one i mean

1158
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:18,480
that's a technology that's like very

1159
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:21,440
specific to that area

1160
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:22,800
but is is definitely uh pretty cool i

1161
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,119
mean the other thing that and this is

1162
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:27,760
indoor cultivation which i don't

1163
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,599
i'm not an expert in at all but you know

1164
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:31,359
i have had some conversations with

1165
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,640
with people who you know have had

1166
00:39:31,358 --> 00:39:36,239
careers in

1167
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:38,559
um you know big agricultural indoor

1168
00:39:36,239 --> 00:39:40,479
cultivation systems

1169
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,400
uh you know growing you know massive

1170
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,838
massive quantities of cucumbers or

1171
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,000
tomatoes

1172
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:48,239
and you know they still sort of think

1173
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,119
that the technologies used by the

1174
00:39:48,239 --> 00:39:52,239
average

1175
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,880
indoor cannabis farmer are like

1176
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:56,000
far from optimal and you know they say

1177
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,240
like relative to the type

1178
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,760
of production you know you might see in

1179
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:01,519
the netherlands for

1180
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,040
their indoor tomato production or

1181
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:03,838
cucumber production or strawberry

1182
00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:05,279
production

1183
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:07,440
you know cannabis still actually has a

1184
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,599
long way to go to sort of meet those

1185
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,639
those standards and so you know that'll

1186
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,039
be interesting to see

1187
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:13,838
when these people who aren't experts in

1188
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:16,960

as far as technology and and things like
