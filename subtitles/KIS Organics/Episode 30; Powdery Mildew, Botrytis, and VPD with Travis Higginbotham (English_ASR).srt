00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:17,219
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,770
science podcast

4
00:00:17,219 --> 00:00:22,349
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:24,089
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:25,949
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:24,089 --> 00:00:28,018
science-based perspective and draw on

8
00:00:25,949 --> 00:00:29,970
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,858
share their wisdom and knowledge my

10
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:33,719
guest this week is a repeat guest I

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:35,820
wanted to follow up again with Travis

12
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,609
Higginbotham Travis is the new director

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:40,320
of cultivation support for fluence prior

14
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:41,820
to working at fluence he worked at a

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,950
state-of-the-art environmentally

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,539
controlled greenhouse covering 50 acres

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,079
where he was the head of research and

18
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,510
development

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,340
they grew annual and perennial crops for

20
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:52,769
big-box retailers supplying the

21
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,140
northeastern United States his focus was

22
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,480
on rearing beneficial insects IPM

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,640
protocols disease testing and trialing

24
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,108
new genetics from around the world he

25
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,179
recently received his master's in

26
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:05,189
horticulture from Virginia Tech this

27
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,500
resulted in equipping irrigation booms

28
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:09,209
with lights for photo periodic flowering

29
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,790
applications to a controlled environment

30
00:01:09,209 --> 00:01:14,280
which propagated over 1.2 million

31
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:16,500
perennials from stage 3 tissue culture

32
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,920
per year he also has a Bachelors of

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,420
Science from Clemson University hey

34
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,920
Travis I really appreciate you coming

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,329
back on the show there was a lot of

36
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,728
stuff that we didn't get to touch on

37
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:29,519
during our last talk about lighting and

38
00:01:26,728 --> 00:01:31,590
you have this vast background in in

39
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:32,759
controlled environments and agriculture

40
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,150
that I'd really love to chat with you

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,689
about today yeah Chad no I'm happy to be

42
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,390
back

43
00:01:36,688 --> 00:01:40,889
eager to see what we talked about today

44
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,780
so this podcast is probably going to

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,000
jump around quite a bit but the first

46
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,118
thing I wanted to talk about was VP D

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,530
which stands for vapor pressure deficit

48
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:51,780
as you know it's a relationship between

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:54,899
temperature and humidity and I know

50
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:58,320
fluence has a VP D chart can you explain

51
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,060
what VP D is and how humidity and dew

52
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:03,959
point are important variables in

53
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:06,868
greenhouse and indoor environments sure

54
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:11,128
sure so it's a loaded question but I'm

55
00:02:06,868 --> 00:02:14,009
gonna be my best here so the VPD chart

56
00:02:11,128 --> 00:02:16,949
that we have on our high ppfd guide is

57
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:19,649
is that it's a guide and it's for people

58
00:02:16,949 --> 00:02:22,139
to kind of understand what DTD is but in

59
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,760
some way it could be pretty complex but

60
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:25,229
hopefully we don't want to do it real

61
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:29,340
quick and it can be a little bit more

62
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:32,250
simpler you know it's this is the

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:34,408
deficit VPD vapor pressure deficit it's

64
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:36,930
the difference between the amount of

65
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:39,359
moisture in the air and how much the air

66
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,609
can hold that moisture in the form of

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,549
vapor before it is condensed into do

68
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:46,290
right before it's condensed into water

69
00:02:44,549 --> 00:02:49,920
droplets on leaves and things so

70
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:53,479
whenever I think about VPD I think to

71
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:57,328
myself how much space in the air is

72
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:59,548
available for moisture and vice versa

73
00:02:57,329 --> 00:03:03,780
and usually in a greenhouse setting you

74
00:02:59,549 --> 00:03:06,810
know by based on what we feel we equate

75
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:10,169
this to humidity and in a way they're

76
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,959
tied but in a way they're not so if we

77
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:14,669
think about how plants use moisture and

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,519
how temperature can regulate this and

79
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:19,828
ultimately light can regulate it it's

80
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,810
through photorespiration photosynthesis

81
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:22,379
and ultimately transpiration in the

82
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:26,430
plant

83
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:27,989
okay so and co2 is linked to it as well

84
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:29,549
it's hard to talk about one thing

85
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:31,789
without having to talk about six others

86
00:03:29,549 --> 00:03:35,549
when it comes to this kind of stuff but

87
00:03:31,789 --> 00:03:38,400
when a plant takes a co2 molecule in

88
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:40,829
donate you have three orders of

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,379
magnitude worth of moisture come out of

90
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:45,359
that still mate so in order for that

91
00:03:43,378 --> 00:03:48,239
process to be efficient you have to have

92
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:50,489
space in the air that's open for

93
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,549
moisture and this allows the plant to

94
00:03:50,489 --> 00:03:56,519
transpire and translocate minerals

95
00:03:53,549 --> 00:03:58,530
through the plant efficiently and let's

96
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:02,579
say if it's if the air is completely

97
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:04,318
saturated with moisture and you're

98
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:06,419
getting to the plant possibly where

99
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,369
you're going from vapor and clouding in

100
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:10,169
the air of moisture to puddling on the

101
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:12,780
plant it's going to be very hard for

102
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,760
that plant to breathe so to say because

103
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,399
there's no room in the air to keep

104
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:20,848
pushing out moisture and so that's why

105
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:22,859
it's very important to understand the

106
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:25,468
relationship between humidity and VPT

107
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,180
and why why it matters does that make

108
00:04:25,468 --> 00:04:27,839
sense

109
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:31,019
so

110
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,638
we want to avoid too high of humidity in

111
00:04:31,019 --> 00:04:34,799
the sense because at that point like you

112
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,949
said the plant can't breathe but we're

113
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:40,740
also creating a better environment for

114
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:45,090
mold and mildew at that point to on the

115
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:49,710
extreme end of high humidity or high vbd

116
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:51,869
is that correct yes so so how a lot of

117
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:53,279
these pathogens work and you know we can

118
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,870
get to melody but first we can talk

119
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:57,629
about botrytis because it's very

120
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:02,100
ubiquitous it's its ever-present it's

121
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:04,379
everywhere and you have to have three

122
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,900
main positions for a pathogen to be

123
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:09,659
effective and one of those is for one

124
00:05:06,899 --> 00:05:12,388
you obviously need the pathogen to you

125
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,090
need the adequate temperature for this

126
00:05:12,389 --> 00:05:17,668
pathogen to be effective and three you

127
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:20,310
need the conducive environment and so

128
00:05:17,668 --> 00:05:22,288
when we talk about botrytis in this

129
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,910
situation for one we need to package and

130
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:26,038
we have it we have to try to spores that

131
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,750
are floating around everywhere and then

132
00:05:26,038 --> 00:05:31,199
usually you have moderate temperatures

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:32,879
which botrytis usually live you produce

134
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,460
the moderate to low temperatures

135
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:38,159
especially during the night and then you

136
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:40,469
have moisture present which is huge so

137
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,150
when they score lands on moisture which

138
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,289
could be puddled on a leaf due to high

139
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:48,929
humidity that abides the spore and the

140
00:05:46,288 --> 00:05:51,478
spore produces a germ tube and that germ

141
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,400
tube can sit over cells and produce

142
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,219
enzymes that break down the cell walls

143
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:58,319
and they are infected with botrytis if

144
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:59,070
there was not water puddling on these

145
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,649
tissues

146
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:05,699
you wouldn't be imbibing botrytis spores

147
00:06:01,649 --> 00:06:07,168
as fast so the what you're trying to do

148
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:09,719
is have a good environment for the plant

149
00:06:07,168 --> 00:06:12,990
but then you're also now with too much

150
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,370
vapor and too high of a humidity you

151
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:16,819
have a conducive environment for

152
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:22,740
pathogens to infect your plant

153
00:06:16,819 --> 00:06:24,180
mildew is similar in that it works a

154
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,220
little different than botrytis but it

155
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,740
needs a similar environment and it can

156
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,000
spread extremely fast and start

157
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:37,129
colonizing a cell after cell and in some

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,079
ways the way the cell reacts to mildew

159
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,699
some plants have a what you would call a

160
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:44,159
hypersensitive response

161
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,289
once they get infected and that's the

162
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:50,939
plant defense response against the

163
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:55,290
pathogen so let's say if a powdery

164
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,509
mildew infects a cell the plant responds

165
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,420
the plant notices this is happening and

166
00:06:57,509 --> 00:07:03,539
it tells the other cells around the

167
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:05,370
infected one to die and the plant's

168
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,129
thinking there is that it will inhibit

169
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:10,590
the growth of that pathogen but however

170
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:12,839
it's its opposite when it comes to

171
00:07:10,589 --> 00:07:14,819
botrytis and powdery mildew once that

172
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:17,099
hypersensitive response happened and

173
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,500
those other cells are dead okay now it's

174
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:21,720
easier for the pathogen to infect

175
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,610
themselves so some plant defense

176
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,800
responses are actually beneficial and

177
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:28,379
with some hypersensitive responses in

178
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,870
regard to powdery mildew or not so

179
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:33,120
that's why powdery mildew can can

180
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:38,160
colonize and move so fast when the

181
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,990
conducive environment is there so do we

182
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:46,770
have those same issues at the low

183
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:48,660
humidity end of things this is where

184
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:50,399
temperature you know an irrigation

185
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,360
strategies also come into play too and

186
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:56,159
sanitation so there's a point where you

187
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,949
know the conducive environment will

188
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,710
allow pathogens to spread and multiply

189
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:04,319
and infect you know at a rate that we

190
00:08:01,709 --> 00:08:07,349
can't control when we have the

191
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:09,779
environmental conditions and a certain

192
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,850
level to where we can prevent infection

193
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:14,189
that helps we also have to know that

194
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,260
many of these pathogens are ubiquitous

195
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,120
they're everywhere and so our sanitation

196
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:20,250
practices have to be in line not only

197
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,230
with how we're treating our environment

198
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,980
but also how we understand the pathogen

199
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:28,379
that answer your question

200
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:29,759
yeah a little bit so moving back a

201
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,500
little bit here and I want to talk about

202
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,000
treatment options too so we're not just

203
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,549
explaining a problem but actually give

204
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,179
some options for listeners to solve the

205
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:41,129
problem but sure one thing I've noticed

206
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:42,989
with my outdoor squash I think I've

207
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:44,389
mentioned this on previous podcast is it

208
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,310
seems to me that it's when there's high

209
00:08:44,389 --> 00:08:50,399
fluctuations in temperature and humidity

210
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:52,500
outdoors is where I see powdery mildew

211
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,409
move in so if we have a nice sunny day

212
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:57,750
followed by rainy

213
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,000
you know rainy day or vice versa those

214
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:01,860
big swings in temperature seem to stress

215
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,490
the plant and seem to allow these spores

216
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,870
to really take hold so I've always I've

217
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,509
always gone under the assumption that we

218
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,549
want to avoid major changes or

219
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:14,009
fluctuations in humidity and temperature

220
00:09:11,549 --> 00:09:16,859
for an indoor environment because that

221
00:09:14,009 --> 00:09:19,919
seems to cause a lot of plant stress do

222
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:22,560
you have any thoughts on that no I agree

223
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:25,019
I agree usually in nature you'd like to

224
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:26,969
think on a let's say not on a rainy day

225
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,759
just doing it in a normal day when the

226
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:31,800
Sun comes up and the Sun comes down

227
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:34,050
things are the environment is slowly

228
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:36,000
transitioned right there seems to be at

229
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:39,828
least somewhat of an acclamation period

230
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,958
during each stage of the day so to say

231
00:09:39,828 --> 00:09:45,688
and in in controlled environment you

232
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:48,359
know many many times we have we have

233
00:09:45,688 --> 00:09:49,828
environmental conditions turn on and

234
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,389
then they're on for the photo period and

235
00:09:49,828 --> 00:09:53,519
those environmental conditions include

236
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:56,250
co2 and irrigation everything helps turn

237
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,370
off during a dark period these blunt on

238
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:01,078
and off are not what plants receive in

239
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,470
nature right and plants are obviously

240
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:07,739
inclined to favor what they want they

241
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:10,259
genetically in the past received through

242
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:12,870
through the environment so I agree that

243
00:10:10,259 --> 00:10:14,430
we're still fine-tuning growers are

244
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:17,220
still working how to fine-tune their

245
00:10:14,429 --> 00:10:19,109
systems supposed to adequately fit the

246
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,819
genetic reads that have been brought up

247
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,509
in these plants and their native native

248
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:25,860
habitats so what I'm hearing a lot of

249
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:28,139
growers doing is having their lights

250
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,730
shut off gradually so maybe half the

251
00:10:28,139 --> 00:10:31,470
lights will shut off at one point in the

252
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:35,399
next set I'll shut off a few minutes

253
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,620
later or ways of reducing that extreme

254
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:39,179
on-and-off that you're describing have

255
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,610
you seen any research or results to

256
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:42,659
support that sort of approach to reduce

257
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,620
dewpoint

258
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,850
and can you talk a little bit about

259
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,049
dewpoint that's something that we I

260
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,050
wanted to bring up as well

261
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:59,519
sure so let me thank howda we've done

262
00:10:54,208 --> 00:11:01,768
some studies when studies on you know

263
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,350
slowly at the beginning of the day let's

264
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:07,500
say during veg you have you know long

265
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,840
days 18 hours let's say that the first

266
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,649
two hours in the first

267
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:16,820
you slowly increase light intensity to

268
00:11:12,649 --> 00:11:18,289
somewhat mimic a sunrise right and then

269
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,270
you have your photo period and then

270
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:22,879
towards the last two hours or last hour

271
00:11:20,269 --> 00:11:26,899
you slowly decrease that intensity again

272
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:30,620
to try to mimic a sunset when you have

273
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:33,799
these it seems like a good idea but when

274
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:36,379
our goal is to increase yield and to

275
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:39,589
increase quality during those two hours

276
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:41,779
that we slowly increase and slowly

277
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,680
decrease light intensity we're losing

278
00:11:41,779 --> 00:11:49,659
overall light accumulation for that day

279
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:52,879
so it's been hard to justify doing that

280
00:11:49,659 --> 00:11:55,699
you know I don't think anyone has yet to

281
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:56,299
iron out the perfect photo period for

282
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,310
this plant

283
00:11:56,299 --> 00:12:00,979
don't get me started on the options of

284
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:04,579
photo period manipulation with cannabis

285
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:06,950
but I feel like in that regard you have

286
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,990
to you have to determine what your goal

287
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:13,700
is right is our goal to treat this plant

288
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:17,000
as perfectly as we can or is it to crank

289
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:19,190
out as much yield and as much compounds

290
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,059
and it is possible and if that's the

291
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,950
case then these gradual on-off stages

292
00:12:23,059 --> 00:12:26,599
are told you know decreasing our overall

293
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:28,580
energy production in the plant because

294
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,450
of the total light accumulation during

295
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:35,540
that 24 hour period well what about

296
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,190
going then to if you knew what your DL I

297
00:12:35,539 --> 00:12:39,110
was amount of light that the plant can

298
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:42,980
take in over a given photo period if you

299
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:46,879
took that and had a rate that you wanted

300
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:49,940
to hit over say 20 hours then or 19

301
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:53,659
hours could you then incorporate it in

302
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:55,910
some of these principles I would say I

303
00:12:53,659 --> 00:12:58,339
would say yes no and you hit the nail on

304
00:12:55,909 --> 00:13:00,379
the head though that you know I say that

305
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,060
growers do need to talk about the Li and

306
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:03,289
once they under the Li that they can

307
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:06,019
approach these things a little

308
00:13:03,289 --> 00:13:08,469
differently right so if you have a deal

309
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:11,899
I of I don't know let's just say 40 and

310
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:15,080
that that number came from a duration of

311
00:13:11,899 --> 00:13:17,629
18 hours but you know that you want to

312
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:20,810
apply a long day and so if you were to

313
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:22,399
bump your D Li to 41 I'm not doing the

314
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:24,258
math right here right now good

315
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:26,899
wanting to bump into 41 and that gave

316
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:31,459
you an alibi for and an hour after and

317
00:13:26,899 --> 00:13:34,068
now you have a total but you are able to

318
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:36,078
slowly increase intensity then you had

319
00:13:34,068 --> 00:13:39,078
your 18 hours and then you're able to

320
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,818
decrease intensity I think there are

321
00:13:39,078 --> 00:13:43,448
ways that you could go about it as long

322
00:13:40,818 --> 00:13:48,289
as you didn't wake up your 18 hours and

323
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:49,969
you didn't take up that desired DLI is

324
00:13:48,289 --> 00:13:53,208
there any advantage to it from the

325
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:56,959
perspective of reducing dew point on the

326
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:58,849
leaf surface there I think so if your

327
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,768
temperature mimics the increase right so

328
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,959
temperature dictates yeah you know

329
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:06,078
dictates humidity in big tasty point a

330
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,758
lot so it's a good question and you know

331
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:10,849
I working on a few things right now I

332
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:12,470
will go to too much detail but all of

333
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,909
these environmental conditions are links

334
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:16,430
and I've said that in the past so if

335
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,438
we're slowly increasing light you know

336
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:21,620
transpiration of photosynthetic Laden so

337
00:14:18,438 --> 00:14:23,719
this is both photorespiration right

338
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:25,938
those are all linked to this as well so

339
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,910
house how should CEO to be treated

340
00:14:25,938 --> 00:14:30,678
during that hour how should temperature

341
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:33,980
gradually increase from the night

342
00:14:30,678 --> 00:14:37,039
temperature so we can alleviate any

343
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:39,170
possible negative you know effects of

344
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,958
dew point things and that that in my

345
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,338
opinion is still yet to be determined

346
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:46,549
and it's the reason for that is because

347
00:14:43,339 --> 00:14:48,800
every one system is so different you

348
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:51,919
know you may you may talk to a grower

349
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:55,370
who has a system like this but at the at

350
00:14:51,919 --> 00:14:57,610
the during their photo period they may

351
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,230
actually bring temperatures up into 85

352
00:14:57,610 --> 00:15:02,209
degrees right so their temperature

353
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,720
regime is so different from someone who

354
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:07,698
keeps their max depth at 75 so it's a

355
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,379
it's a challenging that's a challenging

356
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:13,609
point right now and I can appreciate the

357
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:15,079
question so really the big takeaway then

358
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:18,550
would be that we just need to be aware

359
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:22,188
of what VPD is and how it relates to

360
00:15:18,549 --> 00:15:24,229
humidity and that we need to make

361
00:15:22,188 --> 00:15:26,838
adjustments based on our own environment

362
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:29,269
as we learn things and say okay well in

363
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:32,779
my environment I seem to do really well

364
00:15:29,269 --> 00:15:36,129
within this range and try and try and

365
00:15:32,778 --> 00:15:38,899
maintain and stay at those levels

366
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:41,059
yes I agree and we need that we need to

367
00:15:38,899 --> 00:15:44,809
try to make sure that temperatures don't

368
00:15:41,059 --> 00:15:47,509
drop too quickly right because the water

369
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:50,119
vapor will condense you know into into

370
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:53,210
the liquid liquid water on lead you

371
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,450
think when temperature drops quickly so

372
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:59,389
when we turn off light and you know the

373
00:15:56,450 --> 00:16:01,340
plant process is somewhat decrease in

374
00:15:59,389 --> 00:16:02,990
for overall percent of function then we

375
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,759
also need to make sure their temperature

376
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:06,919
is adequate admit to it

377
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:08,389
the next step with cannabis I believe in

378
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:09,889
controlled environments in general is

379
00:16:08,389 --> 00:16:13,189
we're going to have to monitor all of

380
00:16:09,889 --> 00:16:18,439
these things you know we're gonna have

381
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:21,320
to monitor at what pace right - all of

382
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:24,320
these fall in line together and how can

383
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,550
we maximize it well it's exciting to be

384
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,620
part of an industry where we're still

385
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:30,229
learning so much I really I really enjoy

386
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:32,679
that aspect of of cannabis and its such

387
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:35,629
a fun plant and to grow in that regard

388
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:37,159
one thing I want to bring up just the

389
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:38,929
different listeners to keep in the back

390
00:16:37,159 --> 00:16:41,120
of their head is that ultimately the

391
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:43,279
cultivar that you choose is so important

392
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,460
when it comes to milk mold and mildew

393
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,699
resistance especially I you can grow to

394
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,050
it exact same or two of the same plants

395
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,570
that are different cultivars and get

396
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:55,909
very different pressures in relation to

397
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:57,320
mold and mildew so I just want to touch

398
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:59,480
on that so people don't get too caught

399
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,070
up with this and forget about how

400
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:05,029
important the cultivar astray and

401
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:07,759
they're growing really is yes completely

402
00:17:05,029 --> 00:17:09,289
good you and glad you don't if we if we

403
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:11,390
can take another second on mildew I'd

404
00:17:09,289 --> 00:17:13,279
like to say one other thing yeah

405
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:16,490
definitely I want to actually go back to

406
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:19,129
that so that this is a perfect time okay

407
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:21,680
cool so yeah every no matter what we do

408
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:23,810
you're 100% right that everything is

409
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:25,580
strain dependent right or strain

410
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,679
specific depending on your system

411
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:30,039
depending under what you define as

412
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,029
quality and even pathogen resistance

413
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,730
everything else it's all based on your

414
00:17:32,029 --> 00:17:39,680
strain but something I wanted to share

415
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:42,049
with your listeners was in the in the

416
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,259
ornamental market you know in the flower

417
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:48,259
market those growers in one greenhouse

418
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:49,640
at one acre of greenhouse probably

419
00:17:48,259 --> 00:17:51,859
managed over ten

420
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:54,320
different genera and that can probably

421
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:57,799
equate to at least 50 to 60 different

422
00:17:54,319 --> 00:18:01,009
varieties and ultimately maybe 40

423
00:17:57,799 --> 00:18:05,659
different species it it's quite amazing

424
00:18:01,009 --> 00:18:07,309
and each plant like we just said

425
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,100
responds this heart differently to

426
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:12,169
different pathogens something that we've

427
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,119
learned in the past two to three years

428
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:16,550
that's actually been implemented on a

429
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:19,819
commercial scale is how to make the

430
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:23,329
plant more resistant to powdery mildew

431
00:18:19,819 --> 00:18:26,179
and fungi and general diseases how do

432
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:28,699
how can we make the plant be tougher

433
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:32,170
more tough to combat these pathogens and

434
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:35,779
there's two strategies one of them is

435
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:37,060
what's called silicon and it's a mineral

436
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:39,829
nutrient it's one of the most plentiful

437
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:43,429
minimal nutrients out there it actually

438
00:18:39,829 --> 00:18:47,599
covers the Earth's crust but silicon is

439
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:51,830
not considered a essential plant

440
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:53,779
nutrient but a plant can use it and it

441
00:18:51,829 --> 00:18:55,819
comes in the form when you apply outputs

442
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:58,639
once it comes in the form of potassium

443
00:18:55,819 --> 00:19:01,159
silicate and one of the strategies

444
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,650
that's being used in other crops outside

445
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:07,730
of cannabis for mildew prevention for

446
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:11,660
example on vineyards on roses even on

447
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:16,069
basil in some cases is adding potassium

448
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:17,810
silicon to your fertilizer and you would

449
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:20,269
apply this at a certain parts per

450
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:22,549
million every feed and you would slowly

451
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:26,359
slowly build up an accumulation of

452
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,909
silicon in the plant and what silicon

453
00:19:26,359 --> 00:19:33,409
does is it it's similar to calcium in

454
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:36,380
that it focuses on the cell walls and it

455
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:37,940
makes cell walls more stiff and to some

456
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:40,100
degree it can be so stiff that it

457
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:42,279
inhibits the enzymes that pathogens

458
00:19:40,099 --> 00:19:46,609
produce to try to break down cell walls

459
00:19:42,279 --> 00:19:49,579
so you know it's it's it's amazing to me

460
00:19:46,609 --> 00:19:51,740
with how our agricultural industries are

461
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:55,519
moving away from pesticides and

462
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:57,259
embracing bio controls the extent at

463
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,170
which we're going to prevent disease and

464
00:19:57,259 --> 00:20:02,569
to prevent pest damage we now can

465
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:03,259
implement something as silicon to make

466
00:20:02,569 --> 00:20:05,569
the plants

467
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:08,058
strong in some cases that we reduce

468
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:10,250
powdery mildew severity by up to eighty

469
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:12,079
percent and the rest of the powdery

470
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:15,589
mildew is actually killed by our

471
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:17,899
preventative sprays so you know it's

472
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:20,119
just the growers in my opinion should

473
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,830
take some time and dive into the

474
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:24,168
literature in some cases on some of

475
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:26,750
these pathogens you can find very cheap

476
00:20:24,169 --> 00:20:28,429
and easy to implement solutions to some

477
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:31,970
of these pathogens just by what's been

478
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:34,220
done on other crops in the past now the

479
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,769
challenge with with powdery mildew and

480
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:40,370
you mentioned potassium silicon which is

481
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:42,500
I think a great product we carry a

482
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:45,589
powdered version in our online store

483
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,929
called AG sill 16h there's a lot of

484
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:49,548
people now selling it for the reasons

485
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,590
that you mentioned and there's a great

486
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:54,558
article which I'll post on the podcast

487
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:56,539
page about silica it has a ton of

488
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,579
benefits one of the ones I found most

489
00:20:56,539 --> 00:21:01,940
interesting is it actually mitigates

490
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:03,710
micro toxicities in the in the leaf

491
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,048
surface or on the in the leaf tissue

492
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,440
itself so if you have a little bit too

493
00:21:06,048 --> 00:21:11,119
much boron or copper or manganese for

494
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,870
example it'll help spread that out so

495
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:17,119
you get less of a toxic effect in in the

496
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:20,089
leaf tissue on top of all the other

497
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:22,849
things that you mentioned so yeah I yeah

498
00:21:20,089 --> 00:21:24,678
and that that's I don't mean to

499
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:27,529
interrupt you but that that's called

500
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:29,840
soluble silicon the plant converts it

501
00:21:27,529 --> 00:21:32,418
into that and so when you apply let's

502
00:21:29,839 --> 00:21:35,019
say egg cell you have the plant

503
00:21:32,419 --> 00:21:38,270
converted into soluble silicon and then

504
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:40,129
polymerize silicon polymerize is what

505
00:21:38,269 --> 00:21:42,079
helps you on your cell walls and a

506
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:43,610
soluble is what helps you transport a

507
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,009
lot of the mineral nutrients like you're

508
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:49,058
saying yep okay yeah I didn't know that

509
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:51,410
and the other thing I found is that

510
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:53,660
cannabis in particular seems to just

511
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:55,759
thrive on potassium even more than other

512
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,860
you know vegetable crops and ornamentals

513
00:21:55,759 --> 00:21:59,509
that I'm familiar with growing so

514
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:02,539
getting that extra potassium is in

515
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:04,460
general a good thing so it's a good mix

516
00:22:02,539 --> 00:22:07,220
but the one thing I do want to mention

517
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,289
is that it's not organic and that's

518
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:11,390
important for a lot of a lot of our

519
00:22:09,289 --> 00:22:12,740
listeners and at least something to be

520
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:16,419
aware of when you are applying something

521
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:18,159
in your garden yes true

522
00:22:16,419 --> 00:22:21,340
there's some forms out there that can be

523
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,409
but yeah yeah there's I've seen other

524
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:24,849
silica products but in terms of what you

525
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:29,109
mentioned there with the amount of

526
00:22:24,849 --> 00:22:30,819
available silicon is there there tend to

527
00:22:29,108 --> 00:22:32,589
be a lot lower so that they're not

528
00:22:30,819 --> 00:22:34,200
necessarily plants available like a lot

529
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,089
of people put rice holes in their media

530
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,069
because they're high in silica but it's

531
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:41,829
not in a form that the plant can take up

532
00:22:39,069 --> 00:22:43,569
so you're waiting you know for months

533
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:45,638
potentially for some of this to become

534
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:49,928
available to the plant as it gets broken

535
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:51,668
down yep I agree and that you know the

536
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:54,999
crop times that we deal with those no

537
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:57,190
point in adding rice holes and you know

538
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:59,139
you can effort strategies of how you can

539
00:22:57,190 --> 00:23:01,840
break down rice holes and then and then

540
00:22:59,138 --> 00:23:04,778
apply a powder and that you know you can

541
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:07,388
have a plant response in less than two

542
00:23:04,778 --> 00:23:09,099
weeks when you integrate a powder but

543
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:11,099
most of the you know most of the growers

544
00:23:09,099 --> 00:23:13,298
I meet are not using a loose substrate

545
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,788
right they're using these compressed

546
00:23:13,298 --> 00:23:18,038
blocks of whether it be core peat or

547
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:18,819
rock wall so you couldn't even mix in

548
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:20,858
something like that

549
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:22,058
so I agree yeah that's a challenge to

550
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:25,509
get a product like that and I wanted to

551
00:23:22,058 --> 00:23:27,038
touch on your potassium I've learned

552
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:28,899
similar things like you have with

553
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,128
potassium being important with cannabis

554
00:23:28,898 --> 00:23:33,518
but we have to be careful because

555
00:23:30,128 --> 00:23:36,339
potassium also regulates the EC so the

556
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:39,819
more potassium we the more potassium you

557
00:23:36,339 --> 00:23:42,849
include in your fertilizer you increase

558
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:46,148
your EC also and then it's a little

559
00:23:42,849 --> 00:23:48,878
harder for you know the fertilizer to be

560
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:50,648
up to be taken from into the plant

561
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,288
because the water is a little saltier

562
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:56,378
and when you look at your nutrition you

563
00:23:53,288 --> 00:24:00,759
you want to apply potassium in a

564
00:23:56,378 --> 00:24:03,519
one-to-one ratio with nitrogen so just

565
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:05,858
something to keep in mind I yeah I

566
00:24:03,519 --> 00:24:07,929
definitely want to talk about nutrition

567
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:10,210
because I think you have a lot to share

568
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:12,369
there but before we do can we talk a

569
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,700
little bit more about strategies for

570
00:24:12,368 --> 00:24:18,069
dealing with these these particular like

571
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:19,419
botrytis and powdery mildew so some of

572
00:24:18,069 --> 00:24:22,808
the other ones that I'm aware of out

573
00:24:19,419 --> 00:24:25,570
there are let's see there's sulfur

574
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:27,269
burners it is one option that I hear

575
00:24:25,569 --> 00:24:30,069
that a lot of people have used

576
00:24:27,269 --> 00:24:31,900
lactobacillus you know through Rob

577
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:35,289
and some of the enzymes in there there's

578
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:37,000
been some research on there's potassium

579
00:24:35,289 --> 00:24:40,089
bicarbonate and then there's another

580
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:42,190
form of bicarbonate that you can get I

581
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:44,939
think it's green cure I can't remember

582
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:47,470
what it is right now I'm blanking but

583
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,930
are you familiar with other you know

584
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:54,220
more organic options out there and their

585
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:59,320
efficacy around cannabis great question

586
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,880
um so powdery mildew is tough and in for

587
00:24:59,319 --> 00:25:03,490
example like in the ornamental market

588
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:06,160
it's so tough to control in some cases

589
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:07,599
they're just breeding away from it you

590
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,660
know they're they're making plants that

591
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:13,119
are just resistant to it period so like

592
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,529
now there's instead of in patients that

593
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,779
were covered and they'll do in the past

594
00:25:14,529 --> 00:25:18,279
now we have resistant genetics that

595
00:25:16,779 --> 00:25:20,440
won't even get infected with mildew

596
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:21,700
that's how that's how other markets are

597
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:24,519
dealing with it because it's such a

598
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:26,620
struggle that's why I think things like

599
00:25:24,519 --> 00:25:28,539
silicon in your constant feed just

600
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:31,449
automatically gives you a strong buffer

601
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:34,509
but as far as other measures you know

602
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,569
like I've seen some growers who they

603
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:41,170
have they get plugs you know from other

604
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:43,720
suppliers and you automatically have to

605
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:45,670
treat these plugs as infected plants I

606
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,789
mean even if even if the supplier is

607
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:51,340
completely clean it's just a safe bet to

608
00:25:48,789 --> 00:25:53,349
have a quarantine program right and

609
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:55,659
there's products out there and I could I

610
00:25:53,349 --> 00:25:58,990
could list an array of products problem

611
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,840
is I've learned that one product will

612
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:03,640
work in one state and that same products

613
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:07,389
will not work in another state that

614
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,250
really is frustrating but you're right

615
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,660
there's potassium bicarbonate I believe

616
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:17,140
that's called nil stop and then you have

617
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:20,950
the sulfur burners and bacillus and I

618
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:23,140
believe sulfur burners work well you

619
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:24,850
have to be careful because that can add

620
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:26,500
too high of concentrations it's not too

621
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:29,259
healthy also for humans and you can have

622
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:34,779
some burn on plants but elemental sulfur

623
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:36,190
is sprays helps but my advice is I would

624
00:26:34,779 --> 00:26:38,259
have something in your feed whether it

625
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:41,830
be silicon or high levels of calcium

626
00:26:38,259 --> 00:26:44,000
chloride to help the plant strengthen

627
00:26:41,829 --> 00:26:46,279
its cell walls to reduce over

628
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,319
all infection and then have preventative

629
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:50,920
sprays in place with potassium

630
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:53,329
bicarbonate or even have vaporized

631
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:56,810
diffused sulfur in your growing

632
00:26:53,329 --> 00:26:58,879
environment to try and help mitigate

633
00:26:56,809 --> 00:27:00,649
whatever micro environments that you

634
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,530
have that could Harbor powdery mildew

635
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:06,440
and third if we had a cultural change I

636
00:27:03,529 --> 00:27:07,879
would say if growers can and this can be

637
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:11,720
a struggle but if you can get your

638
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:14,600
airflow to 2 meters per second then you

639
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,910
are automatically kind of diffusing all

640
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:19,279
of the micro climates into one in your

641
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:21,080
room and that way the more airflow you

642
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:24,529
have the less chance you're going to

643
00:27:21,079 --> 00:27:28,039
have mildew actually having a stabilized

644
00:27:24,529 --> 00:27:29,480
population well let's talk about air

645
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:31,819
flow really quickly in relation to

646
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:33,559
mildew so I've seen some people where

647
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:35,779
they're just you know blasting the plant

648
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:39,259
it affects their transpiration rates in

649
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:40,430
the hopes of preventing it and then I've

650
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:43,819
seen other people where they want the

651
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:45,740
air coming out underneath the canopy and

652
00:27:43,819 --> 00:27:48,289
being pulled up through the canopy and

653
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:50,240
then I mostly what I see is fans up

654
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:52,250
above the canopy to help cool the lights

655
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,529
to keep that heat from coming down to

656
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,319
the plants now obviously with LEDs that

657
00:27:54,529 --> 00:28:00,639
changes a bit but what what are we

658
00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:03,470
looking for in an indoor environment for

659
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,060
airflow in terms of where we should be

660
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:09,579
positioning our fans relative to our

661
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:14,269
canopy yep and I would say that that is

662
00:28:09,579 --> 00:28:16,579
definitely defined by what regulations

663
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:19,069
you grow like so are we dealing with

664
00:28:16,579 --> 00:28:21,199
large plants very few plants but large

665
00:28:19,069 --> 00:28:24,079
plants are we dealing with a ton of

666
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,819
small plants in a grow and they're

667
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:28,699
shorter and they're not so big with so

668
00:28:25,819 --> 00:28:30,919
much canopy and that that to me is

669
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:33,529
really where we first have to ask okay

670
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:35,330
what what kind of plant in the stage of

671
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:39,250
plant the size of plan are we dealing

672
00:28:35,329 --> 00:28:43,460
with and then or equal to position

673
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:45,289
stands underneath the plants and are you

674
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:48,079
also able to do either horizontal or

675
00:28:45,289 --> 00:28:50,809
vertical airflow for example like in

676
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:52,939
lettuce you know and we can learn from

677
00:28:50,809 --> 00:28:54,919
other industries if we look at lettuce

678
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,820
lettuce has a problem and it's called

679
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,769
leaf tip burn and this is due

680
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:02,829
to calcium deficiency and it's because

681
00:28:59,769 --> 00:29:04,809
but it was with LEDs as sole source

682
00:29:02,829 --> 00:29:06,759
lighting or supplemental lighting when

683
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:08,950
you try to push the plant at a certain

684
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,990
pace with a certain amount of light at a

685
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:13,870
certain temperature the plant can't

686
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:15,789
translocate nutrients fast enough so you

687
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:17,649
end up in the new growth having cells

688
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:19,990
that don't mature in it then it over

689
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:21,610
time it looks like burn not because

690
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:24,430
those cells die and they stretch and

691
00:29:21,609 --> 00:29:26,259
they split it's not a way to fix issues

692
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:27,970
with vertical airflow and it does

693
00:29:26,259 --> 00:29:29,829
exactly what you said when you have

694
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:31,029
airflow that comes directly down onto

695
00:29:29,829 --> 00:29:34,240
the plant you're automatically

696
00:29:31,029 --> 00:29:36,099
increasing transpiration rates and so if

697
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,009
you work to increase air flow you would

698
00:29:36,099 --> 00:29:40,629
obviously need to also change the way

699
00:29:39,009 --> 00:29:42,190
that you perceive the plants

700
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,810
transpiration rate and does that mean

701
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,340
changing you see a little bit bringing

702
00:29:43,809 --> 00:29:49,629
it down just a little bit so things can

703
00:29:45,339 --> 00:29:51,099
move to the plant easier and so it's

704
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:53,230
it's interesting I get some of the same

705
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:55,269
questions all of the pins on the system

706
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:57,430
ideally you would want some airflow that

707
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:59,650
yes touches the plant from the side and

708
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:01,960
also from above but it's the main thing

709
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:03,970
with mildew is can you get inside to

710
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,319
canopy right so you usually have a

711
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:07,839
bordering edge which is called the

712
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:09,669
buffer zone all these plants that are

713
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:12,970
found in the middle there is in the

714
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:14,650
middle can Harbor many many populations

715
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,450
throughout and if you're not careful

716
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:18,220
during the night period they can spray

717
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:22,150
to your outer buffer and then it's very

718
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:24,789
hard to get control so we want to manage

719
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:28,420
our canopy to making sure that people

720
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:30,309
you can that airflow can go through

721
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:32,970
there to reduce the Spore pressure in

722
00:30:30,309 --> 00:30:36,250
the areas that are getting less airflow

723
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:38,440
essentially exactly yep and in other

724
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:40,029
industries they just space their plants

725
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,799
you know if they have the available

726
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:44,559
space they just space them so there's a

727
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:46,299
fair flow but in this crop in this

728
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,169
industry right now that's that's the

729
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:51,669
last thing I'm going to recommend

730
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:53,320
somebody is spacing so yeah it is a

731
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,840
challenge right now trying to get air

732
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:59,409
flow in between two canopies of multiple

733
00:30:55,839 --> 00:31:01,329
plants but so when I first started

734
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:02,890
growing I was told that you want to be

735
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:05,230
able to see through the plants that was

736
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:08,830
how they you know just that the

737
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:11,430
two-second lesson on pruning but then as

738
00:31:08,829 --> 00:31:13,349
I got into it more and

739
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:16,140
our people started looking at how far

740
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:19,349
light is penetrating the canopy and then

741
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:22,350
removing leaves that were below you know

742
00:31:19,349 --> 00:31:25,189
a certain ppfd for example in the in

743
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:27,269
that canopy as because they just weren't

744
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:29,789
photosynthesizing light as effectively

745
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:33,240
and they were potentially places where

746
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:39,269
mold and mildew could could take off do

747
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,859
you have any thoughts on that so you

748
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:43,500
talking about pruning pruning leagues

749
00:31:40,859 --> 00:31:46,079
we're talking about pruning viable solar

750
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,940
real estate to the plant I understand

751
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:50,339
that people are worried about different

752
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:52,170
wavelengths penetrating you know a

753
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:53,819
certain amount of leaves to where let's

754
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:56,340
say by the fourth leaf down you're not

755
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:58,200
getting any benefit from the light

756
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,819
that's where fluence I think really

757
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:02,250
separates I'm not trying to have a sales

758
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:05,339
pitch here but that's where full

759
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:07,470
spectrum truly comes into play right so

760
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:10,169
a multitude of spectra when it's being

761
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:12,029
applied properly you can have let's say

762
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,710
red and blue that's not going to

763
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:16,019
penetrate one leaf that's going to be

764
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:18,509
absorbed as as soon as it touches the

765
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:20,819
leaf surface but these other spectrum

766
00:32:18,509 --> 00:32:23,190
actually actually channel through the

767
00:32:20,819 --> 00:32:26,579
leaves and do have photosynthetic

768
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:28,230
ability as they travel through now what

769
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:29,909
is the extent of that right that's all

770
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:33,990
based on your density and light

771
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:35,640
intensity but I have seen systems where

772
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,549
they they prune the heck out of their

773
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,170
plants and I understand why and it's

774
00:32:38,549 --> 00:32:42,059
further reasons you say but at the same

775
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:46,769
time I'm thinking those leaves are

776
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:49,649
generating your energy so it I think if

777
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:52,829
anything pruning at certain stages could

778
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:56,460
be effective for the the objective of

779
00:32:52,829 --> 00:32:58,470
your plant so during flowering when

780
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:01,410
you're focused on buds and let's say by

781
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:02,940
the end of week five in flowering and

782
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:04,740
you know at the end of week six your

783
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,410
flowers and your buds should be formed

784
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:09,470
that may be a good time to actually take

785
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:12,060
some leaves away and focus on the buds

786
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:14,730
but at the same time any energy that

787
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:17,519
could be harnessed during that time goes

788
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:19,349
into the bud but that's a hard one and I

789
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,519
wish that you know in the future of

790
00:33:19,349 --> 00:33:23,099
getting more and more hands-on

791
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:25,440
experience with cannabis we can kind of

792
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:27,849
see what the threshold is with pruning

793
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,220
so essentially what you're you're

794
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:32,498
hitting on is that you can use pruning

795
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:36,909
as a trigger to with the plant in terms

796
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:39,100
of stressing it and removing extra xxs

797
00:33:36,909 --> 00:33:41,710
families for example to focus its energy

798
00:33:39,099 --> 00:33:43,359
on bud production the plants naturally

799
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,909
trying to senesce its ending its life

800
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:48,248
cycle it's trying to produce seeds

801
00:33:44,909 --> 00:33:49,600
obviously these are you know not viable

802
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:51,610
in that sense because they haven't been

803
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:55,868
pollinated but the plants still going

804
00:33:51,609 --> 00:33:58,628
through that process and by removing all

805
00:33:55,868 --> 00:34:00,908
these this excess all these excess

806
00:33:58,628 --> 00:34:04,028
leaves the plant really has to focus its

807
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:07,960
energy into its its bud production that

808
00:34:04,028 --> 00:34:10,418
sound about right well the the plant

809
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,940
process is going to be dictated by photo

810
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:14,918
period cutting of leaves

811
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:17,619
yes I would say a fission causes a

812
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,000
certain level of stress but overall if

813
00:34:17,619 --> 00:34:20,980
you're under a short-day the plant is

814
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,719
going to be focused on flowering I do

815
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:26,289
think that some leaves can be a

816
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:28,509
nutritional sink so some older leaves

817
00:34:26,289 --> 00:34:30,190
that let's say most likely look pretty

818
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:32,980
rough you know to the naked eye

819
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:37,389
co-curricular fleshly those could be a

820
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:39,128
sink for macro nutrients so in that case

821
00:34:37,389 --> 00:34:40,750
if they're darker green if they have

822
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:43,088
some chlorosis things like that

823
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:45,280
definitely prune them because they're

824
00:34:43,088 --> 00:34:48,190
taking away from what is the newer

825
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:51,000
growth and in flowering during a short

826
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:54,309
day I wouldn't say that this stress

827
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,108
helps the plant in regard to pruning but

828
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:58,960
more if you were to prune than the plant

829
00:34:56,108 --> 00:35:01,509
reach annals the focus from going into

830
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,579
those leads and goes into the bud

831
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:06,069
I don't know if they came off clear but

832
00:35:03,579 --> 00:35:08,109
yeah I get what you're saying the reason

833
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:09,548
I'm asking is because I've seen there's

834
00:35:08,108 --> 00:35:11,170
there's a book out there and it's like

835
00:35:09,548 --> 00:35:13,329
thousands of dollars or something crazy

836
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,510
where the guy I think he's out of

837
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:19,150
Colorado recommends removing all fan

838
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,690
leaves in flower so literally all you

839
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:25,869
have is these these bud sites and they

840
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:27,338
claim it it maximizes their their yield

841
00:35:25,869 --> 00:35:30,640
and I know a few people have tried it

842
00:35:27,338 --> 00:35:34,150
and gotten decent results and I always

843
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:35,558
attributed it to excessive sort of plant

844
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,838
stress that's opening you up to more

845
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,640
diseases and other problems but

846
00:35:37,838 --> 00:35:42,808
potential

847
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:45,868
allowing the plant to focus more of its

848
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:48,150
energy on its bud sites though I haven't

849
00:35:45,869 --> 00:35:51,710
really ever wrap my brain around how

850
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:55,528
removing all of those you know

851
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:56,849
photosynthetic or potentially all that

852
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:59,460
leaf surface is actually going to

853
00:35:56,849 --> 00:36:03,119
benefit the overall plant health and

854
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,490
yield ya know I'm with you there and we

855
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,140
have to be careful because I've seen

856
00:36:05,489 --> 00:36:08,879
strategies of let's say reducing

857
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:11,788
nitrogen towards the end of flowering

858
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,608
right and either that's to apply a

859
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:17,119
stress or that's to try to not have so

860
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:19,230
much nitrate concentrated in the bud or

861
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,539
applying a stress through water

862
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:23,670
stressing the plants towards the end of

863
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:27,420
flower or cutting off leaves like you're

864
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:29,789
saying abscission stress stress can be a

865
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,159
good thing when we understand what it

866
00:36:29,789 --> 00:36:34,980
does and how it does it if we apply

867
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:36,868
stress too much stress the plant is

868
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,230
going to put all of its energy into

869
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:41,789
combating that stress response and it's

870
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:44,250
not going to be focused on what we want

871
00:36:41,789 --> 00:36:45,750
it to be focused on so I think I think

872
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,059
they are and to your point we still have

873
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:51,059
so much to learn on how to manipulate

874
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,190
stress to increase quality and to

875
00:36:51,059 --> 00:36:56,099
increase yield and the next question is

876
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:57,720
happenes compounds and it depends on who

877
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:58,859
you're talking to when are they produced

878
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,929
and why are they produced you know

879
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:04,199
there's theories all around on why the

880
00:37:00,929 --> 00:37:06,179
plant produces them but then okay what

881
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:08,038
what causes an excess production of

882
00:37:06,179 --> 00:37:10,528
those can we harness that energy so we

883
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:12,480
need leaves but if we're applying stress

884
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:14,068
to its vision maybe we don't need to

885
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,048
lease because it's a stress response

886
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:19,380
you know there's it's interesting this

887
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:21,568
plan is just fascinating it is and the

888
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,910
other factor is on a commercial scale

889
00:37:21,568 --> 00:37:26,278
you just don't have the labor to prune

890
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:28,949
that much in most cases it's it's just

891
00:37:26,278 --> 00:37:31,469
too much work so most other growers I

892
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:35,338
know that are producing on scale are

893
00:37:31,469 --> 00:37:36,899
typically you know staffed but running

894
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,578
around crazy and don't have time to go

895
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:41,130
through and remove all of these leaves

896
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:43,980
in most cases and it may not be

897
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:46,440
beneficial based on the the difference

898
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:48,028
in in yield and what we know about plant

899
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,659
stress and and all the reasons that you

900
00:37:48,028 --> 00:37:52,570
just mentioned yeah I completely agree

901
00:37:51,659 --> 00:37:54,039
with you labor that

902
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:57,370
and that certainly needs to be a

903
00:37:54,039 --> 00:38:00,610
priority to take into consideration so I

904
00:37:57,369 --> 00:38:03,630
would say if anything if you if you go

905
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:06,309
in there and pruning as part of your IPM

906
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:08,050
integrated pest management schedule

907
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:10,029
right so if you end up seeing

908
00:38:08,050 --> 00:38:12,250
environments that are forming within the

909
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,350
canopies I would prune so you wouldn't

910
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:16,570
have powdery mildew you go in there and

911
00:38:14,349 --> 00:38:18,819
eat that look like they're nutrient

912
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:20,380
sinks I would prune that out so the rest

913
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:22,870
of the planet can use the nutrition

914
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,230
properly I personally would not prune

915
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:28,630
for an absent stress yep

916
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:29,679
let's let's simply let's simplify this a

917
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:31,990
little bit so take me through your

918
00:38:29,679 --> 00:38:36,569
you're gonna go through a room and scout

919
00:38:31,989 --> 00:38:40,089
for powdery mildew and botrytis and for

920
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:42,910
pests and insects in theory on a daily

921
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:44,800
basis if you're staffed for it just to

922
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:46,809
know what's going on in your room so you

923
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,450
come across a plant that has powdery

924
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:51,250
mildew say and at some point how are you

925
00:38:49,449 --> 00:38:52,839
going to treat that in a in a flower

926
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:54,489
room for example where you don't want to

927
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:58,630
be using any doing any foliar

928
00:38:54,489 --> 00:39:01,329
applications for numerous reasons what

929
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:05,769
options do you have besides removing the

930
00:39:01,329 --> 00:39:07,389
infected material that's a great

931
00:39:05,769 --> 00:39:10,329
question in regard to mildew you don't

932
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:11,920
have many right now that's why I why I

933
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:15,670
really push having things in your

934
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,500
constant fertigation system because that

935
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:19,030
helps you when you get to a case like

936
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:21,969
this because hopefully it prevents a

937
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:23,500
case like this so when you're when

938
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:27,189
you're in there scouting and you end up

939
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:30,610
finding but and when you end up finding

940
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:32,559
mildew pruning would be the first option

941
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:34,930
but then you're touching it right you

942
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:37,779
could possibly be spreading it doing it

943
00:39:34,929 --> 00:39:40,690
that way the first thing I would do is

944
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:42,550
if you have any ability to space the

945
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,470
plants I would space them so either

946
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:46,600
those leaves can be exposed to light or

947
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:50,709
air you dry them out and you fry them

948
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:54,519
with light intensity the spores or if

949
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:56,860
you possibly can't apply any spray under

950
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:58,750
the under the buds I guess it depends on

951
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:00,400
your regulations there then you would

952
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:03,670
obviously try to hit it with some type

953
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,019
of spray and an interesting approach so

954
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,250
that I want to mention that's come out

955
00:40:05,019 --> 00:40:09,880
to a company call

956
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:13,389
by Oh safe is is a product I believe

957
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:15,490
it's called prevent and what this is

958
00:40:13,389 --> 00:40:18,369
it's a it's a microorganism and I can't

959
00:40:15,489 --> 00:40:21,129
think of the strain right off top of my

960
00:40:18,369 --> 00:40:22,960
head right now but it's for applications

961
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:25,510
to prevent powdery mildew and botrytis

962
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,409
and what you do is you would apply it as

963
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:32,710
a foliar spray and it actually colonizes

964
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:34,960
the tissue so botrytis and powdery

965
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:37,199
mildew cannot it has no it's completely

966
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,679
an environmentally friendly item to use

967
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,179
but it takes up the real estate before

968
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,599
botrytis and powdery mildew try to move

969
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,579
in

970
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,409
and so in my mind if you're gonna have

971
00:40:45,579 --> 00:40:49,329
any success with powdery mildew is all

972
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:52,960
going to be due to your prevention

973
00:40:49,329 --> 00:40:55,179
strategy yeah so we want to grow

974
00:40:52,960 --> 00:41:00,579
cultivars that are less susceptible to

975
00:40:55,179 --> 00:41:03,639
PM we want to manage our our relative

976
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:05,650
humidity and VPD we want to treat all

977
00:41:03,639 --> 00:41:07,719
plants that come into the facility by

978
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:11,039
either you know dipping or spraying and

979
00:41:07,719 --> 00:41:13,599
quarantine we want to keep our our

980
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:15,159
clothing and everything our access to

981
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,500
the room really controlled so that we're

982
00:41:15,159 --> 00:41:19,000
not creating any new vectors but at the

983
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,349
end of the day spores are going to make

984
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,719
it into your room there's no such no

985
00:41:20,349 --> 00:41:25,000
one's growing in a clean room per se so

986
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:27,879
at that point it's just a matter of

987
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:29,949
managing you know like you said using

988
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:34,390
IPM strategies to really keep everything

989
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:36,639
as as controlled as possible yeah and

990
00:41:34,389 --> 00:41:40,029
that's a great way that that's a great

991
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:41,949
way to bring it all together yeah so the

992
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:43,210
other one that we touched on at first

993
00:41:41,949 --> 00:41:47,739
that haven't gotten back to you it is

994
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:50,199
botrytis it's really it's the worst and

995
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:52,389
it spread so rapidly the first time I

996
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:54,159
saw it in a crop I started doing a whole

997
00:41:52,389 --> 00:41:56,079
bunch of research and read just how

998
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:59,529
quickly it can spread you know it

999
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,809
multiplied so so rapidly in when it gets

1000
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:03,190
in ideal environments how do we really

1001
00:42:01,809 --> 00:42:06,039
treat that because it's always happening

1002
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:09,340
at the end of flower and it's it's just

1003
00:42:06,039 --> 00:42:11,559
a big problem for growers yeah Petridis

1004
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:13,150
is finicky because it's everywhere it's

1005
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:17,320
sitting all over our face right now as

1006
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:19,400
we talk but it I actually worked on

1007
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:22,309
botrytis from

1008
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:25,220
Aster's and we tried to use strategies

1009
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:28,640
using UV light to kill it on contact

1010
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:32,980
with as short of a dose as 30 seconds of

1011
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:36,558
pulse and it was highly effective and

1012
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:38,750
with LEDs and UV it's very very

1013
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,200
difficult it's not impossible right now

1014
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:44,778
to have such a high radiation wavelength

1015
00:42:42,199 --> 00:42:46,308
in the form of an LED right it's not

1016
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,838
it's not efficient at all there's

1017
00:42:46,309 --> 00:42:52,369
technology out there from other

1018
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:55,449
companies that use UV UVB and UVC for

1019
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:58,818
sterilization of certain pathogens but

1020
00:42:55,449 --> 00:43:02,000
anyway my point in saying that is I even

1021
00:42:58,818 --> 00:43:06,380
went so far as UV because botrytis is so

1022
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:09,559
hard to control the thing with botrytis

1023
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,778
is first it's key to because the

1024
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:12,650
different stages of Petridis there's a

1025
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:16,849
stage called

1026
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:18,710
sclerotia and the fungus can produce it

1027
00:43:16,849 --> 00:43:22,160
is referred to as an overwintering

1028
00:43:18,710 --> 00:43:23,720
structure and this structure is formed

1029
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:27,500
when the environment is not conducive

1030
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:29,719
and so let's say you have botrytis likes

1031
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,670
cooler temperatures anything below 70

1032
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:34,129
degrees it usually performs much better

1033
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:35,720
it can perform at higher but it performs

1034
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:39,019
much better and much more effectively

1035
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:40,939
below 70 degrees Fahrenheit and so when

1036
00:43:39,019 --> 00:43:44,028
temperatures are consistently higher up

1037
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:49,190
into the 80s and 85 it can transform

1038
00:43:44,028 --> 00:43:51,108
into the sclerotia form as that form it

1039
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,608
can tolerate pretty much most

1040
00:43:51,108 --> 00:43:55,130
environmental conditions that will come

1041
00:43:52,608 --> 00:43:57,798
in contact with and even some chemical

1042
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,778
products they can still withstand and so

1043
00:43:57,798 --> 00:44:02,778
we're these sclerotia

1044
00:43:59,778 --> 00:44:04,849
take place is they are on dead plant

1045
00:44:02,778 --> 00:44:06,980
material on your tables they're on the

1046
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:08,869
floors they're in the cracks they're in

1047
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:11,449
places that you you wouldn't think twice

1048
00:44:08,869 --> 00:44:13,068
to even clean but they're staying in

1049
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:15,199
there and they're staying dormant until

1050
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:18,288
the environmental conditions come to

1051
00:44:15,199 --> 00:44:19,879
where botrytis is is known to grow and

1052
00:44:18,289 --> 00:44:22,190
then it triggers it back into the

1053
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:25,510
reproductive stage and that that's where

1054
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:28,400
I think people don't take sanitation

1055
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:31,609
seriously enough in between harvesters

1056
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,358
all plant material every day that falls

1057
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:35,190
or any cut mature

1058
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,558
needs to be cleaned up because botrytis

1059
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:38,789
will go dormant and it will colonize and

1060
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,190
grow on there and if you're not careful

1061
00:44:38,789 --> 00:44:44,039
you could have a spore spawn out of

1062
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:45,869
colony grow on there and air hit it

1063
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:49,799
right you have thousands of spores in

1064
00:44:45,869 --> 00:44:51,239
the air so cleaning is huge when it

1065
00:44:49,798 --> 00:44:52,739
comes to cat right and you're right

1066
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:54,389
there's not many things you can spray on

1067
00:44:52,739 --> 00:44:56,309
botrytis that's why I think in the

1068
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:59,460
future UV light may have some potential

1069
00:44:56,309 --> 00:45:01,470
on killing pathogens on contact when you

1070
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:04,170
when you're not allowed to spray but

1071
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:06,568
cleaning and sanitation daily and in

1072
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:07,528
between crops I mean scrubbing the

1073
00:45:06,568 --> 00:45:09,690
corners of the room

1074
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:12,568
scrubbing under the tables and hosing

1075
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:15,749
things down that's critical when it

1076
00:45:12,568 --> 00:45:18,119
comes to the Treader Wow you know it's

1077
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:20,518
terrible as you know a lot east past and

1078
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,039
diseases are at the same time it's

1079
00:45:20,518 --> 00:45:25,858
pretty amazing the survival and

1080
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:28,349
reproduction strategies that Nature has

1081
00:45:25,858 --> 00:45:30,598
come up with in these cases I have to

1082
00:45:28,349 --> 00:45:35,489
kind of tip my hat to a certain extent -

1083
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:38,309
to these - these diseases but yeah it's

1084
00:45:35,489 --> 00:45:40,920
been a ting yep one thing that I hear a

1085
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:43,769
lot of growers doing in in organics is

1086
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:45,239
just taking their leaves off of their

1087
00:45:43,768 --> 00:45:48,088
plants when they trim and using them as

1088
00:45:45,239 --> 00:45:49,858
a mulch right there on the soil and I've

1089
00:45:48,088 --> 00:45:51,358
always sort of been against that and I

1090
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:54,328
think the reasons that you just listed

1091
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,588
are the biggest reasons why we want to

1092
00:45:54,329 --> 00:45:57,119
make sure we're removing all leaf

1093
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:58,798
material that doesn't mean just throwing

1094
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,970
in a bucket and leaving it in the corner

1095
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:01,619
of the room for the rest of the day you

1096
00:45:59,969 --> 00:46:03,748
got to get it out of there you got to

1097
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:05,460
clean your hands if you're if you're

1098
00:46:03,748 --> 00:46:07,949
doing that you know you want to go back

1099
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:09,150
in with the same clothes so yeah these

1100
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:11,429
are all things that people need to think

1101
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,440
about and with their workflow to really

1102
00:46:11,429 --> 00:46:15,118
reduce the amount of pressure that

1103
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,608
they're getting so that's that's a great

1104
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:19,920
point

1105
00:46:16,608 --> 00:46:21,719
yeah that's using leaves on top of the

1106
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:24,088
soil as a mulch I completely agree with

1107
00:46:21,719 --> 00:46:26,578
you that's gonna be a haven for trips or

1108
00:46:24,088 --> 00:46:29,038
spider mites eventually and yes it's

1109
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:30,690
dark under there usually cooler under

1110
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:33,390
there and it's usually more moist under

1111
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:35,039
there you will have botrytis thrive in

1112
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:38,998
those environments you know that's a

1113
00:46:35,039 --> 00:46:40,589
no-no all right well we haven't even

1114
00:46:38,998 --> 00:46:42,298
gotten to the topic that you wanted to

1115
00:46:40,588 --> 00:46:45,558
talk about when we first chatted before

1116
00:46:42,298 --> 00:46:47,579
the podcast which was nutrition so I

1117
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:49,259
don't know if now's a good time to

1118
00:46:47,579 --> 00:46:51,959
touch on that or if you want to take it

1119
00:46:49,259 --> 00:46:53,639
up and maybe another podcast but it's

1120
00:46:51,958 --> 00:46:57,509
definitely something I wanted to hear

1121
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:59,009
your thoughts on sure yeah I can I can

1122
00:46:57,509 --> 00:47:01,289
talk about it briefly at least the

1123
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:05,579
things that can be manipulating it

1124
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:08,099
should be thought about so I think the

1125
00:47:05,579 --> 00:47:10,259
first thing that needs to be said is you

1126
00:47:08,099 --> 00:47:12,298
need to think about nutrition in regard

1127
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:14,130
to your substrate and you have to

1128
00:47:12,298 --> 00:47:18,650
understand how your struggle your

1129
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:21,239
substrate buffers or how quickly it uses

1130
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:23,190
that the nutrition delivery system for

1131
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,650
your plant so in regard to rock wall

1132
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:28,048
that's considered hydroponic right a lot

1133
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:29,400
of times the fertigation strategies that

1134
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:32,579
are applied to rock wall are also

1135
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:34,739
applied to just flowing water for herb

1136
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:38,548
production in hydroponic systems and

1137
00:47:34,739 --> 00:47:41,608
tunnels and and things like this and in

1138
00:47:38,548 --> 00:47:44,759
regard to core compressed coir or

1139
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:47,608
compressed peat and you know it's we're

1140
00:47:44,759 --> 00:47:50,009
getting close to the age where many

1141
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:51,808
growers of multiple industries are going

1142
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:54,809
to start to use wood fiber because it's

1143
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:56,640
truly a renewable resource and a

1144
00:47:54,809 --> 00:48:00,180
renewable substrate compared to the

1145
00:47:56,639 --> 00:48:03,719
alternatives especially peat so wood

1146
00:48:00,179 --> 00:48:05,190
fiber is a is a very complex molecule

1147
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:08,208
and I'm not going to go into that

1148
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:10,769
because that's a more than IPM thing but

1149
00:48:08,208 --> 00:48:14,909
these different substrates have

1150
00:48:10,768 --> 00:48:17,008
different buffering capabilities Rock

1151
00:48:14,909 --> 00:48:18,929
oil does not the rock wall will have a

1152
00:48:17,009 --> 00:48:20,880
continuous feed to it right there's no

1153
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:22,588
buffering you're not gonna have build up

1154
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:26,009
you're not going to have difference as

1155
00:48:22,588 --> 00:48:28,048
much in PH like you would in different

1156
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:29,969
substrates so that's the first thing I'd

1157
00:48:28,048 --> 00:48:31,858
say that you need to understand first is

1158
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:33,269
what subsidies that choose why is you

1159
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:35,429
gonna choose it and how is you gonna

1160
00:48:33,268 --> 00:48:36,988
deliver nutrients through that substrate

1161
00:48:35,429 --> 00:48:41,969
to the plant how are you going to manage

1162
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:44,849
it so with that I think everyone

1163
00:48:41,969 --> 00:48:46,708
understands easy pretty well or you're

1164
00:48:44,849 --> 00:48:49,199
getting to the point where they do an EC

1165
00:48:46,708 --> 00:48:51,298
and this is just simple it's the amount

1166
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:53,940
of saltiness your fertilizer it's right

1167
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:55,798
so how many how much salt is present how

1168
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,528
fast can the plant take it up in in

1169
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:01,559
liquid form is based on its saltiness

1170
00:48:58,528 --> 00:49:03,329
that the increase of decrease of EC and

1171
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,509
usually due to high concentrations high

1172
00:49:03,329 --> 00:49:08,099
ppm sand concentrate and depending on if

1173
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:10,620
you have a delivery system of one to

1174
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:12,059
fifty or one to 100 because then you're

1175
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:14,130
easy at the end of the hose is going to

1176
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:17,969
be different based on your injection

1177
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:19,980
rate so without going too much into the

1178
00:49:17,969 --> 00:49:22,379
substrate and looking more on just a

1179
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:28,590
nutrition in general some key rules of

1180
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:30,360
thumb to keep in mind are first off no

1181
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:32,010
matter what fertilizer you using I

1182
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:33,660
wouldn't mix it how's your vendor

1183
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:35,280
recommends that you mix it if you allow

1184
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:37,469
it to go through your injectors and you

1185
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,300
take a sample at the end of that hose

1186
00:49:37,469 --> 00:49:42,000
and you send it in to a lab and you get

1187
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,710
a nutrient analysis no one can help you

1188
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,719
and you can't help yourself until you've

1189
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:47,550
seen what's on that nutrient analysis

1190
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:49,889
and what I mean by that is all the

1191
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:52,230
microbes and all the macros listed out

1192
00:49:49,889 --> 00:49:53,699
and parts per million that's exactly

1193
00:49:52,230 --> 00:49:55,800
what your plants receiving or that's

1194
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:58,349
exactly what your substrate buffering

1195
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,910
that to me is a huge priority for any

1196
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:02,369
core it's hard to know anything from a

1197
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:04,170
label to be quite frank you need to just

1198
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,150
allow these things to go through your

1199
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:08,970
systems and then see after your system

1200
00:50:06,150 --> 00:50:11,190
because injection rates we can do the

1201
00:50:08,969 --> 00:50:14,339
math but they're not perfect there's

1202
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:16,800
still at least a 5 to 10% error within

1203
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:18,630
some of these systems so don't be don't

1204
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,000
be too firm on the numbers on your piece

1205
00:50:18,630 --> 00:50:22,680
of paper get them sent into a lab when

1206
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,929
you see these parts per million of

1207
00:50:22,679 --> 00:50:27,259
macros and micros but first start with

1208
00:50:24,929 --> 00:50:31,769
the macros you have NPK nitrogen

1209
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:34,110
phosphorus and potassium a rule of thumb

1210
00:50:31,769 --> 00:50:36,210
for nitrogen and potassium is you need a

1211
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:37,829
one to one ratio if you have a hundred

1212
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:41,400
parts nitrogen you need 100 parts

1213
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:43,829
potassium potassium is known to regulate

1214
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:46,260
EC so let's say you under a strict

1215
00:50:43,829 --> 00:50:48,690
growth or encourage growth you can add

1216
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,940
more or less potassium increase or

1217
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:53,940
decrease your EC and you can control

1218
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:56,940
growth that way phosphorus on the other

1219
00:50:53,940 --> 00:51:01,019
hand if you're not careful you can have

1220
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:05,849
deficiencies quite easily and see here

1221
00:51:01,019 --> 00:51:08,610
when we talk about phosphorus a baseline

1222
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:10,529
number for phosphorous if 12 parts per

1223
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:11,849
million is the lowest you should ever go

1224
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:13,650
that's when you're trying to pinch

1225
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:15,268
pennies and you want to apply as less

1226
00:51:13,650 --> 00:51:17,429
the least amount of fertilizer

1227
00:51:15,268 --> 00:51:19,588
you can ask how parts-per-million you're

1228
00:51:17,429 --> 00:51:21,898
at saturation point with phosphorus at

1229
00:51:19,588 --> 00:51:24,148
24 parts per million and when you go up

1230
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:25,588
past 24 there's there's not been

1231
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:29,429
anywhere shown that there's a benefit

1232
00:51:25,588 --> 00:51:30,798
for that there's there's growth benefits

1233
00:51:29,429 --> 00:51:33,809
when you understand how to manipulate

1234
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:36,298
phosphorus so in some some crops

1235
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:39,449
especially in leather stock crops you

1236
00:51:36,298 --> 00:51:41,608
can you can manipulate inner node

1237
00:51:39,449 --> 00:51:43,979
between nodes you just need to

1238
00:51:41,608 --> 00:51:46,679
manipulate the links with phosphorus you

1239
00:51:43,978 --> 00:51:47,728
can also inhibit flowering so if let's

1240
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:49,139
say you're a grower and you're

1241
00:51:47,728 --> 00:51:50,848
struggling to get the amount of yield

1242
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:52,469
that you want and you've never done a

1243
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:55,048
nutrient analysis well you know you

1244
00:51:52,469 --> 00:51:57,148
could lack in phosphorus and that's

1245
00:51:55,048 --> 00:52:00,208
reducing your overall yield because it's

1246
00:51:57,148 --> 00:52:02,398
inhibiting flowering so phosphorus is

1247
00:52:00,208 --> 00:52:05,428
critical to be I would say at least at

1248
00:52:02,398 --> 00:52:06,868
20 20 parts per million in your safe 24

1249
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:10,309
is in saturation your even better

1250
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:12,539
anything above 24 it's not worth it and

1251
00:52:10,309 --> 00:52:14,099
anything below 12 you're going to see

1252
00:52:12,539 --> 00:52:17,969
deficiencies and start really hard

1253
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:21,630
coding the plant let's see what else

1254
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:23,278
here calcium calcium and magnesium are

1255
00:52:21,630 --> 00:52:25,889
two that need to be understood because

1256
00:52:23,278 --> 00:52:27,778
if they're out of balance you then all

1257
00:52:25,889 --> 00:52:31,139
have deficiencies of one or the other or

1258
00:52:27,778 --> 00:52:33,719
both when thinking about calcium you

1259
00:52:31,139 --> 00:52:36,209
need a ratio at least a three to one

1260
00:52:33,719 --> 00:52:38,458
three being calcium and one being

1261
00:52:36,208 --> 00:52:40,048
magnesium and it's because they don't

1262
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:41,759
interact well together so you need to

1263
00:52:40,048 --> 00:52:44,219
trump it with calcium so you can still

1264
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:46,289
get the plant to absorb both of them if

1265
00:52:44,219 --> 00:52:49,579
you can and if you understand how to

1266
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:54,959
make salt you want a five to one ratio

1267
00:52:49,579 --> 00:52:56,369
of calcium to magnesium so there's

1268
00:52:54,958 --> 00:52:58,078
there's multiple ways and it's

1269
00:52:56,369 --> 00:52:59,909
fascinating I don't think anibus has

1270
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,130
even touched on this yet but there's

1271
00:52:59,909 --> 00:53:05,278
multiple ways in regard to light

1272
00:53:02,130 --> 00:53:07,829
intensity and photosynthetic rate on how

1273
00:53:05,278 --> 00:53:10,228
you can manipulate insurance in relation

1274
00:53:07,829 --> 00:53:13,639
to light and control the plant so much

1275
00:53:10,228 --> 00:53:17,638
more precisely than we do right now

1276
00:53:13,639 --> 00:53:19,079
yeah and basically what you shared I

1277
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:21,059
think is really important if you're

1278
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:23,669
growing we're using ionic nutrients or

1279
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:26,699
mineral salts now how do we apply that

1280
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:29,129
to organic growing where we're actually

1281
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:31,559
in living soils

1282
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:33,269
in media that contains a lot of high

1283
00:53:31,559 --> 00:53:36,349
levels of microorganisms that are

1284
00:53:33,268 --> 00:53:38,548
actually cycling these nutrients for us

1285
00:53:36,349 --> 00:53:40,349
well it's it's a lot of the same

1286
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:42,000
principles and at the end of the day

1287
00:53:40,349 --> 00:53:45,720
right now all I can tell you is that

1288
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,358
kind of thing is the Wild West and the

1289
00:53:45,719 --> 00:53:53,009
reason I say that is is because I hear

1290
00:53:48,358 --> 00:53:55,348
these living living soils right and I'm

1291
00:53:53,009 --> 00:53:58,469
sure plenty of them I've heard plenty of

1292
00:53:55,349 --> 00:54:00,119
them works fabulously and it's because

1293
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:01,649
those companies have done the science in

1294
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:03,809
the background to understand how these

1295
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:05,759
microorganisms have mutualistic

1296
00:54:03,809 --> 00:54:07,559
relationships and symbiotic

1297
00:54:05,759 --> 00:54:10,949
relationships with each other and also

1298
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,750
the substrate and the plant and certain

1299
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:17,460
bacteria you know work together to

1300
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:20,909
produce nitrogen and ammonia and I think

1301
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:24,539
right now you know it it's hard to

1302
00:54:20,909 --> 00:54:27,690
regulate organic nutrition like you can

1303
00:54:24,539 --> 00:54:30,299
you know mineral salt nutrition because

1304
00:54:27,690 --> 00:54:32,639
there's so many microorganisms that can

1305
00:54:30,298 --> 00:54:36,778
have multiple reactions that's hard to

1306
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:38,759
have precision with I think it's it's

1307
00:54:36,778 --> 00:54:40,829
there I think some some companies have

1308
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:44,699
it down and even you know including

1309
00:54:40,829 --> 00:54:46,559
castings of certain larvae and another

1310
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:48,960
microorganisms and you can even rear

1311
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,690
nematodes inside wax moth larvae in

1312
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,000
living soils if you wanted to to prevent

1313
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:56,130
entrance of peas areum carried by fungus

1314
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:58,099
mats like it it there's there's all

1315
00:54:56,130 --> 00:55:01,200
these different strategies out there

1316
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:04,680
that I don't think are ironed out just

1317
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,989
yet and in some cases if you if you have

1318
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:09,358
the ability to make sure out salts I

1319
00:55:06,989 --> 00:55:11,368
think that that first needs to be

1320
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:14,429
figured out with this crop before we try

1321
00:55:11,369 --> 00:55:17,460
to figure it out with organic mineral

1322
00:55:14,429 --> 00:55:18,690
nutrition well I totally agree with you

1323
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:22,079
that we don't have it figured out from

1324
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:25,009
an organic perspective and these living

1325
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:28,890
soils I don't think we ever truly will

1326
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:31,259
just because of the fact that there are

1327
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:34,558
so many different complex interactions

1328
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:37,079
going on like you mentioned between in

1329
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:37,980
the rhizosphere between the plants and

1330
00:55:37,079 --> 00:55:40,230
its exudates

1331
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,548
the nutrients that it's able to uptake

1332
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:42,838
through these different microbial

1333
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:45,659
communities that are

1334
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:48,088
so incredibly complex that we're still

1335
00:55:45,659 --> 00:55:50,489
learning about and you know how

1336
00:55:48,088 --> 00:55:51,719
antagonistic or symbiotic various

1337
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:53,789
microbes are and many of which we

1338
00:55:51,719 --> 00:55:56,309
haven't even identified or can't culture

1339
00:55:53,789 --> 00:55:57,179
in a lab to really study so I totally

1340
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,479
agree with you there

1341
00:55:57,179 --> 00:56:02,429
that being said what I'm seeing is

1342
00:56:00,478 --> 00:56:04,798
because this is basically our side of

1343
00:56:02,429 --> 00:56:07,650
the industry and what I'm really

1344
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:09,719
passionate about and I untold yet why

1345
00:56:07,650 --> 00:56:12,059
why it's something that you're not as

1346
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:13,349
into coming from an ornamental industry

1347
00:56:12,059 --> 00:56:15,528
perspective because this just doesn't

1348
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:18,209
exist over there for numerous reasons

1349
00:56:15,528 --> 00:56:20,458
that make a lot of sense but what we're

1350
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:21,958
doing is looking at soil testing you

1351
00:56:20,458 --> 00:56:23,728
know an acid extraction using like a

1352
00:56:21,958 --> 00:56:26,068
male like three tests for example or

1353
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:28,649
something similar as a way of seeing all

1354
00:56:26,068 --> 00:56:30,808
of what nutrients are potentially in the

1355
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:34,019
soil not necessarily plants available

1356
00:56:30,809 --> 00:56:35,548
and then comparing throughout the cycle

1357
00:56:34,018 --> 00:56:37,468
and at the end of the cycle and seeing

1358
00:56:35,548 --> 00:56:40,288
what's being used up by the plant over

1359
00:56:37,469 --> 00:56:42,809
that period of time and then reom ending

1360
00:56:40,289 --> 00:56:46,799
that same soil as a way of maintaining

1361
00:56:42,809 --> 00:56:49,798
those levels of fertility over time does

1362
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:51,418
that make any sense yeah exactly

1363
00:56:49,798 --> 00:56:53,668
it does it does and like you can think

1364
00:56:51,418 --> 00:56:56,969
of it in the same principle as a grower

1365
00:56:53,668 --> 00:57:00,509
constantly using the same nutrition in a

1366
00:56:56,969 --> 00:57:03,108
concentrated concentrate what's the word

1367
00:57:00,509 --> 00:57:06,659
tank so let's say that you you irrigate

1368
00:57:03,108 --> 00:57:09,869
with a certain fertilizer concentrate

1369
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:12,059
with rockwool you use that same tank and

1370
00:57:09,869 --> 00:57:13,259
the same recycled water over and over

1371
00:57:12,059 --> 00:57:14,789
and over and over again

1372
00:57:13,259 --> 00:57:16,918
what does mineral nutrients are going to

1373
00:57:14,789 --> 00:57:19,380
be taken up at different percentages at

1374
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:20,908
different ratios by day three you're

1375
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:23,759
gonna have a different ratio of those

1376
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,619
nutrients in the tank versus day one so

1377
00:57:23,759 --> 00:57:27,869
I agree with you the plants will take up

1378
00:57:25,619 --> 00:57:30,479
these and use these minerals so

1379
00:57:27,869 --> 00:57:34,409
differently that we constantly have to

1380
00:57:30,478 --> 00:57:35,848
keep amending them can I just I'm just

1381
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:38,189
gonna go on a short rant here really

1382
00:57:35,849 --> 00:57:39,959
quickly so one thing I've noticed about

1383
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:41,958
this the cannabis industry and you may

1384
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:45,989
not have seen this coming from the

1385
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:47,608
nursery side of things but people will

1386
00:57:45,989 --> 00:57:50,188
come up used to come up to me and be

1387
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:51,869
like hey have you tried Product X I'd be

1388
00:57:50,188 --> 00:57:53,578
like no never heard of it whatever so

1389
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:56,220
I'll research it and either a it's

1390
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:59,130
something that is got

1391
00:57:56,219 --> 00:58:00,419
ingredients you know that you know you

1392
00:57:59,130 --> 00:58:02,849
could find you could find a much cheaper

1393
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:05,430
version of or what I find more commonly

1394
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:06,960
is that grower will be like hey my buddy

1395
00:58:05,429 --> 00:58:08,608
tried it and you got the most amazing

1396
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:10,710
results ever and I'll look at the

1397
00:58:08,608 --> 00:58:14,009
product and let's just say it's a it's a

1398
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:15,838
phosphorus product now but maybe the

1399
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:17,640
reason that his buddy got such a great

1400
00:58:15,838 --> 00:58:19,559
result is because his soil was low in

1401
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:21,059
phosphorus or his nutrient program was

1402
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,409
low in phosphorus and that boost and

1403
00:58:21,059 --> 00:58:25,108
phosphorous caused his plant to be

1404
00:58:22,409 --> 00:58:26,969
healthier and he he did great or but

1405
00:58:25,108 --> 00:58:29,159
that doesn't mean that that product is

1406
00:58:26,969 --> 00:58:31,409
magical and it's not necessarily the

1407
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:33,118
right product for your program if your

1408
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:34,818
soil is already high in phosphorus or

1409
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,650
your fertigation program already has

1410
00:58:34,818 --> 00:58:39,900
appropriate levels of phosphorous it may

1411
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:41,940
it may be have negative effects on your

1412
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:43,289
on your soil or on your overall plant

1413
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,970
health and I just think that's something

1414
00:58:43,289 --> 00:58:46,769
that a lot of growers don't take into

1415
00:58:44,969 --> 00:58:48,088
consideration when they're looking at

1416
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:49,858
all these different products they just

1417
00:58:48,088 --> 00:58:52,529
they just look at it either as

1418
00:58:49,858 --> 00:58:55,469
beneficial or detrimental and they don't

1419
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:56,609
know they're not taking into account all

1420
00:58:55,469 --> 00:58:59,098
the other variables that have to

1421
00:58:56,608 --> 00:59:03,088
interact with within an you know a

1422
00:58:59,099 --> 00:59:04,800
proper nutrition program yeah no I

1423
00:59:03,088 --> 00:59:07,170
completely agree and that's for the

1424
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:09,240
reason I said that first before you dive

1425
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:11,130
into your nutrition understand what the

1426
00:59:09,239 --> 00:59:12,989
capabilities holding a buffering

1427
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:14,910
abilities starter charges of your

1428
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:17,129
substance and in figure out how are you

1429
00:59:14,909 --> 00:59:19,259
gonna measure your nutrition in those

1430
00:59:17,130 --> 00:59:20,640
substrates and then start thinking about

1431
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:22,500
your nutrition and how you're going to

1432
00:59:20,639 --> 00:59:24,900
deliver it I completely agree with you

1433
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:28,019
yeah yes bit you have to understand the

1434
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:29,460
soil first and you can't just take take

1435
00:59:28,019 --> 00:59:31,079
something by you know by word of mouth

1436
00:59:29,460 --> 00:59:32,550
you have to trial it yourself you have

1437
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:35,670
to see a performer stuff it you have to

1438
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:37,500
send it and get an analysis run do you

1439
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:39,900
know exactly what's being delivered to

1440
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:41,579
your plan yeah and you can't use EC in

1441
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:44,010
the same way with organic soil as you

1442
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,810
would with rock wool or some of these

1443
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:48,589
hydroponic programs that you're talking

1444
00:59:45,809 --> 00:59:50,880
about I have seen people use EC if they

1445
00:59:48,588 --> 00:59:52,650
didn't want to do or didn't have time to

1446
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,210
do testing and say that their EC was at

1447
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,980
a certain level and then they try and

1448
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:58,530
hit that same level with their remember

1449
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,730
program but it's not very accurate but

1450
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:02,069
the numbers are going to be off the

1451
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:03,719
charts for organic soil versus rock wall

1452
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:06,809
and in some of these other more inert

1453
01:00:03,719 --> 01:00:08,578
media yep and they're going to be

1454
01:00:06,809 --> 01:00:09,869
different forms of minerals hence the

1455
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:11,430
difference in DC

1456
01:00:09,869 --> 01:00:12,569
it's going to be different the EC's

1457
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:14,669
gonna be different coming out of your

1458
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:17,750
hose as reviews if you were to get a

1459
01:00:14,670 --> 01:00:19,829
leach test out of your substrate I agree

1460
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,659
yeah well was there more you wanted to

1461
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:23,579
talk about in regards to nutrition I

1462
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:25,500
thought that was really helpful what you

1463
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:29,059
shared I I I learned some stuff because

1464
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:31,349
I've never looked at it strictly from a

1465
01:00:29,059 --> 01:00:33,570
nutrient in a ppm perspective because

1466
01:00:31,349 --> 01:00:35,099
I've always used organics so it's never

1467
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:40,830
something I've looked at in quite that

1468
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:42,690
way well I knew I don't really have too

1469
01:00:40,829 --> 01:00:44,519
much more I think in the future you know

1470
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:47,190
we could maybe have a discussion over

1471
01:00:44,519 --> 01:00:49,889
more organic nutrition or as I learn

1472
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:52,050
more about this crop to but I think in

1473
01:00:49,889 --> 01:00:54,629
the future we can talk about organic

1474
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:57,630
nutrition down to the ppm you know and

1475
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:59,309
we can make mixed substrates with

1476
01:00:57,630 --> 01:01:01,230
certain per you know certain percentages

1477
01:00:59,309 --> 01:01:03,360
of this type of carbon versus this type

1478
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:05,730
of carbon and trying to figure out you

1479
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:07,710
know degradable cycles and things like

1480
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:10,260
that and you know at the end of the day

1481
01:01:07,710 --> 01:01:12,990
that's a sense the right direction to go

1482
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:15,060
and we still have a lot to learn like

1483
01:01:12,989 --> 01:01:18,269
you said but now I appreciate the

1484
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:20,989
complication you know you bring that up

1485
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:23,940
but I wonder how do we do that if every

1486
01:01:20,989 --> 01:01:26,879
soil is going to have a have different

1487
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:29,039
microbial concentrations and diversity

1488
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:31,950
so our nutrient cycling rates are gonna

1489
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:35,969
vary so we may have the same inputs but

1490
01:01:31,949 --> 01:01:38,579
at the end of the day I just don't see

1491
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:40,529
how we really you know completely dial

1492
01:01:38,579 --> 01:01:43,489
in that that level of complexity that

1493
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:46,200
we're getting out of nature right now

1494
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:48,329
yeah well and I think that's going to

1495
01:01:46,199 --> 01:01:50,549
take you know certain companies are

1496
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:52,489
going to have to invest in labs and you

1497
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:54,900
know other industries do this now and

1498
01:01:52,489 --> 01:01:56,279
they they're going to get to the point

1499
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:57,750
where they they understand the

1500
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,280
interactions because they've tested the

1501
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,409
interaction of themselves you know you

1502
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,480
can do this you can you can take let's

1503
01:02:01,409 --> 01:02:05,539
say you want a certain

1504
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:08,519
trichoderma mycorrhizae bacillus strain

1505
01:02:05,539 --> 01:02:10,409
you can make a selective media you can

1506
01:02:08,519 --> 01:02:12,119
make a petri dish the only grows that

1507
01:02:10,409 --> 01:02:14,309
and then you want to compare that

1508
01:02:12,119 --> 01:02:15,900
relationship with another one and then

1509
01:02:14,309 --> 01:02:17,699
you can put those on the same plate

1510
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,530
together and see how they interact and

1511
01:02:17,699 --> 01:02:21,629
then extract that putting your liquid

1512
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,700
concentration and tested and see what

1513
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,858
enzymes or what mineral nutrients

1514
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:27,929
produced from the interaction you think

1515
01:02:25,858 --> 01:02:29,578
can be done the problem is half of the

1516
01:02:27,929 --> 01:02:32,338
products they give you a cocktail of

1517
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,900
over a hundred microorganisms and in my

1518
01:02:32,338 --> 01:02:36,000
mind part of the reason they give you a

1519
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:38,220
cocktail is because they're hoping some

1520
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:39,539
of those or at least 50% of them are

1521
01:02:38,219 --> 01:02:43,529
going to have a relationship with the

1522
01:02:39,539 --> 01:02:46,320
plant so in nature wherever let's say if

1523
01:02:43,530 --> 01:02:49,230
petunia was native to there's one strain

1524
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:51,269
of one microorganism but had a true

1525
01:02:49,230 --> 01:02:53,010
relationship with that petunia that's

1526
01:02:51,269 --> 01:02:55,588
why the products that we apply on

1527
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:57,270
petunias have a cocktail of

1528
01:02:55,588 --> 01:02:59,159
microorganisms because growers are

1529
01:02:57,269 --> 01:03:00,750
hoping that they'll see a response from

1530
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:03,179
one of these strains because we don't

1531
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:05,699
know yet which strain does the response

1532
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:07,799
we're looking for yeah and I'd add to

1533
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:10,169
that I heard Colin bell with mammoth

1534
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:12,539
microbes talk and he was talking about

1535
01:03:10,170 --> 01:03:15,300
how they created their product and

1536
01:03:12,539 --> 01:03:19,909
essentially it's a it's a combination of

1537
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:22,230
four different strains of bacteria and

1538
01:03:19,909 --> 01:03:24,929
individually the plant responds they got

1539
01:03:22,230 --> 01:03:27,449
from the four of them was not nearly

1540
01:03:24,929 --> 01:03:29,309
what it was as those four combined and

1541
01:03:27,449 --> 01:03:30,779
it was just through trial and error that

1542
01:03:29,309 --> 01:03:33,150
they came up with what they came up with

1543
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,349
but there is this sort of synergistic

1544
01:03:33,150 --> 01:03:38,190
effect to that we don't totally

1545
01:03:34,349 --> 01:03:40,859
understand either so there's a lot to

1546
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:43,139
learn there and you know I would love to

1547
01:03:40,858 --> 01:03:45,750
chat again I I really enjoyed this

1548
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:47,250
conversation I learned a lot too once

1549
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,719
you've sort of been on the job for a

1550
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,369
little while I know this is still a new

1551
01:03:48,719 --> 01:03:53,459
industry to you and you're starting to

1552
01:03:50,369 --> 01:03:54,990
visit more more cannabis facilities and

1553
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:56,480
learn more about this plant so that

1554
01:03:54,989 --> 01:03:59,399
would be great

1555
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,318
yeah no no I'd love to how is enjoy it

1556
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:02,940
yeah we're learning every day and it's I

1557
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:05,429
can appreciate your your listeners

1558
01:04:02,940 --> 01:04:08,220
because all of them you know they care

1559
01:04:05,429 --> 01:04:09,868
so much they're trying new things and

1560
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:11,250
they're all seeing different things and

1561
01:04:09,869 --> 01:04:12,599
eventually we're gonna have to find a

1562
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:14,818
way to kind of come together as an

1563
01:04:12,599 --> 01:04:17,670
industry and be like okay what have we

1564
01:04:14,818 --> 01:04:19,920
learned you know what what can we put in

1565
01:04:17,670 --> 01:04:23,760
as some industry standards to actually

1566
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:25,710
leave this crop along together so yeah

1567
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:28,230
learning every day man this is great

1568
01:04:25,710 --> 01:04:29,309
yeah well I again I really appreciate

1569
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,929
your time today

1570
01:04:29,309 --> 01:04:34,380
and I look forward to chatting again

1571
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:35,940
here in the future yep sounds good Ted I

1572
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:45,019
will talk to you later

1573
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:47,519
[Music]

1574
01:04:45,019 --> 01:04:49,920
that was Travis Higginbotham with

1575
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:51,780
fluence bioengineering manufacturers of

1576
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:54,450
LED lighting for the horticultural

1577
01:04:51,780 --> 01:04:57,000
industry their website is fluence dot

1578
01:04:54,449 --> 01:04:58,469
science or you can type fluence lighting

1579
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,780
into google and it will be the first

1580
01:04:58,469 --> 01:05:03,089
link you're listening to the cannabis

1581
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:05,220
cultivation and science podcast I'm your

1582
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:06,600
host Todd Hussey don't forget that

1583
01:05:05,219 --> 01:05:10,339
there's more information and articles

1584
01:05:06,599 --> 01:05:14,400
available on our website and blog at WWE
