1
00:00:01,879 --> 00:00:06,108
so I'm here with Suzanne Wainwright

2
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,790
Evans and we're talking about various

3
00:00:06,108 --> 00:00:10,609
pests and we're gonna start off talking

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:11,660
about the rude aphid can you tell me a

5
00:00:10,609 --> 00:00:15,109
little about that in relation to

6
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:17,089
cannabis yes I I don't wanna say

7
00:00:15,109 --> 00:00:20,030
everybody has it but I think almost

8
00:00:17,089 --> 00:00:21,980
everybody has it at this point and the

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,560
reason I wanted us to kind of start here

10
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,480
is because I'm getting contacted to

11
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:29,989
Instagram several times a day which is

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,679
fine but people are sending me pictures

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:36,530
of their rue de Foods and they're not

14
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,729
rude aphids in fact I've had a few

15
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:40,489
situations where people have actually

16
00:00:37,729 --> 00:00:42,318
been treating for several years thinking

17
00:00:40,488 --> 00:00:44,988
they had rue de foods and they're not

18
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:47,210
rude aphids oftentimes it's either

19
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:49,549
fungus gnats or now I'm actually having

20
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,359
a lot of people get mites confused with

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:57,548
rue de foods remember mites have eight

22
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:59,838
legs as adults when mites the first

23
00:00:57,548 --> 00:01:01,399
firstborn they only have six but then

24
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:03,679
when they molt they'll get eight and

25
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,760
generally when they're first hatch out

26
00:01:03,679 --> 00:01:06,079
of the eggs people don't see them they

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,359
don't see them till they're later in

28
00:01:06,078 --> 00:01:11,569
life and bigger and then they'll have

29
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,629
eight legs where insects which is what a

30
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:17,389
Fatah R they'll always just have six

31
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:20,599
legs and then their antennae so don't

32
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:23,659
count their antennae as as legs and so

33
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:26,118
you've got to start there because how we

34
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:28,490
manage my tissues is very different and

35
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:32,118
how we manage Aoife tissues

36
00:01:28,489 --> 00:01:34,149
I've actually I'm saving a whole file on

37
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:37,429
the computer of things people have

38
00:01:34,149 --> 00:01:39,890
thought or rude aphids that aren't and

39
00:01:37,429 --> 00:01:44,539
and the concern is as people are doing

40
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:46,519
all these bavaria drenches with or eyes

41
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,560
area using these two different fungi

42
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:50,269
which we're using for really food

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,829
management but they don't really do

44
00:01:50,269 --> 00:01:53,358
anything for mites so it's just people

45
00:01:51,828 --> 00:01:54,798
are wasting a lot of money and a lot of

46
00:01:53,358 --> 00:01:57,828
products going out when it doesn't need

47
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,140
to so that's kind of why I wanted to

48
00:01:57,828 --> 00:02:01,669
talk about him a bit yeah so tell me a

49
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:03,799
little bit about their about their

50
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,390
lifecycle you mentioned already the

51
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:06,979
adults the flying adults look a lot like

52
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:08,659
fungus gnats and people are confusing

53
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,370
those I know I've had a tough time

54
00:02:08,659 --> 00:02:12,829
looking at a sticky card telling them

55
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:14,000
apart unless they were side by side so

56
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,469
what are some of the key characteristics

57
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,219
throughout the etymology

58
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:21,020
the lifecycle of this test so general

59
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:24,590
okay so with fungus gnats when they're

60
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:26,060
adults they all fly the larvae are white

61
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:28,789
maggots in the soil and they have a

62
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,189
blackhead capsule and that's how you can

63
00:02:28,789 --> 00:02:35,090
tell fungus gnat larvae from other fly

64
00:02:31,189 --> 00:02:37,069
species in the soil and typically they

65
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,379
bounce around on the soil surface and

66
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:41,299
they have this very weird little flight

67
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:43,250
pattern they do and that's why when we

68
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:45,290
put out sticky cards for fungus gnats we

69
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,169
typically have them closer to the soil

70
00:02:45,289 --> 00:02:50,389
profile and not up in the high top part

71
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,329
of the canopy the canopy we is where we

72
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:55,399
put more for things like thrips but down

73
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:57,110
towards the soil that's where you can

74
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:00,590
find the fungus gnats bouncing around

75
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:04,370
he feeds most of the time they don't

76
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:07,250
have wings they develop wings when it's

77
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:11,210
time for them to disperse and typically

78
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,759
what I'm seeing especially in cannabis

79
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:15,620
but this can be true because there

80
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,969
there's several species of rude aphids

81
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,099
and there's some that attacked

82
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:21,289
vegetables some attack ornamentals some

83
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:23,239
attack cannabis but basically they all

84
00:03:21,289 --> 00:03:25,150
kind of hang out in the soil until

85
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,550
there's either an environmental cue or

86
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:29,870
something like the population gets too

87
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,580
high and then it's time for them to

88
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,520
disperse and this is what's happening in

89
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:36,800
cannabis is people think oh my gosh and

90
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,810
flower we have this massive all of a

91
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,939
sudden Rudy fat issue it's been there

92
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:42,140
the whole time it's just the numbers

93
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:44,300
have been really low they've been

94
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:46,849
hanging in the soil reproducing feeding

95
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,380
on the plant not developing wings and

96
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,319
then when they get to a certain number

97
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:53,209
or environmental cues may play into this

98
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:55,310
too which we don't know yet but they

99
00:03:53,209 --> 00:03:58,550
decide okay now we're gonna have babies

100
00:03:55,310 --> 00:04:00,110
that are gonna develop wings and then

101
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:01,969
that's when you see them coming out of

102
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:03,560
the soil and dispersing and you may be

103
00:04:01,969 --> 00:04:05,780
like oh no I've seen them crawling

104
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,569
around with no wings what you're seeing

105
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,120
are in matures that haven't developed

106
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:12,739
their wings yet I was just at a facility

107
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,989
a few weeks ago and we collected a bunch

108
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,790
of rudy foods and we looked at them

109
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:20,540
under you know my Dynalite by the way I

110
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:23,000
got a new Dino light I'm so excited but

111
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:26,240
you can actually see what are called

112
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,879
like wing pads and that's where the

113
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,889
aphid wings are gonna develop from

114
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:34,459
so even though you don't see full-blown

115
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:36,860
wings on him you can see on the immature

116
00:04:34,459 --> 00:04:38,509
aphids where the wings are going to

117
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,819
develop and that's just something that

118
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:42,259
as you look at aphids over and over and

119
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,670
over again you can start to see them so

120
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:46,069
you can see these aphids that are

121
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,720
climbing around by the hundreds or

122
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:49,639
thousands if you look at them you can

123
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:52,520
see these wing pads and know that when

124
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:54,409
they're going to shed their skin into

125
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,729
the next life stage when they get to the

126
00:04:54,410 --> 00:05:01,880
adult part of it they will have wings so

127
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:09,230
so take me through the lifecycle of the

128
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:10,519
Nathan okay start so for so for Rudy if

129
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,920
it's a little different than regular

130
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:14,000
aphids just a little bit but basically

131
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,100
if it's do a thing called

132
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,879
parthenogenesis and that means they do

133
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,110
not have to meet to have babies so

134
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:24,350
basically all their offsprings are

135
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:25,639
clones of themselves and this is why

136
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:27,740
there's a lot of problems with

137
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:30,319
insecticide resistance where people use

138
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:33,650
the same product over and over you know

139
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,569
natural pyrethrins if you use them over

140
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:38,509
and over and if mom developed resistance

141
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:41,269
since her offspring are clones of her

142
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:43,129
they're going to have resistance too and

143
00:05:41,269 --> 00:05:45,229
so that's why it's very easy to develop

144
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:49,879
resistance in aphids and insecticides

145
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:51,290
and the female as once she be she is an

146
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,490
adult she just sits there and I'll have

147
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:59,270
live birth for the most part this this

148
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:02,540
is um in in warmer climates and inside

149
00:05:59,269 --> 00:06:05,299
of greenhouses we generally don't see

150
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,060
them laying eggs there's in my entire

151
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:09,319
life I've only seen one species do it

152
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:12,259
and that's the cannabis aphid they're

153
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,599
kind of doing their own weird thing

154
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,849
so we'll just we'll talk about them in a

155
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,840
second but so inside your greenhouse

156
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:25,879
with cotton melon with your green peach

157
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:28,369
with even your Roode aphid what you're

158
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,019
seeing is just when female just having

159
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,930
live birth all the time and they're

160
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:36,019
clones of herself so and it just goes on

161
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:39,079
year-round now if you're an outside

162
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:42,740
producer of any plants in the northern

163
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:46,159
climate they do overwinter as eggs and

164
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,560
so when the days get shorter and the

165
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,789
temperatures start to fall if it's then

166
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,120
actually will produce some male

167
00:06:49,788 --> 00:06:54,589
offsprings they'll mate and then the

168
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,259
females lay eggs and then they

169
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:59,179
overwinter as eggs and then in the

170
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,610
spring those hatch and off to the races

171
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:03,079
again but in protected environments

172
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,939
where they don't get those environmental

173
00:07:03,079 --> 00:07:07,279
cues they just have babies year-round

174
00:07:04,939 --> 00:07:09,949
and you know I work a lot in South

175
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:13,429
Florida you know outside just babies

176
00:07:09,949 --> 00:07:16,158
year-round kind of thing so but for some

177
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:19,579
reason and and we're not sure exactly

178
00:07:16,158 --> 00:07:21,529
why yet the cannabis aphid the actual

179
00:07:19,579 --> 00:07:24,228
cannabis aphid not if it's on cannabis

180
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:29,448
but the species the cannabis e-fit it

181
00:07:24,228 --> 00:07:32,418
actually it is laying eggs inside of

182
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:34,038
greenhouses but it's well facilities

183
00:07:32,418 --> 00:07:35,930
that are using artificial lighting and

184
00:07:34,038 --> 00:07:38,360
we're actually seeing cannabis eggs and

185
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:41,180
we think it's when people are changing

186
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:43,129
their lighting and temperature to

187
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,459
trigger the plants to flower that's

188
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:49,009
triggering the cannabis aphid to go into

189
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:51,168
egg-laying so that's like this one weird

190
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,800
exception we're seeing and I've seen it

191
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:56,839
in Canada United States southern western

192
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,978
United States Eastern you know kind of

193
00:07:56,839 --> 00:08:02,929
all over this happening okay so would

194
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,550
these live births you get these little

195
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:06,168
tiny are they conservatives I don't

196
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:10,460
considered a larval stage at that point

197
00:08:06,168 --> 00:08:12,948
or is it actually or immature but it

198
00:08:10,459 --> 00:08:15,258
looks just like mom but it's a miniature

199
00:08:12,949 --> 00:08:18,050
version because insects basically have

200
00:08:15,259 --> 00:08:21,348
two ways that they can grow up and

201
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:23,150
become adults they have things like

202
00:08:21,348 --> 00:08:24,439
aphids that when they're born they look

203
00:08:23,149 --> 00:08:26,418
just like the adults they're just

204
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,310
smaller versions and each time they molt

205
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:30,740
they get a little bigger it's the same

206
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,820
thing with a stink bugs do that on the

207
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,139
flip side of that you have insects like

208
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,360
butterflies you know the eggs are laid

209
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:40,338
when they hatch out they're immature

210
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,219
stage does not look like the adult at

211
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:44,570
all and so they actually have to go

212
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:49,570
through you know complete metamorphosis

213
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:53,980
to completely change and so caterpillars

214
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:56,670
caterpillars do that flies do that

215
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:57,899
beetles do it you know ladybugs you

216
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:59,549
the larvae look like little black

217
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,860
alligators they don't look like ladybugs

218
00:08:59,549 --> 00:09:04,229
and when people see small ladybugs and

219
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:06,330
they're like oh it's a baby ladybug it's

220
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,389
like no that's the full size once you

221
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:10,920
see a ladybug adult that they don't grow

222
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:13,230
any bigger than that because they're

223
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:15,959
immature stage are that little alligator

224
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,930
stage and so that's what's so important

225
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,700
to know what the different life stages

226
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:22,259
look like and you know that's what I'm

227
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:26,670
spending a ton of time teaching in my

228
00:09:22,259 --> 00:09:28,769
workshops so if you do have an aphid in

229
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:34,019
an egg when that hatches does that hatch

230
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:37,679
as a little a little baby clone as well

231
00:09:34,019 --> 00:09:39,840
and this is so when you have egg laying

232
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,609
generally there's a male and a female so

233
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:46,440
you can get some genetic diversity in

234
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:49,980
there okay okay that makes it but no one

235
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,690
has done this detail of work yet on the

236
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,519
Cannabis even because of all the

237
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,470
limitations of who can study it and

238
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,490
moving it and yada yada yada all that

239
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:02,970
stuff okay so in terms of plant health

240
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,669
and plant damage with the cannabis aphid

241
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,320
versus the root David what are are there

242
00:10:05,669 --> 00:10:10,169
any distinguishing characteristics in

243
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,760
terms of how it affects plants or are

244
00:10:10,169 --> 00:10:14,759
they still using the same mechanism for

245
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:16,319
feeding well they do they they all EFA's

246
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:18,779
have what's called a piercing sucking

247
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,180
mouth part you basically have the plant

248
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:22,799
wall here and their mouth looks like a

249
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:24,839
straw and they just stick it in and

250
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,909
that's why they start feeding on the

251
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:29,550
plant juices they don't actually chew

252
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:32,490
the plant or take away pieces of the

253
00:10:29,549 --> 00:10:34,229
plant and this is why historically

254
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:36,750
systemic pesticides it works so well

255
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,550
because they're moving and the liquid

256
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:39,990
fluid of the plant and you know you just

257
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:41,909
tap your straw in there and you suck it

258
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:47,899
right up and that's why systemics do

259
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:51,089
work well on on a Fitz but as you know

260
00:10:47,899 --> 00:10:52,409
one it can lead right back to a lot of

261
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:54,300
resistance issues and there's a lot of

262
00:10:52,409 --> 00:10:55,559
crops we can't use systemics on and

263
00:10:54,299 --> 00:10:56,729
including cannabis is when you

264
00:10:55,559 --> 00:11:01,739
definitely don't want to be using a

265
00:10:56,730 --> 00:11:04,320
systemic on but what I see with the ruh

266
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:06,930
David is an overall just decline in

267
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,940
plant health they just don't look as

268
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,778
vigorous the color can be slightly off

269
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:13,199
it just stress

270
00:11:09,778 --> 00:11:15,480
the plant and usually when they're in

271
00:11:13,198 --> 00:11:18,769
like propagation the numbers are so low

272
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,990
you don't notice it and it's overtime as

273
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:23,959
the populations build and as the plants

274
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:26,519
get closer to flower often you have

275
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:29,489
thousands of these aphids feeding on

276
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:31,980
their roots and it can really stress a

277
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,589
plant especially add in any nutritional

278
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:37,110
stress then you put disease strain you

279
00:11:34,589 --> 00:11:38,249
know all these different factors and you

280
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:40,949
know typically people are pushing

281
00:11:38,249 --> 00:11:43,139
cannabis plants pretty hard to grow for

282
00:11:40,948 --> 00:11:44,519
certain characteristics that we want and

283
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:47,120
they're pushing with fertilizer and that

284
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:49,828
just adds into the stressors on there

285
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,499
but with the cannabis aphid they're

286
00:11:49,828 --> 00:11:55,588
feeding on the foliage of the plant and

287
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:58,980
that caused and it's the same thing with

288
00:11:55,589 --> 00:12:01,199
the other foliar a fat species and

289
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,749
they're again sticking their mouthparts

290
00:12:01,198 --> 00:12:07,878
in but you can see more discoloration on

291
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:10,290
the foliage also um when aphids feed

292
00:12:07,879 --> 00:12:12,300
since they're sucking up all these plant

293
00:12:10,289 --> 00:12:15,568
juices they take them in a lot more

294
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:17,188
sugar than they actually need and so

295
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,838
what happens then is they're like well

296
00:12:17,188 --> 00:12:21,870
I've got us extra sugar inside of me I'm

297
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:23,579
just gonna squirt it out and so they

298
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,620
actually will squirt out what we call

299
00:12:23,578 --> 00:12:27,870
honeydew and it's the excess sugars they

300
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:30,860
don't need as part of their diet and you

301
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,019
actually get sticky on the leaf surface

302
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,909
and this is often times when you get

303
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:38,639
ants moving in because ants like to feed

304
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:40,860
on that sugar and if it gets really bad

305
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,318
you can get what's called [ __ ] mold

306
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,699
growing on it and oftentimes people

307
00:12:43,318 --> 00:12:47,759
think they have disease issue but it's

308
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:50,099
actually all related to what we call

309
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,759
piercing sucking insects whether it be

310
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:56,009
if it's white flies and even some of the

311
00:12:53,759 --> 00:13:00,000
soft scales can do it but I've seen it

312
00:12:56,009 --> 00:13:02,490
in with white flies in cannabis so where

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,490
are we scouting for these various aphid

314
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:07,110
species well with the rooty that you

315
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,129
need to be scouting and probably I mean

316
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:10,199
I just think everybody should be

317
00:13:08,129 --> 00:13:12,539
treating and prop I mean and this is

318
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:14,938
what people don't do enough treatment

319
00:13:12,539 --> 00:13:17,219
and propagation they wait until the

320
00:13:14,938 --> 00:13:19,620
problem gets too bad and it's you don't

321
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,379
want to wait to treat for the problem so

322
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,669
you need to be scouting but scouting

323
00:13:21,379 --> 00:13:25,110
depending on how you're growing

324
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,019
can be very difficult people that use

325
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,730
the the large living soil beds you can't

326
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,049
really Scout fruit aphids because you

327
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:33,930
can't get in there and really see your

328
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,189
roots and once you get the Rudy if it's

329
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,469
in there they just keep building and

330
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,940
building and people end up fighting them

331
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:41,580
and basically they just try to keep them

332
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:44,760
suppressed in those soil beds you know

333
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,009
um with the foliar aphids you know you

334
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:48,509
go by and if you saw that video I didn't

335
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:51,090
Instagram while ago where you just bang

336
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,769
the plant onto the board a foods will

337
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:54,450
fall out too when you do that as well as

338
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:56,939
thrips and mites and so that's an easy

339
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:57,900
way to detect early populations on the

340
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:01,350
foliar feeding

341
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:05,519
even species so using a bang board to

342
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,980
get the bang a fit boom I see what you

343
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:11,129
did there so I know the ODA put out a

344
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,450
report on it I can link to that PDF it's

345
00:14:11,129 --> 00:14:13,769
got some photos and things like that

346
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:16,110
have you had a chance to see that

347
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:18,569
advisory oh yeah yeah it looks pretty

348
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,519
good you something well I mean it's a

349
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:24,060
basic but the thing is is we still just

350
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:27,059
don't know a lot about it and back to

351
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:29,759
this whole egg-laying thing it's the

352
00:14:27,059 --> 00:14:31,500
first time again I've ever seen a fence

353
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:33,210
lay eggs in a greenhouse and it's a

354
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,889
first time for a lot of people I showed

355
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:37,530
the images to other entomologist never

356
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:39,809
just like wooo because nobody's seen it

357
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:42,899
so it has a very unusual behavior about

358
00:14:39,809 --> 00:14:44,219
doing that and we don't even know what

359
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:47,069
really will feed on the eggs

360
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:50,009
I would assume lacewing larvae would

361
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,780
feed on them because lacewing larvae

362
00:14:50,009 --> 00:14:55,620
will eat just about anybody and anything

363
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:58,620
including their brothers and sisters but

364
00:14:55,620 --> 00:15:00,480
it's something when you are scouting to

365
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,789
be aware of because you won't readily

366
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,000
recognize it as an aphid egg it looks

367
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:09,569
more like a yellow to black almost

368
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,730
really shiny Mike and Ikes candy huh

369
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,430
what about aureus would that feed on it

370
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:18,570
it possibly would feed on it too I mean

371
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:19,739
my dream thing to do is to you know get

372
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,270
a bunch of the eggs through a bunch of

373
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,730
beneficials instead of my scope for

374
00:15:21,269 --> 00:15:25,199
hours but you've got to have the eggs

375
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,649
right at the right time you know it's

376
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:31,020
hard to do that kind of stuff yeah yeah

377
00:15:27,649 --> 00:15:33,990
so what are some treatment options that

378
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:35,879
you're aware of for route a phase or for

379
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:38,080
the cannabis aphid you know and we've

380
00:15:35,879 --> 00:15:40,059
talked about stuff

381
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,310
the Rudy Fed management in the past and

382
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,349
people listen closely because I had a

383
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:47,079
lot of people contacting me about it and

384
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:52,149
said I said things that I never sever

385
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:57,399
said so at this point in time as in July

386
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:59,350
11th 2019 we are not seeing success

387
00:15:57,399 --> 00:16:01,629
controlling and with any of what I call

388
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,690
the macro biocontrol agents the ROA

389
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:08,169
beetles the mites any of those kinds of

390
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,329
things yes if you put a rue David in a

391
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:13,088
petri dish with row beetle it's probably

392
00:16:10,328 --> 00:16:15,849
gonna eat it but it's not controlling it

393
00:16:13,089 --> 00:16:17,560
if those things work to control it it

394
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,389
wouldn't be such an industry-wide

395
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,500
problem because everybody's dumping

396
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:25,750
loads of this stuff out what we have

397
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:28,149
seen that the best thing we've got going

398
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:30,519
right now are the microbial what we call

399
00:16:28,149 --> 00:16:33,909
the enema pathogenic fungi they're fungi

400
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:37,328
that kill insects products like patan

401
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:40,149
Agard or my cotrol which are the bavaria

402
00:16:37,328 --> 00:16:44,169
bassiano and that's the GH a strain

403
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:46,120
strain has been successful but what I'm

404
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,379
finding is when people say I'm doing it

405
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,659
I'm not getting control the probe

406
00:16:47,379 --> 00:16:52,419
doesn't work they suck they're not

407
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:56,679
applying it correctly and also for the

408
00:16:52,419 --> 00:17:00,370
ninth million times the Tana guard is

409
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:03,069
not a GMO product it is not genetically

410
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,900
engineered cannabis industry you know

411
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:07,779
what I need my 10 foil hat for this and

412
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,990
it's actually upstairs okay it is not a

413
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:12,759
GMO product

414
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:13,660
none of those microbe deals on the

415
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:16,088
market right now

416
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,949
now they've selected them by saying wow

417
00:17:16,088 --> 00:17:19,448
this fungus works the best so working

418
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:21,068
these but it's not genetically

419
00:17:19,449 --> 00:17:23,980
engineered and I got people you know

420
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:25,928
saying it and in it it's not true you

421
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:31,029
have to fact-check what you're saying

422
00:17:25,929 --> 00:17:33,400
out there but that said the bavaria as a

423
00:17:31,029 --> 00:17:36,460
drench application and remember the

424
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:39,130
spores have to come in contact with the

425
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,740
aphid it's not systemic and you have to

426
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:44,290
get contact for it to work we're seeing

427
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:47,380
good results with eyes area which is

428
00:17:44,289 --> 00:17:51,059
another genus of anima pathogenic fungi

429
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:53,940
and that's in the product like PFR 97

430
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:57,690
but again you have to apply correctly

431
00:17:53,940 --> 00:18:00,150
and get contact so how how are you

432
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,330
recommending applying this I know I was

433
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:05,880
just interviewing a buddy of mine and he

434
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,149
was using the hold on let me get this

435
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:10,170
right

436
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:12,630
the the DRAM BP for with an aftermarket

437
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:15,240
five headed telescopic atomizing Lance

438
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:17,730
for a lot of his spray applications now

439
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,859
that's spring not necessarily for

440
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,269
microbial applications but how are you

441
00:18:19,859 --> 00:18:25,199
applying a lot of products you're

442
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:29,759
talking about well well so so the

443
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:34,110
microbials like the Bavaria or eyes area

444
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:37,470
so they work well on Rudy if it's not

445
00:18:34,109 --> 00:18:41,069
foliar a foot so you it's it's kind of

446
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:44,700
somewhat complicated so the fungus when

447
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:47,129
it's in the soil does a good job in the

448
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:48,390
ribbits but for foliar aphids it doesn't

449
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:51,750
work that well cuz you really have to

450
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:54,990
tank mix the fungus with an insect

451
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:59,339
growth regulator which are IG r s IG ARS

452
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:03,539
basically disrupt insects from becoming

453
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:07,019
mature adults so basically it's like if

454
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:08,879
a 14-year olds getting hammered with a

455
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:10,470
compound that will keep them from going

456
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
through puberty kind of thing it's

457
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:16,140
basically what insect growth regulators

458
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:18,690
do and this is very very loose the way

459
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,460
I'm explaining this but what happens is

460
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,980
when you have an aphid if it shed their

461
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:23,940
skin a lot really fast the foolery fits

462
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,849
and that's where you get those white

463
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:29,700
flakes everywhere if you spray in here

464
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:32,309
lanza by various spore or your eyes area

465
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:34,769
and then it sheds its skin there goes

466
00:19:32,309 --> 00:19:36,990
the spore if you tank making it with an

467
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:39,900
insect growth regulator it stops them

468
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,710
from molting and so that spore can't get

469
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,390
molted off and so if you're talking

470
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:49,529
about using these microbials for a

471
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:52,890
foliar application for a fadeev got to

472
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:55,259
have that IG are not necessarily for the

473
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:57,060
root avid species because you have a

474
00:19:55,259 --> 00:19:58,710
hundred percent humidity in the soil and

475
00:19:57,059 --> 00:20:00,720
the fungus works fast enough down there

476
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,370
but on the foliage you need that the

477
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,839
problem is

478
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:06,179
is when you look at insect growth

479
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:08,399
regulators most of them are disallowed

480
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:10,470
in cannabis production with the one

481
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,750
exception of as interacting and

482
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,579
depending on what state you're in if you

483
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,140
can use as interaction or not but as it

484
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:18,389
are actin is actually an insect growth

485
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:22,650
regulator that can be tank mixed with

486
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:26,220
the microbials for better foliar ef'n

487
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:28,110
management so as far as the sprayer your

488
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:30,690
buddy's using that's when you would use

489
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:33,449
that kind of sprayer but treating for

490
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:36,179
rudy if it's in the soil you need one of

491
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:38,549
more like the the drenching heads that

492
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,679
you know is like a heavy water because

493
00:20:38,549 --> 00:20:43,589
you want to get a lot of water volume to

494
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:45,240
get the fungal spores down into the soil

495
00:20:43,589 --> 00:20:47,099
surface and do the i mean its into the

496
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:49,679
media through through the soil profile

497
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:52,589
yeah yes thank you so what I'm wondering

498
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,380
though is how does an atomizer affect

499
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:58,049
these spores is it it's not damaging and

500
00:20:55,380 --> 00:21:00,240
damaging them so the main thing that can

501
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:02,909
damage spores is heat and that's why you

502
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,009
have to be very careful with foggers dr.

503
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:06,870
Michael Brown bridge if you guys don't

504
00:21:05,009 --> 00:21:09,629
know him you should know and follow his

505
00:21:06,869 --> 00:21:11,159
work up out of he's with the Vineland

506
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,559
research and Innovation Center and

507
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,058
actually if you're coming to cultivate

508
00:21:13,558 --> 00:21:17,700
this weekend I'm not sure when you put

509
00:21:15,058 --> 00:21:20,579
the podcast up but Michaels gonna be

510
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:22,830
speaking on microbials this weekend at

511
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:24,629
cultivate as well as I am I'm doing a

512
00:21:22,829 --> 00:21:25,678
presentation on how to integrate

513
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,679
microbials

514
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:30,960
with traditional chemistry's to use them

515
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,730
for bio control agents but Michael Brown

516
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,860
bridge has actually been doing study a

517
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,529
research up at the Vineland research and

518
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:41,279
innovation center looking at equipment

519
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:42,269
and how does putting up a very bacillus

520
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:43,950
and things like that through this

521
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:46,558
equipment and how does it affect it and

522
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:49,970
generally it's heat and pressure are two

523
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:53,069
of the issues but for just regular

524
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:54,480
sprayers it's usually not a problem it's

525
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:56,609
with these foggers where they have

526
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,460
really high PSI and you get the heat

527
00:21:56,609 --> 00:22:02,399
heat cooks and kills them yeah I looked

528
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,230
at uh this was probably almost a decade

529
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,050
ago I looked at some compost tea through

530
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:09,690
and fogger and it destroyed everything

531
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:13,079
yeah even the bacteria was was yeah well

532
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:15,929
there's cold foggers and and DRAM makes

533
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:18,148
one and again that's a stuff if you

534
00:22:15,929 --> 00:22:19,860
you can probably put a link in this for

535
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:23,699
the work that Michaels been doing on

536
00:22:19,859 --> 00:22:25,319
testing the stuff okay all right so

537
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:29,190
anything else on Athens before we move

538
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:31,378
on to a different pest um I just you

539
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:33,240
know just ID I'm willing to help

540
00:22:31,378 --> 00:22:37,079
everybody you guys know that because you

541
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:40,440
guys are taking full advantage of which

542
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:42,839
is okay but you know just count legs if

543
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,970
it has eight it's a mite if it's got six

544
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:47,490
it's a spider I mean it's a spider what

545
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:50,220
am I saying it's an insect if it has six

546
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,980
you know if there's you know antennae

547
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,749
insects have antennae you know just

548
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:56,399
basic things like that and that's why I

549
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:58,110
mean I'm not gonna completely promote

550
00:22:56,398 --> 00:23:01,798
myself but yes come to one of my classes

551
00:22:58,109 --> 00:23:04,819
that does basic insect ID so that you

552
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,819
guys can learn this stuff
