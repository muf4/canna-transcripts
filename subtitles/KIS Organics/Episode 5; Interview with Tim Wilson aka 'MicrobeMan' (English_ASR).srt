science podcast

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:22,168
I'm your host tad hussy of kis organics

5
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:23,970
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,769
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:23,969 --> 00:00:27,778
science-based perspective and draw on

8
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,118
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,498
share their wisdom and knowledge our

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,750
guest today is Tim we'll stir the

11
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:35,339
microbe organics some listeners may know

12
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,229
him better as microbe man from his

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,240
helpful posts on many internet forums

14
00:00:37,229 --> 00:00:40,769
Tim is a longtime friend and colleague

15
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,840
who has taught me much of what I know

16
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,660
regarding microscopy and evaluating

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,609
compost teas I consider Tim to be one of

18
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:49,649
the foremost experts and researchers on

19
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,960
aerated compost teas and microbial

20
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:56,250
amendments in North America Tim also

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,960
founded WWE logical Gartner org a free

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,649
forum for gardeners as a wealth of

23
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,450
information

24
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,299
I am honored today to have him on the

25
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,129
show we have Tim on here today one of

26
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:06,989
the the first things I would like to

27
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,100
talk to Tim about would be to hear a

28
00:01:06,989 --> 00:01:11,429
little bit more about your background

29
00:01:08,099 --> 00:01:12,899
regarding growing cannabis in Canada you

30
00:01:11,429 --> 00:01:13,769
have a pretty unique history there I'd

31
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:15,868
love to hear a little more about that

32
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:17,420
style of growing and how you did it if

33
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:21,679
we could start with that that'd be great

34
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:25,289
sure okay I guess starting back around

35
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:28,649
1995 or so is when I kind of more

36
00:01:25,289 --> 00:01:31,409
seriously got into growing growing

37
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:35,310
cannabis starting with outdoors and then

38
00:01:31,409 --> 00:01:38,880
slowly moved it indoors and a couple of

39
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:44,129
years after that I ended up having an

40
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:46,798
association with the BC compassion Club

41
00:01:44,129 --> 00:01:50,248
Society which provides strictly

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,670
medicinal grade cannabis - at that time

43
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:59,459
it was around 1,500 to 2,000 patients

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,459
now it's way up there who knows but at

45
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:05,310
the beginning we just started out doing

46
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:09,000
basically what everybody else was doing

47
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:11,340
with the pots you know like a five

48
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,469
gallon pot under the high pressure

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:17,460
sodium lights and then

50
00:02:13,469 --> 00:02:19,590
at the end of the the when we harvested

51
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:21,689
we would just dump the dirt out and use

52
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,849
it in the vegetable garden or something

53
00:02:21,689 --> 00:02:28,289
like that and then it just started

54
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:31,699
occurring to me that this was kind of

55
00:02:28,289 --> 00:02:35,310
stupid to be wasting all that so we

56
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:39,869
graduated from there to to just starting

57
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:43,830
to remix the the media as we went along

58
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,830
each time adding some more compost to it

59
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:50,270
and I should mention too that we had

60
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,340
also started out just using typical

61
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:58,170
chemical mixed fertilizers checking the

62
00:02:53,340 --> 00:03:00,810
EC TPMS and and all that stuff and we

63
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:03,089
sort of had started at the same time

64
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,400
graduated after that when we just

65
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,270
started using compost and some more

66
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,240
natural fertilizers and and at the same

67
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:15,930
time we had been expanding our outdoor

68
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,260
gardens and in the outdoor gardens we

69
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:22,980
you know we didn't mix anything up every

70
00:03:19,259 --> 00:03:26,340
year we just left it like a as if it was

71
00:03:22,979 --> 00:03:28,979
a vegetable garden and the the plants

72
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,150
outside we're doing just as well if not

73
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:36,479
better than the the indoor plants so so

74
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:39,739
then I thought why don't we we just try

75
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:44,039
to move outdoors indoors and so we

76
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:49,159
pretty rapidly graduated to using bins

77
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:52,889
and I guess that would have been around

78
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:56,180
1999 or 2000 something like that the

79
00:03:52,889 --> 00:03:59,669
problem being with with the bins is that

80
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:03,870
they take up so much space and you can't

81
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:07,439
move them around erm and so so then we

82
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:09,599
just got the idea of building bins which

83
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:13,109
could be stacked on top of each other

84
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,419
with with the lip sort of facing out so

85
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:18,720
there was a little space to get into to

86
00:04:15,419 --> 00:04:24,478
to plant the young plants the Kotik

87
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:26,970
rooted cuttings into and just hung three

88
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:30,029
high pressure sodium lamps in the

89
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:32,400
in the center and have the four boxes

90
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:36,239
stacked high and I'm I guess around

91
00:04:32,399 --> 00:04:39,899
seven seven stacks or something around

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,439
the lights we just stopped doing any

93
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:46,679
digging up of the soil just let it let

94
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:48,750
it be and you know at first I thought

95
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:51,449
this you know there's no way this is

96
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:55,500
gonna work but we experimented with with

97
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:58,589
one set it worked fine we just top

98
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,189
dressed in between harvests we would

99
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:04,949
inoculate with fermentations like IAM

100
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:07,259
fermentations and that sort of thing we

101
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:11,789
did the only prepared thing we were

102
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:13,860
using then was fish hydrolysate other

103
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:19,200
than that we just made our own own

104
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:21,750
compost keys with that system we just we

105
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:26,879
would allow the the plants just to grow

106
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:29,730
up over about ten days to 14 days then

107
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:32,819
we would just change the light to the

108
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:37,259
12-hour cycle and then start flowering

109
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:42,240
them so the the whole turnaround time

110
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:45,360
was close to 60 days sixty-four days

111
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,900
something like that the plants were only

112
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:53,340
18 inches tall approximately when we

113
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:56,219
harvested them but we doing it like that

114
00:05:53,339 --> 00:05:59,129
we got the same yield as we were getting

115
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,229
before where we were going these larger

116
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:04,168
plants and over a longer period of time

117
00:06:01,228 --> 00:06:08,728
and so we ended up getting actually a

118
00:06:04,168 --> 00:06:11,000
higher yield that way anyway that I

119
00:06:08,728 --> 00:06:13,918
don't know if I described it exactly

120
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,430
perfectly or anything but ask any

121
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:19,469
questions about that yes I was wondering

122
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:20,939
what size were these bins that you're

123
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,550
describing in and also what was your

124
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:31,019
media in the bins that you kept reusing

125
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:37,860
yeah okay so the bins were about 30 36

126
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:40,519
inches long and 14 inches deep and at

127
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:44,340
the bottom they were about

128
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:47,430
probably 10 inches wide and then whether

129
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:52,918
you sloped out to about 14 inches at the

130
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:55,829
top and making the initial mix you know

131
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,709
we found overtime with experience after

132
00:06:55,829 --> 00:07:02,908
we started the other bins is is fairly

133
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:06,989
important we tried to have a combination

134
00:07:02,908 --> 00:07:10,379
of things that stay in place for

135
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,329
drainage for a longer period of time you

136
00:07:10,379 --> 00:07:15,889
know over the whole but the life of the

137
00:07:12,329 --> 00:07:20,430
soil basically so so we use things like

138
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:21,769
fine gravel and pea gravel and that sort

139
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:26,069
of thing

140
00:07:21,769 --> 00:07:28,288
for that component intuitively I I just

141
00:07:26,069 --> 00:07:30,870
thought let's use as many different

142
00:07:28,288 --> 00:07:34,949
colors as we can whether that make sense

143
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:37,728
scientifically who knows but just in

144
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:40,288
keeping with the human diet that

145
00:07:37,728 --> 00:07:43,318
supposedly if you eat a variety of color

146
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:46,348
things you get a variety of of minerals

147
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:49,800
and nutrients so that was my idea with

148
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:55,199
that and then then of course we mixed in

149
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:59,038
stagnant peat moss and and topsoil from

150
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:02,879
outside and vermicompost that we raised

151
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:07,918
ourselves in in just in a big heap and a

152
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:10,259
barn full of worms can we talk about

153
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:12,688
that to YouTube yeah yep you have a

154
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,060
unique form a composting style and you

155
00:08:12,689 --> 00:08:17,930
I've seen the microbial results of your

156
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,249
your vermicompost and it's it's always

157
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,769
fairly superior to pretty much

158
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:27,270
everything else I see I'd love to share

159
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:29,098
that with listeners too okay well um so

160
00:08:27,269 --> 00:08:32,328
then do you think I finished off the

161
00:08:29,098 --> 00:08:37,139
other the mix there satisfactory I mean

162
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:40,259
but it I know it's um my way of doing it

163
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:43,918
is quite different and and and really I

164
00:08:40,259 --> 00:08:46,318
count on the the soil coming to life and

165
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:52,019
and having a life you know that's

166
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:53,669
ongoing so the the microbial population

167
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,970
is stay

168
00:08:53,669 --> 00:08:59,250
in there and doesn't get disturbed and I

169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,149
think that's really what contributes to

170
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:07,019
the success of the whole thing and I

171
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:10,980
should add to that as far as pests go

172
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:15,360
like insects that chow down on the plant

173
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:19,170
and root suckers and stuff like that we

174
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:22,800
we were really fortunate in that when we

175
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:27,529
brought in some of the topsoil and and

176
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:31,740
the vermicompost from basically outdoors

177
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:36,209
we also brought in some rolled beetles

178
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:40,110
and they they were just indigenous to

179
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:43,550
the area and they basically kept the

180
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:47,129
pests in balance it was just amazing

181
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:49,469
that that we had success that way but in

182
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:54,799
addition to that we had also we bought

183
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:58,320
some humorous and some / similes and

184
00:09:54,799 --> 00:10:00,809
both of them we also had another room

185
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,520
where we had 18 hour late going all the

186
00:10:00,809 --> 00:10:09,359
time and both of them multiplied on

187
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:11,759
their own why I don't know exactly I

188
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,129
didn't give them anything special to eat

189
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:17,639
or anything like that but especially the

190
00:10:14,129 --> 00:10:20,580
humorous just propagated like crazy so

191
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,279
whenever we needed them in another room

192
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,960
we would just dig them up and take the

193
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:31,860
minute and move them around so and and I

194
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:35,060
should mention that the the longest time

195
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:40,370
that we had those bins going without

196
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:44,029
mixing up the soil is was 7 years and

197
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:47,310
the other ones were about 5 years and

198
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:51,179
they would they they just got

199
00:10:47,309 --> 00:10:53,309
interrupted because our our contract

200
00:10:51,179 --> 00:10:56,789
with questioned by the authorities and

201
00:10:53,309 --> 00:10:59,729
we had to sort of shut down but with the

202
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:03,659
vermicompost we had two different

203
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:06,690
methods that we used for that one like I

204
00:11:03,659 --> 00:11:07,299
said we're was just done in a big heap

205
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,029
in

206
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:14,769
a small barn that we had built for that

207
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:17,639
purpose and we we piled up

208
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:20,230
horse manure that we got from our field

209
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:26,429
and we usually pick out the stuff that

210
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:30,278
semi dried out and and mixed in some

211
00:11:26,429 --> 00:11:35,588
sawdust and and straw sometimes but it

212
00:11:30,278 --> 00:11:39,730
was almost all horse manure and with

213
00:11:35,589 --> 00:11:41,740
into that we would mix some wheat brand

214
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,709
that was very cheap to buy it the

215
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:48,850
livestock supply store

216
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:52,389
some alfalfa meal at no greater than 5%

217
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:55,659
because I found out the hard way that if

218
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:59,139
you put too much elfelfa meal in it the

219
00:11:55,659 --> 00:12:04,809
nitrates just killed worms and we also

220
00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:07,480
put in some peat moss into that and that

221
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,939
I didn't say kelp meal yet did i kelp

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,190
meal as well so we we put in as much

223
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:15,370
kelp meal as we could afford to at the

224
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:17,470
time but it which wasn't very much

225
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:20,620
because it's a more expensive as an

226
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:24,399
ingredient and but the important part

227
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:25,870
with that is that we we left it for a

228
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,879
long time

229
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:34,600
so basically our worms were neglected

230
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:39,220
you know it we didn't we didn't harvest

231
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:42,430
it out on a continuous basis so my

232
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:47,759
opinion is that because the worms were

233
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:50,169
sort of forced to keep on Reed I jest

234
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:53,169
interject every little scrap they could

235
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:56,110
find instead of having new food new food

236
00:12:53,169 --> 00:13:01,870
new food new food given to them they

237
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:05,589
produced a superior quality and our our

238
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:08,078
vermicompost was not typical looking

239
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:11,740
like the castings that you see in the

240
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:15,219
bags that was sort of real gooey gummy

241
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:18,730
stuff anyway and then the other the

242
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,879
other method is that we use the same

243
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,269
basically the same

244
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:28,100
greetings accept added kitchen scraps as

245
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:32,269
well and raised them in in big plastic

246
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:35,690
bins but also subjected them to you know

247
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:39,529
staying in there for a very long period

248
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:44,350
of time our method of harvesting the

249
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:47,959
worms out was to use those plastic mesh

250
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:50,950
transplant trays we would just fill them

251
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:54,139
up with the worms favorite food and

252
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:57,170
cover that over with wet newspaper and

253
00:13:54,139 --> 00:14:00,470
then lay them all over at the top of the

254
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:02,029
the worm pile they would crawl up in

255
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,850
there and then we would just snatch them

256
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:07,909
off and then gradually throw them all

257
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:10,279
into a big bin and then come in with the

258
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:13,339
tractor and clear clean the barn out

259
00:14:10,279 --> 00:14:16,100
obviously we also scooped out some of

260
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,750
the worms and the castings of course so

261
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,870
one of the things you've talked about

262
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,779
already was just the importance of the

263
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,179
microbial communities in the soil as

264
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:28,129
being the most critical factor for

265
00:14:26,179 --> 00:14:30,559
allowing you to have the system where

266
00:14:28,129 --> 00:14:32,049
you could go five to seven years without

267
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:34,129
disturbing the soil

268
00:14:32,049 --> 00:14:37,659
could you give listeners a little

269
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:41,809
background into the microbial loop or

270
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:46,189
living soils as as you call them yeah

271
00:14:41,809 --> 00:14:50,419
sure okay so first off you know with a

272
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:53,480
living soil there's uh you know microbes

273
00:14:50,419 --> 00:14:56,360
live air are quickly so that there are

274
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,029
some microbes that have evolved to

275
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:03,110
function close to the surface of the

276
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:05,059
soil and some halfway down and some way

277
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:09,289
down at the bottom you know where there

278
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:13,759
could be rocks or whatever and so the

279
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:16,610
ones that are at the surface are the the

280
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:20,149
ones that decompose things the fastest

281
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,279
and scientifically it's called the that

282
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:26,750
treatise fear where detrás [ __ ] all that

283
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,059
branches and leaves and everything fall

284
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:32,809
on there and so they have at their

285
00:15:29,059 --> 00:15:33,649
disposal all kinds of fuel you know they

286
00:15:32,809 --> 00:15:37,698
can use

287
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:40,789
the oxygen which is abundant nitrogen is

288
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:43,490
abundant you know light even that some

289
00:15:40,789 --> 00:15:47,058
microbes use is is there - if they need

290
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:49,850
to so that's why that's the fastest area

291
00:15:47,058 --> 00:15:54,139
that things are degraded and then and

292
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:56,240
then the the altered component of what

293
00:15:54,139 --> 00:16:00,499
was degraded is then passed down to the

294
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:06,289
next set of net microbes etc etc etc so

295
00:16:00,499 --> 00:16:09,139
that's sort of a sort of a basis of of

296
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:13,099
why you wanna leave your soil intact and

297
00:16:09,139 --> 00:16:16,549
then you know if you're outside or if

298
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:19,550
you've quit some sort of rocks or

299
00:16:16,549 --> 00:16:24,639
minerals at the bottom of your soil mix

300
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:27,979
then possibly you have the the mineral

301
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,499
microbes that will therefore pass some

302
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:34,730
minerals up the scale instead of down

303
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:38,028
the scale the as far as the the actual

304
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:42,589
nutrient loop goes the biggest players

305
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:45,049
in that are are the the bacteria and

306
00:16:42,589 --> 00:16:48,860
archaea I should take a minute to say

307
00:16:45,049 --> 00:16:52,729
that our ki lump in with bacteria

308
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:54,889
because they're absolutely indiscernible

309
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:58,339
if you're looking at them with a

310
00:16:54,889 --> 00:17:01,789
microscope and for many many years

311
00:16:58,339 --> 00:17:03,709
we've we've thought that that it was all

312
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:06,048
bacteria that we're looking at it's only

313
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:09,588
been in you know the past twenty years

314
00:17:06,048 --> 00:17:12,648
and you know getting more and more that

315
00:17:09,588 --> 00:17:16,369
people are discovering that archaea are

316
00:17:12,648 --> 00:17:18,918
everywhere and that maybe they are just

317
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:22,278
as or even more responsible for the

318
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:25,189
mineralization of nutrients but anyway

319
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:30,460
so I put those together bacteria and

320
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:35,200
archaea they process organic matter or

321
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:39,079
minerals and then they are consumed by

322
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:42,679
towards OA and in the protozoa group the

323
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:44,778
the two important ones in in our soil

324
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:47,509
that we're looking for flageolets and

325
00:17:44,778 --> 00:17:52,700
naked amoeba and so they

326
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:57,379
they use only 10 to 40% of the energy

327
00:17:52,700 --> 00:18:02,660
that they intake from eating those other

328
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:06,470
organisms and the other 90 or 260

329
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:09,050
percent is expelled in an ionic form

330
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,660
that's directly available to the roots

331
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:17,119
of the plants that's really an economic

332
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:20,650
thing for the plant because then it

333
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:23,869
doesn't have to expend as much energy to

334
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:27,050
to gain nutrients you know that would

335
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:30,949
take us into another topic to talk about

336
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,859
route exhibitions but I don't know if we

337
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:36,380
wanted to get there quite yet but I

338
00:18:33,859 --> 00:18:39,049
don't know if I explain that as simply

339
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:43,220
as possible but to put it in a nutshell

340
00:18:39,049 --> 00:18:47,240
the the protozoa eat eat the bacteria

341
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:50,329
and poop out I own that the that the

342
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:52,880
roots can uptake that are already you

343
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:55,490
know in a form that that is available to

344
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,250
them yeah no that's great I think the

345
00:18:55,490 --> 00:19:00,620
way I usually explain it is when we're

346
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:02,839
putting out Miracle Grow or any kind of

347
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:04,279
you know chemical or ionic nutrient

348
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:06,759
we're directly feeding the plant that's

349
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:10,069
coming in direct contact with the roots

350
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:12,500
plant grows when we put out organic

351
00:19:10,069 --> 00:19:15,349
fertilizer like alfalfa meal or kelp

352
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:18,859
meal we're not directly feeding the

353
00:19:15,349 --> 00:19:22,099
plant but all this microbial interaction

354
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:24,169
is what causes these nutrients to be

355
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:28,339
changed into a form that the plant can

356
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:31,730
then uptake yeah true but that's that's

357
00:19:28,339 --> 00:19:34,730
exactly what happens and and you know if

358
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:38,509
we're if we do get into this a little

359
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:43,309
bit the the bacteria archaea and fungi

360
00:19:38,509 --> 00:19:47,470
that that initially degrade the the

361
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:52,730
nutrients of organic acids that they

362
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:57,380
excrete for that purpose and the the

363
00:19:52,730 --> 00:20:00,610
plant roots have the exact same organic

364
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,420
acids that they utilize or vary

365
00:20:00,609 --> 00:20:06,609
very similar anyway for to to release

366
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:10,330
nutrients as well

367
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:15,969
that's how how plants could do it

368
00:20:10,329 --> 00:20:19,058
without the the organisms there to cycle

369
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:24,130
the nutrients you have some of the

370
00:20:19,058 --> 00:20:27,808
nutrients which are stored in adhered to

371
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:32,140
these organic matter or clay particles

372
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:35,819
are you know stored as as we everyone

373
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:39,820
knows as cations and they have certain

374
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:41,889
net positive charges a lot of guys

375
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:46,740
talked about how you have a certain

376
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:52,540
balance of soil and along comes another

377
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:55,808
charge and lo and behold the the the

378
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:59,710
nutrients is is released from the

379
00:20:55,808 --> 00:21:03,399
organic matter or the clay and is that

380
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:06,990
then available to to the root but it's

381
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:11,769
it's it's not a hundred percent that

382
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:15,839
simple or maybe it is simple but it it

383
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:19,298
also occurs from its it's caused by the

384
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:23,220
organic acids I talked about so if you

385
00:21:19,298 --> 00:21:27,480
have say you have like calcium it's got

386
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:31,419
it's got a plus two positive charge so

387
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:36,970
we've learned that that it is released

388
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:41,470
by by hydrogen so if we look at you know

389
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:45,600
one of the organic acids say citric acid

390
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:51,130
which is very common it has eight

391
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:55,709
hydrogen bonds on it so if you consider

392
00:21:51,130 --> 00:22:00,059
that those if you divide the two into

393
00:21:55,710 --> 00:22:04,210
the eight we get four so that means that

394
00:22:00,058 --> 00:22:07,210
the citric acid could release basically

395
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:10,569
four units for want of a better word of

396
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:14,289
the calcium nutrient and so these

397
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:18,220
organic acids are actually really

398
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:21,279
by the roots and by the microorganisms

399
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:25,569
it isn't something that just happens

400
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:28,589
because of having a certain mix in your

401
00:22:25,569 --> 00:22:32,500
soil at least in my opinion

402
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:36,939
so do you follow what I mean or is that

403
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:38,710
too crazy so these these organic acids

404
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,269
that are produced both by the plant

405
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:46,930
roots as in the form of an exudate or by

406
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:49,329
these micro microbes in the soil you're

407
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:52,060
saying is what is what's essentially

408
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:55,049
making these various plant nutrients

409
00:22:52,059 --> 00:22:59,259
available to the plant in an ionic form

410
00:22:55,049 --> 00:23:05,710
it yeah it is actually what releases

411
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:08,769
from the where it's stuck you know the

412
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:10,900
cation exchange capacity right where

413
00:23:08,769 --> 00:23:14,589
it's stuck to the organic matter or the

414
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:19,620
clay particle so that it's the trade of

415
00:23:14,589 --> 00:23:23,490
the hydrogen atoms that make up that

416
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:28,479
molecular structure that actually

417
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:35,890
releases equal amount of nutrient from

418
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:38,500
the positive charge caddy on sure so so

419
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:41,440
so it's it's it's still it's the roots

420
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:44,289
of the plant and the microorganisms that

421
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,269
are making that happen that's why I

422
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:50,519
would say it's important in your slow

423
00:23:46,269 --> 00:23:55,000
mix to have microbial microbial a active

424
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:58,150
media meaning adding in vermicompost or

425
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,880
having a high quality compost fraction

426
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:03,340
in there as well as a good peat moss is

427
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,850
a good way to increase that nutrient

428
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:09,299
cycling yeah absolutely

429
00:24:06,849 --> 00:24:14,500
and like with peat moss it's got a

430
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:18,849
really high CEC so it it has a large

431
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:23,259
capacity to hold nutrients which are

432
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:27,459
then available on an ongoing basis yeah

433
00:24:23,259 --> 00:24:28,179
so the plant can control what nutrients

434
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,569
become available

435
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:33,100
by the exudates that's feeding to the

436
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:36,009
microbial populations in the rhizosphere

437
00:24:33,099 --> 00:24:37,808
as well as the organic acids it's using

438
00:24:36,009 --> 00:24:40,929
to break down some of these nutrients

439
00:24:37,808 --> 00:24:44,548
itself is that correct yeah basically

440
00:24:40,929 --> 00:24:48,399
it's kind of um it's complex beyond

441
00:24:44,548 --> 00:24:51,658
complete simplification but in in my

442
00:24:48,398 --> 00:24:57,008
mind I sort of simplified it in in the

443
00:24:51,659 --> 00:25:01,149
that the even though the the roots can

444
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:04,169
excrete these organic acids to get the

445
00:25:01,148 --> 00:25:08,709
nutrients themselves they can also

446
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:14,649
excrete amino acids and sugars that

447
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:17,470
attract certain bacteria to them and so

448
00:25:14,648 --> 00:25:21,538
then by attracting and feeding those

449
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:25,960
bacteria the the bacteria increase

450
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:31,388
vastly in population very quickly and so

451
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:34,990
that stimulates the protozoa to come out

452
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:38,589
of their cysts to exist and then they

453
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:42,429
begin dividing so as the bacteria

454
00:25:38,589 --> 00:25:44,709
release the basic nutrients that we

455
00:25:42,429 --> 00:25:50,110
talked about with with the excretion of

456
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:53,710
their organic acids and then the the

457
00:25:50,109 --> 00:25:57,538
protozoa began feeding on them they

458
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:59,788
basically multiply the amount of

459
00:25:57,538 --> 00:26:05,308
nutrient that would have been available

460
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:09,548
to begin with so so for the economy of

461
00:26:05,308 --> 00:26:12,849
the plant it makes great sense that it

462
00:26:09,548 --> 00:26:16,898
has released this energy in the form of

463
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:19,439
the amino acids and sugars to start

464
00:26:16,898 --> 00:26:22,418
feeding these bacteria to begin with

465
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:25,629
it's it's almost like when you watch a

466
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:28,028
compost tea developing right when you

467
00:26:25,628 --> 00:26:31,269
you start it up and then you feed it

468
00:26:28,028 --> 00:26:35,019
some molasses or whatever food stock and

469
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:37,450
and the bacteria are the are just about

470
00:26:35,019 --> 00:26:40,659
the first thing to begin multiplying and

471
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,890
then because of that the existence of

472
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:45,190
all those bacteria

473
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,070
it stimulates the protozoa to come out

474
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:51,279
of their cysts and to begin to divide as

475
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:55,019
well so it's kind of the same thing as

476
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:57,160
going on but it's in in the soil so

477
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:59,349
let's talk about this before anyone

478
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:02,680
takes this concept and starts dumping

479
00:26:59,349 --> 00:27:05,519
sugar all over their other plants can

480
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,779
you explain a little bit more about

481
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:10,450
maybe a little bit about molasses and

482
00:27:07,779 --> 00:27:12,009
different sugars and then also what

483
00:27:10,450 --> 00:27:16,000
happens when you put too much and what

484
00:27:12,009 --> 00:27:18,910
happens when these bacteria reproduces

485
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,779
too rapidly if the bacteria produce too

486
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:22,600
rapidly

487
00:27:19,779 --> 00:27:25,779
you mean in in the soil or do you mean

488
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:27,699
in a compost tea I want to save compost

489
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:28,720
tea for just a second I'm talking about

490
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:31,360
just in the soil

491
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,710
I I'm kind of leading you to a question

492
00:27:31,359 --> 00:27:34,479
but I think you're gonna get there so

493
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,610
what happens if we add let's just say

494
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,950
too much molasses into into a soil

495
00:27:36,609 --> 00:27:44,379
what's gonna what's going to occur I'm

496
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:46,420
not really sure you know I can't say and

497
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:49,120
I don't I don't know what too much is

498
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:51,850
but I'm too much of anything is not good

499
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:54,969
and so I would I would just guess that

500
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:57,699
if you put too much molasses in there

501
00:27:54,970 --> 00:28:01,150
you'll get an overabundance of bacteria

502
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:04,569
and they may end up eating everything in

503
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:08,130
sight it depends on what you have in the

504
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:11,619
soil to begin with you know because

505
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:15,940
molasses is a food for fungi as well as

506
00:28:11,619 --> 00:28:19,239
bacteria so it does make some sense to

507
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:22,660
to just apply some diluted molasses

508
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:24,400
occasionally to to soil they use

509
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,210
molasses I don't know if you know about

510
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:32,140
this but if there's um like an oil spill

511
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:34,870
out in a wilderness area they they pour

512
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:38,040
diluted molasses into the soil to

513
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:43,209
stimulate the the bacterial population

514
00:28:38,039 --> 00:28:46,089
that will consume the oil I didn't know

515
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:49,809
that yeah what I was getting at is you

516
00:28:46,089 --> 00:28:52,569
have the potential for the the bacteria

517
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,730
to wrap to multiply so rapidly that they

518
00:28:52,569 --> 00:28:57,099
could actually create

519
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,490
temperature increase in the soil around

520
00:28:57,099 --> 00:29:02,949
the root zone which could cause the

521
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:04,930
plants to suffer or that the bacteria

522
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:08,590
could be more efficient and accessing

523
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:11,380
that food source to where it could pull

524
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:14,169
nitrogen and other nutrients from what

525
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:16,780
the plant could access yeah that that's

526
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,400
a possibility for sure that's kind of

527
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:22,539
what I was I was trying to get at just

528
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:24,070
caution listeners yeah well you caution

529
00:29:22,539 --> 00:29:29,589
with everything the same thing can

530
00:29:24,069 --> 00:29:31,569
happen if you if you put mix like

531
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:34,990
woodchips or something

532
00:29:31,569 --> 00:29:38,619
into your soil ones which ships that are

533
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:42,759
not composted or aged the same thing can

534
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:45,929
happen the the bacteria and maybe fungi

535
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:50,079
will use up all of the available

536
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:53,320
nitrogen in an effort to to degrade that

537
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:57,069
those wood chips and so then they they

538
00:29:53,319 --> 00:30:01,059
lock it away from the plant that's why I

539
00:29:57,069 --> 00:30:04,689
don't like the idea of of burying things

540
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:07,029
down in the soil for the the plant to

541
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:10,120
come upon sometime in the future or

542
00:30:07,029 --> 00:30:13,420
whatever because that that's always a

543
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:16,689
possibility for that to occur if you put

544
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:20,680
some sort of raw organic matter down

545
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:22,450
there that that is not stable are you

546
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,480
talking about Hugo culture beds are you

547
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:27,490
talking about the layers that I've heard

548
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:30,430
some of the like the revit recommended

549
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,220
with the true living organics Oh some

550
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:36,820
some yeah the the layers sort of thing

551
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:39,910
the spikes um some guys say that they

552
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:43,169
they have great success if they put a

553
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:46,120
dead animal at the bottom of the pit

554
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:48,340
before they plant and stuff and and

555
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:51,099
sometimes that works out great you know

556
00:30:48,339 --> 00:30:53,859
it's just it almost seems like it's

557
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:56,319
happenstance that sometimes there's a

558
00:30:53,859 --> 00:30:59,139
lock-up and sometimes there isn't I've

559
00:30:56,319 --> 00:31:03,250
been caught for sure with my pants down

560
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:07,060
with that one by by mixing stuff in too

561
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:08,470
soon okay so let's

562
00:31:07,059 --> 00:31:10,769
change direction a little bit here and

563
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,230
talk a little about soil testing so I

564
00:31:10,769 --> 00:31:15,970
know that certain groups like in the

565
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,950
past I've heard some people claim that

566
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:20,289
if that all the nutrients we need are

567
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:22,059
already in soils we just need to add the

568
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,440
right microbial populations

569
00:31:22,059 --> 00:31:25,509
they'll make these nutrients available

570
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:28,480
well there's other groups that will say

571
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:30,339
hey if we get the right mineral content

572
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:31,960
and balanced in the soil and everything

573
00:31:30,339 --> 00:31:34,089
is you know the soil is mineral e

574
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:36,220
balanced then these microbes are just

575
00:31:34,089 --> 00:31:38,319
gonna appear and start reproducing and

576
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:40,299
then we'll have optimal soils can you

577
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:45,189
give me your sort of taken experience on

578
00:31:40,299 --> 00:31:48,299
all of this well I don't think that that

579
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:51,220
every soil everywhere will produce

580
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:54,430
whatever you need just because it has a

581
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:57,759
good microbial population there may be

582
00:31:54,430 --> 00:32:02,500
certain soils in some areas that you can

583
00:31:57,759 --> 00:32:05,289
say that about I'm in the the group or

584
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:10,200
maybe by myself where I think it's

585
00:32:05,289 --> 00:32:14,079
important to include as many diverse

586
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:18,130
nutrient components as you can within

587
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:20,949
reason and and that that's why you know

588
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:23,650
we we used you know so many different

589
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:27,250
things in our soil mixes like the

590
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:30,940
different we would Cakes stone from one

591
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:33,730
area and and use the vermicompost and

592
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:37,750
that sort of thing and that's what I

593
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:42,269
think is is necessary I haven't bought

594
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:46,809
into the whole balanced soil thing

595
00:32:42,269 --> 00:32:48,990
because the way I've been looking at at

596
00:32:46,809 --> 00:32:53,139
the way that plants and microorganisms

597
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:57,190
work together to acquire the necessary

598
00:32:53,140 --> 00:33:00,460
nutrients sort of goes against that in

599
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:02,350
in my mind because I think what you're

600
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,710
saying when you say if you have a

601
00:33:02,349 --> 00:33:08,829
balanced soil and then all of the it'll

602
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:11,079
it'll cause this to release that and

603
00:33:08,829 --> 00:33:14,289
this will be available instead of being

604
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:17,889
locked up and it sort of goes against

605
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:20,589
the plant being sort of having an

606
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:22,389
influence over its environment

607
00:33:20,589 --> 00:33:25,798
and as if it's just something that's

608
00:33:22,388 --> 00:33:29,668
being held up and sucking up nutrients

609
00:33:25,798 --> 00:33:34,808
whereas I I think it really does work

610
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:38,639
kind of the way I described that the the

611
00:33:34,808 --> 00:33:43,778
plant is working in concert with the

612
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:47,918
microorganisms and the organic materials

613
00:33:43,778 --> 00:33:51,579
that are around it and those can be you

614
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:56,528
know organic matter can be compost

615
00:33:51,579 --> 00:34:00,189
vermicompost powdered rock minerals clay

616
00:33:56,528 --> 00:34:02,589
powders whatever which so that's why I

617
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:07,929
like to put you know within reason as

618
00:34:02,589 --> 00:34:10,719
much as I can but but balance it as far

619
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:12,550
as the soil being able to breathe and

620
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:17,019
drain and that sort of thing at the same

621
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:20,050
time I hope I answered your question a

622
00:34:17,019 --> 00:34:22,418
lot you did and you didn't so the

623
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:23,769
physical properties of the soil totally

624
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:26,378
agree with in terms of the amount of

625
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:28,418
porosity drain inch aeration when we

626
00:34:26,378 --> 00:34:30,639
talk about a soil though let's say you

627
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:33,638
have a soil that is deficient in calcium

628
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,220
that that calcium has to come from

629
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:37,838
somewhere yeah absolutely

630
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,299
so there is something to balancing the

631
00:34:37,838 --> 00:34:42,909
soil and saying hey I just did a soil

632
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:46,060
test this is obviously low in calcium I

633
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:48,220
need to raise my calcium levels up to X

634
00:34:46,059 --> 00:34:50,710
whatever that level is that you want to

635
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:53,769
set it at I totally agree with you in

636
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:56,019
terms of the fact that mineral balancing

637
00:34:53,769 --> 00:35:01,059
is just certain people's best guess

638
00:34:56,019 --> 00:35:03,759
whether it's you know Kinsey Solomon

639
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:05,650
you know Michaelis Terra all of these

640
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,569
guys are just you know carry reams

641
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:11,108
they're trying to guess at what they

642
00:35:07,568 --> 00:35:14,130
think is optimal for plant health for

643
00:35:11,108 --> 00:35:16,509
various crops but we don't we don't know

644
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,550
there just hasn't been enough research

645
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:22,990
it seems like to me on in that regard

646
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:25,150
yeah well so I I haven't said that you

647
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:27,399
shouldn't have calcium or you shouldn't

648
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:30,099
have all of the components possible what

649
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,710
I am saying is that they they should be

650
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:34,000
there but they don't necessarily have to

651
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,820
be there

652
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:41,320
in in the certain ratios that someone

653
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:44,470
has delineated sure yeah that's that's

654
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,019
all so and sure you could end up with

655
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:50,319
some soil that's deficient in calcium

656
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:52,000
and then sure you need to add some

657
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,650
component and it's going to supply the

658
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,840
calcium absolutely

659
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,720
so you're saying don't get too caught up

660
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,970
or freak out if your potassium is not at

661
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:04,389
three to five percent of your CEC or

662
00:36:00,969 --> 00:36:06,848
your your calcium is not sixty to

663
00:36:04,389 --> 00:36:09,579
seventy percent and all of that sort of

664
00:36:06,849 --> 00:36:10,869
thing yeah right but that's what I mean

665
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,940
yes

666
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:15,608
whether I'm I can't say that I'm a

667
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,639
hundred percent right but that's that's

668
00:36:15,608 --> 00:36:21,519
how I grew but definitely you you know

669
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:23,409
you try to include everything that you

670
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:25,960
can and and it all depends on an

671
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:30,179
individual circumstances some people can

672
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:34,030
afford to send a way to Timbuktu for

673
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:38,710
whatever ingredient right others like

674
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:41,740
where we were we were on a farm ninety

675
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:44,230
miles away from the closest town and so

676
00:36:41,739 --> 00:36:48,519
we used what was at hand

677
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:51,608
and and made what we could make lucky I

678
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:54,460
guess we we did have all of the

679
00:36:51,608 --> 00:36:57,699
necessary components existent in the

680
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:59,949
materials that were around the area we

681
00:36:57,699 --> 00:37:02,309
talked a little bit about soils and you

682
00:36:59,949 --> 00:37:05,799
talked about the importance of these

683
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:08,250
microbial communities in this soil the

684
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,780
way I met you was actually through a

685
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:14,320
discussion board hosted by Jeff flow in

686
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:16,240
Fell's on aerated compost teas and I

687
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:19,420
consider you one of the foremost experts

688
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:22,029
on the continent when it comes to this

689
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,500
subject so I would love to kind of dive

690
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,990
in a little bit to that if you have time

691
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:29,829
right now to discuss a little bit more

692
00:37:25,989 --> 00:37:32,409
about what aerated compost teas are what

693
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:33,639
they are not and what you what you would

694
00:37:32,409 --> 00:37:38,129
recommend for people that are just

695
00:37:33,639 --> 00:37:43,719
starting out in using compost teas

696
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:48,610
okay so what is aerated compost tea it's

697
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:52,029
basically a water base that's got air

698
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:56,740
being pumped into it and house and it's

699
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:59,500
being agitated and compost is added and

700
00:37:56,739 --> 00:38:03,189
the agitation extracts the

701
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:07,780
microorganisms that are existing in the

702
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:11,740
compost or vermicompost and a food

703
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:16,000
source is provided that feeds the

704
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:21,279
bacteria archaea and fungi that are

705
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,880
existent in your compost and as they

706
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:29,080
multiply that stimulates as I said

707
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:33,430
before the protozoa to come out of their

708
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:39,779
cysts and begin to divide and multiply

709
00:38:33,429 --> 00:38:45,309
as well so over a period of time the

710
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:49,930
population expands and reaches a sort of

711
00:38:45,309 --> 00:38:51,909
an approximate ratio where you have lots

712
00:38:49,929 --> 00:38:55,359
of but you can see if you use a

713
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:58,059
microscope lots of bacteria and and

714
00:38:55,360 --> 00:39:01,420
protozoa the protozoa

715
00:38:58,059 --> 00:39:03,610
are eating the bacteria so that's when

716
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,010
the nutrient cycling is occurring and

717
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:10,240
it's at its peak and if so that's your

718
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:14,710
purpose for using the compost tea that

719
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:18,029
is the time to apply it now what's the

720
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:22,599
window when that generally occurs for me

721
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:25,120
36 hours is pretty safe if you have if

722
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,559
you're not using a microscope that's a

723
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:32,289
good time people talk about different

724
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:36,730
recipes and making a fungal tea opposed

725
00:39:32,289 --> 00:39:39,940
to a bacterial tea and anyway it doesn't

726
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:42,190
really work that way as far as recipe

727
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:44,559
goes all the way you can have some

728
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:48,159
influence with the recipe it's more the

729
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:50,980
timing so obviously if you want to have

730
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:54,339
straight bacteria

731
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:57,550
in a tea it's it's going to be in the

732
00:39:54,340 --> 00:40:01,240
first probably 12 hours that you want to

733
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:03,910
use it however if you do have fungi in

734
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:07,479
there in your compost it's going to be

735
00:40:03,909 --> 00:40:10,420
growing at that time as well so yeah I i

736
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:16,150
I've never successfully managed to have

737
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:18,849
a compost teeny that was either fungal

738
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:23,680
with no bacteria or bacteria with no

739
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:26,259
fungal if they both exist in in the the

740
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:29,739
compost use they they pretty much grow

741
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:34,359
at the same rate at least in in what

742
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:37,239
I've done so so if if that's what you

743
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:40,420
want then you want to probably use it

744
00:40:37,239 --> 00:40:44,439
between 12 and 18 hours but it's it

745
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:50,079
after 24 hours is usually when the

746
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:51,880
protozoa reach their their peak or come

747
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:55,090
start multiplying I should say and reach

748
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,640
their peak at 36 hours and so if you

749
00:40:55,090 --> 00:41:00,700
want a nutrient cycling that's that's

750
00:40:57,639 --> 00:41:04,659
when you use it as far as methods of

751
00:41:00,699 --> 00:41:08,279
making compost tea we made everything we

752
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:12,750
made everything from you know one liter

753
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:18,130
Brewers up to 1,200 gallons we had

754
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:21,190
straight air stones we we had you know

755
00:41:18,130 --> 00:41:23,619
others that were copies of what other

756
00:41:21,190 --> 00:41:27,300
people had made with the air going down

757
00:41:23,619 --> 00:41:31,930
a cylinder that had the compost in it we

758
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:37,119
used Venturi's which are made with water

759
00:41:31,929 --> 00:41:40,179
pumps and air lifts and air lifts are

760
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:41,769
the most successful way of doing it

761
00:41:40,179 --> 00:41:44,799
first for sure

762
00:41:41,769 --> 00:41:46,420
as far as agitation and as far as

763
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,690
dissolved oxygen

764
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:54,010
you know there's mathematical papers

765
00:41:48,690 --> 00:41:57,358
that illustrate an airlift can up the

766
00:41:54,010 --> 00:42:00,430
the dissolved oxygen capacity tenfold

767
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:04,389
from from an air pump that's just

768
00:42:00,429 --> 00:42:06,399
blowing into air stones anyway

769
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:09,849
should I get sidetracked there and

770
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,930
forget what I was saying or what no I

771
00:42:09,849 --> 00:42:12,819
think that's I think that's interesting

772
00:42:10,929 --> 00:42:16,089
and I just want to I want to reiterate

773
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:18,250
that when Tim says that he's tried all

774
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,079
these Brewers you're also you've also

775
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:22,719
looked at them under a microscope and

776
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,119
you spent hours and hours in your

777
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,889
laboratory it's not a matter of you just

778
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:28,930
looking at a bucket of brown water and

779
00:42:26,889 --> 00:42:30,789
saying oh this looks good or throwing it

780
00:42:28,929 --> 00:42:33,419
on a plant you're actually spending time

781
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:38,829
looking on slide after slide and

782
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:44,980
examining all of these teas yeah we took

783
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:47,619
the pH and the TDS and everything every

784
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:50,710
single brew I've got several notebooks

785
00:42:47,619 --> 00:42:52,930
still full of all of the notes from

786
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,740
there and took the dissolved oxygen

787
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:59,409
readings of course and temperature the

788
00:42:56,739 --> 00:43:00,789
whole works I want to back up just a

789
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,710
little bit one thing you were talking

790
00:43:00,789 --> 00:43:05,199
about with this bacterial dominated or

791
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:06,460
fungally dominated teas i would just

792
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:08,618
want to make it clear when we talk about

793
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:11,800
a tea that's fungally dominated they're

794
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:13,570
still going to be a ton of bacteria it's

795
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,519
not like that like you mentioned briefly

796
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:17,769
but the bacteria is not going away and

797
00:43:15,519 --> 00:43:20,409
vice versa and it's really the brewing

798
00:43:17,769 --> 00:43:22,949
length that controls that more more than

799
00:43:20,409 --> 00:43:25,358
the recipe right absolutely

800
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:27,819
great so I just wanted to clarify that

801
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:30,579
and then let's talk a little bit about

802
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:33,580
what happens when you brew perpetually

803
00:43:30,579 --> 00:43:35,079
or you brew longer than 36 hours because

804
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,849
I know this is something that certain

805
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,519
companies in the industry are promoting

806
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:42,489
that you and I feel rather strongly

807
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:47,019
about already so let's talk about what

808
00:43:42,489 --> 00:43:51,849
happens on a microscopic level well if

809
00:43:47,019 --> 00:43:56,469
once you go beyond 48 hours is pretty

810
00:43:51,849 --> 00:43:59,799
much a maximum before the ciliates

811
00:43:56,469 --> 00:44:02,349
usually at cilia start taking over the

812
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:05,920
whole thing it sometimes it's the

813
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:09,599
flageolets but in my most of my

814
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,838
experience cilia start coming into play

815
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,319
ciliates

816
00:44:10,838 --> 00:44:16,509
are the larger protozoa that are

817
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:20,650
sometimes an indication

818
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:22,810
that there are some anaerobic bacteria

819
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:26,950
in the picture because that's their

820
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:31,179
favorite food like if you go up to 72

821
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:34,960
hours or even beyond that you just end

822
00:44:31,179 --> 00:44:37,629
up with a ciliate soup I've got some

823
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,220
video footage that you know I don't know

824
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,490
if I ever showed it to you but it would

825
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:45,730
it blows my mind it's just like the

826
00:44:42,489 --> 00:44:48,729
whole slide is just teeming teeming

827
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:52,210
ciliates it's just amazing if there's

828
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:55,449
someone who has perpetual breuer going

829
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:58,780
in in a store and then selling tea to

830
00:44:55,449 --> 00:45:03,639
customers I mean that's possible to do

831
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:07,150
but every 36 to 48 hours

832
00:45:03,639 --> 00:45:10,329
you really should reconstitute it and so

833
00:45:07,150 --> 00:45:14,230
that means put in some more compost and

834
00:45:10,329 --> 00:45:18,009
put in some more feedstock but what

835
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:22,210
happens is that once you do that you're

836
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:26,140
gonna have to wait for you know 24 hours

837
00:45:22,210 --> 00:45:28,329
for it to basically go through the whole

838
00:45:26,139 --> 00:45:31,719
cycle that it goes through to come back

839
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:34,719
to being a useful product again so if

840
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:37,959
you're if you're a perpetual Brewer and

841
00:45:34,719 --> 00:45:41,019
you're selling tea you know pity the

842
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,329
customer that comes in after you've just

843
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:46,750
added new stuff to your brew they're

844
00:45:43,329 --> 00:45:49,059
gonna get something that the dissolved

845
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:51,670
oxygen hasn't had a chance to build up

846
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:54,009
and the microorganisms haven't been

847
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:56,619
properly extracted or multiplied they're

848
00:45:54,010 --> 00:46:00,490
gonna get a totally different product

849
00:45:56,619 --> 00:46:01,210
from the customer who gets it at 36

850
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:03,789
hours

851
00:46:01,210 --> 00:46:06,340
so that's what's wrong with perpetual

852
00:46:03,789 --> 00:46:10,239
brewing if you're doing it for yourself

853
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:12,340
at home and keeping track and you have a

854
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,069
microscope or even you just want to

855
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:17,280
experiment you know go for it but if

856
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:22,780
you're selling it to somebody that's

857
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:25,390
that's just not very kosher you bring up

858
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:28,300
a good point though I found it was very

859
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:31,210
challenging to try and maintain good

860
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:33,310
Caribbean diversity and biomass even

861
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:36,639
when adding food stock and using a

862
00:46:33,309 --> 00:46:39,130
microscope beyond you know 48 hours so

863
00:46:36,639 --> 00:46:40,779
when we were doing those trade shows

864
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,550
together for example where we had the

865
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:45,010
microscope when we had a brew going and

866
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:47,740
we would pull samples and add food stock

867
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:49,750
and try and maintain the brew even with

868
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:52,359
a microscope and looking at the samples

869
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:54,099
every I don't know 15 20 minutes it was

870
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,750
still very challenging to maintain that

871
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:58,869
compost tea and I didn't really feel

872
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:01,110
like we did all that effectively yeah no

873
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:04,269
no it wasn't very good no you're right

874
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:07,690
yep so I totally agree with you that's

875
00:47:04,269 --> 00:47:09,699
why when we brew and at our farm we will

876
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:12,940
just tell customers compost tea is

877
00:47:09,699 --> 00:47:14,439
available on Saturdays and that's when

878
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,970
they can come in it'll be brewing

879
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,800
throughout that day they can get us they

880
00:47:15,969 --> 00:47:20,139
can get get something to take home and

881
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,820
then we'll shut it down discard whatever

882
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:23,139
we have and start over again for another

883
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:26,470
day sort of thing

884
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:28,329
yeah that's the way to do it so some

885
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,889
some Brewers are putting there they're

886
00:47:28,329 --> 00:47:32,259
saying they can put compost tea in the

887
00:47:29,889 --> 00:47:34,509
fridge have you have you heard of that

888
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:37,030
one there's a company oh yeah yeah

889
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:40,180
there's all kinds of stuff on YouTube

890
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:41,350
these days so I just want to say that

891
00:47:40,179 --> 00:47:43,059
that doesn't really work very well

892
00:47:41,349 --> 00:47:44,980
either I don't know what your if you've

893
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:47,590
experimented with refrigeration or any

894
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,349
of that sort of thing yourself yeah we

895
00:47:47,590 --> 00:47:52,539
we did put some in the fridge when we

896
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:56,489
were doing all of our experiments and

897
00:47:52,539 --> 00:48:01,059
stuff and it it wasn't worth a damn the

898
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:03,069
the microbes basically just die or go

899
00:48:01,059 --> 00:48:05,949
dormant and they don't come back again

900
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:09,519
unless you you know you might get them

901
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:12,219
back again if you add it into a compost

902
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:17,429
tea and brew it over again when we did

903
00:48:12,219 --> 00:48:21,159
have to store some tea we did it with

904
00:48:17,429 --> 00:48:23,859
removing removing the the compost

905
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:26,639
because we it was in a case where we had

906
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:31,300
it in a bag so we could remove it and

907
00:48:26,639 --> 00:48:33,489
and then aerate it and the longest I

908
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:36,730
kept it that way was over a period of

909
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:39,729
three days constantly aerating it and

910
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:41,210
even then it you know slowly degenerated

911
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:42,860
in what you say

912
00:48:41,210 --> 00:48:45,679
about putting it in the bottle you know

913
00:48:42,860 --> 00:48:50,269
that make reminds me about you know when

914
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:52,039
people send a sample to to get tested

915
00:48:50,269 --> 00:48:54,980
the whole thing is going to change

916
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:58,489
during the shipment so by the time it's

917
00:48:54,980 --> 00:49:02,630
tested if if you're trying to say well

918
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:05,029
this sample was taken at 12 or 36 or 40

919
00:49:02,630 --> 00:49:07,369
hours by the time it's looked at at the

920
00:49:05,030 --> 00:49:09,980
lab it's not gonna be that time anymore

921
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:13,009
it's gonna be 50 hours or however long

922
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:15,500
it took to get there and it will have

923
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:21,470
transformed I don't know if I should say

924
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:24,679
this but I had a client who was in a

925
00:49:21,469 --> 00:49:27,469
bind that he had a customer a big

926
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:31,339
customer for landscaping landscaping

927
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:33,709
deal who insisted that he would not

928
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:39,530
contract with him unless he had a good

929
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:41,869
test result from a lab so he asked me

930
00:49:39,530 --> 00:49:44,840
what what he should do and so I said

931
00:49:41,869 --> 00:49:48,230
well just brew for eight hours put it in

932
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:51,019
the bottle and ship it and by the time

933
00:49:48,230 --> 00:49:53,090
it gets there it'll be good and so

934
00:49:51,019 --> 00:49:55,909
that's what he did and it was perfect

935
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:59,780
and he got really great test results and

936
00:49:55,909 --> 00:50:01,969
got the contract yeah I think that is a

937
00:49:59,780 --> 00:50:03,650
challenging aspect with the whole idea

938
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:05,629
of testing and it's really expensive and

939
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,730
I like to point out to people who are

940
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:09,079
doing those types of tests that not only

941
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:11,869
does it have the challenges that you

942
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:14,900
just listed but you change one thing

943
00:50:11,869 --> 00:50:16,420
about your brew that snapshot really

944
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:19,280
doesn't allow us to make useful

945
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,349
decisions in the field in terms of how

946
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:24,019
to improve our compost teas in my

947
00:50:21,349 --> 00:50:27,289
opinion and that's why I think having a

948
00:50:24,019 --> 00:50:28,940
microscope is so useful if you if you

949
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:30,980
really want to get into that aspect of

950
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:33,470
growing one thing I do want to bring up

951
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:35,630
that you kind of hinted that there is I

952
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:37,339
don't want to discourage growers from

953
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,470
experimenting with compost teas and

954
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:42,470
trying them out on their plants and it's

955
00:50:39,469 --> 00:50:44,209
really hard it's really hard to truly

956
00:50:42,469 --> 00:50:46,099
screw up yeah

957
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:51,220
it's very difficult to make a bad

958
00:50:46,099 --> 00:50:54,650
compost gene yes I tried the adage of of

959
00:50:51,219 --> 00:50:56,750
having an anaerobic stinky tea and

960
00:50:54,650 --> 00:51:01,630
jumping it on a plant that I want to

961
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:04,699
kill and the plant actually loved it so

962
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:08,329
anyway one thing I wanted to bring up is

963
00:51:04,699 --> 00:51:11,809
is recipes that's something else I've

964
00:51:08,329 --> 00:51:15,230
sort of learned in my old age is that

965
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:18,079
I've seemed to get just as good results

966
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:20,900
from just using vermicompost with

967
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:24,319
molasses and you know I do have the

968
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,990
recipes that are on my webpage that a

969
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:29,360
lot of people just they say that's what

970
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:33,049
they use they stand by it it's great and

971
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:35,690
all that but you know all power to them

972
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:40,250
and and if they like it stick with it

973
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:42,559
but but for me I found that I stopped

974
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:46,849
including all of the things like rock

975
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:49,610
phosphate and kelp meal and and fish

976
00:51:46,849 --> 00:51:53,179
hydrolysate and just stuck with the

977
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:56,570
molasses and and vermicompost and got

978
00:51:53,179 --> 00:52:00,079
exactly the same microbial population

979
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:01,460
growing in in there so sure yeah we use

980
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:04,309
a product that we call our microbe

981
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,510
catalyst with ours as a food source not

982
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:08,110
because there's anything wrong with

983
00:52:05,510 --> 00:52:11,300
molasses but just because it's a dried

984
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:13,579
granule and molasses is hard for us to

985
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:16,400
package and ship but when I owe a lot of

986
00:52:13,579 --> 00:52:20,750
my microscope testing I actually used

987
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,030
molasses and you showed me that and I I

988
00:52:20,750 --> 00:52:25,880
will say I do really like to use organic

989
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:28,700
alfalfa meal in addition to molasses and

990
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:31,160
vermicompost as part of your recipe when

991
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:32,779
I use your recipe but just the molasses

992
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:37,809
in vermicompost works really really well

993
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:40,970
- yeah well molasses has got a bad rap

994
00:52:37,809 --> 00:52:44,000
somehow well I I think it all started

995
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:46,279
with some testing that was done in two

996
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:49,760
different labs one was a USDA lab

997
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:54,880
another was Canadian agricultural lab

998
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:59,150
and they they were you know trying to

999
00:52:54,880 --> 00:53:04,280
show that ecoli would grow in aerated

1000
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:07,760
compost tea and they I can't remember

1001
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,500
exactly but I think both of them had

1002
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:13,700
some sort of setup where they were using

1003
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:17,389
jars with air stones which is okay you

1004
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:23,179
know just for experimental purposes but

1005
00:53:17,389 --> 00:53:28,369
they they also in inoculated both both

1006
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:34,039
labs inoculated with e.coli and so if

1007
00:53:28,369 --> 00:53:38,839
you put a coli into an aerated liquid

1008
00:53:34,039 --> 00:53:43,489
water and and give it food like molasses

1009
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:47,660
of course it's gonna grow you know 13 um

1010
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:50,599
any any kind of bacteria is is going to

1011
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:54,519
grow so that that's what I thought was

1012
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:57,799
very flawed with it and and it actually

1013
00:53:54,519 --> 00:54:01,969
you know within the in people's minds

1014
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:06,560
became so serious that I I think it was

1015
00:54:01,969 --> 00:54:12,259
uh what what's the organic branch of the

1016
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:15,409
USDA called the NOP yeah when they had

1017
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:19,130
the compost tea councils part of that

1018
00:54:15,409 --> 00:54:22,149
and and they because of those lab

1019
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:26,090
results they said you shouldn't use

1020
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:29,510
molasses in in compost tea out of all

1021
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:32,660
this fear-mongering about ecoli growing

1022
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:35,630
and so it just that a lot of people are

1023
00:54:32,659 --> 00:54:38,869
saying never use it because of that and

1024
00:54:35,630 --> 00:54:43,670
it's just uh in my mind just a kind of a

1025
00:54:38,869 --> 00:54:47,690
silly knee-jerk reaction and and as you

1026
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:51,320
know you know it it it feeds fungi just

1027
00:54:47,690 --> 00:54:55,460
as well as it does bacteria so it's it's

1028
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:57,080
a very useful food stock to use yeah I

1029
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,150
would say that's one of the the myths

1030
00:54:57,079 --> 00:55:01,340
that you sort of help dispel or

1031
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:03,440
challenge over the last decade

1032
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:05,809
another one is foaming I know when I

1033
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,700
first got in the industry everyone was

1034
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:09,590
talking about how you need to have a

1035
00:55:07,699 --> 00:55:11,989
good head of foam on your compost tea

1036
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:13,400
like it was a beer or something you were

1037
00:55:11,989 --> 00:55:14,779
able to show from looking under the

1038
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,750
microscope that that really wasn't the

1039
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:22,790
case yeah well both things are still

1040
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:26,539
rapidly running going by rumor

1041
00:55:22,789 --> 00:55:28,579
everywhere and it can't Lee I have to

1042
00:55:26,539 --> 00:55:31,159
keep repeating that but it doesn't

1043
00:55:28,579 --> 00:55:32,420
necessarily mean anything but I don't

1044
00:55:31,159 --> 00:55:34,279
want to keep you for too much longer

1045
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:35,900
here Tim really appreciate you taking

1046
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:39,140
the time today and maybe we can do a

1047
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:40,910
follow-up interview to kind of hash out

1048
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:45,829
some more of these topics here in the

1049
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:49,670
future thanks Tim don't forget to check

1050
00:55:45,829 --> 00:55:52,250
out Tim's website WWE COO of organics

1051
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:55,010
com more information microscope videos

1052
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,659
and images he is the inventor of the 50

1053
00:55:55,010 --> 00:55:58,550
gallon microbe you later and the 5

1054
00:55:56,659 --> 00:56:00,949
gallon mini microbe you later both

1055
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:03,200
currently available on our website he

1056
00:56:00,949 --> 00:56:05,029
also has a microbe identification DVD

1057
00:56:03,199 --> 00:56:06,759
that helps farmers and identifying

1058
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:09,530
various microbes under the microscope

1059
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:11,810
available on his website for only $40

1060
00:56:09,530 --> 00:56:13,550
this DVD was very helpful to me because

1061
00:56:11,809 --> 00:56:15,590
the microbes don't hold still on the

1062
00:56:13,550 --> 00:56:18,019
slide so it is much more useful to see

1063
00:56:15,590 --> 00:56:19,519
video than still images you can also
