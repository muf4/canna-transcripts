welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

4
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:24,419
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,160
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,840
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,118
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,439
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,659
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,000
knowledge my guest this week is Brandon

11
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:38,339
Hudson Brandon is a second generation

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,200
cannabis cultivator with over 35 years

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,100
of direct experience with this amazing

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,960
plant

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,939
building on fundamentals learned as a

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,200
child Brandon has applied a controlled

17
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:47,939
approach to cannabis cultivation

18
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,820
starting with his first glance his

19
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:52,199
freshman year of college in 1986. he

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,700
currently works for kiss Organics

21
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,320
providing Growers with everything from

22
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:57,960
customer support to assistance with

23
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,238
nutrients and soil tests a well-rounded

24
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,640
and passionate organic grower Brandon's

25
00:01:00,238 --> 00:01:04,259
real passions in soil chemistry most

26
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,118
recently Brandon was the director of

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,920
cultivation in one of four founding

28
00:01:06,118 --> 00:01:10,859
members of a minority-owned hemp flower

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,478
farm in South Carolina he provided Sops

30
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:14,760
and oversight for all aspects of

31
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:17,519
cultivation from propagation to harvest

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:19,439
and cure including daily operation of a

33
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:21,658
large Nursery facility

34
00:01:19,438 --> 00:01:23,639
in this role Brandon also performed

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,400
several federally funded hemp trials for

36
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,159
hbcus as well as research projects for

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,359
nutrient producers he is a proud dad and

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:32,100
husband who spends his free time

39
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:34,140
outdoors with his veggie gardens and

40
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:35,519
chickens this week's show is a bit

41
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,200
different as we get a lot of the same

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:38,879
questions at kiss Organics and thought

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,859
it would be fun to do a show covering a

44
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:43,158
lot of the most common ones now on to

45
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:43,159
the show

46
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,380
hey Brandon thanks for coming on the

47
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:49,259
show

48
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:51,118
hey Ted great to be here

49
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:53,459
yeah I mean I know we talk all the time

50
00:01:51,118 --> 00:01:55,739
but I want to do this show kind of

51
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:57,780
talking about all the questions that you

52
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:59,699
get asked on a daily basis You Know

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,739
cover helping out with the phones and

54
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:03,659
doing a lot of the Agronomy and solo

55
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:05,699
analysis

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:08,700
um let's just start off right off the

57
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,679
bat talking about soil health

58
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:13,439
you get asked a lot about how to reuse

59
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:15,539
the soil kind of take me through sort of

60
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:18,300
what that process looks like with kiss

61
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:20,639
yeah so it really you know it's like

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,379
anything you you want a little bit of

63
00:02:20,639 --> 00:02:24,779
background on their cultivation practice

64
00:02:22,378 --> 00:02:26,459
are they in beds are they in pots that

65
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,800
sort of thing but after we get

66
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,979
information about you know how their

67
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,680
growth setup is

68
00:02:31,979 --> 00:02:36,479
um it's all kind of similar uh or the

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,480
same across the board and so whether

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:42,598
they're in pots or in large Beds which

71
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:44,518
we prefer for various reasons

72
00:02:42,598 --> 00:02:47,219
um at the when they're approaching the

73
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,379
end of around three weeks two weeks it

74
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:51,598
really depends on how organized they are

75
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,579
and how quickly they can you know get

76
00:02:51,598 --> 00:02:56,280
things turned around do they have the

77
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,260
usual suspect list of amendments that

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,419
they'll most likely need on hand that

79
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:02,639
way they're not waiting to you know get

80
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:05,159
their test results and then order

81
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:08,399
amendments they can usually you know

82
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,199
about two weeks out take a soil sample

83
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,080
if they're in beds they could take a

84
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:15,658
couple of samples from each bed mix

85
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,519
those together homogeneously send off

86
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:20,759
two cups to Logan Labs if they're in

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,519
pots they can either dump all that soil

88
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:25,620
mix it together thoroughly which is kind

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,500
of my preference but that's a lot of

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,360
Labor to get that back into pots or they

91
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:34,139
can take samples from you know

92
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:36,780
representative pots mix that again again

93
00:03:34,139 --> 00:03:38,458
send that off to Logan labs and get

94
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,640
their soil reports back

95
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,039
and so now we're armed to do the mineral

96
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:46,559
nutrition side of their soil so we'll

97
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:50,519
get that soil report back and we'll send

98
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,378
them a detailed recommendation of what

99
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,480
what amendments they need to get in and

100
00:03:52,378 --> 00:03:56,699
that's that's pretty much it as far as

101
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,738
the the mineral side of it it's very

102
00:03:56,699 --> 00:04:00,119
straightforward you know we're doing it

103
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:02,340
you know and you and I talked about this

104
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,319
the other day how incredible it is that

105
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,080
we can use metrics we don't have to

106
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:08,219
guess and so um I'm a big fan of the

107
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,540
soil reports and getting those

108
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:16,620
amendments in and then you've got the uh

109
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:18,539
biological side of the soil and then

110
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,579
you've got the physical components of

111
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:22,620
the soil that you need to deal with

112
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,600
physical components you know we're

113
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:27,418
mostly worried about compaction

114
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,400
over over time after a couple of rounds

115
00:04:27,418 --> 00:04:32,339
we've got the organic matter breaking

116
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,620
down and we're starting to compact a

117
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:36,779
little bit and so every couple of rounds

118
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,899
for me it comes down to every four

119
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,359
rounds but everybody's different and so

120
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:45,779
I'll I'll add you know maybe six to

121
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,000
eight percent aggregate back into my

122
00:04:45,779 --> 00:04:50,758
soil I prefer pumice

123
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,000
um you know I just escaped the the east

124
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,819
coast and the swamp and um I can say on

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,740
the East Coast it's almost impossible

126
00:04:56,819 --> 00:05:01,680
unless you're ordering from the west

127
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,079
coast to get hummus and so a lot of

128
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,759
folks I recommend lava rock

129
00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:06,359
um even hydrogen

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,660
um

131
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:11,340
hydrotton however you say it um but you

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,259
want to get some aggregate back in there

133
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:15,659
and perlite is not

134
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,180
a good choice perlite

135
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,919
um I used it for years

136
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,478
um I just I don't like it it's

137
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:23,159
eventually going to all float to the top

138
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:24,839
and end up in the floor and you're just

139
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,460
going to lose all of your aggregate so

140
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:27,179
it's just not a really good choice for

141
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:28,739
you

142
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,780
and then you've got to deal with the

143
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,120
biological side and that's all about

144
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:35,279
quality compost

145
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,319
um that's that's you know when people

146
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,179
are making their own soil you know East

147
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:41,159
Coast folks that can't afford shipping

148
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:43,500
who you know want to get a nutrient pack

149
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,580
from Kiss to get balanced new mineral

150
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,860
nutrients

151
00:05:44,579 --> 00:05:50,819
their their Achilles heel is always

152
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,800
trying to find good compost and when you

153
00:05:50,819 --> 00:05:55,079
get a compost not all composts are

154
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,720
created equally there's a short little

155
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:59,819
checklist you want to know the pH of

156
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:02,580
that compost just to make sure it's not

157
00:05:59,819 --> 00:06:06,120
way out of range the carbon to nitrogen

158
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:08,519
ratio obviously if it's above 18 to 1 I

159
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:10,978
would I would find a different compost

160
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:14,038
you know the the carbon to nitrogen

161
00:06:10,978 --> 00:06:16,800
ratio heavy metals those are the real

162
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,959
blockers

163
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,939
you know I want to look at sodium I want

164
00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:24,120
to look at the cations as well but once

165
00:06:20,939 --> 00:06:26,519
they have a suitable uh uh compost every

166
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,840
couple of rounds you can add that or

167
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:30,959
alternatively you can be getting your

168
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,339
biology through teas so

169
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:34,439
that you know there's there's some

170
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:35,879
options to do that but every couple of

171
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:39,199
rounds I do like to get some more

172
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:39,199
compost back in there

173
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,840
okay so just to highlight a few things

174
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:44,339
and add a little bit

175
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:46,560
um there's three big things that we're

176
00:06:44,339 --> 00:06:47,818
looking at when we're reinvending soil

177
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,360
we want to look at the physical

178
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,180
properties of the soil which is

179
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:56,220
gas exchange aeration

180
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:57,600
moisture retention you know if you're if

181
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:59,460
you're buying potting soil that should

182
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,720
already be optimized or close enough to

183
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:03,180
optimize and that's just a matter of

184
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,520
maintaining it every cycle

185
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,500
um you mentioned the biological

186
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:09,060
properties of the soil you know if

187
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:10,439
you're on the west coast I'm going to

188
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:12,660
give a shout out to the New England

189
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:13,978
compost I've seen samples of it and

190
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,139
talked to them over there I think they

191
00:07:13,978 --> 00:07:17,699
have a really nice product so if you're

192
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,800
out there you know checking check in

193
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:21,180
with those guys

194
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,418
um and if you don't want to bring in

195
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,660
compost to add organic matter because of

196
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:29,339
the risk of fungus gnats or other pests

197
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,199
things like that you could look into

198
00:07:29,339 --> 00:07:33,418
making a compost tea or a compost

199
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,460
extract as a way of getting beneficial

200
00:07:33,418 --> 00:07:38,719
microbes back into the soil or you could

201
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:41,219
use a specific microbial inoculant

202
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,500
you have some options there

203
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:44,400
and then when we talk about the mineral

204
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,319
side

205
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:51,000
which is where we really like to

206
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,979
emphasize and target for reament

207
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,300
um two to three weeks out you said two

208
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:57,360
weeks that might be kind of a little

209
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,918
close with a few uh a few facilities in

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,780
turn if they're further away and they

211
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:02,399
need to get amendment to order after

212
00:08:00,779 --> 00:08:03,598
seeing analysis

213
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,918
but if you they already have all the

214
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,959
Amendments on hand and you know they're

215
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:08,879
doing this all internally then two weeks

216
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:09,959
worth great it's just really important a

217
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,279
couple of things I want to point out

218
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,680
with this is it's important to always

219
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:16,619
take the samples the same way and take

220
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:18,000
them correctly you can do one sample for

221
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:19,918
an entire room if you're treating the

222
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,019
room homogeneously and then if you have

223
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,339
any outlier beds that are performing

224
00:08:22,019 --> 00:08:25,378
differently for some reason you could

225
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:27,359
always sample those separately but you

226
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:30,060
don't need to sample every bed I'm

227
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:32,519
Bryant's Mason Soul doctor and I've had

228
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:34,139
multiple conversations about this and uh

229
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:36,059
the tests always come back close enough

230
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,338
so it saves a lot of money you know

231
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,158
being able to test per room or per area

232
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,320
versus every bed

233
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:46,200
um and then the last thing around the

234
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,480
testing uh just to mention the folks we

235
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,160
we did partner with Logan labs and now

236
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,019
we are offering the testing directly

237
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:53,939
through kiss for those of you that work

238
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:58,440
with us and

239
00:08:53,940 --> 00:09:01,080
we do an analysis for 35 of the complete

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,459
soil test and then if you buy the

241
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,459
Amendments that we recommend through us

242
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:07,799
you get a credit towards

243
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:09,479
uh towards those amendments so

244
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,639
essentially making the consult portion

245
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,920
free so that is an option for folks that

246
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,778
do use us but anyway I don't want to

247
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,299
focus too much on kiss I want to keep

248
00:09:15,778 --> 00:09:21,360
this podcast uh you know as educational

249
00:09:18,299 --> 00:09:25,699
and non sales pitchy as possible Right

250
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,700
brand agnostics I want to share that

251
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:30,540
no I was just going to say one other

252
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,339
thing about soil that that gets left out

253
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:36,480
once you look at the mineral physical

254
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:39,000
and biological is the IPM side and so

255
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,339
it's it is really important to keep that

256
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,919
soil healthy you know we talk about

257
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:45,720
folks that have to flush uh between

258
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:48,419
rounds because their sodium is too high

259
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,860
you know it's really important

260
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:51,479
um once you've removed those plants

261
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,500
which is a portion of the immune system

262
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,980
of the of the soil to get something

263
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,360
aggressive whether that's trichoderma or

264
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:02,278
lactobacillus but some productive

265
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,320
biology in there because you know like

266
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:06,059
we you know I'm always saying that we've

267
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,100
probably got pythium on our faces when

268
00:10:06,059 --> 00:10:10,679
we're talking you you're not going to be

269
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:12,240
able to exclude that but there are some

270
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,819
things that you can add into your soil

271
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,399
to out-compete it and then there's the

272
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:20,600
the insect side of things where you

273
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,778
could be putting Bavaria and beneficial

274
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:29,120
insects like SF nematodes or you know

275
00:10:24,778 --> 00:10:31,860
other insects into prevent fungus gnats

276
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,379
whatever pest pressures you have and so

277
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,419
that's that's one last piece of that

278
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:40,039
puzzle that I like to just at least

279
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:40,039
start the conversation with folks

280
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,640
okay well since he brought up Flushing

281
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,440
uh the couple things I want to mention

282
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:49,159
around that so we typically don't

283
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:54,060
recommend flushing in organic soils

284
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:56,100
unless you have an excess of nitrates or

285
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:56,699
mineral nutrition in general

286
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,079
um

287
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:04,259
or if the you know prior to harvest now

288
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:07,679
after harvest if you have excessive

289
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:10,919
levels of nitrates potassium or more

290
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:12,899
specifically sodium which we do see when

291
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,539
you don't have any runoff potentially

292
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:16,440
build up over time it's not an essential

293
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:18,719
plant

294
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,640
plant mineral and it can cause issues

295
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,620
and raise your overall soluble salt

296
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,120
level

297
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,919
people say flush but then they have

298
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,179
questions about how do I do that can you

299
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:29,360
take us through what the flushing

300
00:11:27,179 --> 00:11:32,219
process would look like to reduce sodium

301
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:33,899
yeah yeah that's that's one that we just

302
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:36,720
see repeatedly with this style of

303
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,019
growing sodium's highly mobile but with

304
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:42,240
no runoff there's no place for it to go

305
00:11:39,019 --> 00:11:44,820
so what we need to do is if your sodium

306
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:49,079
is creeping up you know anytime I see

307
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,820
somebody hit a hundred ppms uh I start

308
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,399
talking to them about you know let's

309
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,879
let's plan for a flush but I've seen

310
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:59,759
some pretty scary numbers 344 parts per

311
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,399
million stuff like that and so like you

312
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:05,759
mentioned the the overall soluble salts

313
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:08,940
and related osmotic stress is going to

314
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,120
go up exponentially and then sodium is

315
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,740
going to block your productive cations

316
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,440
specifically potassium and it can

317
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,379
actually replace potassium in the plant

318
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,700
plant which is not good so we want to

319
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:23,159
flush that

320
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,959
the easiest way to do that first and

321
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:27,838
foremost is to make sure that your water

322
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:30,419
is not bringing in extra sodium so if

323
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
sodium if the contamination is coming

324
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:34,259
from your water obviously you need to

325
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,439
solve that before you do a flush because

326
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:39,720
pumping more sodium Laden water into the

327
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,540
beds not going to fix the problem

328
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:44,579
but if you have clean water

329
00:12:42,539 --> 00:12:47,578
low sodium you want to flush

330
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:50,638
approximately 10 percent by volume you

331
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:53,458
know so a 4x4 is typically you know with

332
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,820
a 12 inch side 10 inches of soil is is

333
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:59,338
almost dead on 100 gallons of soil and

334
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:02,820
so if you flush that 10 you want to get

335
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:05,700
10 gallons of runoff and most facilities

336
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:08,579
are not set up with this in mind and so

337
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,220
you know if you don't have

338
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:13,979
a way to capture your runoff if you

339
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,200
don't have a valve you can open on the

340
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,180
in on the bottom of your bed or

341
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,040
something like that you'll have to get a

342
00:13:18,179 --> 00:13:21,659
little more creative I've got you know

343
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,278
some Growers who will catch it in a five

344
00:13:21,659 --> 00:13:24,778
gallon bucket and when they've got two

345
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:26,879
of those full they know they've got 10

346
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,220
gallons out and so you know we're

347
00:13:26,879 --> 00:13:31,139
Growers we're resourceful and we'll

348
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:35,600
figure out a way to do it but you need

349
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:38,399
to get 10 runoff through that bed to

350
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,860
essentially cut that sodium or that

351
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,839
nitrate in half and that's typically

352
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:47,759
what we're shooting for

353
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:49,920
um you can bring in an EC meter and you

354
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:52,919
know take your EC right when runoff

355
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:54,659
starts and it'll typically be very high

356
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:57,179
and then you could continue to flush

357
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,519
until that EC is cut in half and that

358
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,699
will give you a more dialed in approach

359
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:05,278
to it but we have really good success

360
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:08,339
with just the 10 so that's normally what

361
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:11,360
I do and then the last little bit I try

362
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,459
to that's where I'll add

363
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,839
trichoderma or lactobacillus just to

364
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,399
make sure that I'm getting a really nice

365
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,540
biology

366
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:24,000
prophylactic approach to keeping that

367
00:14:21,539 --> 00:14:26,399
that soil safe

368
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,200
yeah we don't like to do this type of

369
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,659
heavy flushing when there's a plant in

370
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,278
the bed this would be after harvest and

371
00:14:30,659 --> 00:14:33,419
just to get people some numbers so if

372
00:14:32,278 --> 00:14:35,100
you have a yard of soil it's

373
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:37,319
approximately 200 gallons you're putting

374
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,600
20 gallons of water through it coming

375
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,699
out the bottom

376
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,040
um right right okay so it might take

377
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:46,319
more than it might take 30 or 40 gallons

378
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:47,879
it just really depends on how dry their

379
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,660
soil is

380
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:54,059
um you know so the the runoff Target you

381
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:55,919
want to collect that 10 and so if you

382
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:59,759
can you know so

383
00:14:55,919 --> 00:15:03,059
it might take more water than you know

384
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:05,698
10 gallons in a 4x4 it might take 15 or

385
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:08,958
20 to get get 10 gallons to flow out of

386
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,958
it but that's what their target is

387
00:15:09,139 --> 00:15:14,220
great Yeah you mentioned uh Bavaria

388
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:16,680
changing topics here we're going to

389
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:20,278
bounce around a lot this podcast

390
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:21,838
um and I wanted to talk about some

391
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:25,379
things that we learned about Bavaria

392
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,139
last week in a meeting with uh one of

393
00:15:25,379 --> 00:15:29,399
the large major producers of it in North

394
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:31,740
America

395
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:33,360
and I want to just share a little bit

396
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,919
that but I do hope to do a whole podcast

397
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,620
this number very because I think it's

398
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:39,179
really fascinating but some of the

399
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,278
highlights from that meeting that I

400
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,659
would share was that every species is

401
00:15:41,278 --> 00:15:45,179
different and will have slightly

402
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:47,639
different results within that Target

403
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:51,479
class of pests that Bavaria works on so

404
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:53,698
uh you know the particular uh hearing of

405
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,500
Bavaria that

406
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:56,879
you know is sold through bioworks is

407
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:59,940
going to have different results than the

408
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:02,278
one from certis and you know on and on

409
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,380
down the line so uh that's not to say

410
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:06,120
that one is better than the other but

411
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:08,159
that they're just going to have slightly

412
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,480
different results across the species

413
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:12,299
that Bavaria works with because they're

414
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,339
all different strains and they were uh

415
00:16:12,299 --> 00:16:16,799
all captured naturally from different

416
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:18,180
areas around the world

417
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,159
um which also means that they'll have

418
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:22,198
different storage conditions so some may

419
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:25,679
store in the fridge for

420
00:16:22,198 --> 00:16:28,259
six months and not have any any Spore

421
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,939
loss whereas others uh won't have that

422
00:16:28,259 --> 00:16:32,159
same storage life which I thought was

423
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:33,839
really interesting

424
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,399
um I have a couple other things but did

425
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,120
you want to add anything

426
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:41,759
about Bavaria yeah Bavaria is one of my

427
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:44,820
you know one of my favorites I like

428
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:47,039
Horticultural oils I like Bulgaria

429
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,440
um I thought the conversation was really

430
00:16:47,039 --> 00:16:52,500
interesting just the whole concept of

431
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,100
these biology biological

432
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:58,759
um helpers have been evolving for

433
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:02,399
Millennia along with

434
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:04,078
their their targets and so if you get a

435
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,720
like you know if you get a Bavaria

436
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,519
strain from Chile or one from Northern

437
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,318
California they're going to have

438
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:12,539
different efficacies on different

439
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:17,119
insects because they've evolved with

440
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:20,338
different insects and then just the the

441
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:24,298
complexity of like you just mentioned uh

442
00:17:20,338 --> 00:17:26,279
storage you know what temperatures

443
00:17:24,298 --> 00:17:28,019
um there's a different PH range that you

444
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:31,019
want to apply

445
00:17:28,019 --> 00:17:35,160
um there's the timing as well so like

446
00:17:31,019 --> 00:17:36,000
with any IPM product for insects

447
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,640
um

448
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,339
the timing is is really important you

449
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,640
want to get that all you know usually

450
00:17:41,339 --> 00:17:46,740
when it's an early molting you know

451
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,080
stage where you can you can have better

452
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,259
efficacy against the insects but it's

453
00:17:49,079 --> 00:17:54,178
just really important to make sure that

454
00:17:52,259 --> 00:17:56,099
you're you know in the fly fishing terms

455
00:17:54,179 --> 00:17:57,120
match the hatch you want to make sure

456
00:17:56,099 --> 00:17:59,099
that

457
00:17:57,119 --> 00:18:02,699
you've got the right strain for the

458
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:04,558
right target insect and that you are

459
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,980
taking all the environmental factors

460
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:10,139
into into account you know temperature

461
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,640
uh pH those sort of things the same way

462
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,980
you would want to do that if you're

463
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:15,240
deciding between cucumbers or swarsky

464
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:17,460
you know you want to look at the

465
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,620
environment in your greenhouse and so I

466
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,019
was just I was really Blown Away by how

467
00:18:19,619 --> 00:18:24,538
complex these bavarious strains are and

468
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,700
how specific they are

469
00:18:24,538 --> 00:18:30,119
um and then I really thought that the

470
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,779
you know because we're trying to lend it

471
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:35,038
um

472
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:37,798
how wet the plant gets even in veg the

473
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:39,480
conversation about cold fogging Bavaria

474
00:18:37,798 --> 00:18:41,400
was really intriguing to me because I

475
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,558
that's never occurred to me and that's

476
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,720
that's something that for a propagation

477
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:48,538
room or a veg room

478
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:51,660
would really free up a lot of Labor and

479
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:54,538
get you the coverage you need

480
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:56,279
yeah one other thing that I'll have

481
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:58,379
another interview later today with

482
00:18:56,279 --> 00:19:00,839
Michael brownbridge at biorex talking

483
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,760
about isopathologist and he's going to

484
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,819
talk a lot more about Bavaria and these

485
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:07,679
microbes in general but um one of the

486
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:09,200
things that he's discovered through

487
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,759
testing that I hope to get him to

488
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,860
elaborate on is that some of these

489
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:15,839
Brands and I'm not talking about

490
00:19:13,859 --> 00:19:17,879
you know these the major brands like

491
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,259
bios but some of the people even in the

492
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:23,100
living soil game that are selling

493
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:25,379
Bavaria have levels Spore counts so low

494
00:19:23,099 --> 00:19:27,178
in their product that you can't even get

495
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:30,059
any sort of efficacy with them it's not

496
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,000
it's just not possible for that to have

497
00:19:30,058 --> 00:19:35,519
any any actual effect on an insect

498
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,079
because of the Spore count so you may be

499
00:19:35,519 --> 00:19:38,940
wasting your money as a grower if you're

500
00:19:37,079 --> 00:19:40,798
buying some of these products and this

501
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,120
is not unique to the living soil game

502
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:43,740
there's a lot of there's a lot of

503
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,019
companies out there in the AG world too

504
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:47,460
that just have poor quality product in

505
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,259
that regard so don't assume that all

506
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:51,600
Bavarian is going to perform the same or

507
00:19:49,259 --> 00:19:54,240
is of the same quality and then the

508
00:19:51,599 --> 00:19:56,459
other thing is that other product labels

509
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,660
have actually had claims of sport counts

510
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,000
so high that it would not be

511
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:02,580
physiologically possible to fit that

512
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,380
many spores into that given volume so

513
00:20:02,579 --> 00:20:06,779
their labels are just completely

514
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:07,620
inaccurate too so

515
00:20:06,779 --> 00:20:09,839
um

516
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:11,939
it's an interesting topic when we start

517
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,159
thinking about marketing and how it

518
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:17,460
comes into play and what people are are

519
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:19,679
claiming around Bavaria so you just I

520
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:22,380
guess Barbie wear when it comes to that

521
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,298
sort of thing yeah exactly buyer beware

522
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,039
it's the same thing with mycorrhizae

523
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:29,339
where you you'll see a product that

524
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:31,679
lists you know an endo uh form of

525
00:20:29,339 --> 00:20:32,879
mycorrhizae but the Spore count is so

526
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,519
low that

527
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,980
you know it's it's a marketing blurb but

528
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,900
it's there's no efficacy at all so you

529
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:43,279
definitely want to do your research and

530
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:43,280
and use trusted products

531
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,679
yeah since you brought it up one of the

532
00:20:45,359 --> 00:20:48,538
questions that we get is you know is

533
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:51,900
there mycorrhizal fungus in your soil

534
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:54,720
and uh the reason we don't add it to our

535
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:56,460
soil mix is because uh it would strictly

536
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,620
be a way of just getting it on the label

537
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:00,900
it wouldn't actually have any sort of

538
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:02,579
efficacy because it's impossible to get

539
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,320
a high enough Spore count to make any

540
00:21:02,579 --> 00:21:06,418
difference when adding it to your media

541
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,639
uh you really need to add it

542
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:10,020
specifically to the root Zone write a

543
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
transplant time

544
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:13,679
um if you're going to use it at all

545
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,720
stuff that that's a good point so when

546
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:17,100
you see it read the label and then

547
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,480
realize that the label might not be

548
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:22,399
accurate

549
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:25,079
um because of storage conditions uh

550
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,140
inaccurate product management and a

551
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:30,000
variety of other reasons

552
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:31,140
these microbes get tricky

553
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,419
um

554
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,659
moving on though

555
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,179
since we are talking about microbes uh

556
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:40,799
let's talk a little bit about

557
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:43,080
aspergillus because we've had a few

558
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:45,619
people bring that up uh bring it to our

559
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:48,240
attention uh what can you tell me about

560
00:21:45,619 --> 00:21:50,099
aspergillus uh we've had a we've talked

561
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,519
to a few people who have failed for it

562
00:21:50,099 --> 00:21:54,599
in their growth how do we manage it most

563
00:21:53,519 --> 00:21:57,839
effectively

564
00:21:54,599 --> 00:21:59,759
yeah so in this will dovetail into a

565
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:01,259
another conversation about root ball

566
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:04,319
removal

567
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:06,839
um and why we like like that but um we

568
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:09,480
can we can come back to that in a second

569
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,359
um fungal pathogens aspergillus

570
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:14,400
specifically there's a lot of things it

571
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,538
starts with cultural controls you know

572
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,240
all of your

573
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:19,679
pathogen control starts with cultural

574
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,240
controls and so you want to make sure

575
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,298
that you're moving around your facility

576
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:26,400
always from the head house Downstream

577
00:22:24,298 --> 00:22:28,440
you don't ever want to reverse that and

578
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:31,559
go from a flower room back into your

579
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:35,340
your veg or your mother room

580
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:37,619
um it's it's a really good idea to wear

581
00:22:35,339 --> 00:22:40,558
some sort of protective clothing whether

582
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:42,359
that's scrubs or a Tyvek suit or you

583
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:43,798
know something like that just you know

584
00:22:42,359 --> 00:22:46,678
most of the folks that work and grow

585
00:22:43,798 --> 00:22:48,418
facilities have a plan or two at home

586
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:50,759
you know they're they're passionate

587
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,640
about it most of them and so you don't

588
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:56,279
want whatever might be going on there to

589
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:59,280
come to your facility and so if you

590
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:01,440
sealed them into uh into some scrubs or

591
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:03,119
something hopefully that doesn't get

592
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,759
loose in your facility so that's just

593
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,859
one more layer of protection I really

594
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:10,859
like bleach mats

595
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:13,199
um when when you took me to Gold Leaf I

596
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:16,038
I was really happy to see that they had

597
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:18,840
bleach mats at every every door

598
00:23:16,038 --> 00:23:22,379
I really like the idea of having a spray

599
00:23:18,839 --> 00:23:24,359
bottle with 90 rubbing alcohol in every

600
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,520
room so that you know as you enter you

601
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:30,000
can spray your yourself down from the

602
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:32,339
forearms and hands uh the other option

603
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,259
is to use nitrile gloves but I don't

604
00:23:32,339 --> 00:23:35,939
like to use all that plastic if I don't

605
00:23:34,259 --> 00:23:38,819
have to

606
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:40,019
um and then keeping your tools clean you

607
00:23:38,819 --> 00:23:41,879
know make sure that you're you know

608
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:44,460
you've got at least two pairs of shears

609
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,919
per person so that they can rotate those

610
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,620
out into a bleach solution or something

611
00:23:46,919 --> 00:23:51,900
between plants and then it's going to

612
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:55,259
come down to labor constraints you know

613
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:57,900
you don't want to stop your workers

614
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:59,339
every 30 seconds so they'll they'll

615
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:01,679
always be some potential

616
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:04,379
cross-contamination

617
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,519
but then the other thing is really

618
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:12,120
controlling your environmental controls

619
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:14,519
aspergillus likes a hot humid room it it

620
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,339
really likes to have

621
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:19,139
um

622
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:22,918
microclimates you know little uh hot

623
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,020
moist areas and so defoliation and good

624
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:27,120
fan air movement throughout the room is

625
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,279
really good and then that's that's a

626
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:32,459
weird Catch-22 because if you look at

627
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,500
powdery mildew it needs moist high

628
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,179
humidity

629
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:42,058
to spread but it also needs dry air

630
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:43,740
to sporulate in the first place and so

631
00:24:42,058 --> 00:24:45,480
you're kind of damned if you do damned

632
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:49,019
if you don't you know you want high air

633
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:52,200
movement to prevent pm and to prevent

634
00:24:49,019 --> 00:24:54,480
aspergillus but if you've got fusarium

635
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,620
you don't want a lot of cfus moving

636
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
through that room because it's just

637
00:24:55,619 --> 00:25:01,079
going to destroy the whole room and so

638
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,720
again like we were saying with

639
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:05,480
um insects or anything you really have

640
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,880
to get a definitive

641
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:11,519
ID on what you're dealing with and so

642
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,400
you want to know is this aspergillus is

643
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:16,679
this some other fungal pathogen but

644
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,200
those are the cultural controls that

645
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:20,820
that you can do for that there are some

646
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,659
products and I know like you just said

647
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:23,759
you're going to talk to Michael

648
00:25:21,659 --> 00:25:26,760
brownbridge Dr Michael Brown Bridge

649
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:28,619
later and he and I talked about some

650
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:30,379
products

651
00:25:28,619 --> 00:25:33,119
um

652
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:34,980
one of those being trichoderma that you

653
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:36,538
can get into the soil they also have

654
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:39,298
some other products that could be

655
00:25:36,538 --> 00:25:40,679
beneficial for dealing with aspergillus

656
00:25:39,298 --> 00:25:43,139
and then you really want to make sure

657
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:45,179
that you're cleaning your rooms as

658
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,559
thoroughly as possible between rounds

659
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,440
and so you could get in there with a

660
00:25:46,558 --> 00:25:52,319
good oxidizer and get the floors and the

661
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,100
walls at the very least

662
00:25:52,319 --> 00:25:55,019
um

663
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:58,798
you know I see people doing things like

664
00:25:55,019 --> 00:26:00,418
running trim machines in a grow room or

665
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:03,179
you know they'll they'll Harvest and

666
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,220
hang their plants in in the same grow

667
00:26:03,179 --> 00:26:07,740
room and that's just the opportunity to

668
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,440
really inoculate that room and so you'll

669
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,839
see people who pass pass and then all of

670
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:14,159
a sudden they fail and it's just those

671
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:16,980
four counts are just building up

672
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,080
building up and then eventually they

673
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:21,179
take over a room and and you'll lose it

674
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:24,899
and so those are those are some of the

675
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:26,880
main things you can do you want a really

676
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:29,880
good air exchange so you don't want to

677
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,799
just be pushing the same room around or

678
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,080
the same air around the facility you

679
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:35,819
need to get the old air out the heat

680
00:26:34,079 --> 00:26:37,798
humidity out and you need to get fresh

681
00:26:35,819 --> 00:26:39,119
air in there

682
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,480
um I don't know am I leaving something

683
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:43,859
out I think that covers it pretty well

684
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,079
uh you know I just want to say

685
00:26:43,859 --> 00:26:48,240
aspergillus is everywhere

686
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:51,720
um it's going to be at differing levels

687
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:52,980
depending on your media and and soil

688
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,558
especially if you're you know if you're

689
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,700
using a compost in your soil

690
00:26:55,558 --> 00:26:59,879
um

691
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:01,019
we've seen it in a variety of different

692
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,179
potting soils from different

693
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:06,298
manufacturers and it's All About

694
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:07,980
Management like you mentioned so

695
00:27:06,298 --> 00:27:10,740
just something for people to keep in

696
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,620
mind uh and really it probably involves

697
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:17,278
a deeper conversation around their

698
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:19,319
specific facility or grow space

699
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,720
um but those are some you know good

700
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:24,119
Basics that everyone should be doing in

701
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:26,819
for IBM in in any space

702
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:28,859
uh yeah and the reports I've seen the

703
00:27:26,819 --> 00:27:31,619
white papers I've read is that they they

704
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:35,579
find aspergillus in every soil every

705
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:37,019
potting substrate and so you know it's

706
00:27:35,579 --> 00:27:39,658
just good to know what you're up against

707
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,619
and so you can take the proactive steps

708
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:42,960
and

709
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:46,139
keep your facility clean get good

710
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,960
biology into your soil and you know it

711
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,240
is everywhere the exclusion is is

712
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,259
difficult and so we want to you know

713
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:57,120
meet it head-on

714
00:27:54,259 --> 00:28:00,240
yeah okay I want to uh switch directions

715
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,719
and talk a little bit about heavy metals

716
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:05,339
there's a few things you know we've done

717
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,140
podcasts now on heavy metals uh you can

718
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:09,058
go back and listen to my one with Brian

719
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:10,919
Mason Soul doctor

720
00:28:09,058 --> 00:28:13,200
uh there's a few things I want to just

721
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:15,000
bring to to highlight for folks because

722
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,740
we are hearing more and more people

723
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,778
having to deal with regulations around

724
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,558
heavy metals

725
00:28:18,778 --> 00:28:22,319
um

726
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,058
do you want to cover why don't you go

727
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:25,200
first Brandon and just mention a few of

728
00:28:24,058 --> 00:28:28,379
the highlights and then I have a list

729
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:31,558
here of things I want to add to it okay

730
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,299
and and kind of something I left out on

731
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,000
the aspergillus that that comes into

732
00:28:33,298 --> 00:28:38,158
this same conversation is getting rid of

733
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,298
the root ball we're seeing that heavy

734
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,539
metals accumulate as well as viroids in

735
00:28:42,298 --> 00:28:47,879
the root material and the recent

736
00:28:45,538 --> 00:28:50,339
research has has proven that that's

737
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:53,039
that's where we're getting the heaviest

738
00:28:50,339 --> 00:28:55,678
um rates of accumulation whether it's

739
00:28:53,038 --> 00:28:58,158
heavy metals or viroids and so we are

740
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,778
heavily recommending that folks remove

741
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,460
their root ball so that they can get

742
00:29:00,778 --> 00:29:04,919
that out of their soil

743
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,380
and then that that just goes back to a

744
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,500
con uh comment I meant to make about the

745
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:12,600
aspergillus is that

746
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:14,220
indoors folks that leave any sort of

747
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:15,719
detritus

748
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:18,480
um and this and this includes cover

749
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,600
crops and mulch

750
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,460
um that's a perfect breeding ground for

751
00:29:21,599 --> 00:29:25,319
aspergillus if you wanted to grow

752
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:27,960
aspergillus you would leave all your

753
00:29:25,319 --> 00:29:29,700
dead leaves on the surface and so it's

754
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:32,220
really important to keep those beds

755
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,419
clean if you are going to try to do that

756
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:35,278
you want to make sure that you're

757
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,640
incorporating that organic material

758
00:29:35,278 --> 00:29:39,960
below the soil surface

759
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,880
and again I still just I would rather

760
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:45,298
just remove it in an indoor environment

761
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,679
but with heavy metals again we want to

762
00:29:45,298 --> 00:29:51,658
remove that root ball there's

763
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,600
so many potential contaminants it could

764
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:56,220
be dust from lead arsenic that's been

765
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,500
sitting in your neighbor's field from

766
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,778
the 70s you know these are persistent

767
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:01,980
they're not going anywhere it could be

768
00:30:00,778 --> 00:30:04,859
in your water

769
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:08,220
it could be in your compost you know we

770
00:30:04,859 --> 00:30:12,599
see that frequently so there's so many

771
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:15,960
uh ph up and down products can bring it

772
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:18,898
in and so it's really important to get a

773
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,880
test for anything you want to add to

774
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:22,619
your soil because you're not going to be

775
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,120
able to get those heavy metals out so

776
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,158
you've got to prevent them from getting

777
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:29,339
in there

778
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,799
um you can try to control it with a

779
00:30:29,339 --> 00:30:34,558
higher pH we've seen some really

780
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:36,658
interesting things with biochar tying up

781
00:30:34,558 --> 00:30:40,619
um heavy metals I've seen some

782
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:44,220
interesting Research into silicon being

783
00:30:40,619 --> 00:30:46,379
able to out compete heavy metals for

784
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:49,700
accumulation in the plant and so there's

785
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:52,860
some things we can we can try to do to

786
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,840
mediate a bad situation but we really

787
00:30:52,859 --> 00:30:56,639
want to prevent it and that all goes

788
00:30:54,839 --> 00:31:00,480
back to testing your products making

789
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:02,278
sure and if you contact a producer and

790
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,679
ask for a heavy metal test and they blow

791
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:07,740
you off or they won't send it you can

792
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,080
look that up I believe California has a

793
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:12,599
registry for you know all the organic

794
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:15,359
products but you can you can look them

795
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,099
up but honestly if they don't send you a

796
00:31:15,359 --> 00:31:20,459
heavy metal test that's a red flag for

797
00:31:17,099 --> 00:31:22,139
me just to keep keep looking

798
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:24,480
yeah and I never have a problem with

799
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,159
people asking us for uh additional

800
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:28,440
testing or they want to test the product

801
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:30,720
themselves I think that's important

802
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:33,600
um but just the Highlight some main

803
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:35,038
things again uh heavy metals are

804
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:39,119
everywhere

805
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:41,038
uh typically when water or soil comes in

806
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:43,019
contact with metal that's a

807
00:31:41,038 --> 00:31:45,179
contamination risk for heavy metal

808
00:31:43,019 --> 00:31:49,918
uptake uh

809
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:52,080
we have seen high levels of uh certain

810
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:55,320
heavy metals in PH down specific

811
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:57,720
products from pretty big name brands so

812
00:31:55,319 --> 00:32:00,960
do your research there and test

813
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:04,980
we don't know what levels in soil will

814
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,819
cause a plant failure we can't say that

815
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:11,159
this PPM of arsenic in soil is going to

816
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:13,079
cause or in your media is going to cause

817
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:16,020
this level of PPM in your plant because

818
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:19,619
there's so many variables between your

819
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:22,200
VPD how are you watering what your your

820
00:32:19,619 --> 00:32:23,519
ppfd is on you know light intensity on

821
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,679
that plant

822
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,480
um what sort of biological activity and

823
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,940
nutrient cycling do you have happening

824
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,500
what is your pH all of these things are

825
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:33,000
going to affect uptake what is the

826
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,200
genetics that you're running that's a

827
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,579
huge one

828
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,140
um different cultivars are going to be

829
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,398
more efficient at pulling up heavy

830
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:40,380
metals than others

831
00:32:38,398 --> 00:32:41,658
and and honestly if you need to pull

832
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,159
heavy metals out of your soil

833
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:47,520
unfortunately have been cannabis are

834
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:50,039
probably the best plant for that too so

835
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,679
it is a challenge so so the key for for

836
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:54,538
us what we try to do at kiss at least is

837
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:57,298
we try to start at a level that we know

838
00:32:54,538 --> 00:32:58,919
we're gonna pass regulation

839
00:32:57,298 --> 00:33:01,019
um below whatever that regulatory

840
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,940
threshold is and then we know that we

841
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:04,259
have a removal rate because we we know

842
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,120
there's going to be some heavy metals in

843
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:08,398
our soils we just need to keep them low

844
00:33:06,119 --> 00:33:09,719
we need to manage them and then when you

845
00:33:08,398 --> 00:33:11,278
go to harvest your crop you're going to

846
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,679
be pulling out small amounts of heavy

847
00:33:11,278 --> 00:33:15,179
metals what we have to do is make sure

848
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:18,240
that that level is going to allow you to

849
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:21,419
pass and then the next round will be

850
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,980
reament we're reamending with less than

851
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:25,259
you pulled out so we're always moving

852
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,460
the direction of removing heavy metals

853
00:33:25,259 --> 00:33:28,619
and

854
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,259
um interestingly enough we did a test

855
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:32,518
with gold leaf soil oh I think it was it

856
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:34,919
was a couple years ago now so they're

857
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:36,480
probably six years into that soil we

858
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:38,038
actually tested it in the Michigan

859
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,720
Market

860
00:33:38,038 --> 00:33:41,759
um sent a sample over there and it

861
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:44,159
passed undetected for heavy metals which

862
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,519
was awesome and so I know that it's

863
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:50,580
possible with this method to grow and

864
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,679
and and passed but you do have to be

865
00:33:50,579 --> 00:33:55,740
diligent and where we see people get in

866
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,659
trouble is when they start adding other

867
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,099
products and maybe they haven't tested

868
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:01,380
all the products and they just assume

869
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:02,038
from the manufacturer that it's safe

870
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,659
um

871
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:05,640
and and that's where we start to see

872
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:07,200
people fail it and the more products you

873
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:09,599
add the more variables you have to go

874
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:11,760
back and test which can get very

875
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,639
expensive down the road and that can be

876
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,619
teased that can be uh microbials that

877
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,919
can be uh just about anything like we

878
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:22,019
said PH down so uh you really do have to

879
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:24,898
do your research there and that doesn't

880
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:28,079
even get into uh I just saw a pot a

881
00:34:24,898 --> 00:34:28,858
webinar the other day

882
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,799
um

883
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:34,079
by Patricia Atkins she I mean I might

884
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,359
have to get her on the podcast he's with

885
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,279
uh antilia scientific

886
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:41,159
and what she was talking about with

887
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,139
heavy metals is the laboratory side and

888
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:45,300
how many fail points there are in the

889
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:47,039
laboratory from the type of water that

890
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,800
they're using to how clean the facility

891
00:34:47,039 --> 00:34:52,679
is to if they have metal furniture in

892
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,019
that space to the gloves that they're

893
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,300
choosing to use actually have heavy

894
00:34:55,019 --> 00:34:59,579
metals on the gloves and levels of zinc

895
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:01,200
and other and other things so

896
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:04,079
it's challenging

897
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:07,019
um yeah and when you're looking at when

898
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,078
you're looking at levels that low the

899
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:12,059
margin of air you know that small 0.02

900
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,880
parts per billion or something like that

901
00:35:12,059 --> 00:35:16,920
the margin of air is as the unit gets

902
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
smaller the margin for error

903
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,800
exponentially gets bigger and bigger and

904
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,039
so you know with heavy metals

905
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,380
um there's there's it's it's really

906
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:30,059
difficult it's just really difficult so

907
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:33,000
you want to manage everything up front

908
00:35:30,059 --> 00:35:34,799
by exclusion and test and everything and

909
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,659
then another thing is RO water and we

910
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:39,420
can talk about RO water because I get a

911
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:41,519
lot of calls about that but RO water is

912
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:44,280
hungry water there's no ions in it and

913
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,920
so anything it passes over it's going to

914
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,880
grab ions from so if it's going through

915
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:52,800
you know cheap uh plastic if it's going

916
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,320
through

917
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:57,180
um a brass spigot if it's going you know

918
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,940
any metal plastic anything that that

919
00:35:57,179 --> 00:36:02,460
water is passing through or over could

920
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,200
very well grab heavy metals and deposit

921
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,820
those into your bed so that's that's

922
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:08,039
another thing you know you want to make

923
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:12,380
sure that that water is buffered before

924
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:12,380
you get it back into your beds or pots

925
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:18,300
yeah absolutely

926
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:20,579
um I had something else on heavy metals

927
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,619
but I'm blanking on it at the moment so

928
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,200
I'll have to I'll have to come back to

929
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:27,960
it oh I just remembered so the other

930
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,179
thing with heavy metals too is they uh

931
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:34,500
they appear to accumulate more in older

932
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:36,899
tissue so if you can send in a I think a

933
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:41,219
younger part of the plant as well as

934
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:42,780
less stem in that plant that is probably

935
00:36:41,219 --> 00:36:44,219
going to test slower I'd like to see

936
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,740
more research around that but that's

937
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:48,419
just sort of the direction I would head

938
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,578
based off of

939
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,740
what uh what we've been learning about

940
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,060
heavy metals still want to pass that

941
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:58,199
along

942
00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:00,119
so uh moving on to a new topic you know

943
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:02,338
I know you get asked a lot like what's

944
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:03,780
what's the secret sauce what's that

945
00:37:02,338 --> 00:37:05,099
special product that's going to make

946
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,540
your

947
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,400
grow

948
00:37:06,539 --> 00:37:09,119
I guess special

949
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,338
um

950
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,119
but what do you have to say about that

951
00:37:11,338 --> 00:37:18,838
man after 38 I'll have 38 years of

952
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,460
cannabis under my belt in May and I've

953
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:24,719
done

954
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:26,820
you know I drove for 18 years Organics

955
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,879
for 20 years

956
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:33,000
um

957
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,780
I've tried every kind of setup that you

958
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:38,579
can imagine and

959
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:41,519
the kiss system and again I don't want

960
00:37:38,579 --> 00:37:45,300
this to be a kiss ad but just a simple

961
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:47,579
organic living soil with testing and

962
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,900
amendments with Safe products

963
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:53,160
is the easiest workflow I've ever had

964
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:56,639
and so

965
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:58,440
after trying you know the Frankenstein

966
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,759
approach just every product you can

967
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,420
imagine

968
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,119
um

969
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,280
the most simple sop has given me the

970
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:07,200
best yields and the best quality

971
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,460
cannabis and so

972
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:13,799
it all comes down to managing your

973
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:15,320
environment making sure that you have

974
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,300
adequate

975
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:20,700
nutrients available to your plant and

976
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,280
the secret sauce is time and patience

977
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:25,259
and paying attention to your plants

978
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:28,380
listening to your plants observing your

979
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:31,260
plants taking data you know getting in

980
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:33,960
there doing scoping defoliating looking

981
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,560
for pests and pathogens

982
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,079
um

983
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:39,659
that's really the secret sauce is the

984
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,900
folks that spend

985
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:45,539
um spend more time in their Garden

986
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:47,460
have better grows because I could give

987
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:51,838
you know 10 different Growers all the

988
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:53,099
exact same inputs cultivars whatever and

989
00:38:51,838 --> 00:38:54,320
they're going to have dramatically

990
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,180
different results

991
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,039
and a lot of folks you know and it's not

992
00:38:57,179 --> 00:39:01,379
their fault a lot of Growers are burned

993
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:03,659
out it's a growing is it can be

994
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,480
monotonous it can be you know it's a lot

995
00:39:03,659 --> 00:39:09,179
of hours I know that for a fact you know

996
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,820
you can easily burn a 80 hour work week

997
00:39:09,179 --> 00:39:13,618
on a farm and so a lot of Growers get

998
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,180
burned out and they come in they check

999
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:17,400
make sure everything's watered and they

1000
00:39:15,179 --> 00:39:20,940
just want to get out of there and and I

1001
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,099
don't fault them for that but

1002
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:24,720
the the thing that you need to do is

1003
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,220
spend more time and so if you can

1004
00:39:24,719 --> 00:39:28,858
automate your watering so you're not

1005
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:31,618
doing that by hand and get more time you

1006
00:39:28,858 --> 00:39:34,019
know that's a that's a dunk just for the

1007
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:36,119
return on investment uh side of things

1008
00:39:34,019 --> 00:39:37,980
but anything you can do so that you can

1009
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,079
free up your grower

1010
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:42,000
especially your higher end grower so

1011
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:43,680
they're not on you know holding a hose

1012
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,099
or something like that

1013
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:50,460
that's what's going to get you better

1014
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:52,880
uh results and and then the next thing

1015
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:55,679
would be if you want to try a special

1016
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,940
you know secret sauce if you want to try

1017
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:58,858
a product

1018
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:00,240
you need to start off with uh you know

1019
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:02,039
like we always tell people to start off

1020
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:04,319
with just water only for their first

1021
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:06,659
round and they're like well but you know

1022
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:09,059
if we add this or we add that

1023
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:11,819
well if you add anything you do not have

1024
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:14,759
a base data set and you really really

1025
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:16,859
need to get get a base data set so you

1026
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,240
can make decisions moving forward so if

1027
00:40:16,858 --> 00:40:20,699
there is a product that your buddy's

1028
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:23,459
using or you read about or saw in a

1029
00:40:20,699 --> 00:40:26,460
podcast and you really want to use it

1030
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,500
you need to set up a control so that's

1031
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,900
the only thing you're adding and then

1032
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:34,858
you have other beds or pots with the

1033
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:37,200
exact same ppfd CO2 you know all the

1034
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:38,880
environment is the same and then you can

1035
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:41,159
determine at the end of that round did I

1036
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:43,680
get a you know a statistically relevant

1037
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:46,078
bump on

1038
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:49,440
on my return for the money I spent

1039
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,539
because you know if you're a if you just

1040
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:53,400
got a 4x4 tent

1041
00:40:51,539 --> 00:40:56,099
you can go crazy because you just really

1042
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:57,960
can't spend too much money and and so I

1043
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:59,400
think that that's a lot of fun to to

1044
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,820
play around with different products and

1045
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:04,559
that kind of stuff but on scale you

1046
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:06,359
really have to take a scientific

1047
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:09,420
approach to it because you just can't

1048
00:41:06,358 --> 00:41:11,460
afford to to spend or waste I should say

1049
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:13,980
that that kind of capital and then

1050
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:15,240
there's a lot of products out there that

1051
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:18,500
you know

1052
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:22,500
are are marketed to Growers

1053
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:26,219
that don't really produce you know

1054
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:28,199
um and look to look to traditional AG as

1055
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:30,419
well that's one of my mantras I'm always

1056
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:32,960
begging people to you know cannabis is

1057
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:36,539
very special to me it's it's it's

1058
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,559
very special to me to my family

1059
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,838
um

1060
00:41:37,559 --> 00:41:42,599
it's not special in agriculture and

1061
00:41:39,838 --> 00:41:45,960
there's no corn or soybean guys spending

1062
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:49,559
six grand on aloe water or you know some

1063
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:53,338
of these products that you know there's

1064
00:41:49,559 --> 00:41:55,219
a place in time and a small uh in a

1065
00:41:53,338 --> 00:41:59,338
small operation where that might work

1066
00:41:55,219 --> 00:42:01,618
but for Growers on scale you need to be

1067
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:04,799
spending time with your plants you you

1068
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:07,740
really have to check in Daily and

1069
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,780
um that that would be my my soapbox on

1070
00:42:07,739 --> 00:42:11,819
all that

1071
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,640
yeah I have I have a couple thoughts on

1072
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:16,619
this too so one I I agree that there's a

1073
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:19,440
lot of I see a marketing all the time on

1074
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,720
Instagram and even stuff like

1075
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,940
that's pushed forward as education

1076
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:26,039
around how to grow but it's really just

1077
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:28,440
product based or just pushing products

1078
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,000
on you and it it frankly drives me a

1079
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,679
little crazy and I don't know how to

1080
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,400
combat that

1081
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:34,559
um

1082
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:36,480
and at the end of the day it's a lot of

1083
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:38,460
hype around product and and if you think

1084
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,199
about it or at least how I how I

1085
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:41,880
approach it is like you said you want to

1086
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:45,419
control for a variable test one thing at

1087
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,579
a time get a baseline but add something

1088
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,139
and if you do get a result try and

1089
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:50,640
figure out think about why you got that

1090
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:52,319
result it means you had some sort of

1091
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:54,118
limiting factor growth at that product

1092
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:55,920
addressed whether it was nitrogen

1093
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,019
whether it was nutrient cycling through

1094
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,720
microbes whether it was you know

1095
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:01,800
whatever micro macronutrient at the end

1096
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:04,799
of the day that's what you want to

1097
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,960
consider when you're thinking about uh

1098
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:09,180
product from a non-marketing perspective

1099
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:12,599
and and then the other thing about this

1100
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:15,838
and I really I really love this about uh

1101
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:18,539
Nate over at Gold Leaf so for him his

1102
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:22,159
secret sauce is his soil because he got

1103
00:43:18,539 --> 00:43:25,079
soil over eight years ago now and

1104
00:43:22,159 --> 00:43:28,019
that soil has been in his facility he's

1105
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:30,599
been managing it in a very specific uh

1106
00:43:28,019 --> 00:43:32,519
microclimate that's unique to him and so

1107
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,680
the expression that he's going to get

1108
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:38,039
from his genetics is going to be totally

1109
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:39,419
different because of that microbial

1110
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:41,880
succession

1111
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,039
and ever and co-evolution between his

1112
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,780
cannabis plant and his soil that's been

1113
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:47,940
happening over the last eight years you

1114
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:50,400
know cycle after cycle that's what

1115
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:53,280
probably 40 40 plus Cycles now in that

1116
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,760
soil and so for him his secret sauce is

1117
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:58,920
his soil that's that's his uh that's his

1118
00:43:56,760 --> 00:44:02,160
Special Sauce because it allows him to

1119
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:04,920
have you know unique terpene expression

1120
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:09,118
um you you know different unique

1121
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:11,099
cannabinoid levels and so I think that's

1122
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:13,079
kind of a better way to approach the

1123
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:15,599
secret sauce ideas just realize that as

1124
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:17,700
a as a grower that soil that you're

1125
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:19,859
managing if you are reusing it it's

1126
00:44:17,699 --> 00:44:22,259
going to become unique to you it's not

1127
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:25,259
you know it's it's no longer a name

1128
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,900
brand soil it's now your

1129
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:30,540
under your ecology habitat that you

1130
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:32,940
created and so that that can be special

1131
00:44:30,539 --> 00:44:34,500
and can be a marketing tool down the

1132
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:38,099
road for Growers depending on your

1133
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:41,280
market so and I and I I think that that

1134
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:43,079
uh that's super important and I

1135
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:45,000
um couldn't agree more

1136
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:47,880
um when Allison Schaefer just got

1137
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:50,940
interviewed for uh their local paper

1138
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:53,400
that's Justin McGill's lead grower for

1139
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,139
the high-end Mako Farms

1140
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:57,599
and she said the exact same thing she

1141
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:59,818
said our either she said either their

1142
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,059
secret recipe or there's you know their

1143
00:44:59,818 --> 00:45:04,380
secret weapon is their soil and it just

1144
00:45:03,059 --> 00:45:07,739
goes back to the same thing they've been

1145
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,420
running kiss soil for a number of years

1146
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:11,578
um you start to you know obviously

1147
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:13,500
there's no humic fraction in a potting

1148
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:16,318
substrate but you do start to approach

1149
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:19,380
something similar to where you've got

1150
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:21,420
nutrients just flowing into solution and

1151
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:23,640
then you've got the microbiology that's

1152
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,639
going to be completely unique to your

1153
00:45:23,639 --> 00:45:27,719
environment and your grow and whether

1154
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:32,039
that's

1155
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:36,000
driving trichome production or driving a

1156
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:38,039
different uh terpene profile

1157
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,659
um that that is what's going to set you

1158
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:41,338
aside and so some of the things we were

1159
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:43,199
talking about earlier as far as like how

1160
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,699
you manage your soil keep it healthy

1161
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,578
that's going to have everything to do

1162
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,618
with your final product and so again you

1163
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:51,720
could give four different Growers the

1164
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,940
same cultivar you know and put it in

1165
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:56,039
their soil and one's going to definitely

1166
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,139
come out on top one of them is going to

1167
00:45:56,039 --> 00:46:01,099
have you know a better expression just

1168
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:01,098
because of that soil

1169
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:08,039
yeah and I want to change topics again

1170
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:09,078
here and talk a little bit about no-till

1171
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,059
um

1172
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:13,200
I I you and I are going to agree on this

1173
00:46:12,059 --> 00:46:14,880
because we've talked about it multiple

1174
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:17,219
times but I want to I want to kind of

1175
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:19,920
share some thoughts around it and you

1176
00:46:17,219 --> 00:46:22,318
know I met Steve Cantwell Greenlife

1177
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,200
Productions down in Vegas uh face to

1178
00:46:22,318 --> 00:46:26,940
face for the first time uh last month I

1179
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:28,858
think it was at the living soil Summit

1180
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:31,380
where we were both speaking and I got to

1181
00:46:28,858 --> 00:46:33,000
hear him speak and I gotta say I have a

1182
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:35,160
ton of I I mean I already had a ton of

1183
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,838
respect for the guy but um I love what

1184
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:38,578
he's doing I love his thought process

1185
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:40,619
and The Innovation that he brings to the

1186
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:43,440
community is amazing

1187
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,880
um now Steve's a cover crop guy Steve's

1188
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:47,159
a no-till guy

1189
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:48,960
um Steve's came up with the idea

1190
00:46:47,159 --> 00:46:50,519
bottomless pots which I think is

1191
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,740
potentially very brilliant I can't wait

1192
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:57,719
to do some trials with it

1193
00:46:52,739 --> 00:46:59,459
um so I I share this twofold one because

1194
00:46:57,719 --> 00:47:01,318
I have I'm going to give you my

1195
00:46:59,460 --> 00:47:04,260
reasoning for why I don't do those

1196
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,699
things in uh the facilities that we work

1197
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:08,460
with or I don't recommend them some of

1198
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:10,739
them still do it and that's fine but

1199
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:12,480
also that we're all a community here and

1200
00:47:10,739 --> 00:47:14,098
at the end of the day like it's this

1201
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:16,740
Innovation that pushes us forward and

1202
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:18,599
and when we become dogmatic in the way

1203
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:20,098
that we grow we are open to what other

1204
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:22,859
people are doing or what other people

1205
00:47:20,099 --> 00:47:25,140
are sharing I think it really limits us

1206
00:47:22,858 --> 00:47:27,779
um and you know people try and act like

1207
00:47:25,139 --> 00:47:28,980
we're we're against each other on this

1208
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,480
sort of thing and while we have

1209
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:32,699
differing opinions

1210
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:33,900
um Stephen I get along great so I just

1211
00:47:32,699 --> 00:47:35,818
want to throw that out there there's no

1212
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:38,400
drama there but

1213
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:42,179
I do want to talk about why we don't

1214
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:44,639
recommend cover crops indoors and why I

1215
00:47:42,179 --> 00:47:47,399
don't really like the term no-till

1216
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:50,219
indoors as well so

1217
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:53,818
and and this is a complicated topic

1218
00:47:50,219 --> 00:47:55,219
um cover crops uh potentially one

1219
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:59,460
they're another crop you have to manage

1220
00:47:55,219 --> 00:48:02,699
uh two they are habit an ecology for

1221
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:05,400
pests and pathogens potentially and

1222
00:48:02,699 --> 00:48:07,618
three and the biggest reason for me even

1223
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:10,200
though those two are huge is that I want

1224
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:11,880
to mix my nutrients back into my soil

1225
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:14,098
down into the Rises there I don't want

1226
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:15,838
to top dress it because of our short

1227
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:18,000
flowering cycle I want those nutrients

1228
00:48:15,838 --> 00:48:20,578
available immediately and having cover

1229
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:23,338
crops in there makes it impossible or a

1230
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:27,300
much more challenging for me to do that

1231
00:48:23,338 --> 00:48:30,420
um and we have this term no-till which

1232
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:33,539
when we amend indoor beds we're not

1233
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:35,460
truly tilling anyway we're not running a

1234
00:48:33,539 --> 00:48:37,440
tiller we're we're shoveling it which

1235
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:40,199
does not have the same impacts on

1236
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,000
biology that uh tiller would and we're

1237
00:48:40,199 --> 00:48:43,199
not creating a compaction Zone like you

1238
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:46,559
would with a tiller if we're using a

1239
00:48:43,199 --> 00:48:48,598
shovel so uh the other advantages of

1240
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:50,400
this just to highlight are you're

1241
00:48:48,599 --> 00:48:51,599
removing the roots which would

1242
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:54,180
potentially lower your heavy metal

1243
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:56,039
content in that soil for the next cycle

1244
00:48:54,179 --> 00:48:58,078
you're getting your nutrients directly

1245
00:48:56,039 --> 00:48:59,639
into the rhizosphere

1246
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,500
and

1247
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,019
um there's this other there's this

1248
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,960
disturbance hypothesis that uh Dr Ben

1249
00:49:04,019 --> 00:49:09,179
Higgins talks about uh that I I might

1250
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:12,599
need to do a an episode with him on this

1251
00:49:09,179 --> 00:49:16,259
but essentially the idea is that we have

1252
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:17,880
we have ecological systems starting with

1253
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:20,160
our primary systems which would be like

1254
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,780
right after a volcano erupts and you

1255
00:49:20,159 --> 00:49:23,759
just have a rock right you have bare

1256
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:25,560
rock and then slowly Life Starts to come

1257
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:28,140
in those are our

1258
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:29,400
beginning successional systems all the

1259
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:31,139
way through you know then you have

1260
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,059
grasslands temperate forests all the way

1261
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:35,039
through to our old growth forest like

1262
00:49:33,059 --> 00:49:38,519
the Redwoods that would be our

1263
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:42,119
considered an apex or climax ecosystem

1264
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:44,579
where we have the most biodiversity

1265
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:46,260
and in theory where cannabis would most

1266
00:49:44,579 --> 00:49:48,720
like to grow is really in the middle

1267
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,280
there it's not in these Apex you know

1268
00:49:48,719 --> 00:49:54,358
no-till

1269
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:56,099
climax ecosystems it's it's where we

1270
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:58,559
have the most biodiversity is is through

1271
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:01,079
disturbance and that disturbance

1272
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:03,299
um allows us to sort of maintain

1273
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:06,000
a little bit more ecological diversity

1274
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,339
and biodiversity in theory I don't know

1275
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,838
how anyone would ever prove or disprove

1276
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:12,480
what I'm saying just because we don't

1277
00:50:09,838 --> 00:50:13,679
have the technology to truly measure

1278
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,960
these things

1279
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:19,559
um because of how rapidly these

1280
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,539
microbial communities are changing

1281
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,338
um but I do feel like that's really our

1282
00:50:21,539 --> 00:50:25,559
sweet spot and why we see the results

1283
00:50:23,338 --> 00:50:28,139
that we do is there anything you want to

1284
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:32,159
add around no-till or cover crops yeah

1285
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:34,139
no I'm on the exact same page I I am a

1286
00:50:32,159 --> 00:50:37,019
no-till person but no-till doesn't mean

1287
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:39,059
no-till because you know like I always

1288
00:50:37,019 --> 00:50:40,800
say I always bring up phosphorus it's

1289
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:42,599
only going to you know phosphate's gonna

1290
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:45,180
move a half an inch in your profile on

1291
00:50:42,599 --> 00:50:47,400
its own so if you're not you know

1292
00:50:45,179 --> 00:50:50,098
scratching in three or four inches down

1293
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,660
to where your roots can get to it you

1294
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:52,920
know your plants are going to be super

1295
00:50:51,659 --> 00:50:56,460
slow

1296
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:59,159
um top dress is a super slow release the

1297
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:01,079
biology can't get to it and make it in

1298
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:03,000
you know available in an ionic form for

1299
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,579
your plant and then you're potentially

1300
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:08,460
creating an impermeable

1301
00:51:05,579 --> 00:51:11,640
um layer on top that would love to grow

1302
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:13,559
fungal you know spores of some sort some

1303
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:14,219
good some bad

1304
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,680
um

1305
00:51:14,219 --> 00:51:18,419
and then um

1306
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,338
I love what you're just saying about Ben

1307
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:22,980
you know we're not trying to mimic

1308
00:51:20,338 --> 00:51:24,779
nature we're trying to do better you

1309
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:27,780
know we you know there's lots of loss in

1310
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,880
nature and we're trying to prevent that

1311
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:32,599
um but yeah so I think that that you

1312
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,599
nailed all that

1313
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,140
yeah this idea of

1314
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:39,179
you know doing what nature does

1315
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:42,000
is I think a little bit of a fallacy

1316
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:45,480
because nature doesn't have weeds nature

1317
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:48,239
doesn't select for one crop species over

1318
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,880
another and to the exclusion of others

1319
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:52,558
and you don't see the level of Health in

1320
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:55,858
nature typically that you would

1321
00:51:52,559 --> 00:51:59,220
especially across a for vast

1322
00:51:55,858 --> 00:52:01,318
quantity of plants which is what you

1323
00:51:59,219 --> 00:52:03,299
need to do when we grow cannabis and you

1324
00:52:01,318 --> 00:52:04,858
don't see monocrops in nature you're not

1325
00:52:03,300 --> 00:52:06,900
going to see you're not just going to

1326
00:52:04,858 --> 00:52:09,119
walk out into an old growth forest and

1327
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:11,700
see a field of you know homogeneous

1328
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:13,740
cannabis anywhere you know

1329
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:15,659
um and so

1330
00:52:13,739 --> 00:52:17,578
that's you know we're doing we're doing

1331
00:52:15,659 --> 00:52:18,779
something different I shouldn't say

1332
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:20,039
better we're just doing something

1333
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,819
different

1334
00:52:20,039 --> 00:52:23,338
um

1335
00:52:20,818 --> 00:52:25,679
and so you know some of the things that

1336
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:27,358
some of the natural processes are not

1337
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,338
beneficial to us in a controlled

1338
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,400
environment

1339
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:34,500
yeah and I do love cover crops mulches

1340
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,358
those sorts of things outdoors so I want

1341
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,059
to or even in Greenhouse environments so

1342
00:52:36,358 --> 00:52:40,920
I want to make that clear uh but the

1343
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,800
other thing too

1344
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,818
is just that while uh

1345
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:48,839
while we don't see monocrops in nature

1346
00:52:46,818 --> 00:52:51,838
we uh

1347
00:52:48,838 --> 00:52:53,818
we we do see

1348
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:56,639
I guess what I want to add to this is we

1349
00:52:53,818 --> 00:52:59,159
do see healthy plants in nature and and

1350
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:02,879
the biodiversity is important but adding

1351
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:05,338
you know a five or seven crop

1352
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,380
cover crop is not really increasing our

1353
00:53:05,338 --> 00:53:10,619
biodiversity anywhere near the levels

1354
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:13,680
that or that we would see naturally so

1355
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:16,440
to me that's that's still monocropping

1356
00:53:13,679 --> 00:53:20,460
pretty much yeah and it it just makes me

1357
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:22,440
so nervous to add a cover crop indoor

1358
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:24,358
you know what what's the advantage so it

1359
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,880
helps with your moisture retention I'd

1360
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,558
much rather set up a blue mat system and

1361
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,900
automate my water so I'm not having to

1362
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,480
worry about that you know it can prevent

1363
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:35,639
erosion and I always joke that if you've

1364
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,559
got erosion indoors you should try an

1365
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:39,659
instrument that maybe growing is not the

1366
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:41,160
thing you should be doing because you

1367
00:53:39,659 --> 00:53:43,259
know how are you you know creating

1368
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,879
erosion indoors so that shouldn't be a

1369
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:46,319
factor

1370
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:49,200
um and then it makes you know we're

1371
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:52,679
already adding in the nutrients based on

1372
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:55,618
you know very tested targets so we don't

1373
00:53:52,679 --> 00:53:58,078
need you know any nitrogen fixing in our

1374
00:53:55,619 --> 00:54:00,720
in our beds

1375
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,579
um and then it makes it so next to

1376
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:05,219
impossible to till in your nutrients

1377
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:07,559
you're gonna have to tear up all that

1378
00:54:05,219 --> 00:54:09,719
um organic matter and work it under the

1379
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,760
soil and it goes back to the aspergillus

1380
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:15,659
conversation you know if if you've got

1381
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:17,760
cover crop and you know you get a pest

1382
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:19,259
or a pathogen in there it's you're going

1383
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:21,839
to have hell to pay on that it's going

1384
00:54:19,260 --> 00:54:25,020
to be really tough

1385
00:54:21,838 --> 00:54:27,539
and Steve talks about how he's growing

1386
00:54:25,019 --> 00:54:29,880
in a desert in Nevada and so his pest

1387
00:54:27,539 --> 00:54:31,558
pressure is very different than what a

1388
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,640
lot of us face in other parts of the

1389
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:35,160
country

1390
00:54:32,639 --> 00:54:36,900
um he doesn't have a lot of crops being

1391
00:54:35,159 --> 00:54:39,838
grown around him from what from what I

1392
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:42,059
understand and he is downright militant

1393
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,558
about who gets into his who gets into

1394
00:54:42,059 --> 00:54:46,619
his facility and who gets into his

1395
00:54:43,559 --> 00:54:47,940
flowering rooms yeah he instead in his

1396
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:49,440
talk that there's a lot of people that

1397
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:51,420
work in these facilities that have never

1398
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:54,358
seen his flowering spaces because they

1399
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:57,059
don't need to and that's the sort of IPM

1400
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:58,858
that allows you to do the things that

1401
00:54:57,059 --> 00:55:02,339
he's doing I think

1402
00:54:58,858 --> 00:55:05,460
um because he's really doing a great job

1403
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:07,259
of keeping pests out of away from his

1404
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:09,059
plants an office facility you know

1405
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,339
you're not allowed to grow if you work

1406
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:13,400
for him you're not allowed to do a lot

1407
00:55:11,338 --> 00:55:16,558
of those those things that lead to

1408
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,800
problems so yeah a lot of respect for

1409
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,800
Steve

1410
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:28,019
yeah yeah and I and I love

1411
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,880
um that that you're always

1412
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:33,300
open to

1413
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:34,740
um conversation and even being wrong and

1414
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:36,960
um yeah I'd love to keep the

1415
00:55:34,739 --> 00:55:38,818
conversations and and keeping our minds

1416
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,159
open and that's how we learn and how we

1417
00:55:38,818 --> 00:55:42,300
get better and you know like that's one

1418
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:44,940
of my favorite things about cultivation

1419
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:46,680
is I learned something every single day

1420
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,720
I was joking with somebody the other day

1421
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:51,480
I was like sometimes I learned that I

1422
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:54,358
was wrong and that's that's exciting you

1423
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:56,699
know it's um you know everybody's got an

1424
00:55:54,358 --> 00:55:58,799
ego some some level of it and so it's

1425
00:55:56,699 --> 00:56:01,139
humbling to be wrong but man it's

1426
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:03,480
exciting because you get to you get to

1427
00:56:01,139 --> 00:56:06,420
go off on a whole other area of learning

1428
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:07,800
and um so I'm very grateful for the

1429
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:12,358
folks who

1430
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:13,980
have differing opinions but uh the folks

1431
00:56:12,358 --> 00:56:17,338
that bring it to the table respectfully

1432
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:19,559
and in a genuine sincere desire to learn

1433
00:56:17,338 --> 00:56:21,659
more and to help other Growers so that's

1434
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,519
that's I love that that's part of the

1435
00:56:21,659 --> 00:56:25,500
conversation just keeping everybody's

1436
00:56:23,519 --> 00:56:27,239
Minds open and we're all on the same

1437
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:29,760
team you know we all want to push the

1438
00:56:27,239 --> 00:56:30,419
needle towards sustainable

1439
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:33,480
um

1440
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,800
and and we've all you know every path of

1441
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:38,460
the organic

1442
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:41,059
uh sustainable movement has stuff to

1443
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,059
contribute

1444
00:56:41,639 --> 00:56:46,199
so one other question I get all the time

1445
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:49,740
especially since I started doing the

1446
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:51,000
plant trivia posts on Instagram was uh

1447
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:54,779
diagnosis

1448
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,099
so people send plant photos of of you

1449
00:56:54,780 --> 00:56:57,839
know some issue or another they're

1450
00:56:56,099 --> 00:57:00,200
dealing with their plan how do you

1451
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:04,558
approach diagnosing a plant

1452
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:08,460
that's uh yeah so diagnosis in person is

1453
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:10,740
difficult and so for me to diagnose

1454
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:14,039
you know from across the country over

1455
00:57:10,739 --> 00:57:17,159
the phone is really difficult

1456
00:57:14,039 --> 00:57:19,139
um but we do have a systematic approach

1457
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:21,899
to that and you know we've got the

1458
00:57:19,139 --> 00:57:24,058
dichotomous key on on the website that

1459
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:26,338
folks can look at that will give them a

1460
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:29,220
really good Fighting Chance at figuring

1461
00:57:26,338 --> 00:57:30,599
out what what's going on

1462
00:57:29,219 --> 00:57:32,578
um the first thing you really need to do

1463
00:57:30,599 --> 00:57:34,920
is determine if it's a nutrient issue

1464
00:57:32,579 --> 00:57:38,280
and so one of the easiest ways to do

1465
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:40,380
that one of the the tried and true ways

1466
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:42,660
is to look at your individual ranges and

1467
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:45,838
any range would be you know whether it's

1468
00:57:42,659 --> 00:57:49,558
a bed or a group of pots but when I say

1469
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:50,838
range I just mean a uniform cultivar and

1470
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:54,240
feed schedule

1471
00:57:50,838 --> 00:57:55,019
and then uniform environmentals

1472
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:57,479
um

1473
00:57:55,019 --> 00:57:59,699
and if you look at that and that whole

1474
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,940
bed is showing some symptom it's all

1475
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:05,279
yellowing or something you know then if

1476
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:08,280
the entire bed is affected you can

1477
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:10,140
usually safely assume that it's nutrient

1478
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:12,240
now it might be a nutrient issue because

1479
00:58:10,139 --> 00:58:14,338
the whole bed got over watered and

1480
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:16,979
there's been root death and so it's

1481
00:58:14,338 --> 00:58:20,759
showing nitrogen issues

1482
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:24,119
um but if you can see a consistent uh

1483
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:26,040
across the the entire range issue then

1484
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:28,500
you're pretty safe to assume you need to

1485
00:58:26,039 --> 00:58:30,358
go down the nutrient path pests and

1486
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,880
pathogens tend to jump around and so

1487
00:58:30,358 --> 00:58:35,519
you'll have one plant tanking and then a

1488
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,559
plant right beside it that's doing fine

1489
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:40,440
um that that's time to get out the scope

1490
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:42,119
look at Roots maybe do some testing

1491
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:44,400
um but if you if you see something

1492
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:45,838
uniform you want to inspect the range

1493
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,700
and you want to look at the plants and

1494
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,159
what the first thing you want to notice

1495
00:58:47,699 --> 00:58:52,439
is where is the problem starting don't

1496
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:54,058
even worry about what the issue is where

1497
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,460
is it starting on the plant if it's

1498
00:58:54,059 --> 00:58:59,519
starting on the bottom of the plant then

1499
00:58:56,460 --> 00:59:02,519
it's a mobile element and so what's

1500
00:58:59,519 --> 00:59:05,400
happening is the apical growing tip

1501
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:07,440
you know the plant is is trying to

1502
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:10,079
reproduce itself it's just doing what

1503
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:13,798
biology does it's trying to make progeny

1504
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:18,059
and so it's going to sacrifice those

1505
00:59:13,798 --> 00:59:20,159
lower leaves and and flowers to the top

1506
00:59:18,059 --> 00:59:22,500
of the plant to make sure that that's

1507
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:24,179
healthy and can receive pollen and make

1508
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,858
seeds for the next round

1509
00:59:24,179 --> 00:59:27,659
and that's what the plant wants to do to

1510
00:59:25,858 --> 00:59:30,480
preserve itself

1511
00:59:27,659 --> 00:59:32,279
um and so if you're losing nutrients at

1512
00:59:30,480 --> 00:59:34,920
the bottom you know it's new a mobile

1513
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,660
element so you can

1514
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,599
you know kind of break that down pretty

1515
00:59:36,659 --> 00:59:42,920
quickly you know it's either nitrogen

1516
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:45,838
phosphorus potassium or magnesium and

1517
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:48,420
that's that's pretty easy magnesium is

1518
00:59:45,838 --> 00:59:50,599
is probably the easiest one to diagnose

1519
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:54,059
it's just that inner venal chlorosis

1520
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:56,579
potassium is chlorosis you know that

1521
00:59:54,059 --> 00:59:58,519
stays on the margin and then rapidly

1522
00:59:56,579 --> 01:00:00,960
goes to necrosis

1523
00:59:58,519 --> 01:00:03,960
phosphorus the the whole plant will get

1524
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:06,559
dark but the bottoms the tips will start

1525
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:09,420
to burn and the leaf will go necrotic

1526
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:11,280
nitrogen you just the whole Leaf goes

1527
01:00:09,420 --> 01:00:12,780
yellow goes chlorotic and then you'll

1528
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:14,940
have lethal decision where the leaf will

1529
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,440
just pop off before it goes necrotic you

1530
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:19,318
can just pop it right off or it'll fall

1531
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,000
off and so then if it's not at the

1532
01:00:19,318 --> 01:00:22,798
bottom then you know that it's a

1533
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:25,380
immobile element

1534
01:00:22,798 --> 01:00:27,900
you know and that's where I see most of

1535
01:00:25,380 --> 01:00:30,780
the misdiagnoses a lot of folks will see

1536
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:33,720
burning at the top and assume that it's

1537
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:34,980
nitrogen they've got too much nitrogen

1538
01:00:33,719 --> 01:00:37,739
um

1539
01:00:34,980 --> 01:00:40,039
when in fact that's almost always a

1540
01:00:37,739 --> 01:00:43,618
Calcium deficiency

1541
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:47,639
there's a couple that will show across

1542
01:00:43,619 --> 01:00:50,700
the entire plant like sulfur the entire

1543
01:00:47,639 --> 01:00:51,960
plant will go kind of light green

1544
01:00:50,699 --> 01:00:54,798
um and then there's things that happen

1545
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,760
at the top of the plant like like iron

1546
01:00:54,798 --> 01:00:58,798
consistently and every grow I've ever

1547
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,079
seen you know the very top of the plant

1548
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:04,079
is a little bit of lime green especially

1549
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:06,000
where the petiole into the of the leaf

1550
01:01:04,079 --> 01:01:08,460
and that's iron and it just grows out

1551
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,338
you know repeatedly over and over again

1552
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:14,240
and so just using a dichotomous key to

1553
01:01:11,338 --> 01:01:19,019
see where on the plant it's starting

1554
01:01:14,239 --> 01:01:21,058
will limit what nutrients you're going

1555
01:01:19,019 --> 01:01:22,318
to look at and then there's very

1556
01:01:21,059 --> 01:01:23,640
specific

1557
01:01:22,318 --> 01:01:26,338
um

1558
01:01:23,639 --> 01:01:28,858
uh symptoms that come with that and so

1559
01:01:26,338 --> 01:01:30,719
you can get out the nutrient

1560
01:01:28,858 --> 01:01:32,578
deficiencies and bedding plants that

1561
01:01:30,719 --> 01:01:34,259
book is a great book because you could

1562
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:38,280
go around your yard

1563
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:39,780
and look at every single plant and you

1564
01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:41,760
know because that dichotomous key is not

1565
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:43,500
specific to cannabis it's it's designed

1566
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:46,440
for cannabis with cannabis illustrations

1567
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:49,798
to to help Growers but you can apply

1568
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:52,798
that to to grasses to flowering plants

1569
01:01:49,798 --> 01:01:55,679
and so it's practice that's that's the

1570
01:01:52,798 --> 01:01:57,539
thing is you can't just get that

1571
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,818
overnight you're gonna have to practice

1572
01:01:57,539 --> 01:02:01,380
and so you're going to have to look at

1573
01:01:59,818 --> 01:02:04,199
that dichotomous key and you're going to

1574
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:05,240
have to run through your plants and you

1575
01:02:04,199 --> 01:02:08,098
know

1576
01:02:05,239 --> 01:02:10,500
practice on on what's in your garden

1577
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:12,059
that's not cannabis practice you know if

1578
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,500
you go to a friend's house look at their

1579
01:02:12,059 --> 01:02:15,900
plants

1580
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:18,659
um don't drive them crazy with diagnosis

1581
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,660
but you know just the more times you can

1582
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:24,058
repeat that process where you know is it

1583
01:02:21,659 --> 01:02:26,460
nutrient is it a consistent symptom

1584
01:02:24,059 --> 01:02:28,980
throughout the range where on the plant

1585
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:31,199
did it start and then based on where on

1586
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,719
the planet started start looking at the

1587
01:02:31,199 --> 01:02:35,219
individual symptoms and then it's it's

1588
01:02:33,719 --> 01:02:37,318
pretty straight straightforward to dial

1589
01:02:35,219 --> 01:02:38,759
that in

1590
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:40,739
um I guess the other the only other

1591
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:43,680
thing is just to

1592
01:02:40,739 --> 01:02:45,179
don't neglect environmental changes if

1593
01:02:43,679 --> 01:02:46,618
you've got our differences if you've got

1594
01:02:45,179 --> 01:02:48,239
a great a big greenhouse and

1595
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:50,760
everything's planted the same you might

1596
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:52,318
have a corner that's shady and so it's

1597
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:54,180
you know accidentally getting over

1598
01:02:52,318 --> 01:02:56,338
watered it's just not getting the same

1599
01:02:54,179 --> 01:02:58,919
growth rate that sort of thing I think

1600
01:02:56,338 --> 01:03:00,960
everybody's first initial instinct is

1601
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:02,460
it's nutrients and it might be nutrients

1602
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:03,960
but it might be some environmental

1603
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,720
Factor that's preventing it from getting

1604
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:08,760
into the plant as well like calcium you

1605
01:03:06,719 --> 01:03:10,379
know if your VPD is off it doesn't

1606
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:12,119
matter how much calcium you've got in

1607
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:14,539
the soil it's just not going to get into

1608
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,539
the plant

1609
01:03:15,900 --> 01:03:18,838
yeah I think you covered it I don't

1610
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,099
really have a lot to add there other

1611
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:23,400
than

1612
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:25,920
um when people send me their photos I I

1613
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:28,559
try to give a diagnosis but it's always

1614
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,780
a challenge so just keep that in mind

1615
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:32,760
I'll do my best but uh

1616
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:35,339
yeah like you said it's impossible to

1617
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,660
tell just from a food yeah and if they

1618
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:38,460
can if they can give you that

1619
01:03:36,659 --> 01:03:41,399
information because a lot of times

1620
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:43,139
people will send me a picture of a leaf

1621
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:44,940
and they're like what's going on with

1622
01:03:43,139 --> 01:03:47,159
the plant and if you could send me a

1623
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:49,260
picture of the leaf send me a picture of

1624
01:03:47,159 --> 01:03:52,139
the entire plant like backed away from

1625
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:54,240
it that and then some information has to

1626
01:03:52,139 --> 01:03:57,000
you know when it started

1627
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:59,159
where did it start is it homogeneous

1628
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:02,539
throughout the rain you know is it only

1629
01:03:59,159 --> 01:04:05,940
one cultivar you know like um

1630
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:08,279
you know Justin McGill has one of the

1631
01:04:05,940 --> 01:04:11,460
most amazing growth facilities I've ever

1632
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:15,000
seen it's like a surgery room the floors

1633
01:04:11,460 --> 01:04:18,179
are are Polished in um it's the cleanest

1634
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:20,099
place the nutrients are dialed in

1635
01:04:18,179 --> 01:04:21,500
they've got one I think it's their white

1636
01:04:20,099 --> 01:04:25,380
star dog

1637
01:04:21,500 --> 01:04:27,838
it always presents some deficiency at

1638
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:29,220
the end of the round and so as long as

1639
01:04:27,838 --> 01:04:32,338
you

1640
01:04:29,219 --> 01:04:34,798
are okay with that then the the

1641
01:04:32,338 --> 01:04:36,179
nutrients across the board you know

1642
01:04:34,798 --> 01:04:38,880
there's always going to be certain

1643
01:04:36,179 --> 01:04:42,000
outlier cultivars that are super heavy

1644
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:43,798
feeders super light feeders and so that

1645
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,539
could be an issue as well so always

1646
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:48,380
always consider the cultivar in the

1647
01:04:45,539 --> 01:04:48,380
environment as well

1648
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:54,119
yeah Justin's facility is great in the

1649
01:04:51,358 --> 01:04:55,739
sense of uh

1650
01:04:54,119 --> 01:04:58,680
the

1651
01:04:55,739 --> 01:05:01,199
the staff and how they they care for the

1652
01:04:58,679 --> 01:05:03,419
plants keep things clean it does have

1653
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,039
just if people go online and look at his

1654
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,500
the pictures on Instagram he does have

1655
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,298
old life he does have old Peck in there

1656
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:11,280
but they still grow consistently really

1657
01:05:09,298 --> 01:05:13,920
good plants because of

1658
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,019
all the other reasons that you lifted so

1659
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:18,298
I just want to throw that out there uh

1660
01:05:16,019 --> 01:05:19,980
just in case people do go look that up

1661
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:21,599
and check him out um which they should

1662
01:05:19,980 --> 01:05:23,940
he's a great grower and he's they're

1663
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:25,019
definitely a facility to follow along if

1664
01:05:23,940 --> 01:05:26,519
you're interested in this style of

1665
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:30,000
growing

1666
01:05:26,519 --> 01:05:31,380
um okay last topic uh in in under five

1667
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:33,480
minutes because we're almost out of time

1668
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:34,920
you said you get asked a lot about white

1669
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:35,699
ash

1670
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:37,200
um

1671
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:39,598
do you want to go ahead and touch on

1672
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:41,699
that and then we'll uh sign off on the

1673
01:05:39,599 --> 01:05:43,140
podcast for today yeah I'll make this

1674
01:05:41,699 --> 01:05:45,539
really quick

1675
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:47,759
um bottom line for white ash is it

1676
01:05:45,539 --> 01:05:50,338
should not be a driver for why you're

1677
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:52,380
selecting your cannabis there's all

1678
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:54,779
kinds of myths that it's heavy metals

1679
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:58,858
it's pesticides it's not flushed

1680
01:05:54,780 --> 01:06:00,180
properly for hydro soil Hydro grows

1681
01:05:58,858 --> 01:06:03,119
um

1682
01:06:00,179 --> 01:06:05,279
there's been a ton of research you know

1683
01:06:03,119 --> 01:06:08,579
you can go on the forums and get let

1684
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:10,500
down all kinds of Primrose Pathways but

1685
01:06:08,579 --> 01:06:13,079
if you if you go back like I said

1686
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:15,239
earlier go to traditional Ag and look at

1687
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:17,220
the research before you you know spend

1688
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:20,578
money on something

1689
01:06:17,219 --> 01:06:22,798
um with white ash there's tons of

1690
01:06:20,579 --> 01:06:24,539
research it's been done we don't need to

1691
01:06:22,798 --> 01:06:26,579
do it again you know you could look at

1692
01:06:24,539 --> 01:06:28,680
the tobacco industry they're kind of

1693
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:31,019
responsible for the whole white white

1694
01:06:28,679 --> 01:06:33,960
ash mythology

1695
01:06:31,019 --> 01:06:36,480
um but also forestry services both here

1696
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:38,760
and in Europe fire departments you know

1697
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,119
the study combustion science that's not

1698
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:44,240
new you know there's 200 years of of

1699
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:47,220
research that we can look at

1700
01:06:44,239 --> 01:06:49,679
and Ash color

1701
01:06:47,219 --> 01:06:51,538
has nothing to do with pesticides has

1702
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:54,179
nothing to do with heavy metals has

1703
01:06:51,539 --> 01:06:56,339
nothing to do with mineral content Ash

1704
01:06:54,179 --> 01:06:59,338
color is determined by carbon

1705
01:06:56,338 --> 01:07:01,219
and whether all the organic matter all

1706
01:06:59,338 --> 01:07:04,980
the carbon-based

1707
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:07,199
material has been burned off and

1708
01:07:04,980 --> 01:07:09,179
combusted converted to carbon dioxide

1709
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:11,578
and it's left the building it's gone now

1710
01:07:09,179 --> 01:07:13,199
and if all the carbon has left the

1711
01:07:11,579 --> 01:07:14,940
building then you end up with a

1712
01:07:13,199 --> 01:07:16,460
perfectly White Ash and the only thing

1713
01:07:14,940 --> 01:07:19,798
that's left behind or the mineral

1714
01:07:16,460 --> 01:07:21,119
constituents a lot of sodium magnesium

1715
01:07:19,798 --> 01:07:23,639
um

1716
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:27,059
but you know so when people say it

1717
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:29,338
wasn't flushed and that's why I had too

1718
01:07:27,059 --> 01:07:31,619
much nitrate or something like that in

1719
01:07:29,338 --> 01:07:32,759
the in the plant that's not why it's

1720
01:07:31,619 --> 01:07:35,579
burning

1721
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:38,339
um Salt and Pepper or dark uh you know

1722
01:07:35,579 --> 01:07:40,318
because in perfect White Ash the only

1723
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:41,880
thing that's left behind is the mineral

1724
01:07:40,318 --> 01:07:45,538
content

1725
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:47,700
um there's there's a a chemist who did a

1726
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:48,420
bunch of experiments on it

1727
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,939
um

1728
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:52,740
but it all comes down to moisture

1729
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:55,019
content you could you could have the

1730
01:07:52,739 --> 01:07:58,318
best herb in the world that's not

1731
01:07:55,019 --> 01:08:00,538
perfectly dry and burn it and you're

1732
01:07:58,318 --> 01:08:03,538
gonna get a dark ash and then you could

1733
01:08:00,539 --> 01:08:07,619
have heavy metal pesticide Laden

1734
01:08:03,539 --> 01:08:09,420
horrible swaggy brick weed and it'll

1735
01:08:07,619 --> 01:08:11,539
burn perfectly white if it's super dry

1736
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:14,579
because all the carbon's been burned off

1737
01:08:11,539 --> 01:08:16,819
so at the end of the day I just don't

1738
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:20,039
want people to you know that's a myth

1739
01:08:16,819 --> 01:08:21,539
that if we don't get it out of cannabis

1740
01:08:20,039 --> 01:08:23,819
you know how do how do they get

1741
01:08:21,539 --> 01:08:25,679
cigarettes to burn perfectly white well

1742
01:08:23,819 --> 01:08:30,359
they spray products on that and I don't

1743
01:08:25,679 --> 01:08:32,279
want tobacco ethics or sprays in my

1744
01:08:30,359 --> 01:08:34,079
cannabis experience

1745
01:08:32,279 --> 01:08:37,380
um I don't I don't want anything to do

1746
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:40,559
with that and so my incentive for trying

1747
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:44,000
to stomp on this one particular myth is

1748
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:46,500
because if we don't stomp on this one

1749
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:49,859
eventually we will have cannabis

1750
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:51,838
producers you know for spraying their

1751
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:55,020
final product with additives so that it

1752
01:08:51,838 --> 01:08:59,460
will burn white if that is a driver

1753
01:08:55,020 --> 01:09:01,319
um you know like THC you know is is a

1754
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:02,939
huge driver if you go into dispensary

1755
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,100
that's what they're going to tell you

1756
01:09:02,939 --> 01:09:07,979
this is a THC level on this this and

1757
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:10,199
this but we know from blind tests that

1758
01:09:07,979 --> 01:09:13,259
people are picking their cannabis based

1759
01:09:10,198 --> 01:09:16,439
off of the terpene profile more than the

1760
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:18,719
THC and so when it comes to drivers on

1761
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:20,818
why you're paying what you're paying and

1762
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:22,739
what the experience is you know if

1763
01:09:20,819 --> 01:09:24,900
aesthetically it does something special

1764
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:26,759
for you to have white ash in your pipe

1765
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:30,479
or on your joint

1766
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:31,979
um then cool go for it but as far as the

1767
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:35,039
science behind it and studying

1768
01:09:31,979 --> 01:09:37,619
combustion science there's there's no

1769
01:09:35,039 --> 01:09:39,539
validity to the White Ash myth at all

1770
01:09:37,619 --> 01:09:40,559
just zero

1771
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:44,159
um

1772
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:46,620
it all comes down to temperature and you

1773
01:09:44,159 --> 01:09:48,358
know you can go ask a fireman probably

1774
01:09:46,619 --> 01:09:50,399
the average fireman could do a much

1775
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:52,259
better job of explaining this or you

1776
01:09:50,399 --> 01:09:55,859
know somebody in the Forestry Department

1777
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:59,880
but the things that would prevent

1778
01:09:55,859 --> 01:10:01,738
um one or one finished flower from being

1779
01:09:59,880 --> 01:10:04,140
white versus another one would be the

1780
01:10:01,738 --> 01:10:06,899
moisture content and the resin content

1781
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:08,960
and then a really interesting side note

1782
01:10:06,899 --> 01:10:12,779
on this is that

1783
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:16,319
THC to CBD ratios may have something to

1784
01:10:12,779 --> 01:10:19,259
do with it because the way that the THC

1785
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:21,599
molecule it it's a 2d two-dimensional

1786
01:10:19,260 --> 01:10:24,719
molecule it lays flat CBD is a

1787
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:28,620
three-dimensional molecule and so

1788
01:10:24,719 --> 01:10:31,319
when you decarboxylate that

1789
01:10:28,619 --> 01:10:33,658
um you have the protonation of a carbon

1790
01:10:31,319 --> 01:10:36,960
group that has to leave but then there's

1791
01:10:33,658 --> 01:10:37,979
a there's a a proton has to

1792
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:41,100
um

1793
01:10:37,979 --> 01:10:43,859
come in for that to happen

1794
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:47,460
with CBD because it's three-dimensional

1795
01:10:43,859 --> 01:10:50,759
that second ring is blocking that proton

1796
01:10:47,460 --> 01:10:53,399
so it slows the decarboxylation and so

1797
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:57,000
could that be another part of the puzzle

1798
01:10:53,399 --> 01:10:59,939
as to why you know those ratios it
