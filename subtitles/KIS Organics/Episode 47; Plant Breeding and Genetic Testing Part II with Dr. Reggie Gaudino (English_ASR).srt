00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,118
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,699
science podcast

4
00:00:21,118 --> 00:00:26,129
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:27,779
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:26,129 --> 00:00:29,910
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:31,559
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,630
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:35,308
share their wisdom and knowledge before

10
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,899
starting off the podcast I want to tell

11
00:00:35,308 --> 00:00:38,699
you about some exciting new stuff going

12
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,710
on with kiss organics we are now

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,420
officially registered for our soils and

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,189
nutrient pack with the CDFA in

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,620
California we went through the process

16
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,359
of registering as a fertilizer which is

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:50,280
how all super sales or living soil

18
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:52,229
should be categorized if you're using

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,879
one that isn't registered that way then

20
00:00:52,229 --> 00:00:55,288
it might not have the level of testing

21
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:57,058
and lab work that you want to make sure

22
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,679
the heavy metal levels and nutrient

23
00:00:57,058 --> 00:01:00,780
levels are safe or actually what the

24
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:03,179
company is claiming you can also view

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,670
microscope work on our soil mix on their

26
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,170
YouTube channel in addition we are

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,840
approved for use in organic production

28
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:12,240
with the CDFA as well as certified kind

29
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,490
in Oregon till we have our veggie mix

30
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:15,809
certified with the double USDA and are

31
00:01:14,489 --> 00:01:17,579
in the process of getting the rest of

32
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,409
our products registered as organic here

33
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:21,658
in Washington as well it's just a lot of

34
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,490
paperwork we hope to be adding some new

35
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:25,650
hydro shops and garden centers in other

36
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,390
states here soon but don't hesitate to

37
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,969
contact your local shop or have them

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:31,920
reach out to us if you're interested

39
00:01:28,969 --> 00:01:32,429
this week's podcast is a follow up with

40
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
our guest

41
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:37,979
Reggie Gaudi know Reggie is the chief

42
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,350
science officer for steep hill labs dr.

43
00:01:37,978 --> 00:01:42,060
Godinho oversees all scientific research

44
00:01:40,349 --> 00:01:43,618
and development for steep hill and is

45
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,259
the driving force for steep hills

46
00:01:43,618 --> 00:01:48,180
genetic research program doctor Gao Dino

47
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,459
directed a team of researchers which led

48
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:53,399
to the development of gen KITT the first

49
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:55,078
cannabis DNA based sex test the research

50
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:57,118
from dr. Godinho has been peer reviewed

51
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:59,209
and published leading to important new

52
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:02,009
discoveries in the cannabis industry

53
00:01:59,209 --> 00:02:04,169
doctor Gao Dino received his BS in

54
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,450
molecular biology and PhD in molecular

55
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:08,520
genetics from the State University of

56
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,949
New York at Buffalo and he conducted

57
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:12,659
four years of postdoctoral research at

58
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:14,639
Washington University in

59
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:17,819
Louis studying transcriptional

60
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:19,769
regulation of our RNA Reggie was one of

61
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,079
the first african-american molecular

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:25,530
biologists to enter a ph.d program in

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:32,430
the United States in 1985 now onto the

64
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:33,449
show alright hey Reggie thanks for

65
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,460
coming on the show again I really

66
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:36,929
appreciate it

67
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:39,090
thanks dad thanks for having me I'm

68
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:41,460
actually honored and surprised that you

69
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,930
have me back oh the feedback from the

70
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:46,080
show was really good it was all really

71
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,819
positive I did get a few questions if

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,210
you don't mind it will just dive right

73
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,430
in with some of those sounds great okay

74
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:56,700
so one of the things in the podcast that

75
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:59,849
you had mentioned was that even worked

76
00:02:56,699 --> 00:03:02,039
at Monsanto and some people reached out

77
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:03,870
to me really concerned about Monsanto in

78
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,939
general because you elaborate a little

79
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:08,700
more about what the future holds and the

80
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:10,409
role of companies like steep hill you

81
00:03:08,699 --> 00:03:13,259
know for example if you were to develop

82
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:15,840
an effective genetic marker with with

83
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:17,129
the data what assurances do growers have

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,170
that their data isn't going to be used

85
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:21,479
by a company like yourself or other

86
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:23,458
companies in this space and then turned

87
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:27,479
around and bought out by a company like

88
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,640
bear who owns Monsanto okay so these are

89
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:31,649
great questions so let me start with so

90
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:34,049
I did my postdoc at Washington

91
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,240
University in st. Louis and so some of

92
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:38,219
my postdoctoral research was done in

93
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:40,350
conjunction with Monsanto and on a month

94
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:42,750
Hendo campus I have actually not ever

95
00:03:40,349 --> 00:03:45,959
worked or been paid by Monsanto so I

96
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:47,909
want to make that very clear so and then

97
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:51,930
so to the rest of the question you know

98
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:54,060
so data is an interesting thing and so I

99
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:55,530
get approached with this a lot how do we

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,039
know that you're not going to do this

101
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,830
well when you take an individual sample

102
00:03:59,039 --> 00:04:05,429
and you look at it when you sequence it

103
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:07,650
all you really have is that sample and

104
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,349
if that's the only sample you look at

105
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:13,890
you can't really make any calls about

106
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:16,168
what else is going on in a genome the

107
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:18,839
power of genomics doesn't come until you

108
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:20,310
have a lot of DNA sequences aggregated

109
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,978
and then you start to look at

110
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,478
differences in the aggregated data so

111
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,289
when you look at it from that

112
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:29,680
perspective any one person

113
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:32,350
data is not going to give you any

114
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,050
answers right it's not until you

115
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:38,500
actually have tens or hundreds of

116
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,180
samples to then align and/or you know

117
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:42,040
number crunch against each other where

118
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:45,069
you start to see patterns fall out of

119
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:47,020
the ether right and so when somebody

120
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:50,170
comes to me and says that I say well

121
00:04:47,019 --> 00:04:52,750
your data point is just one of many and

122
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:53,290
with your one data point you can't do

123
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:56,170
much

124
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:59,410
it's the aggregation of all the data so

125
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:01,300
in reality it's the work that we do on

126
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,400
the back end after we've done all this

127
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,230
other sequencing that allows us to make

128
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:08,049
any calls and see any differences right

129
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,670
so that's not to minimize you know the

130
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,490
fact that growers spend a lot of time

131
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:13,960
building unique cultivars you know but

132
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,420
you can't tell it's unique from the

133
00:05:13,959 --> 00:05:18,430
genetic perspective unless you compare

134
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:21,009
it to a bunch of other things so having

135
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,680
said that you have to do the kind of

136
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:26,529
analysis that they're afraid of to be

137
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,360
able to see anything and then you get to

138
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:30,489
the point where and this has been

139
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:32,980
litigated you know in regular you know

140
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,500
chemistry type science and other

141
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:40,780
Sciences where in fact there's there's a

142
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:43,209
whole a whole level of infringement

143
00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:45,759
payment analysis that's done based on

144
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:48,489
the contribution of that one data point

145
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,889
to the overall system right and if it

146
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:52,810
takes a thousand points to be able to

147
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,969
make a call then the person's really

148
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,009
only entitled to one one thousandth of

149
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,310
the payment right and that's what

150
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:03,930
happens right now in patent law right so

151
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,579
getting back to the question you know

152
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:09,280
it's important for people to understand

153
00:06:06,579 --> 00:06:11,889
that in order to be able to give them

154
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:14,139
any advice on breeding or markers we

155
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:18,039
have to be able to aggregate data and

156
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:21,189
look at it as a whole in which case any

157
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,470
one data point becomes a lot less

158
00:06:21,189 --> 00:06:26,050
important even though it's very

159
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,460
important to the client right so you

160
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,389
know we have to look at it from the both

161
00:06:27,459 --> 00:06:33,339
perspective so you know so what the pill

162
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:37,269
has done right as we've done a lot of

163
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:40,299
sequencing and and we have been a lot of

164
00:06:37,269 --> 00:06:44,049
aggregate we found markers for THC

165
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:46,150
you know a liver taluk acid 55 different

166
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,920
terpene genes exciting flowering jesus

167
00:06:46,149 --> 00:06:50,799
said all right so we have built a

168
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,580
library of markers that we can then turn

169
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:57,730
around and use to help people do better

170
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:59,889
breathing but again we couldn't have

171
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:02,740
done that without looking at everybody's

172
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:05,620
data so what we do is and we turn around

173
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:09,340
and we offer that information to staff

174
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:11,170
as you know the markers right we allow

175
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:14,199
anybody who would like to agree for that

176
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:16,420
marker to use or genetic services we

177
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:19,060
ourselves and and this is unique to

178
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:20,830
California right and so and we can go

179
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:23,500
into examples of other companies that

180
00:07:20,829 --> 00:07:27,519
are not doing this right but because of

181
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:30,069
us where we are we actually cannot hold

182
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,250
any financial interest in any other

183
00:07:30,069 --> 00:07:36,370
license in California right so I cannot

184
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:38,050
have a cultivation license I can't have

185
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:41,319
a dispensary license I can't have a

186
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:44,530
nursery license so so all I can do at

187
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,449
steep hill is actually equal and then

188
00:07:44,529 --> 00:07:48,759
offer marker-assisted breeding services

189
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:50,349
where people bring us their DNA we do

190
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,599
the analysis and say hey you have this

191
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:54,730
allele it's the right one or it's the

192
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,010
wrong one so if you would like to be

193
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:58,540
able to breed then this is what you have

194
00:07:57,009 --> 00:08:00,519
to do so that's what we do we offer

195
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:03,129
consulting services based on the marker

196
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:05,199
analysis and sequencing some other

197
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,939
companies out there have taken some data

198
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,170
and and I think this is you know

199
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:10,529
poignant and I'm not trying to bash

200
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,580
anybody but right now there are

201
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,679
companies out there that are under

202
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:17,289
scrutiny because they have in fact taken

203
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:19,150
their their clients data and use it for

204
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,590
their own personal gain so I don't want

205
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:22,870
to mention names or like that but but

206
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,219
you know it's if people you know look

207
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:28,689
deep enough in the industry they'll find

208
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:30,430
exactly I'm talking about so so the next

209
00:08:28,689 --> 00:08:35,289
part of this question is is what happens

210
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:37,509
if Bayer you know buys our data or

211
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:41,799
absorbs me and buys my data so what they

212
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:43,629
don't do is they don't okay before I go

213
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:45,209
into that let me let me give something

214
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:48,519
else which is I think a basic

215
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:51,250
misconception in in patent law unless

216
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:53,720
you are the inventor you cannot file for

217
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:56,028
a patent if you do file for a patent

218
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,769
and somebody challenged it challenges it

219
00:08:56,028 --> 00:08:59,120
it is basically thrown out almost

220
00:08:57,769 --> 00:09:01,639
immediately it will cost a little money

221
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,620
to prove it but yes if they can't they

222
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:06,079
don't have a leg to stand on right so

223
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,089
with those two things in mind if there

224
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:10,250
were to come or Monsanto were to come

225
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:13,639
and buy steep hill right they would get

226
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,500
our marker database yes right because

227
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:17,959
that marker database was something that

228
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:20,839
we created it's our IP based on

229
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,909
sequencing thousands of strains right

230
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,800
but again we get back to the any one

231
00:09:22,909 --> 00:09:30,919
string doesn't tell you anything and you

232
00:09:27,799 --> 00:09:33,979
know and that would be of a concern

233
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:36,979
because a Monsanto or a bear could then

234
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:40,009
use all of that data to jump start right

235
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,778
but it's not anything that someone else

236
00:09:40,009 --> 00:09:44,240
can do I can offer that state reading

237
00:09:41,778 --> 00:09:45,769
service to you know any number of seed

238
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,720
companies in the cannabis industry now

239
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:51,350
and they could do the same thing right

240
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,990
so so the technology is there and being

241
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:57,639
built for the cannabis industry to use

242
00:09:53,990 --> 00:10:00,980
and because of the nature of that data

243
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:03,470
it doesn't allow anybody to pack their

244
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,120
strain but it does allow them to do the

245
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:07,339
same greeting if they can get the same

246
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,808
germ plasm which is a problem in the

247
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:09,920
industry because what we do in the

248
00:10:08,808 --> 00:10:11,058
industry is we put clubs and

249
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,729
dispensaries anyway and sell them for

250
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:19,458
ten bucks a pop right so so you know I

251
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:21,769
think we we need to as an industry

252
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:24,138
understand a little better where the

253
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:25,879
lines are drawn in these things right so

254
00:10:24,139 --> 00:10:28,430
first of all you can't patent somebody

255
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:29,839
else's strain right if you try to and

256
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:35,508
they can prove it you're gonna lose the

257
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:39,050
patent right you know marker developing

258
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:41,568
markers for breeding right can't be done

259
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:44,058
just using one strain it must be done

260
00:10:41,568 --> 00:10:46,039
with the aggregate data from a lot of

261
00:10:44,058 --> 00:10:48,438
strains in which case you know what

262
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:50,240
we've done now is removed from the

263
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:52,250
strain we've had to go and take a look

264
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,500
at it and say okay why are these things

265
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:57,019
different where do these differences

266
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,089
occur and how and how then can we follow

267
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:02,299
them right so there's a lot of work that

268
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:04,550
goes into that that is devoid of the

269
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:07,509
person's personal DNA sequence for his

270
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:09,609
strain so you know

271
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,169
there it's a difficult thing to get

272
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,669
comfortable with and I think we're in a

273
00:11:11,169 --> 00:11:14,589
different situation in the cannabis

274
00:11:12,669 --> 00:11:18,519
industry because typically this stuff

275
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,500
was all done by feed companies you know

276
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,960
big feed companies that did it all

277
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,639
in-house and did all the work that steep

278
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,550
hill does in-house like Monsanto doesn't

279
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:29,139
go to a steep hill to have them sequence

280
00:11:27,549 --> 00:11:32,679
their DNA they have they do it all

281
00:11:29,139 --> 00:11:35,970
in-house right so so you know I do

282
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:38,739
understand that there's this fear factor

283
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:40,330
because I think a lot of the industry

284
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:44,680
doesn't understand the power of genetics

285
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:49,150
or what genetics can can and cannot do

286
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:51,250
but you know I don't think there's a way

287
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,809
to assure people that something like

288
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,879
that can't happen because they're

289
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:57,069
absolutely right you know five years

290
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:58,870
from now ten years from now whoever the

291
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:01,000
board of directors is at steep hill

292
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,740
could say holy crap we just got offered

293
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
up a billion dollars for Steve Hill

294
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,649
he'll yell we're gonna sell in which

295
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,259
case they would get everything lock

296
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:13,629
stock and barrel including the IP and so

297
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:15,700
you know remotely is that a concern yes

298
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,439
I think that we don't have to worry

299
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,120
about that I don't think the big blue

300
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,770
chips that people are ready to come into

301
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,810
the industry anyway is will be a couple

302
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:25,269
years and that still gives us a couple

303
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:27,819
years to lay the foundation for which

304
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:30,399
they can't do any of this which is then

305
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:32,080
we as an industry has to take the

306
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,340
information that we have the genetic

307
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:36,070
sequence has been developed by the

308
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:38,440
companies like myself and mg medicinal

309
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:40,510
genomics and Philo's we have to use

310
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,190
those tools or advantage so that we can

311
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:44,080
put out patents and intellectual

312
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:46,150
property that keep people like from

313
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,680
Monsanto from coming in and then

314
00:12:46,149 --> 00:12:49,659
benefiting from exactly what they're

315
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:51,669
afraid of buying a company like mine and

316
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:54,129
then having all this information right

317
00:12:51,669 --> 00:12:56,949
so if the patent and the strains are

318
00:12:54,129 --> 00:12:58,450
already out there it doesn't really help

319
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:01,390
them all that much they still have to

320
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:04,330
work around all those things does that

321
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:06,370
kind of address the question I think so

322
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,920
so you're you're saying that any one

323
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,409
person's genetic marker is really just a

324
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:15,039
drop in the ocean it doesn't have any

325
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:16,750
intrinsic value by itself but when

326
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,610
combined with a bunch of other data it

327
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,379
now has it has value because you can

328
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:21,699
make correlations and draw conclusions

329
00:13:20,379 --> 00:13:26,289
now what

330
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:28,568
exactly to that though is I have friends

331
00:13:26,289 --> 00:13:32,349
for example that are vegetarian because

332
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:34,719
they're very against our industrial meat

333
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:36,579
process which I completely understand

334
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,889
and it makes a lot of sense so they

335
00:13:36,578 --> 00:13:40,748
abstained from that fully knowing that

336
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:42,730
they're they're abstaining from eating

337
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:44,980
meat is probably not going to affect the

338
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:47,048
overall American market for meat

339
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,199
consumption but if for them it's an

340
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:52,178
ethical principle and I see that around

341
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,128
growers - with cannabis so is there any

342
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:56,789
is there any way though to use these

343
00:13:54,129 --> 00:14:00,609
tools to use this science without

344
00:13:56,789 --> 00:14:01,808
without risking or this sort of thing or

345
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:04,839
is it really one of those things that if

346
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:06,129
you want to use this technology it's

347
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,169
just something that you have to risk

348
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:13,418
with with your with your genetics so

349
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:15,938
there is a way to use it so not

350
00:14:13,418 --> 00:14:18,609
everybody has to get their whole genome

351
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:20,379
sequence right so when I when I speak of

352
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:22,089
marker tests we don't speak once the

353
00:14:20,379 --> 00:14:23,409
whole genome to look at the markers

354
00:14:22,089 --> 00:14:25,689
we've developed high-throughput assays

355
00:14:23,409 --> 00:14:27,338
that have the ability to just look at

356
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:29,168
that one marker so let's say somebody

357
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:32,410
sends in a you know a sample to us

358
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:34,659
anyway just wants BBB and X that's all

359
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:37,058
we look for because we're only charging

360
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:39,578
him 30 bucks I'm not gonna go and spend

361
00:14:37,058 --> 00:14:41,499
you know a thousand dollars to sequence

362
00:14:39,578 --> 00:14:42,969
his own whole genome to give him the

363
00:14:41,499 --> 00:14:44,499
answer he's looking for when I can do it

364
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:49,059
for 30 bucks

365
00:14:44,499 --> 00:14:52,749
so does that sample stay in the

366
00:14:49,058 --> 00:14:57,219
repository for future work no yes and no

367
00:14:52,749 --> 00:15:00,009
so what the way we do it is is we if we

368
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,109
if we see in the course of working with

369
00:15:00,009 --> 00:15:04,629
a client that we have something special

370
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:08,489
from that client we will definitely then

371
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:10,538
try to engage them in a fuller

372
00:15:08,489 --> 00:15:13,899
investigation of the genomic right but

373
00:15:10,538 --> 00:15:17,019
again where we're in this to create a

374
00:15:13,899 --> 00:15:18,909
business and a the business is most

375
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:20,619
efficiently done by just looking for the

376
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:25,328
markers people checkoff on the box right

377
00:15:20,619 --> 00:15:27,129
so you know at the end of the day I'm

378
00:15:25,328 --> 00:15:29,378
trying to make money and if I do

379
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,668
additional work I'm losing money

380
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,989
because I'm not charging a lot for their

381
00:15:30,668 --> 00:15:34,329
service in the first place right so if

382
00:15:31,989 --> 00:15:38,740
I'm charging 15 or 20 bucks a mark

383
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:41,110
that's really really cheap right you

384
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,180
know you look at looking marker analysis

385
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,870
and human genomes it costs thousands and

386
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:50,500
thousands of dollars I thought you know

387
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,899
so in order to participate using these

388
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:55,389
tools you have to have a relationship

389
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,049
and a trust with the lab right or maybe

390
00:15:55,389 --> 00:16:00,939
you go to a lab like mine where we are

391
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:03,789
precluded from doing anything that

392
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,890
you're afraid of right so you know if

393
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,299
you go to a lab in Oregon where they're

394
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:09,009
not precluded where you go to a lab

395
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,569
let's say in Arkansas where they you

396
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,950
know who knows what lab is offering

397
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,160
these services but if you go to another

398
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:17,980
lab where they have the ability to you

399
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:21,429
know breed and create their own you know

400
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:23,379
germ plasm well then there is clearly a

401
00:16:21,429 --> 00:16:25,689
potential for conflict of interest and

402
00:16:23,379 --> 00:16:30,220
and I'm very sensitive to that because

403
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:32,500
of the fact that you know I myself and

404
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,660
they plant biologist and have worked for

405
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,240
22 years in intellectual property so I

406
00:16:34,659 --> 00:16:39,490
am very very sensitive to the to the

407
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,860
plight of the person who is potentially

408
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:43,299
going down this path right so I spent 22

409
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,120
years writing patents and protecting

410
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:47,919
patents for other people so when we put

411
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,409
together our service it was from the

412
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:52,240
perspective of we do not want to be a

413
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:53,980
competitor we want to be a partner right

414
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,560
if people we will never have people

415
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:58,480
trust us if we turn around and start

416
00:16:56,559 --> 00:17:00,129
breeding ourselves so that is something

417
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,850
that we absolutely do not do it's Kiko

418
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:05,529
so but it is a concern and people need

419
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:08,170
to do their own due diligence to see you

420
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:10,389
know and and read the intake form right

421
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,990
so every every genetic service out there

422
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:15,700
has a intake form contract read the fine

423
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:18,130
print you know see what they're going to

424
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:20,289
do I specifically state that I guess I

425
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,410
have the right to use the data for

426
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:26,139
aggregate analysis but I and I clearly

427
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:29,080
state that I will that I make no claims

428
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,000
to this to the strain or or to the DNA

429
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:33,549
itself I will not go out and try and

430
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,740
patent your DNA because it's not my DNA

431
00:17:33,549 --> 00:17:37,240
for the reasons why I said before so all

432
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:40,269
those things are stated in my intake

433
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:41,799
form but I clearly say you you're

434
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:43,720
bringing me your data I'm going to give

435
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:47,019
you a result and I'm going to use this

436
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:48,009
data for further aggregate research so

437
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,808
I'm

438
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:52,058
so it's important for people to I think

439
00:17:49,808 --> 00:17:53,440
you know read the fine print and make

440
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:56,349
sure they do a due diligence before

441
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,058
choosing a genetic partner yeah that's

442
00:17:56,349 --> 00:18:00,099
you brought up a good point that's a red

443
00:17:58,058 --> 00:18:02,889
flag for meat or I guess more of a sore

444
00:18:00,099 --> 00:18:05,619
spot because like my father for example

445
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:07,780
he originally was designed and made a

446
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:09,909
compost tea Brewer this is like 20 years

447
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:11,500
ago and he was working with a particular

448
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:14,140
lab who was collecting all this data he

449
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,779
was paying them for these tests and then

450
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:18,730
you know they were recommending his

451
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:21,279
Brewer because of the level he was

452
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:23,620
testing and then down the road you know

453
00:18:21,279 --> 00:18:25,569
five six years they came out with their

454
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:27,459
own line of compost tea brewers so they

455
00:18:25,569 --> 00:18:29,470
took that data and that information that

456
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,630
they gathered from my father and others

457
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,069
who were using their lab to gain this

458
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,290
information and then came out with a

459
00:18:33,069 --> 00:18:37,119
competing product which you're right is

460
00:18:35,289 --> 00:18:39,639
not illegal but ethically and morally

461
00:18:37,119 --> 00:18:41,918
it's a little bit suspect and that would

462
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,340
be my concern as a grower what you've

463
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:46,630
mentioned there is in states like Oregon

464
00:18:44,339 --> 00:18:49,178
where they could do something like that

465
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:51,160
and you I've have heard exactly what

466
00:18:49,179 --> 00:18:53,470
you're alluding to that would concern me

467
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:56,558
to know that my data is being used to

468
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:59,860
essentially help out a competitor in my

469
00:18:56,558 --> 00:19:03,029
own state in my industry so that's a

470
00:18:59,859 --> 00:19:06,339
that's a very valid concern yeah no it

471
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:09,160
it absolutely it is right and so but at

472
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:12,159
the same time right so you know without

473
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:13,870
the ability to aggregate data and to see

474
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:18,548
differences let's take the Varens

475
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:22,269
pH TV right so so if you just look at

476
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:24,009
DNA from a Varon strain right you have

477
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,109
no idea what makes it a baron strain

478
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:27,279
it's not until you compare it to a non

479
00:19:26,109 --> 00:19:29,019
variant strain and you can see the

480
00:19:27,279 --> 00:19:32,289
points of difference that you can tell

481
00:19:29,019 --> 00:19:36,069
why apparent strain is is special and

482
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:37,779
then it's only after that analysis on a

483
00:19:36,069 --> 00:19:39,819
much larger scale can you actually

484
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:42,509
reasonably make calls as to what markers

485
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:46,480
might be useful for breeding to follow

486
00:19:42,509 --> 00:19:49,000
producing Varon strains right so you

487
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,390
know so at some point there has to be an

488
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:55,058
acceptance in the industry for at least

489
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,059
a basic level of genetic investigation

490
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:59,918
and and and utility right because

491
00:19:58,058 --> 00:20:01,940
without it we will always be behind

492
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,528
April this is exactly what is done

493
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:05,720
and every other commercial crash crop

494
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:07,308
and again we do things a little bit

495
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,500
differently here because a lot of this

496
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:11,269
work is done internally to a big company

497
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,490
like this Monsanto or Dow they do it all

498
00:20:11,269 --> 00:20:16,009
internally none of the companies in the

499
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:17,599
cannabis industry at least beginning had

500
00:20:16,009 --> 00:20:19,009
the resources to do this I'm sure that

501
00:20:17,599 --> 00:20:20,808
there are some big seed companies now

502
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,220
that are doing quite well you know

503
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:23,628
selling you know millions and millions

504
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:25,940
of dollars a year a flower that's great

505
00:20:23,628 --> 00:20:28,219
so some of these labs can then start to

506
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:30,200
do it but then it's an expensive

507
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,389
undertaking right so now you have to

508
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,340
start thinking about you know sequencing

509
00:20:32,388 --> 00:20:36,288
all your strains and you know the

510
00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:37,579
setting of a molecular biology lab and

511
00:20:36,288 --> 00:20:39,980
then and then once you have your strain

512
00:20:37,579 --> 00:20:42,109
sequence if you don't have a method

513
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,419
developed or using that information

514
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:47,388
you're still you know at square one

515
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:49,778
right so it takes a lot of work to be

516
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:52,548
able to set up a robust genetic service

517
00:20:49,778 --> 00:20:55,190
a lot more than people would probably

518
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:57,619
realize right and so because of that

519
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:00,379
it's not something that you can bring

520
00:20:57,619 --> 00:21:02,538
in-house unless you are a very large

521
00:21:00,378 --> 00:21:05,148
company or you have the money like

522
00:21:02,538 --> 00:21:07,069
behind in an Andy a sorry um an Aurora

523
00:21:05,148 --> 00:21:09,709
or a canopy right people with that kind

524
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:12,710
of money can do can consider this path

525
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:14,480
internally otherwise it has to be done

526
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:15,610
through the use of a third of a third

527
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,960
party

528
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:21,378
Casca a random slightly off-topic

529
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:26,179
question here you continually use the

530
00:21:21,378 --> 00:21:28,339
word strain as a geneticist is there is

531
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:32,889
there a particular reason you use that

532
00:21:28,339 --> 00:21:36,378
nomenclature over a varietal or cultivar

533
00:21:32,888 --> 00:21:38,898
I because of the industry itself

534
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:41,869
cultivar or and actually cultivar is

535
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:43,398
probably not even correct chemo var is

536
00:21:41,869 --> 00:21:44,778
the actual correct terminology right

537
00:21:43,398 --> 00:21:46,548
because you can take the same genetic

538
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:48,308
and grow at multiple different ways and

539
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:50,210
get different chemical output so

540
00:21:48,308 --> 00:21:51,829
realistically we should be completion

541
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,740
and this is the problem with strain

542
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:56,480
names in general I did so because it

543
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:57,980
tells you really nothing even the

544
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,569
genetics tells you nothing without

545
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:02,058
knowing the environment in which it was

546
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:04,700
grown so chemo var is actually probably

547
00:22:02,058 --> 00:22:07,609
the most accurate terminology for the

548
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:10,159
industry for what you're the data you're

549
00:22:07,609 --> 00:22:12,798
collecting now yeah it would be the best

550
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,600
if we were to refer to an actual

551
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:17,220
plant a plant it would be a varietal

552
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:18,719
then wouldn't it because it could be

553
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:23,370
expressed in two different Keene of ours

554
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:27,870
but it would be a specific yeah I get

555
00:22:23,369 --> 00:22:30,149
material yeah so cultivar varietal I

556
00:22:27,869 --> 00:22:33,418
think cultivar and varietal are fairly

557
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:36,450
close in their meaning so I think you

558
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:39,028
know III see that more people are

559
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,240
adopting varietal and getting away from

560
00:22:39,028 --> 00:22:44,308
the preeminence through the strain

561
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,429
designation and I'd say that varietal is

562
00:22:44,308 --> 00:22:50,879
definitely a step in the right direction

563
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:52,950
and potentially varietal with a sub

564
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,950
classification of a specific chemo bar

565
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,720
right so this varietal the this chemo

566
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,880
bar from this varietal right so and

567
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,110
because remember it there is also the

568
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,809
possibility that you can have different

569
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:06,509
varietals that have overlapping chemo

570
00:23:03,808 --> 00:23:07,798
bars right so so ultimately depends on

571
00:23:06,509 --> 00:23:09,089
what what question you're asking if

572
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:10,769
you're really concerned about just the

573
00:23:09,089 --> 00:23:12,298
chemistry then then it would be a chemo

574
00:23:10,769 --> 00:23:14,278
bar but if you are concerned about the

575
00:23:12,298 --> 00:23:16,908
genetics that would be varietal and then

576
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:19,109
with a designation of the chemo of our

577
00:23:16,909 --> 00:23:21,240
output you're looking forward which then

578
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:24,269
designate some environmental you know

579
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:26,429
boundary that helps it was just a

580
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:28,679
question that someone had asked me and I

581
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:32,070
thought I'd pose it to you

582
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,778
so changing topics one more time you

583
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,569
mentioned a little bit some numbers and

584
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:39,058
a little bit around steep hill in terms

585
00:23:36,569 --> 00:23:40,950
of the testing what what sorts of

586
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:43,278
markers are you currently able to test

587
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:48,990
for I know you mentioned sex

588
00:23:43,278 --> 00:23:51,599
you mentioned THC v so we have so we've

589
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:55,589
had a obviously the sex in the CBD has

590
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:58,678
have been available from us for 2015 we

591
00:23:55,589 --> 00:24:02,099
have expanded the CBD test so that it

592
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:03,690
now tells us specifically we can

593
00:24:02,099 --> 00:24:08,250
identify those that are 20 to 1 or

594
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:11,700
higher we actually have expanded our you

595
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:14,970
know our cannabinoid testing we have the

596
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,350
gene for CBG a synthase it's not really

597
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:18,179
call that's called aromatic Pernod

598
00:24:16,349 --> 00:24:22,048
transferase but nobody understands that

599
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:23,820
so we collect EVGA synthase we have a

600
00:24:22,048 --> 00:24:26,009
marker for that we have a marker for the

601
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:28,139
upstream we have markers for

602
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:30,119
during aerial pyrophosphate synthase

603
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:32,669
which is or at least one of the subunits

604
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:36,599
which is one of the feeders into making

605
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:39,890
GP t BGA we have the other side as well

606
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:43,199
the Illuma talat assets by clay sand or

607
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:44,790
aloo Matar acid synthase depending on

608
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,819
whether you use the new or the old

609
00:24:44,789 --> 00:24:50,190
nomenclature so those two things are key

610
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:52,259
to making the compounds that are then

611
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:54,269
condensed into ski BGA we have those

612
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,929
we're going further back up that frame

613
00:24:54,269 --> 00:25:00,750
on each side although those are less

614
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:03,690
well developed we have mapped 55 active

615
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:08,329
tripping genes we are in the final

616
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:10,650
phases of putting together the the

617
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:12,000
validation that would allow us to be

618
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:14,160
able to call each of those 55

619
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,419
individually that's a tough job because

620
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:17,610
there's so much similarity in the

621
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:22,049
terpene gene but we're getting closer on

622
00:25:17,609 --> 00:25:23,428
that and I as far as the cannabinoid

623
00:25:22,048 --> 00:25:26,190
that I realize I just I didn't finish

624
00:25:23,429 --> 00:25:29,220
that but so we also now have developed a

625
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:31,830
bunch of THC a markers that when used in

626
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:34,640
conjunction with CBD markers actually

627
00:25:31,829 --> 00:25:37,019
allows us to start to get a handle on

628
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:39,000
different ratios other than the twenty

629
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:41,220
to one right so now we think we have

630
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,679
markers that when you combine the marker

631
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:46,079
test they identify those things that

632
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,630
come out like two to one like you know

633
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:52,500
five to four to one ten to one that kind

634
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:55,470
of thing so so then on top of that we

635
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:58,200
have we have sort of looking at all the

636
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:59,819
fatty acyl phases because again those

637
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,269
are involved in oil production right and

638
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:05,548
and those are cross over into hemp as

639
00:26:03,269 --> 00:26:07,918
well same genes so you know so oil

640
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:09,298
production in general is it becoming a

641
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,190
more important thing so we've started

642
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:12,629
down that pathway we we have a number of

643
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:16,500
fatty acyl synthase genes that are

644
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:18,809
involved in hydrocarbon production so we

645
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:22,460
had the flowering genes the clock genes

646
00:26:18,808 --> 00:26:24,928
or things like you know photo period

647
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,829
things that affect trichome development

648
00:26:24,929 --> 00:26:30,269
so those are all is either in validation

649
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:33,178
or in the works but the ones that are

650
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:35,579
available right now are sex all the

651
00:26:33,179 --> 00:26:38,009
cannabinoid ones that I mentioned and

652
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:39,359
then many of the terpene ones though the

653
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:42,929
other ones are

654
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:45,869
earlier stage of development so if I was

655
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:48,450
a breeder and I wanted to go through

656
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:50,159
this process with steep hill you

657
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,870
mentioned some costs around you know

658
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,090
fifteen to thirty dollars for a

659
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:55,558
particular marker I would just come in

660
00:26:54,089 --> 00:26:57,269
fill out this form and select what

661
00:26:55,558 --> 00:27:00,269
markers were most important to me and

662
00:26:57,269 --> 00:27:02,480
then I would submit what I assume is a

663
00:27:00,269 --> 00:27:05,519
leaf tissue sample

664
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:09,870
yeah so that's so it used to be that way

665
00:27:05,519 --> 00:27:11,940
so what we so first of all you wouldn't

666
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:14,279
have to come in we actually you can deck

667
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:15,960
to do it online or phone call so you

668
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,109
know what we recommend though it

669
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:23,640
depending on on the person's you know

670
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:26,369
comfortableness with with genetics in

671
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,690
general right so a lot of times we'll

672
00:27:26,369 --> 00:27:29,399
get people who don't really know how to

673
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:31,048
start and so that we do an initial

674
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,610
consultation which is free that we just

675
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:34,769
get on a call we ask you what your goals

676
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:37,289
are wouldn't kind of brief for what are

677
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:39,418
your sort of dream plasma you know and

678
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:41,369
then you know we get an idea of that and

679
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:43,919
then we can suggest how to go about it

680
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:45,599
but it no longer is leaf based because

681
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,590
that's illegal you can't ship across

682
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:53,369
state lines so we now use a card from GE

683
00:27:51,589 --> 00:27:55,649
healthcare it's called it's called the

684
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:58,619
FDA plant favorite card so the beautiful

685
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:01,410
thing about this card is that you know

686
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:04,229
you can do a leaf print on it we can get

687
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:06,058
DNA off of it it carries a very small

688
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:12,360
amount of cannabinoids because it's

689
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:15,329
designed for DNA and and so we we have

690
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:17,099
different processes that we recommend

691
00:28:15,329 --> 00:28:21,058
right so there's a way that you can send

692
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:23,428
us the card we're a small enough leaf

693
00:28:21,058 --> 00:28:25,230
print will not have enough cannabinoids

694
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,769
to be a problem and so we can actually

695
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:31,169
do some limited cannabinoid ratio

696
00:28:28,769 --> 00:28:34,619
analysis so the card does not capture

697
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:36,780
the chemistry in a quantitative fashion

698
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:38,459
but it doesn't equality the fashion so

699
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:41,099
let's say you have a two to one DVD the

700
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,169
THC ratio we will see that ratio

701
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:45,750
preserved and what comes off the card in

702
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:48,120
terms of be cannabinoids but we can't

703
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:51,289
tell you that it was 20% right because

704
00:28:48,119 --> 00:28:53,219
it doesn't it doesn't capture you know

705
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:57,329
quantitatively just quality

706
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:59,220
so but then that allows us to do a

707
00:28:57,329 --> 00:29:02,038
little bit extra analysis for you

708
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:04,079
because now we can do the CBD THC you

709
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:06,450
know genes and then say and here and

710
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,158
based on what we got off the card it

711
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:11,519
looks like that you have a two to one

712
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,789
ratio and it's supported by the DNA

713
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,509
right so and let me let me take an aside

714
00:29:14,788 --> 00:29:20,940
right here so until somebody has a

715
00:29:18,509 --> 00:29:23,908
perfectly true breeding stabilized

716
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:25,288
strain DNA just represents a potential

717
00:29:23,909 --> 00:29:27,630
that's a really important concept for

718
00:29:25,288 --> 00:29:31,169
people to understand right because very

719
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:33,330
few genes are very few outcomes are due

720
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,520
to a single gene right so like THC a

721
00:29:33,329 --> 00:29:37,829
synthase would make THC right but

722
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,019
there's a whole feeder pathway that

723
00:29:37,829 --> 00:29:42,599
feeds the TAC a since they so if

724
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:45,000
something upstream of the gene is not

725
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:47,459
optimized you may never see the benefit

726
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,038
of having the best THC a gene in your

727
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,390
plant does that make sense

728
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:52,710
totally so that's what you're saying is

729
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,690
in a lot of it it just tells you the

730
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:57,659
genetic potential of that plant so if

731
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:59,250
you took that plant planted it in cocoa

732
00:29:57,659 --> 00:30:00,990
and then grew it very poorly or under

733
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,630
poor lighting conditions or watering you

734
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:07,620
may not get that result that you were

735
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:10,590
looking for exactly right so so but that

736
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:12,779
get that becomes less and less of a

737
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:14,970
concern as you go through your breeding

738
00:30:12,779 --> 00:30:16,710
program and you've optimized all of the

739
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:18,600
genes that are important for the effects

740
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:21,090
that you're looking for and that's the

741
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:22,439
beauty of what we do as I said it that's

742
00:30:21,089 --> 00:30:24,480
why we're going back up the pathway

743
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:27,090
that's why we're looking at the GPP and

744
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,329
colic acid synthase because this way as

745
00:30:27,089 --> 00:30:35,459
the library expands you actually can

746
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:37,259
breed and select for the optimized plant

747
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:39,720
that you're looking for and the beauty

748
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:42,658
of genetics is you can select for these

749
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:44,190
things all together right so so you know

750
00:30:42,659 --> 00:30:47,419
for instance let's say you're looking

751
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:51,620
for a trip inyline dominant pH D

752
00:30:47,419 --> 00:30:54,360
dominant you know strain that you know

753
00:30:51,619 --> 00:30:56,099
is drought resistant well

754
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:58,019
drought resistance is something that

755
00:30:56,099 --> 00:31:00,000
we're working on as well as are many

756
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,529
stress stressors right so there's a lot

757
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,839
of stress response and cannabis and so

758
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:06,200
we're looking at some of those as well

759
00:31:02,839 --> 00:31:08,329
and so you know once

760
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:12,019
have the markers you can do a breeding

761
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:14,779
you know crack a thousand seeds and pull

762
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:16,609
out the five that have the markers that

763
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:20,539
you want because that's the power of

764
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:22,519
what the library and the the the marker

765
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:24,799
assisted breeding gives you you don't

766
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:28,309
need to grow all thousand we can just

767
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,049
find at germination the five that were

768
00:31:28,309 --> 00:31:31,339
the ones that had the things that you

769
00:31:30,049 --> 00:31:34,809
were looking for tossed the rest and

770
00:31:31,339 --> 00:31:38,740
just work on those five right so so so

771
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:42,079
as this technology becomes more mature

772
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:45,950
it actually provides greater benefit for

773
00:31:42,079 --> 00:31:48,319
the for the real savvy genetic you know

774
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:50,120
breeder right so that because now it's

775
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:51,529
not just phenyl hunting right you're not

776
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:53,389
just going out there and in rubbing

777
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,759
stems and smelling your fingers right

778
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,920
sir it's actually intelligently designed

779
00:31:55,759 --> 00:32:00,349
breeding programs based on markers that

780
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:02,570
are known and can be followed and that's

781
00:32:00,349 --> 00:32:06,349
what the Monsanto's in the Dallas do

782
00:32:02,569 --> 00:32:09,740
right so that's how we take our industry

783
00:32:06,349 --> 00:32:12,799
to that level right without like having

784
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,000
them do it for us sure but the one

785
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:16,730
question I have then is you mentioned

786
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:19,430
popping a thousand seeds and then doing

787
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:21,589
the marker testing you know a thousand

788
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:24,259
fifteen dollar markers alone would be

789
00:32:21,589 --> 00:32:25,669
fifteen grand if you start looking at

790
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:32,390
more markers how does this become

791
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:34,910
affordable well so you know what we we

792
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:37,190
do offer both pricing right and on both

793
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:38,570
the number of tests and and like any

794
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:40,370
company you're gonna end up um pricing

795
00:32:38,569 --> 00:32:42,200
so if somebody comes in and they want to

796
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:44,719
test on its fifteen dollars a test right

797
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,400
they want to test done for a hundred for

798
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,559
a hundred samples the price goes down

799
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,070
right so so there are both there are

800
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:53,269
both pricing and you know the you know

801
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:55,339
opportunities and and then there's

802
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:56,809
actually you know different

803
00:32:55,339 --> 00:32:58,159
relationships and different company to

804
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:00,289
this differently but but you know at

805
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:07,370
some point if you're looking for a large

806
00:33:00,289 --> 00:33:10,220
enough a large enough swath of markers

807
00:33:07,369 --> 00:33:12,139
then we would probably you know try to

808
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:14,809
recommend that you join the breeding

809
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:17,360
program which is different involves some

810
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:20,118
sequencing and allows us to do a little

811
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:25,038
bit more in-depth analysis

812
00:33:20,118 --> 00:33:28,428
that cost more upfront which saves money

813
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:30,489
and time later right so you know so it's

814
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:33,200
also important to understand that

815
00:33:30,489 --> 00:33:34,759
genetic services come in at at many

816
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,649
different levels right there's a very

817
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,690
simple basic analysis where you can do

818
00:33:36,648 --> 00:33:41,148
success and stuff like that

819
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:43,399
and then there's you know analysis where

820
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:45,648
as you go down a reading program when

821
00:33:43,398 --> 00:33:48,228
you're trying to understand how

822
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:50,388
stabilized your strain is right for any

823
00:33:48,229 --> 00:33:53,960
given marker where you actually do need

824
00:33:50,388 --> 00:33:55,459
to do sequencing along the way in the

825
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:57,259
breeding program to understand what's

826
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:59,838
called the hetero zygosity homozygosity

827
00:33:57,259 --> 00:34:01,969
index right so be more homozygous you

828
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:04,069
are at many positions the closer you are

829
00:34:01,969 --> 00:34:06,080
to stabilize and true breeding which is

830
00:34:04,069 --> 00:34:07,999
ultimately what we need to be if we

831
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:11,960
would like to go towards you know stable

832
00:34:07,999 --> 00:34:15,318
feeds right and so genetic services

833
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,990
themselves come and you know like bronze

834
00:34:15,318 --> 00:34:22,009
silver and gold kind of levels tearing

835
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:23,719
right so and again a a good genetic

836
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:25,429
partner is not going to try to sell you

837
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,558
the gold or platinum service all the

838
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:29,269
time if they can get you the answer at

839
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:32,000
the bronze level right and and so that's

840
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:34,190
why we we started with the single marker

841
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,460
test right so that people could jump in

842
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:40,760
and play around very inexpensively and

843
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:43,519
get to understand and and it's been you

844
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,020
know pretty good for a number of

845
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:46,940
companies that you know so we've had a

846
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:49,940
number of seed companies that in

847
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:51,980
Northern California that spent you know

848
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,960
a few tens of thousand dollars with us

849
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:55,849
you know over the course of two years

850
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,659
and then we had to be quite honest we've

851
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:00,950
never seen them again

852
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:02,088
I sell MTG seed so they probably be

853
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,879
upset if I said their name but I did

854
00:35:02,088 --> 00:35:07,699
anyway they came to us a few years back

855
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,380
we helped them with our high CBD test

856
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:13,358
they came back to the second a following

857
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:16,519
year to do a follow up they established

858
00:35:13,358 --> 00:35:18,259
their their germ plasm for their high C

859
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,309
to B strains we haven't seen them since

860
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:21,470
it's been two years since I've seen

861
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:23,569
anybody from MTG seeds but we were able

862
00:35:21,469 --> 00:35:25,699
to get them to a point where they had a

863
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:27,019
stable population of CBD plants than

864
00:35:25,699 --> 00:35:30,139
where they were used for germ plasm

865
00:35:27,019 --> 00:35:32,119
right so so it doesn't always have to be

866
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:34,019
very expensive but even though it is a

867
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:35,910
fair bit of money of fun

868
00:35:34,019 --> 00:35:37,079
a thousand speeds and 15 bucks a pop

869
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:39,710
even though it would probably closer to

870
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:44,159
like eight or nine bucks a pop right so

871
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:48,059
you know it's still you know ends up

872
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:50,549
becoming a savings down the line because

873
00:35:48,059 --> 00:35:52,679
now think of all the time and money you

874
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:55,440
have saved from not having to do phenyl

875
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:57,449
hunting on thousands of steam so you

876
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:00,150
know it seems to there's no way around

877
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:02,189
it the money has to be spent but that

878
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:04,380
money is almost always recouped and

879
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:06,510
fairly rapidly on the back end when you

880
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:09,210
end up being able to streamline your

881
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:10,710
process sure so you're cutting out the

882
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:13,800
growing process which costs money and

883
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:16,500
labor especially I know even just a

884
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:19,410
couple seasons ago for my father growing

885
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:23,400
some outdoor plants we had you know we

886
00:36:19,409 --> 00:36:25,889
were growing from from seeds and had had

887
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:27,809
a couple males sneaked her that I didn't

888
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:29,759
catch til later on so I grew a lot

889
00:36:27,809 --> 00:36:31,469
bigger than I would have you know I

890
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,150
invested more time and energy and

891
00:36:31,469 --> 00:36:34,919
nutrients into plants I didn't have to

892
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:37,769
and 15 bucks would have been a bargain

893
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,039
at that point in terms of my labor and

894
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:43,909
stuff so well so but here's the

895
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,019
beautiful thing too so so you know

896
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:48,480
stability is this thing that is an

897
00:36:46,019 --> 00:36:53,159
amorphous term in the genic in genetics

898
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,500
in in cannabis right but so if you if

899
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:57,449
you pop these right and as soon as you

900
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:59,130
get to let's say the second node you you

901
00:36:57,449 --> 00:37:02,099
you do a leaf print of one of the leaves

902
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:04,680
you send it in right that you're you're

903
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:06,599
a week in maybe right and so you get two

904
00:37:04,679 --> 00:37:08,849
answers back in less than a week right

905
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,769
or about a week or less right and then

906
00:37:08,849 --> 00:37:11,789
and sometime and it depends on the time

907
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,139
of season right so here's the problem

908
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:15,480
everybody wastes for the last second and

909
00:37:13,139 --> 00:37:16,859
then I get I get like forty thousand

910
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,539
tests dumped on me in two weeks as

911
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:22,320
opposed to you know people starting

912
00:37:18,539 --> 00:37:23,550
early so but you know the turnaround

913
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,690
time is definitely dependent on what

914
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,470
time of the year it is and how many

915
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:29,550
people waited to very late but what ends

916
00:37:28,469 --> 00:37:32,730
up happening is if you do it early

917
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:36,990
enough you actually have time to go back

918
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:40,500
and call right and then even replant new

919
00:37:36,989 --> 00:37:42,719
see so theoretically you should get you

920
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,079
could be able to increase your female

921
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:47,429
population by at least 25% right so

922
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,590
think about

923
00:37:47,429 --> 00:37:51,599
and because you're only two weeks in

924
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,200
most plants in that first two-week

925
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:54,869
period

926
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:56,609
they'll catch up they won't be that far

927
00:37:54,869 --> 00:37:58,920
behind when it comes time to harvest

928
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:02,420
right so especially outdoors you know so

929
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,309
you actually end up increasing your

930
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:07,139
population of females relative to just

931
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:09,989
cracking seeds and not doing this right

932
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:14,489
so that you end up with a higher yield

933
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:18,089
on the front end right you also save all

934
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:19,919
that resource that you know how were

935
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:22,710
four or five six weeks that you you can

936
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,710
figure out it's a male right so you save

937
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:28,409
all those resources right and so now you

938
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:29,970
know you you've you've made some gains

939
00:38:28,409 --> 00:38:32,309
right there alone now here's the

940
00:38:29,969 --> 00:38:34,019
beautiful thing because you can do it so

941
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:35,460
early and if you're not worried about

942
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:38,429
growing four flower but really just

943
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:40,170
breeding now you have a football plant

944
00:38:38,429 --> 00:38:43,319
or a two-foot tall plant you don't need

945
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:45,450
to grow it full you force flower you you

946
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:46,950
pollinate it with your chosen pollen and

947
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:48,779
you start the cycle over again and now

948
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:51,539
you're really only two or three months

949
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:53,580
in so now you go from one generation a

950
00:38:51,539 --> 00:38:56,489
year or maybe two generations a year to

951
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:59,099
five or six generations a year and so

952
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:01,409
now making stable seeds doesn't take ten

953
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:03,509
years it takes two or three years right

954
00:39:01,409 --> 00:39:05,009
so so these are the benefits that people

955
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,960
don't realize that you get with the

956
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,390
ability to follow traits very early on

957
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,789
because you don't the whole plant no you

958
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:14,309
got it right yes it might take away is

959
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:16,889
that even if you're not interested in

960
00:39:14,309 --> 00:39:18,779
breeding necessarily as a grower some of

961
00:39:16,889 --> 00:39:21,319
these tools can still be accessible and

962
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:24,420
beneficial for you down the road

963
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,880
absolutely you know just the time and

964
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:28,920
resource management that you get out of

965
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,360
being able to do this is you know but

966
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:32,220
again this is if you grow from speed

967
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,890
right not everybody grows from speed so

968
00:39:32,219 --> 00:39:37,439
for those who grow from speed this is a

969
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:41,219
very beneficial early entry into

970
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,320
genetics right just sex pest and then if

971
00:39:41,219 --> 00:39:44,849
you're if you're interested in just

972
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:47,580
growing let's say CBD you do sex pest

973
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:50,059
and CBD and you've out of a random bag

974
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:53,250
of seeds and that that's PVD test

975
00:39:50,059 --> 00:39:56,579
identifies you know what your highest

976
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:59,190
THC CBD or the highest CBD THC ratio

977
00:39:56,579 --> 00:40:00,750
will be so now you you've got all this

978
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:04,769
information that you

979
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:07,429
you you would have needed a fairly long

980
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:09,300
time to be able to discern otherwise I

981
00:40:07,429 --> 00:40:10,078
want to I want to talk a little bit

982
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:12,030
about stress

983
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,818
so you mentioned plant stress in terms

984
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:19,890
of water in drought tolerance now as you

985
00:40:17,818 --> 00:40:23,068
know when a plant is stressed it can

986
00:40:19,889 --> 00:40:26,279
change or produce you know higher higher

987
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:27,659
levels of THC and things like that you

988
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:30,300
always hear the story of the person who

989
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:31,920
had their you know I had everything go

990
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,930
wrong with their equipment on a cycle

991
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,750
and grew the you know not not as well

992
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:40,049
yielding but some of the best quality

993
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:41,369
cannabis that they'd ever grown in terms

994
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:44,400
of stress I guess I have two questions

995
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:47,190
one do we have any research that you've

996
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,309
seen around controlling that stress

997
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:52,220
response in in a plant as it has it

998
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:56,068
moves toward seed or move towards

999
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:59,189
senescence and then to in terms of

1000
00:40:56,068 --> 00:41:02,519
stress itself is there any evidence

1001
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:05,519
going from you know successional clones

1002
00:41:02,519 --> 00:41:07,679
that you can see a genetic change over

1003
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:10,739
you know over successive generations

1004
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:15,618
with a large stressor in there at some

1005
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:18,209
point during the plant's life so okay so

1006
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:19,650
let me ask the answer the second

1007
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:22,199
question first and the answer to that is

1008
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,050
yes so epigenetics is a change in the

1009
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:27,179
DNA that is caused by environmental

1010
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:30,390
perturbations typically it occurs by

1011
00:41:27,179 --> 00:41:31,949
methylation of DNA sometimes it's not

1012
00:41:30,389 --> 00:41:34,618
methylation cilinder there are other

1013
00:41:31,949 --> 00:41:37,679
addicts that are at its DNA you know

1014
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:42,838
other other groups methyl is a CH d

1015
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:46,259
group right so and so there in in in

1016
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:48,960
response to environmental stressors you

1017
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:53,700
know things are turned off and/or turned

1018
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,280
on and the stress leaves a discernible

1019
00:41:53,699 --> 00:41:58,318
footprint on the DNA we see that by

1020
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,420
treating the DNA two different ways in

1021
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:02,489
sequencing we take the DNA from the

1022
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:03,900
plant we sequence it straight or we

1023
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,669
treat it with something called bisulfite

1024
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:07,338
and then we acted bisulfite treatment we

1025
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:10,650
sequence it and then because of that

1026
00:42:07,338 --> 00:42:12,960
bisulfite causes certain modified

1027
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:14,670
nucleotides to change and so we can see

1028
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:19,710
where these addicts

1029
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:22,530
added in the DNA based on stress okay so

1030
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:25,230
the answer is yes stressors do affect

1031
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,240
the DNA and-and-and epigenetically they

1032
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,920
are inheritable so you will see the

1033
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:32,579
offspring of those stress plants

1034
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,860
carrying that signature as well and I

1035
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:36,809
think that they've seen it go out as

1036
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:38,700
many as five or six generations in

1037
00:42:36,809 --> 00:42:40,380
plants and sometimes even in mice if you

1038
00:42:38,699 --> 00:42:42,419
stress mice so you get the same thing so

1039
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,789
so and it's so this is phenomenon

1040
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:46,470
epigenetic phenomenon is not just unique

1041
00:42:44,789 --> 00:42:51,480
the plants it happens in all organisms

1042
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:53,159
so getting to the first question so a

1043
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,840
lot of this kind of research is just

1044
00:42:53,159 --> 00:42:57,480
happening remember so we haven't had a

1045
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,550
lot of research dollars for cannabis so

1046
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:02,219
but what I will say is that I was at a

1047
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:04,460
conference just recently it in Colorado

1048
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:07,189
at public Colorado it was the

1049
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:11,909
International cannabis research

1050
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:13,800
organization and so we have some

1051
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:17,549
presentations where somebody went around

1052
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,320
and they were looking at stressors one

1053
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,330
of the stressors was designed to mimic

1054
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,500
like insects eating leaves so they went

1055
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:25,710
away I was a hole punch and a hole

1056
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:27,929
punched the leaves of cannabis different

1057
00:43:25,710 --> 00:43:29,400
amounts of holes on different cannabis

1058
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:30,599
to see whether they could see a

1059
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:34,079
difference in the response and sure

1060
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:37,019
enough they were able to see an increase

1061
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:39,630
in cannabinoid and certain terpene

1062
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:41,219
production right when they when they

1063
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:43,440
punched holes and the more holes they

1064
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,029
punched him the higher the response up

1065
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:46,260
to a level right so it didn't it didn't

1066
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:48,510
double it or anything but you could

1067
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,250
definitely see that there was an

1068
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:52,800
inclusion expression and this increase

1069
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,860
in expression is seen at the

1070
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:58,650
transcription level so the RNA which

1071
00:43:55,860 --> 00:44:03,720
then more RNA usually means more enzyme

1072
00:43:58,650 --> 00:44:06,389
okay so the RNA shot up in response to

1073
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:09,329
this to this nibbling stress the whole

1074
00:44:06,389 --> 00:44:12,239
bunch right at the same conference

1075
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:14,219
people did something similar with you

1076
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:16,379
know drought stress you know over

1077
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:19,109
watering under watering and they found

1078
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:21,030
that you know drought stress does in

1079
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:24,630
fact increase Kanab my production but I

1080
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,580
think maybe I shouldn't say this I don't

1081
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:27,840
remember this 100% but I think they

1082
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:30,480
actually found that Oh

1083
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:33,750
watering had some effect as well I don't

1084
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:35,699
remember what that effect was but yes so

1085
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,909
but the problem is is that you know

1086
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:41,369
there's really no facility that did this

1087
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:43,349
before we we have a few universities

1088
00:44:41,369 --> 00:44:45,179
like in Colorado that are just starting

1089
00:44:43,349 --> 00:44:46,650
to look at some of these things and I've

1090
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:50,489
been getting I've been getting a lot of

1091
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:53,309
questions from from breeders and

1092
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:55,109
cultivators about this and so we have

1093
00:44:53,309 --> 00:44:56,670
actually entered into some you know

1094
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:58,230
collaborative work with some of our

1095
00:44:56,670 --> 00:44:59,309
partners where they're doing these

1096
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:01,019
things and we're looking at the RNA

1097
00:44:59,309 --> 00:45:03,420
analysis and we're giving them you know

1098
00:45:01,019 --> 00:45:05,579
chemical results so it's a very

1099
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:08,010
interesting and and pertinent and timely

1100
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:09,539
question but unfortunately we are at the

1101
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:11,340
very beginning of getting answers to

1102
00:45:09,539 --> 00:45:13,489
that yeah and I want to caution

1103
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:16,110
listeners too there's a lot of

1104
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:17,909
variability associated with this you

1105
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:19,829
know as we start changing a varietal or

1106
00:45:17,909 --> 00:45:21,869
a cultivar or an environment that can

1107
00:45:19,829 --> 00:45:23,849
change the results someone would get and

1108
00:45:21,869 --> 00:45:27,960
also you're opening yourself up to

1109
00:45:23,849 --> 00:45:30,230
greater risk of disease when you when

1110
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:33,900
you stress a plant at any level so

1111
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:36,000
absolutely so so I do not so let me just

1112
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,680
say I do not recommend going around with

1113
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,090
the hole punch and punching holes in the

1114
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,339
leaves in your cannabis plants because

1115
00:45:39,090 --> 00:45:45,210
what you have just done is opened it up

1116
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:47,130
for invasion from bacterial mold and

1117
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,539
potentially even viruses if you're

1118
00:45:47,130 --> 00:45:50,099
growing and this is something else that

1119
00:45:48,539 --> 00:45:52,889
we should denote that is kind of this

1120
00:45:50,099 --> 00:45:54,869
it's in the back of everybody's mind but

1121
00:45:52,889 --> 00:45:57,480
we don't really talk about it because we

1122
00:45:54,869 --> 00:45:59,759
haven't really hit true agronomic

1123
00:45:57,480 --> 00:46:01,559
proportions right so by that I mean

1124
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,430
we're not doing you know tens of

1125
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:08,130
thousands of acres of corn right but but

1126
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:09,599
now that the Hempel is changing and and

1127
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:10,800
and people are being coming more

1128
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:13,559
accepting and this thing was going away

1129
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,620
we will see that we are going to have

1130
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:19,529
loud large outdoor hemp and or cannabis

1131
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:22,319
growth and so then we will have stepped

1132
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:24,630
into a completely other unknown area for

1133
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:27,809
cannabis that has plagued the agronomic

1134
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:30,059
sector for per decade which is you know

1135
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:33,570
you know plant pathogens that are not

1136
00:46:30,059 --> 00:46:35,429
bacterial or or you know fungal there

1137
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:38,370
are all sorts of nasty viruses out there

1138
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:40,019
that love to predate plants right so

1139
00:46:38,369 --> 00:46:41,730
people are starting to ask questions

1140
00:46:40,019 --> 00:46:45,360
about tobacco mosaic virus well

1141
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:49,590
you know and and its close relative can

1142
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:52,890
hunt hemp sunspots virus right so which

1143
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:55,010
is also a mosaic virus and here's

1144
00:46:52,889 --> 00:46:57,750
something that's even more disturbing

1145
00:46:55,010 --> 00:47:00,270
mosaic viruses tobacco mosaic virus

1146
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:02,730
cauliflower mosaic virus cucumber mosaic

1147
00:47:00,269 --> 00:47:04,980
virus etc etc they're all fairly closely

1148
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:08,219
related and it doesn't take long from

1149
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:10,650
one for one type to exist and be

1150
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:13,589
passaged on another plant for that it to

1151
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:18,930
become a temp Russert mosaic virus right

1152
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:21,720
so so as we get to larger and larger

1153
00:47:18,929 --> 00:47:23,279
scales we will start to see all sorts of

1154
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:25,709
things that we haven't even started to

1155
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:29,370
approach yet in this industry yeah have

1156
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,960
you seen anything around powdery mildew

1157
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:34,949
I know there's some companies making

1158
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,869
tests for powdery mildew what what can

1159
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:40,019
you elaborate for people that are

1160
00:47:36,869 --> 00:47:44,339
curious about how to you know how to

1161
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:46,590
protect against that so um so yes so

1162
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,110
powdery mildew again you know disease

1163
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:52,800
resistance in general but powdery mildew

1164
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:56,070
is particularly problematic for us right

1165
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,200
a number of companies and we're

1166
00:47:56,070 --> 00:48:00,150
associated with one pathogen TX we do a

1167
00:47:58,199 --> 00:48:02,339
lot of their development work we we did

1168
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,480
we isolated powdery mildew from a number

1169
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:05,519
of different spins around United States

1170
00:48:03,480 --> 00:48:07,559
and from our labs we sent it out for

1171
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:11,400
sequencing with them and and so we have

1172
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,829
a powdery mildew test that we have that

1173
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:18,269
we make available through pathogen TX

1174
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:19,409
medicinal genomics has one so powdery

1175
00:48:18,269 --> 00:48:23,159
mildew is interesting because it's

1176
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:26,190
actually usually a combination of two or

1177
00:48:23,159 --> 00:48:27,869
more orgasm organisms so but one of them

1178
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,849
is always kind of the same right so

1179
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:32,960
there seems to be one common organism

1180
00:48:29,849 --> 00:48:36,659
and all types of powdery mildew and so

1181
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:38,579
those pests are are out there there are

1182
00:48:36,659 --> 00:48:40,649
fairly accurate I would say that you

1183
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:42,239
know if you get a hit for powdery mildew

1184
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,700
and one of those tests you should you

1185
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,929
should assume you have every mildew you

1186
00:48:44,699 --> 00:48:51,839
know it the test itself is really robust

1187
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:55,199
the way those tests work like with any

1188
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:59,789
other identification test is

1189
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:02,939
um ribosomal RNA which is something this

1190
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:06,000
is like biology 101 ribosomal RNA is

1191
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:08,210
what makes protein oh sorry is that is

1192
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:11,219
part of the structure that makes protein

1193
00:49:08,210 --> 00:49:14,280
okay the thing called the ribosome the

1194
00:49:11,219 --> 00:49:16,679
ribosome you know chugs along the RNA

1195
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,880
transcript and spits out protein so the

1196
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:23,338
thing is is that you know in the

1197
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:25,108
ribosomal RNA of any organism there are

1198
00:49:23,338 --> 00:49:26,789
there is a unique signature that is

1199
00:49:25,108 --> 00:49:29,069
unique to that organism so we've used

1200
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:31,588
the what is called the IITs one of I T

1201
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:35,789
has two regions of ribosomal RNA to be

1202
00:49:31,588 --> 00:49:37,500
able to identify organisms so and so

1203
00:49:35,789 --> 00:49:39,449
it's a very accurate methodology it's

1204
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:42,659
been around for decades and and and

1205
00:49:39,449 --> 00:49:45,088
that's what we used to pull out the DNA

1206
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:46,889
from powdery mildew and identify it so

1207
00:49:45,088 --> 00:49:51,900
that's why I say if you get a hit it's

1208
00:49:46,889 --> 00:49:53,219
probably real but then you know the

1209
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:55,920
question that that's an after-the-fact

1210
00:49:53,219 --> 00:49:58,169
thing right so or it allows you to

1211
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:00,568
actually screen clones if you're buying

1212
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,059
clones getting a powdery mildew test is

1213
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:06,960
a really good idea a really good idea

1214
00:50:03,059 --> 00:50:09,358
because powdery mildew may in fact I

1215
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,710
think you know people some people say it

1216
00:50:09,358 --> 00:50:12,539
does some people say it doesn't but

1217
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,280
probably was the may in fact become

1218
00:50:12,539 --> 00:50:17,009
influenced interstitial which means it

1219
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,690
goes into these cell spaces and even

1220
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:21,599
though you don't see it on the surface

1221
00:50:18,690 --> 00:50:23,639
it may come out later right so so by

1222
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,829
doing the DNA based testing or the

1223
00:50:23,639 --> 00:50:28,980
microbiome testing of a clone you will

1224
00:50:25,829 --> 00:50:32,940
identify if it's been exposed to that

1225
00:50:28,980 --> 00:50:35,099
right so but on the other hand there are

1226
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:37,619
some very simple ways to prevent powdery

1227
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:41,039
mildew right so good ventilation you

1228
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:44,099
know too much humidity and when you

1229
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:45,779
start to see that little white kind of

1230
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:48,300
discoloration on a leaf you hit it with

1231
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,519
peach you know nine point five or higher

1232
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:54,140
water right alkaline water kills it's

1233
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:57,000
dead so so there are ways to actually

1234
00:50:54,139 --> 00:51:00,150
you know prevent it from happening and

1235
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:02,429
there are ways to screen to keep it out

1236
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:03,930
of your grow if you go the clone route

1237
00:51:02,429 --> 00:51:06,088
typically speeds

1238
00:51:03,929 --> 00:51:07,289
you know seeds don't carry powdery

1239
00:51:06,088 --> 00:51:09,250
mildew it's a it's something that

1240
00:51:07,289 --> 00:51:12,670
happens from you know growing

1241
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:15,760
later sure I guess approaching it from a

1242
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:17,590
growing perspective environment does

1243
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:24,460
play a huge role but how much of those

1244
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:27,240
the particular fungal spores or strains

1245
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:29,800
that you're seeing there how are those

1246
00:51:27,239 --> 00:51:32,529
how ubiquitous are those in nature I

1247
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,780
guess is my question so what is the risk

1248
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:36,550
of just airborne spores coming into your

1249
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:38,109
grow or are these specifically being

1250
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:40,269
brought over is it more like a hand

1251
00:51:38,108 --> 00:51:43,630
press it might of the fungal world where

1252
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:46,719
we're passing it on humans or passing it

1253
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:49,480
on plant material wow that's a great

1254
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:50,500
question and you know what I don't have

1255
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,179
an answer for that

1256
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:54,070
cuz I've never thought about it from

1257
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:56,169
that perspective I've never but so I do

1258
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:58,780
know that there are strains that are

1259
00:51:56,170 --> 00:52:01,539
more or less resistant to powdery mildew

1260
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:04,599
right so LA Confidential is one of them

1261
00:52:01,539 --> 00:52:05,590
right where it's extremely extremely

1262
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,320
sensitive caramello

1263
00:52:05,590 --> 00:52:11,470
right so so because of strain or

1264
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:14,230
cultivar genetic there are differences

1265
00:52:11,469 --> 00:52:16,709
in the ability or the susceptibility to

1266
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:20,289
powdery mildew so that much we know

1267
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:22,599
whether or not it is airborne or carried

1268
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:24,039
by insects or other organisms I cannot

1269
00:52:22,599 --> 00:52:25,480
answer but I will be more than happy to

1270
00:52:24,039 --> 00:52:27,699
look that up and get back to you on it

1271
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:29,849
sure well I know like just from as a

1272
00:52:27,699 --> 00:52:31,989
vegetable farmer I know that these

1273
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:34,539
powdery mildew being a catch-all for

1274
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:36,759
anything that produces any fungal strain

1275
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:39,429
that produces that you know white

1276
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:41,200
powdery looking material on a leaf

1277
00:52:39,429 --> 00:52:42,848
surface so you're when you mention that

1278
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,259
it's more than one organism I thought

1279
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:47,050
that was really important for people to

1280
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:48,280
realize and it may be different here in

1281
00:52:47,050 --> 00:52:50,830
Washington state than it is in

1282
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:53,230
California or Maine but my concern is

1283
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:54,608
for example I'm working specifically

1284
00:52:53,230 --> 00:52:56,380
with a grower that's battling powdery

1285
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:57,608
mildew at the moment yes he could go get

1286
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:59,588
one of those tests but we're fairly

1287
00:52:57,608 --> 00:53:01,659
confident that the test is just gonna

1288
00:52:59,588 --> 00:53:03,608
come back as a positive so it's not

1289
00:53:01,659 --> 00:53:05,858
useful because of how much powdery

1290
00:53:03,608 --> 00:53:08,679
mildew he's already battling now he has

1291
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:12,279
plants in that room that are more

1292
00:53:08,679 --> 00:53:13,929
resistant to it but if powdery mildew is

1293
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:18,339
systemic or interstitial as you're

1294
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:20,710
saying then by reusing those plants in

1295
00:53:18,338 --> 00:53:22,420
the room with new genetics is he

1296
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:23,108
potentially contaminating all of his new

1297
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:26,108
genetics

1298
00:53:23,108 --> 00:53:29,078
and just repeating the cycle that's yes

1299
00:53:26,108 --> 00:53:31,538
yeah absolutely no no so that's that

1300
00:53:29,079 --> 00:53:33,880
you're absolutely right so if if it is

1301
00:53:31,539 --> 00:53:37,660
to that and that's why I said so getting

1302
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:42,119
the powdery mildew test you know you

1303
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:45,728
know it is is important right because

1304
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:47,528
you can if you do it on the leaf or bud

1305
00:53:45,728 --> 00:53:51,338
right you're going to see it but if you

1306
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:54,068
if you do let's say a stem you know you

1307
00:53:51,338 --> 00:53:57,940
send a stem a piece of stem or stem

1308
00:53:54,068 --> 00:54:00,728
print in so theoretically that's going

1309
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:03,429
to be more of the internal you know

1310
00:54:00,728 --> 00:54:05,649
biology and if you see it in the leaf

1311
00:54:03,429 --> 00:54:08,708
sorry in a stem you know

1312
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:10,509
section I would say that you know it's

1313
00:54:08,708 --> 00:54:12,909
interstitial if you if you're looking at

1314
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:14,588
flower or leaf it's hard to tell if it's

1315
00:54:12,909 --> 00:54:16,690
interstitial but if you look at the stem

1316
00:54:14,588 --> 00:54:17,739
itself and a lot of these tests that I'm

1317
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,479
talking about you don't have to do it on

1318
00:54:17,739 --> 00:54:20,949
the leaf you don't do it on the blood

1319
00:54:19,478 --> 00:54:24,129
right you can actually do it on any

1320
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:27,248
piece of plant that has DNA so the stem

1321
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:29,170
the root anything right so so if you if

1322
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:31,448
you were to be concerned about whether

1323
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:34,108
it was interstitial or not or just

1324
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:36,579
surface you could send both a leaf and

1325
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:39,130
let's say a stem have them tested

1326
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:40,869
independently and if you get one has it

1327
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:42,519
one doesn't you know you know where you

1328
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:43,959
are and that's kind of why I would say

1329
00:54:42,518 --> 00:54:47,948
it's good to test your clones right

1330
00:54:43,958 --> 00:54:50,588
because clones in general you know at

1331
00:54:47,949 --> 00:54:52,778
that age you're not going to see if you

1332
00:54:50,588 --> 00:54:54,578
if you see it on the clone before you

1333
00:54:52,778 --> 00:54:56,588
guys should buy it right but but you're

1334
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:59,229
not going to see it almost clone so when

1335
00:54:56,588 --> 00:55:01,808
you do it on the clone right what we do

1336
00:54:59,228 --> 00:55:03,578
is we wash the surface right on a clone

1337
00:55:01,809 --> 00:55:05,229
so that you know anything that it would

1338
00:55:03,579 --> 00:55:09,548
have been just surface is gone and then

1339
00:55:05,228 --> 00:55:11,679
we and then we look at you know the you

1340
00:55:09,548 --> 00:55:13,478
know what's left right and so and we

1341
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:14,940
recommend the same thing to to our

1342
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:18,278
customers as well if they're looking to

1343
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:21,130
screen clones you take your clone you

1344
00:55:18,278 --> 00:55:23,170
dip it in a little alkaline water you

1345
00:55:21,130 --> 00:55:25,838
know and then do the leaf print after

1346
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:27,608
that and then the DNA that's inside is

1347
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:29,708
the DNA that's inside and then we can

1348
00:55:27,608 --> 00:55:31,088
tell what's inside though yeah I just

1349
00:55:29,708 --> 00:55:34,929
wonder though in some of these

1350
00:55:31,088 --> 00:55:36,489
environments if because of the amount of

1351
00:55:34,929 --> 00:55:39,940
airborne spores pressure that

1352
00:55:36,489 --> 00:55:43,269
people will get in an area you know like

1353
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:45,159
up here in Washington for example when

1354
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:46,690
we get those baked humidity fluctuations

1355
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:48,190
we're pretty much seeing powdery mildew

1356
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:51,579
you know whether we grow from seed or

1357
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:53,530
from you know growing from clone outdoor

1358
00:55:51,579 --> 00:55:55,929
and indoor without a sealed room I think

1359
00:55:53,530 --> 00:55:58,750
it's something that you're gonna battle

1360
00:55:55,929 --> 00:56:00,368
so I'm just wondering if if there's

1361
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:03,280
gonna be genetic markers for p.m.

1362
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:05,559
resistance here in the near future so oh

1363
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,030
so okay so if that's where you were

1364
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,889
going I'm I completely missed that

1365
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:09,460
question but yes actually so it's

1366
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:11,829
interesting

1367
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:13,119
so a lot of what we know about disease

1368
00:56:11,829 --> 00:56:14,739
resistance actually comes from other

1369
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:18,070
organisms like a rabid offices and

1370
00:56:14,739 --> 00:56:19,868
Brassica so Arabidopsis Dale crest a

1371
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:21,580
little cute little plant that doesn't

1372
00:56:19,869 --> 00:56:23,619
get more than a few inches tall

1373
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:26,380
Brassica is the family that gives us

1374
00:56:23,619 --> 00:56:28,000
things like cauliflower Brussels sprouts

1375
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:29,260
broccoli that kind of thing so we've

1376
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,849
done a lot of work in those organisms

1377
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:32,470
and we've actually gotten a lot of

1378
00:56:30,849 --> 00:56:35,380
disease resistance understanding those

1379
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:36,279
organisms and believe it or not in a

1380
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:37,930
rabid abscess

1381
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:39,970
there's actually there are trichome

1382
00:56:37,929 --> 00:56:42,639
mutations in a rabid OPS's that caused

1383
00:56:39,969 --> 00:56:45,339
powdery mildew resistance right so so

1384
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:48,129
we've actually gone down the path of

1385
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:50,019
looking exactly for those genes and so

1386
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:51,550
when I you know I said we were going to

1387
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:52,030
looking at do these markers and that

1388
00:56:51,550 --> 00:56:55,530
kind of thing

1389
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:59,080
it was just you know stressors right so

1390
00:56:55,530 --> 00:57:00,550
so what we've done is so the genes

1391
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:02,259
involved are called triticum and

1392
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:05,769
glabrous right and there's a few other

1393
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:08,680
ones and so when you look at mutations

1394
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:12,009
and those gains in rabid OPS's they

1395
00:57:08,679 --> 00:57:14,289
cause you know a more or less

1396
00:57:12,010 --> 00:57:15,400
sensitivity to powdery mildew so we've

1397
00:57:14,289 --> 00:57:17,920
actually started to look for the

1398
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:19,420
equivalent genes in cannabis to see

1399
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:21,760
whether or not we can identify those

1400
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:24,579
genes and then start to look at things

1401
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,170
like og cush in LA Confidential which

1402
00:57:24,579 --> 00:57:28,630
seem to be the extremes of powdery

1403
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:31,090
mildew ones more resistant ones more

1404
00:57:28,630 --> 00:57:33,430
susceptible and and and to start to look

1405
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:34,329
at things like that so we can see and

1406
00:57:33,429 --> 00:57:36,219
this gets back to what I was saying

1407
00:57:34,329 --> 00:57:38,289
earlier how you have to go about doing

1408
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:40,719
these genetic analysis you got to take

1409
00:57:38,289 --> 00:57:42,219
one of each to one doesn't give you any

1410
00:57:40,719 --> 00:57:44,079
information you have to have the

1411
00:57:42,219 --> 00:57:46,239
extremes of the system so that you can

1412
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:48,429
find out where they're different and so

1413
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,959
that's where we are right now looking at

1414
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:50,440
different strains that we know have

1415
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:52,599
different

1416
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:54,250
abilities in these various beans that we

1417
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:56,440
know from other plants are involved in

1418
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:58,480
powdery mildew resistant that makes

1419
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:00,670
sense you're still collecting data on it

1420
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:03,130
and you know once you get a thousand

1421
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:05,260
plants that all the growers all said had

1422
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:06,789
you know good powdery mildew resistance

1423
00:58:05,260 --> 00:58:09,180
you'll start to see similarities and

1424
00:58:06,789 --> 00:58:12,159
then you can eventually develop a marker

1425
00:58:09,179 --> 00:58:15,519
exactly but as of right now what we have

1426
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,559
is you know a marker for the organism

1427
00:58:15,519 --> 00:58:20,108
that causes it but we can tell you if

1428
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:21,969
it's there right now we're working on

1429
00:58:20,108 --> 00:58:24,250
trying to tell you how to keep it from

1430
00:58:21,969 --> 00:58:26,500
coming through good breeding and good

1431
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:30,099
genetics yes exactly and with the same

1432
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:32,769
apply to botrytis or bud right yeah so

1433
00:58:30,099 --> 00:58:35,318
so every you know every organism is

1434
00:58:32,769 --> 00:58:37,389
going to have you know based on the

1435
00:58:35,318 --> 00:58:40,409
chemistry of the plant right and well

1436
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:42,940
and some of these things may not be

1437
00:58:40,409 --> 00:58:44,679
specifically you know like a trichome

1438
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:46,000
related it may actually be some of these

1439
00:58:44,679 --> 00:58:47,588
things are related to the chemistry

1440
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,440
itself right so maybe there's a

1441
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:52,568
combination of terpenes that is more

1442
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:56,019
detrimental to bud rot or botrytis than

1443
00:58:52,568 --> 00:58:57,068
others right so and you know but try

1444
00:58:56,019 --> 00:59:01,420
this is interesting because botrytis

1445
00:58:57,068 --> 00:59:05,318
usually comes along with predation from

1446
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:06,490
other things right so caterpillars in

1447
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:08,440
particular when you know and

1448
00:59:06,489 --> 00:59:09,729
caterpillars are eating your your plant

1449
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:11,559
and they poop on your planet then

1450
00:59:09,730 --> 00:59:12,789
wherever they've eaten in poop is where

1451
00:59:11,559 --> 00:59:15,759
you get botrytis right so there's

1452
00:59:12,789 --> 00:59:18,670
definitely either a link to the

1453
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:20,560
caterpillar or there's a link to the

1454
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:24,490
wounding of the caterpillar right that

1455
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:27,759
it has to be worked out but you know and

1456
00:59:24,489 --> 00:59:31,108
but every single one of these stresses

1457
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:33,040
or diseases or pests are will be

1458
00:59:31,108 --> 00:59:35,348
investigated because that's the nature

1459
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,369
of agronomics right we've been all the

1460
00:59:35,349 --> 00:59:39,579
same things and all these other

1461
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:42,068
organisms that's why we have genetically

1462
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:46,720
modified corn and whatnot that is you

1463
00:59:42,068 --> 00:59:48,639
know designed to be able to survive the

1464
00:59:46,719 --> 00:59:49,899
use of certain pesticides so that we can

1465
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:54,190
kill off the insects that are killing

1466
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:55,750
them right so you know and we will we

1467
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,250
will you know obviously I don't think

1468
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:59,650
we'll ever get to that point in cannabis

1469
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,179
because we have a different mindset in

1470
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,130
this industry right we're not like big

1471
01:00:01,179 --> 01:00:03,879
AG we're pesticides you know don't

1472
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,910
matter

1473
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:08,980
um you know but I think you know people

1474
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:10,899
have to understand it's the same kind of

1475
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:12,338
process right it takes time to be able

1476
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:16,619
to work some of these things out because

1477
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:19,568
without being able to find you know a

1478
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:21,880
spectrum to look at genetically there's

1479
01:00:19,568 --> 01:00:23,318
no way to go after some of these markers

1480
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:25,750
and tell you what it is that's causing

1481
01:00:23,318 --> 01:00:27,489
it right so some of this work is kind of

1482
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:28,599
slow some of what we get lucky and it

1483
01:00:27,489 --> 01:00:30,758
falls out because they've done it

1484
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:32,109
already in another plant and then we can

1485
01:00:30,759 --> 01:00:34,389
just take that and it plugs right in

1486
01:00:32,108 --> 01:00:36,548
right but cannabis unfortunately you

1487
01:00:34,389 --> 01:00:38,679
know we get some information but what

1488
01:00:36,548 --> 01:00:41,619
we've found overall is that many of the

1489
01:00:38,679 --> 01:00:44,440
gene families that are present in other

1490
01:00:41,619 --> 01:00:47,430
plants while we find the gene families

1491
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:51,759
in cannabis we find that they are highly

1492
01:00:47,429 --> 01:00:55,808
diverged in some cases so it's a little

1493
01:00:51,759 --> 01:00:57,969
bit slow going but you know but I'd say

1494
01:00:55,809 --> 01:00:59,920
that the low-hanging fruit I'm not sure

1495
01:00:57,969 --> 01:01:02,469
but try to you know I know we have a

1496
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:03,909
marker to identify it but try to but you

1497
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:06,399
know but try this is one of those things

1498
01:01:03,909 --> 01:01:08,078
where until we understand the actual

1499
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,450
root of infection it's hard to come up

1500
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:14,670
with a marker especially because if it

1501
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:18,009
if it's carried by another organism then

1502
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:20,099
then it's something more difficult to

1503
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:22,240
determine what is the resistance right

1504
01:01:20,099 --> 01:01:24,880
because it's not it's not a direct

1505
01:01:22,239 --> 01:01:27,159
one-to-one correlation unlike where

1506
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,950
powdery mildew it was a one-to-one

1507
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:32,048
correlation a defect in the trichome

1508
01:01:29,949 --> 01:01:34,509
caused powdery mildew not to be able to

1509
01:01:32,048 --> 01:01:37,778
to colonize right so that's a one-to-one

1510
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:40,420
correlation that makes sense so as a

1511
01:01:37,778 --> 01:01:43,719
grower what should I get excited about

1512
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:46,809
on if I get a test back from you guys

1513
01:01:43,719 --> 01:01:48,578
like I know I think it was you or one of

1514
01:01:46,809 --> 01:01:50,289
the other people emerald cup on that

1515
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:52,630
panel mentioned that mersin was sort of

1516
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:54,009
the dominant thing you guys were seeing

1517
01:01:52,630 --> 01:01:56,289
on all these and then you start seeing

1518
01:01:54,009 --> 01:01:59,230
some other genetic diversity show up on

1519
01:01:56,289 --> 01:02:02,650
the terpene side you know you discovered

1520
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:04,298
THC v what as a grower what should what

1521
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:07,240
would make my plants stand out and be

1522
01:02:04,298 --> 01:02:12,130
like hey this is something special so

1523
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:14,409
right now you know any plant that's

1524
01:02:12,130 --> 01:02:16,150
making an abundance of a minor

1525
01:02:14,409 --> 01:02:17,250
cannabinoid or making more than the

1526
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:20,070
average minor

1527
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:22,380
eh TV you know it exists at a point you

1528
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:24,510
know 0.5% most places Durbin poison

1529
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:28,559
makes up the 2% that is alright so so

1530
01:02:24,510 --> 01:02:30,900
but that goes with a BBC you know CBG

1531
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:35,039
any of the minor cannabinoids if you

1532
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:36,420
find you know you pop a steam you you

1533
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:41,429
doing chemical tests and something like

1534
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:43,050
that pops up or you find a minor terpene

1535
01:02:41,429 --> 01:02:47,519
that is now very button so so you

1536
01:02:43,050 --> 01:02:49,289
mentioned mercy and Marcin is dominant

1537
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:51,300
in almost two thirds of all cannabis

1538
01:02:49,289 --> 01:02:53,250
strains right so other one-third of

1539
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:56,550
cannabis strains is populated with alpha

1540
01:02:53,250 --> 01:02:59,090
pining dominant limiting dominant

1541
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:04,140
turpentine dominate etc cetera right so

1542
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:06,690
and so but if you find strains that are

1543
01:03:04,139 --> 01:03:11,059
not mercy dominant and then or in one of

1544
01:03:06,690 --> 01:03:13,860
those other you know terpene categories

1545
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:15,659
already you have found something a

1546
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:17,789
little special right like Jack Herer

1547
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:19,769
special for a reason right because it

1548
01:03:17,789 --> 01:03:22,590
does it's a trip pendulum dominant

1549
01:03:19,769 --> 01:03:26,820
strain they're not a lot of them and

1550
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:28,559
then and then you know I guess it really

1551
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:32,400
depends on what the cultivator or

1552
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,099
breeders goal is but you know if if the

1553
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:39,990
goal is to produce better terpenes and

1554
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:42,360
or more cannabinoids that's that's a

1555
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:44,429
very very important thing moving forward

1556
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:46,620
right so we all want you no more

1557
01:03:44,429 --> 01:03:49,169
cannabinoids better yields of the

1558
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:51,750
important compounds from the least

1559
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:54,360
amount of biomass right so looking for

1560
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:57,469
things that increase you know if you

1561
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:00,780
fight if you have a bunch of seeds and

1562
01:03:57,469 --> 01:04:03,419
all of them have a certain amount of

1563
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,220
biomass at week two but you have one

1564
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:08,010
that got like four times the biomass

1565
01:04:05,219 --> 01:04:09,179
right or two times the biomass clearly

1566
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,950
there's a mutation there that is

1567
01:04:09,179 --> 01:04:12,359
increasing the overall vegetative

1568
01:04:10,949 --> 01:04:14,429
production which means that overall

1569
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:15,809
things are working better those are the

1570
01:04:14,429 --> 01:04:17,879
kinds of things that people should be

1571
01:04:15,809 --> 01:04:19,529
interested in if it looks different if

1572
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:20,730
it smells different that's usually a

1573
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:22,290
good indication you have something

1574
01:04:20,730 --> 01:04:24,599
special and that you should pay

1575
01:04:22,289 --> 01:04:27,239
attention to that so I think if it were

1576
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:30,618
me I would be excited for anything that

1577
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:33,528
doesn't look normal right and

1578
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:35,210
and you know be willing to do a little

1579
01:04:33,528 --> 01:04:37,099
chemical or genetic investigation to see

1580
01:04:35,210 --> 01:04:39,199
why it doesn't look normal because you

1581
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,759
don't know you may have the next hot

1582
01:04:39,199 --> 01:04:43,489
thing right which is exactly what

1583
01:04:40,759 --> 01:04:46,099
happened with th TV the guy came in a

1584
01:04:43,489 --> 01:04:48,349
bunch of strains he was looking for CBD

1585
01:04:46,099 --> 01:04:50,809
he did a cross he did a self with

1586
01:04:48,349 --> 01:04:52,338
Harlequin it's for dubs business for

1587
01:04:50,809 --> 01:04:54,739
Doug Zarin he did the stuff of Harlequin

1588
01:04:52,338 --> 01:04:57,199
and then lo and behold a bunch of stuff

1589
01:04:54,739 --> 01:04:59,838
was high CBD and we hit one weird thing

1590
01:04:57,199 --> 01:05:05,149
that was pH D P dominant you know die th

1591
01:04:59,838 --> 01:05:07,699
DB you know and so because he did come

1592
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:10,818
in and say hey I want to know what my

1593
01:05:07,699 --> 01:05:13,248
highest you know my highest you know CVD

1594
01:05:10,818 --> 01:05:15,619
producer is and all these other stuff so

1595
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:17,568
we ran an extended cannabinoid profile

1596
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:20,180
from and and we were shot you're like

1597
01:05:17,568 --> 01:05:22,278
holy crap we've never seen that before

1598
01:05:20,179 --> 01:05:25,940
told him about it and he was off to the

1599
01:05:22,278 --> 01:05:28,789
races though so I think you know it's

1600
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:32,150
important to invest the time and money

1601
01:05:28,789 --> 01:05:34,249
and energy into identifying things that

1602
01:05:32,150 --> 01:05:37,068
don't look like you expect because

1603
01:05:34,248 --> 01:05:38,778
that's where the real diversity and

1604
01:05:37,068 --> 01:05:41,179
innovation is going to come from because

1605
01:05:38,778 --> 01:05:43,849
if we're all growing you know platinum

1606
01:05:41,179 --> 01:05:45,998
cookies gonna look the same right so if

1607
01:05:43,849 --> 01:05:48,318
we're all looking for that perfect bud

1608
01:05:45,998 --> 01:05:51,259
we're going to end up locked into

1609
01:05:48,318 --> 01:05:53,659
genetics that don't change much right so

1610
01:05:51,259 --> 01:05:57,009
it's really those things that are the

1611
01:05:53,659 --> 01:06:00,440
outliers that lead us to new places so

1612
01:05:57,009 --> 01:06:02,389
that's what excites me anyway yeah so we

1613
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:04,869
need growers to to if they do see

1614
01:06:02,389 --> 01:06:07,308
something unique to go ahead and get it

1615
01:06:04,869 --> 01:06:08,979
looked at so that we can preserve those

1616
01:06:07,309 --> 01:06:11,509
genetics over time beyond just

1617
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:13,759
continually pulling cuttings off of a

1618
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:15,769
mother plant and and find out if it

1619
01:06:13,759 --> 01:06:18,889
really is that special outlier like you

1620
01:06:15,768 --> 01:06:21,078
found before that's that's great well

1621
01:06:18,889 --> 01:06:23,598
Reggie you know I feel like I could talk

1622
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:24,079
to you all day but I know you're a busy

1623
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:26,150
man

1624
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:28,670
thank you so much for your time today I

1625
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:30,289
really appreciate it you really kind of

1626
01:06:28,670 --> 01:06:32,389
opened my eyes to a lot of this

1627
01:06:30,289 --> 01:06:33,890
potential of genetic testing and an

1628
01:06:32,389 --> 01:06:35,239
understanding better what the science

1629
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:38,058
looks like behind it so it's not so

1630
01:06:35,239 --> 01:06:40,728
intimidating well you know again

1631
01:06:38,059 --> 01:06:43,880
anything new is tends to be scary right

1632
01:06:40,728 --> 01:06:44,569
and and I completely get you know some

1633
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:47,210
of the criticism

1634
01:06:44,570 --> 01:06:50,600
because you know you know we have been

1635
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:55,510
kind of a shunned society we had to go

1636
01:06:50,599 --> 01:06:58,759
underground and now you know now we have

1637
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:00,590
things that look like big egg being

1638
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:02,630
thrown in our face right and it's like

1639
01:07:00,590 --> 01:07:04,670
well how do I know that this is not

1640
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:07,010
really big big egg and just in disguise

1641
01:07:04,670 --> 01:07:09,889
and it's a very valid point right and

1642
01:07:07,010 --> 01:07:12,560
you know the only thing I can say that

1643
01:07:09,889 --> 01:07:15,289
is you know it's about integrity and

1644
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:17,239
Trust and I think you know and I just

1645
01:07:15,289 --> 01:07:21,409
gave a seminar in Baltimore a couple

1646
01:07:17,239 --> 01:07:23,509
days ago about how laboratories and

1647
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:25,549
producers tend to be at odds with each

1648
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,990
other right and and a lot of times it's

1649
01:07:25,550 --> 01:07:32,000
because of the way regulations are

1650
01:07:26,989 --> 01:07:34,759
written or or you know a lack of

1651
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:37,909
explanation of the process right and so

1652
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,770
you know I would encourage anybody who's

1653
01:07:37,909 --> 01:07:42,710
even you know close to thinking about

1654
01:07:39,769 --> 01:07:44,300
this don't be afraid to call up a lab

1655
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:45,619
and say hey I want to know what happens

1656
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,810
I want to know how you do it I want to

1657
01:07:45,619 --> 01:07:50,960
know how much it cost you know you know

1658
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:53,750
what does it you tell me what I get out

1659
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:55,820
of this they had a good laboratory with

1660
01:07:53,750 --> 01:07:57,050
a good program should be able to answer

1661
01:07:55,820 --> 01:07:59,330
all those questions and if they can't

1662
01:07:57,050 --> 01:08:01,250
then you have your answer that's not the

1663
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:02,420
right laboratory yeah people definitely

1664
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:03,920
do their due diligence around

1665
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:05,150
laboratories - I think that's another

1666
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:06,200
important thing but that would be a

1667
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:10,820
whole nother podcast

1668
01:08:06,199 --> 01:08:12,819
I feel like yeah yeah all right thanks

1669
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:15,440
Reggie have a wonderful rest of your day

01:08:25,909 --> 01:08:29,479
chatted a bit more off air and I found

1676
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,970
the content really interesting so I'm

1677
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:33,919
including it at the end of this podcast

1678
01:08:30,970 --> 01:08:34,909
that was dr. Reggie Gaudi no and you

1679
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,220
were listening to the cannabis

1680
01:08:34,909 --> 01:08:38,930
cultivation in science podcast I'd like

1681
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:40,850
to thank everyone who has supported the

1682

now stay tuned for the bonus track I

1692
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:06,439
didn't have one random question that I

1693
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:08,059
was gonna ask I didn't want to make the

1694
01:09:06,439 --> 01:09:09,619
podcast too long

1695
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:12,230
what's so great about cookies from a

1696
01:09:09,619 --> 01:09:14,029
chemical perspective it's a not fun

1697
01:09:12,229 --> 01:09:17,539
plant to grow it's pretty finicky it's a

1698
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:19,460
low producer um it's a chirping profile

1699
01:09:17,539 --> 01:09:22,220
really you know because it doesn't make

1700
01:09:19,460 --> 01:09:24,890
it doesn't make any more HP than

1701
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:26,600
anything else but it does have it is

1702
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,240
very robust in the stripping production

1703
01:09:26,600 --> 01:09:31,340
cookies tends to be you know 2 to 3%

1704
01:09:29,239 --> 01:09:33,349
chirping content which is pretty good

1705
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:35,600
for most high producing strains these

1706
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:37,310
days a lot of high tasty producing

1707
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:41,539
strains don't really make a lot of

1708
01:09:37,310 --> 01:09:44,840
terpenes but you know but again we get

1709
01:09:41,539 --> 01:09:46,699
into a cultivator thing right because

1710
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,110
I've seen people who grow cookies and

1711
01:09:46,699 --> 01:09:50,329
they bring them in for testing and it's

1712
01:09:48,109 --> 01:09:52,670
got no chirping its dry as bone right so

1713
01:09:50,329 --> 01:09:55,369
so you know there's definitely an art to

1714
01:09:52,670 --> 01:09:59,060
this whole thing about and Cultus amines

1715
01:09:55,369 --> 01:10:02,329
and curing and post-harvest handling is

1716
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:04,820
as important as the growing part and I

1717
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:06,739
think some people new to the industry

1718
01:10:04,819 --> 01:10:08,389
don't understand that right they're like

1719
01:10:06,739 --> 01:10:09,710
oh good I'm just gonna you know I'm

1720
01:10:08,390 --> 01:10:12,560
gonna blast out you know a hundred

1721
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:14,569
thousand square feet but okay great but

1722
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,700
how was your bud gonna come out you know

1723
01:10:14,569 --> 01:10:19,130
on the on the post harvesting side right

1724
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:21,319
so and it's a shame because I've seen

1725
01:10:19,130 --> 01:10:23,270
some really beautiful bud that that had

1726
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:24,529
PhD and not a lot of terpenes and it

1727
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:25,910
didn't get me any higher than something

1728
01:10:24,529 --> 01:10:29,119
that didn't look as good that had a lot

1729
01:10:25,909 --> 01:10:31,729
of terpenes right so so in my opinion

1730
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:33,680
you know cookies is not that great a

1731
01:10:31,729 --> 01:10:37,549
strain it's in you're right it's hard

1732
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:40,610
and here's the thing right so both

1733
01:10:37,550 --> 01:10:42,470
cookie Pham and DJ short right so they

1734
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:46,699
both had a strategy where they went

1735
01:10:42,470 --> 01:10:49,250
after the weirdest-looking [ __ ] or the

1736
01:10:46,699 --> 01:10:52,699
or the spinny key is [ __ ] to go after

1737
01:10:49,250 --> 01:10:54,470
right and and you're right

1738
01:10:52,699 --> 01:10:59,210
so cookies does not grow well especially

1739
01:10:54,470 --> 01:11:01,070
outdoors right so and and here's the the

1740
01:10:59,210 --> 01:11:03,260
the dirty secret about our industry Ted

1741
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:05,689
the majority of things that we find

1742
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:07,760
interesting would be out competed in the

1743
01:11:05,689 --> 01:11:10,269
wild many of the strains that we find

1744
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:12,250
really good would probably

1745
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:15,280
not be very successful in the wild and

1746
01:11:12,250 --> 01:11:18,329
so that we've created is kind of weird

1747
01:11:15,279 --> 01:11:21,670
you know industry where you know

1748
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:25,869
problematic parts to grow and process

1749
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:29,500
things are what we find is our our goal

1750
01:11:25,869 --> 01:11:32,800
but you know you look at things like you

1751
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:34,510
know cookies cookies so blue dream some

1752
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,310
of these strains you're gonna see fields

1753
01:11:34,510 --> 01:11:38,170
and fields and fields of Blues of some

1754
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:41,140
of these strains but things like LA

1755
01:11:38,170 --> 01:11:42,520
Confidential cookies you're not going to

1756
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:44,110
be able to you're not gonna see a

1757
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,580
thousand acre field of that stuff being

1758
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:47,829
grown because it's gonna be really hard

1759
01:11:45,579 --> 01:11:49,510
for them to get quality product like

1760
01:11:47,829 --> 01:11:51,430
that because it doesn't grow without

1761
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:55,930
doors so are you seeing a difference

1762
01:11:51,430 --> 01:11:57,730
across in terms of THC and Turkic

1763
01:11:55,930 --> 01:12:00,610
expression across different methods of

1764
01:11:57,729 --> 01:12:02,559
growing like we're a break promoted of

1765
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:04,229
outdoor living soils and I feel like

1766
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:07,960
we're seeing higher levels of

1767
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:09,789
cannabinoids intervened profiles with

1768
01:12:07,960 --> 01:12:13,210
growers that are switching over are you

1769
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:15,219
seeing that on your end - yeah so we see

1770
01:12:13,210 --> 01:12:19,090
a lot of environmental perturbations the

1771
01:12:15,219 --> 01:12:21,659
data so you know we have we have clients

1772
01:12:19,090 --> 01:12:26,199
who did you know studies would just like

1773
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:29,800
so interestingly enough some of them of

1774
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:32,170
the larger cultivation you know

1775
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,180
companies now are doing a lot of decent

1776
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:35,859
science like so one of them we work with

1777
01:12:34,180 --> 01:12:37,270
came in and said okay we want to

1778
01:12:35,859 --> 01:12:38,710
optimize or grow but we're gonna start

1779
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,300
with light so we want to pick the best

1780
01:12:38,710 --> 01:12:42,189
lights I'm like well you realize that if

1781
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:45,460
you pick the best spice now and you

1782
01:12:42,189 --> 01:12:47,169
change your system later you you you

1783
01:12:45,460 --> 01:12:50,469
know you're growing other methodology

1784
01:12:47,170 --> 01:12:52,659
that you may you you may end up seeing

1785
01:12:50,469 --> 01:12:55,869
that it wasn't the best light I said so

1786
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:58,090
you should be prepared for an iterative

1787
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:59,140
process start with light we find out

1788
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:00,579
with the best light source and they were

1789
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:02,739
looking for something that gave the best

1790
01:13:00,579 --> 01:13:05,649
combination of chirps and cannabinoids

1791
01:13:02,738 --> 01:13:10,149
which happens to be LED plus UV right

1792
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:11,859
they did HPS hpsp plus UV LED LED plus

1793
01:13:10,149 --> 01:13:14,079
UV same genetics for different rooms

1794
01:13:11,859 --> 01:13:16,299
right the only thing I changed was the

1795
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:19,119
light and we got the data back and it

1796
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:23,500
was the LED plus UV gave the best

1797
01:13:19,119 --> 01:13:27,279
overall you know median of both

1798
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:32,800
and cannabinoids right HPS by itself was

1799
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:35,069
highest peak cannabinoids led by itself

1800
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:37,779
was the highest peak terpene right so

1801
01:13:35,069 --> 01:13:39,279
and then so then they took that data the

1802
01:13:37,779 --> 01:13:42,789
led plus UV and now they're going back

1803
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:44,739
into their nutrients right and then and

1804
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:45,729
and living soils so they're doing that

1805
01:13:44,739 --> 01:13:47,139
kind of work now

1806
01:13:45,729 --> 01:13:49,359
but that's a lot of work and a lot of

1807
01:13:47,140 --> 01:13:50,920
money right and so it's only really the

1808
01:13:49,359 --> 01:13:52,569
larger cultivators that are starting to

1809
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:54,789
get into that but we are seeing very

1810
01:13:52,569 --> 01:13:57,309
interesting differences and it is it's

1811
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:59,260
the real thing for sure oh and my head

1812
01:13:57,310 --> 01:14:01,510
too I'm thinking of all the methodology

1813
01:13:59,260 --> 01:14:04,420
challenges and isolating a variable you

1814
01:14:01,510 --> 01:14:07,090
know across cultivars across all these

1815
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,500
other environmental things I could see

1816
01:14:07,090 --> 01:14:09,610
where it would just become a big mess

1817
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:11,739
and you could draw some broad

1818
01:14:09,609 --> 01:14:13,779
conclusions for that facility but it

1819
01:14:11,739 --> 01:14:17,380
would be challenging but that's

1820
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:19,840
interesting so in my opinion and work

1821
01:14:17,380 --> 01:14:22,210
seeing better terpenes and cannabinoids

1822
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:24,069
expression in living soils because of

1823
01:14:22,210 --> 01:14:26,439
those microbial interactions the plant

1824
01:14:24,069 --> 01:14:28,029
in them and the microbe microbes in the

1825
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:29,500
soil are really controlling that and

1826
01:14:28,029 --> 01:14:33,519
that's more than we can do with these

1827
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:35,289
hydroponic nutrients so since you're a

1828
01:14:33,520 --> 01:14:37,060
living saga I'll give you this so we

1829
01:14:35,289 --> 01:14:39,340
haven't published this data yet it's an

1830
01:14:37,060 --> 01:14:41,200
it's in a paper that we're submitting so

1831
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:43,869
I'm gonna swear you to secrecy but so

1832
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:48,489
you will get a kick out of this which is

1833
01:14:43,869 --> 01:14:50,829
that we just did a tureen RNA expression

1834
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:53,079
analysis for a number of different

1835
01:14:50,829 --> 01:14:59,050
plants and so what that allows us to do

1836
01:14:53,079 --> 01:15:01,510
is to look at the abundance of RNA

1837
01:14:59,050 --> 01:15:03,880
produced for different terpenes and we

1838
01:15:01,510 --> 01:15:08,230
did it in a way that we looked at it

1839
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:13,150
from a temporal and a special

1840
01:15:08,229 --> 01:15:18,159
perspective right so we did route shoots

1841
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:20,439
leaves pre flower mid flower and just

1842
01:15:18,159 --> 01:15:23,109
before harvest right and then we took

1843
01:15:20,439 --> 01:15:27,219
the RNA from all of those things right

1844
01:15:23,109 --> 01:15:31,299
and what we saw was that there are about

1845
01:15:27,220 --> 01:15:35,590
ten terpenes that are expressed nowhere

1846
01:15:31,300 --> 01:15:37,329
but the route and it happened it happens

1847
01:15:35,590 --> 01:15:39,310
to be that they're all monitor

1848
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:41,500
with the exception of two which were

1849
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:44,039
specialists there being so basically the

1850
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:47,890
lighter more volatile one so clearly

1851
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:50,529
these ten terpenes are there expressly

1852
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:53,440
for communication with the environment

1853
01:15:50,529 --> 01:15:56,349
right so it is it their job is to

1854
01:15:53,439 --> 01:15:58,629
attract what is good and repelled what

1855
01:15:56,350 --> 01:16:02,350
is bad so you are absolutely right

1856
01:15:58,630 --> 01:16:04,720
living soil is a thing and we we already

1857
01:16:02,350 --> 01:16:07,390
know that there in that there are

1858
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:09,850
chemicals that cannabis makes that is

1859
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:11,980
makes nowhere else but the roots so that

1860
01:16:09,850 --> 01:16:14,620
it must be involved in communication

1861
01:16:11,979 --> 01:16:17,259
with the soil microbiome oh can I have

1862
01:16:14,619 --> 01:16:21,550
you back on to talk about that when you

1863
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:24,610
publish a problem all right I won't I'll

1864
01:16:21,550 --> 01:16:29,020
delete all that after I think so but

1865
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:31,899
that's it you sure you know so we've

1866
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:34,480
shown the preliminary data in a slide

1867
01:16:31,899 --> 01:16:36,250
deck at a conference it was shown at

1868
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:38,319
that at that Colorado conference by just

1869
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:39,970
talking about so technically it has been

1870
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:41,170
released so you actually probably could

1871
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:43,050
talk about you not there if you like

1872
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:47,739
this I could share this with listeners

1873
01:16:43,050 --> 01:16:49,239
yeah okay all right I'll uh I'll edit up

1874
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:50,619
a little bit of this last part of our

1875
01:16:49,239 --> 01:16:52,239
conversation and throw it on as a little

1876
01:16:50,619 --> 01:16:55,510
bonus part I'm sure people will be

1877
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:57,939
really thrilled by that cool all right

1878
01:16:55,510 --> 01:16:58,920
hey thanks Reggie thanks again man I

1879
01:16:57,939 --> 01:17:01,509
really appreciate it

1880
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:05,940
hey no problem it's fun alright have a

1881
01:17:01,510 --> 01:17:05,940
wonderful day you too okay
