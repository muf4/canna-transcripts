1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,839
if you look at your raspberry and you

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:05,080
say I don't know do I have a single crop

3
00:00:03,839 --> 00:00:07,318
or do I have ever bearing all you have

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:10,199
to do is go to Prime canes if the prime

5
00:00:07,318 --> 00:00:12,679
canes are showing flower buds or past

6
00:00:10,199 --> 00:00:15,878
fruit then it's an everbearing if the

7
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:17,920
primes have no flowers or fruit then

8
00:00:15,878 --> 00:00:20,118
it's a single crop so it's pretty easy

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,480
to tell what you've got I just don't mix

10
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:26,000
them very much uh I would rather just

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,839
have one batch of um the ever bearing

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,079
and what I often will do although I

13
00:00:27,839 --> 00:00:31,399
didn't do it this year I didn't have

14
00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:34,719
time I'll often take the everbearing and

15
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:37,558
prune them to the ground in the February

16
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,960
March completely and forgo that summer

17
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:42,199
crop and just look forward to the winter

18
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,039
crop the winter crop the fall crop the

19
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,440
September um October crop so that's one

20
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,079
way of managing is you can just take

21
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,799
them to the ground certainly an easy way

22
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,679
to prune you're just cutting them off a

23
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:54,159
ground level they come up they grow the

24
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:55,399
prime canes they bloom they bear fruit

25
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:58,558
and then the next year you just go and

26
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,558
you cut them to the ground
