welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:22,320
science podcast

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,399
i'm your host tadd hussey of kiss

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,160
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:24,399 --> 00:00:27,679
discuss the cutting edge of growing from

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,439
a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,800
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,679
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,439
knowledge

11
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:35,039

32
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,478
hey suzanne welcome back to the show hey

33
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,559
i'm super excited to be here

34
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:17,920
i love chatting with you and i love all

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,079
your peeps

36
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
yeah no i'm i'm excited too and i think

37
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:25,920
we have some wonderful topics to go over

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,719
for today starting off with talking

39
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,560
about

40
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,640
some new products and innovations that

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,759
have happened in biocontrols

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,519
since the last time you're on the show

43
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,280
yeah there's some really new exciting

44
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,239
things happening and it's not

45
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,560
often that we get new products and bio

46
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:44,640
control because the bio control industry

47
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,879
and right now we're going to talk more

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,399
about macrobio controls

49
00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:50,319
which are your mites insects and

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,280
nematodes they are

51
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:56,639
heavily regulated by the usda you cannot

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:02:00,079
just rear bugs and ship them around

53
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:03,040
so we typically don't get actually

54
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:04,798
new species of beneficials which you

55
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
know we don't have any new beneficials

56
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,360
at this time but what we have is new

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:10,639
technologies

58
00:02:07,359 --> 00:02:13,840
for the current beneficials that we have

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:16,479
and there's this new product um

60
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,400
for applying nematodes which i'm super

61
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:21,119
excited about it's it's still

62
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,000
really really really new it's actually a

63
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,920
product out of

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,039
germany and the manufacturer is a

65
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:28,479
company called

66
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:31,840
e nema don't say that too fast

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:35,199
because you'll say the wrong word um but

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,519
e nema um has been making nematodes in

69
00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,919
germany for quite a long time

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,640
and they were trying to find a new

71
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:45,518
application methods for nematodes

72
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:48,079
right now when we apply nematodes we

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,439
generally drench them or sprint them

74
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,319
across the soil surface and then they

75
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,120
settle into that top portion of the soil

76
00:02:54,318 --> 00:02:58,000
and they're really good right now for

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,878
especially

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,639
fungus gnat larvae western flower thrips

79
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,120
onion thrips pupae which are down in the

80
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,839
soil

81
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,840
which is fine because those are right on

82
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,878
the top of the surface there

83
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,519
the question is how do we manage pests

84
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:14,560
that are

85
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,360
lower in the pot and

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,080
what they have come up with is basically

87
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,760
a slow

88
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,239
release nematode system and actually

89
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,479
when you look at the product it looks

90
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,599
like small tapioca pearls that you've

91
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:29,840
soaked in water

92
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,759
overnight it's these little balls and

93
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,598
they're kind of spongy when you touch

94
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:36,000
them

95
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:36,639
but in each one of these small balls

96
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,919
there's about

97
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:43,199
1600 nematodes and

98
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:45,919
the the idea is you take this product

99
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:46,318
and then you pre-incorporate it into

100
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:49,039
your

101
00:03:46,318 --> 00:03:51,039
media so that then you'll have nematodes

102
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:52,000
completely homogeneously mixed through

103
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,479
your soil

104
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,280
and it can stand up to the soil mixing

105
00:03:54,479 --> 00:03:58,158
process

106
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,280
and then over a series of several weeks

107
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:01,919
you have nematodes

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,039
slowly releasing out all the way through

109
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:04,559
your media

110
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:06,479
so that again you have better

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,519
distribution of nematodes

112
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:11,919
as well as uh

113
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,319
higher numbers in the soil because of

114
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:17,839
the ability to slow release and to come

115
00:04:14,318 --> 00:04:20,959
out of these little pearls

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,758
that they're in and the pearls are

117
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,959
very safe it's not any crazy chemicals

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
that you're going to find they're

119
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,439
basically made of water sunflower oil

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:34,079
there's some calcium chloride emulsifier

121
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:36,719
and there's sodium alginate in there so

122
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:38,719
you know they're all things that

123
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,080
that are not going to be toxic to your

124
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,360
soil and

125
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:46,399
it's a really interesting novel way uh

126
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,520
to apply nematodes again it's brand new

127
00:04:46,399 --> 00:04:50,000
to the market

128
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:50,959
um the distributor for them is going to

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,360
be bio

130
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:54,478
b uh which many people already know

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,240
because bio b

132
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,879
is in a large uh infectory in israel but

133
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,879
they also

134
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,319
sell here into the united states and so

135
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,918
again they're going to be

136
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:05,918
distributing this product

137
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:09,599
yeah i'm looking at it right now on the

138
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:11,759
website here they do like look like

139
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,639
little tapioca pearls

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,360
this would be nice for reasons of if you

141
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,680
had a pot

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,520
with drain holes on the bottom i assume

143
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,759
you're more likely to get any fungus

144
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:23,680
gnat larvae that are

145
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,759
in you know infecting those areas is

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,600
that kind of what you're

147
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,840
you're thinking one of the things i'm

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,879
looking i think it will be interesting

149
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,079
to go back

150
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:36,159
and please do not run out people and say

151
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,599
nematodes control root aphids

152
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,919
in a petri dish we know nematodes can

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,800
get

154
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:43,359
inside of a root aphid but they've never

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,000
worked

156
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,360
in a growing situation where you just

157
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,600
apply nematodes

158
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,879
and the nematodes infect the root aphids

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,720
and control them

160
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:54,478
mainly because your root aphids are too

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,319
deep into the pot because again most

162
00:05:54,478 --> 00:05:57,359
nematode drenches are right on the soil

163
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,360
surface

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,720
i think it will be interesting to look

165
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,400
at if

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,639
incorporating nematodes can help with

167
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,239
suppression

168
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,000
of root aphids i'm not saying it's going

169
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,960
to work but these are the things we have

170
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,519
to trial

171
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:12,959
look at and test and maybe even you know

172
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:16,318
a combo program

173
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:18,719
of an intimal pathogen pre-incorporated

174
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,639
with you know the nematodes to see if we

175
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
can you know go after them for multiple

176
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,879
approaches

177
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,800
so again this is brand new we still have

178
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:29,600
to do a lot of testing

179
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,000
the other thing that i'm interested in

180
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
about this is for the small home grow

181
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,120
because if you um

182
00:06:35,038 --> 00:06:38,879
most nematodes come in larger packaging

183
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,680
and once you open the package you really

184
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,279
have to use

185
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,038
all of it you don't want to store

186
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:46,399
nematodes if these

187
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,839
would come in a cup and could be stored

188
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,598
in the refrigerator for you know a

189
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,359
several week period which from my

190
00:06:49,598 --> 00:06:53,360
understanding from them they can be

191
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,520
you could open your container and again

192
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:57,199
if you only have three or four plants

193
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,719
and you want to apply nematodes to the

194
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,120
soil surface or even

195
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,000
dibble holes in your soil surface drop

196
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,399
some of these in there and

197
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,160
cover them you could do multiple of

198
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:08,239
applications of nematodes

199
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,680
through the crop cycle where

200
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,519
traditionally when you buy the images

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,598
you have to buy them and apply them

202
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,159
and it can get very expensive to buy

203
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:17,120
these large packagings of nematodes and

204
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,520
use them all up

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,840
this way you could do small applications

206
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,959
of them because there is research done

207
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,719
showing that low-dose regular

208
00:07:24,959 --> 00:07:29,198
applications and nematodes work better

209
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:31,280
on fungus nests and coming in

210
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,199
really heavy and then going without an

211
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:36,239
application and going in really heavy

212
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,080
slow low doses are better

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,519
can you back up a moment and talk about

214
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:42,318
uh what

215
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,519
what specific nematodes one would want

216
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
to apply

217
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:46,560
i mean i think you're talking about sf

218
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:49,120
nematodes here but

219
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,319
um if you could kind of explain that and

220
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,918
i'm not even trying to pronounce them

221
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,240
i'll let you handle the pronunciations

222
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:53,598
but

223
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,879
i don't want people to think that like

224
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,079
they can just go online and google

225
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,199
nematodes and think that they're going

226
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,519
to have

227
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,680
you know i know it's specific to a given

228
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:05,198
pest so

229
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:08,079
well and and there is some crossover so

230
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:09,120
the main three nematodes that we work

231
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:12,318
with currently

232
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:14,319
in the u.s are synonymous lta and that's

233
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,520
i mean that's the majority of the market

234
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:19,199
mainly because in

235
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:21,598
research it is shown that performs best

236
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
for fungus net management and for

237
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:28,000
western flower thrips pupa in the soil

238
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,560
there's also a bacteriophora

239
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,958
which um is also used but a much smaller

240
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,120
percent and then carpo capsai

241
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,639
bacteria four is typically used more for

242
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,240
beetle grubs

243
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:42,879
but bacteriophores still can infect

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,278
like fly larva but it's not the best at

245
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,320
it

246
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:48,399
and carpo capsai is used a bit more for

247
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,680
things like cutworms

248
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:55,278
it also can work on flea

249
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:57,519
larvae in the soil outside

250
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:58,958
but that doesn't mean that other

251
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,879
nematodes

252
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,559
there's lots of crossover but the

253
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,120
research basically picks the one that

254
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:05,039
works

255
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,120
the best again it's not like

256
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:09,759
bacteriophorum carpal capsule

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,480
won't do anything for fungus management

258
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:12,799
it's just

259
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,839
celtia's been the best and there really

260
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,559
hasn't

261
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,720
um been a lot of looking at the

262
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:21,278
different species and nematodes

263
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,639
for potential for root aphid because

264
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:24,958
again of the problem

265
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:27,439
rudy says go really deep down on the pot

266
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:29,359
and the nematodes just aren't reaching

267
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,839
down to where the nematodes are when

268
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
they're just top dressed

269
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,200
so this new form of application could

270
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:38,879
potentially

271
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:42,160
if research plays out show better

272
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:43,439
root aphid suppression possibly yes and

273
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,759
i still think i still think you're going

274
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,160
to

275
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,159
need to do it in conjunction with again

276
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:51,199
a microbial product of a very

277
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:51,600
is something along those lines but since

278
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,640
we

279
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,040
don't have you know a magic bullet at

280
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:58,159
this

281
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:59,519
point for root aphids we need to use all

282
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:01,838
the tools possible

283
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
and this may have potential for that

284
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:07,120
again the product is is

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
they just basically launched this

286
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,078
product at the cultivate show

287
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,399
two weeks ago so it's going to be a

288
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:18,159
while before we have some u.s

289
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,639
trials done i do know

290
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:22,319
the research entomologist dr steven

291
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:25,439
authors who's a good friend of mine

292
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,040
who works at bio b is

293
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,079
doing trials with this product

294
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,639
so we should be hearing some stuff later

295
00:10:32,078 --> 00:10:35,838
this year

296
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,958
potentially but i definitely think it's

297
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:40,000
something worth

298
00:10:36,958 --> 00:10:42,000
looking at and testing pricing i am sure

299
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,399
this is going to be more expensive

300
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,519
than just regular conventional nematodes

301
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,879
but

302
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,639
if it's a situation where

303
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:52,078
you can incorporate this and then you

304
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:53,919
don't have to apply again

305
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:56,159
for x amount of weeks where you're

306
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,919
normally applying nematodes weekly

307
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:59,838
it could be a labor cost savings but

308
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,159
that only comes in if you're a larger

309
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,240
grower or in a larger facility

310
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:06,078
again if you're a home grow four or five

311
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,519
plants it's not going to be

312
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:11,199
you know that much of a cost savings

313
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,560
because your labor is not that intensive

314
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,480
yeah i look forward to learning more

315
00:11:12,559 --> 00:11:17,518
about this that's really exciting

316
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:20,000
um yeah oh and and the they

317
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,519
then you both the product i believe

318
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,159
right now is standing in a philty but

319
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,120
they do

320
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:26,719
have the potential to do uh bacteria for

321
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,919
or carpal capsule

322
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:31,839
in this technology too

323
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:34,319
cool cool well i look forward to seeing

324
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,560
uh seeing where that goes here in the us

325
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,920
as it becomes more available

326
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:42,958
yeah me too uh all right so what else

327
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:46,159
is going on in the biocontrol world

328
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,559
so if any of you have spent time with me

329
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:50,719
over the last bajillion years my

330
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:51,599
favorite predatory might of all time is

331
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
persimilis

332
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,278
i love persimilis i if i was a tattoo

333
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
person

334
00:11:55,278 --> 00:11:58,958
i would have a persimmons on me but i'm

335
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,839
a needle weenie so that's not gonna

336
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:02,159
happen

337
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,959
so um that's why i keep telling for

338
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,719
those of you that know

339
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:06,479
kelly vance at beneficial inspector you

340
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,320
know he's got like an insect sleeve

341
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,560
i keep telling him those are my tattoos

342
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,519
on his body because

343
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:15,278
i just well i could too uh i struggled

344
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,799
getting my ears pierced a second time

345
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,559
and now i completely regret it

346
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:20,240
because i'm just such i just don't do

347
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,919
needles but

348
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,680
persimmonless is absolutely amazing for

349
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:25,599
those that aren't familiar

350
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,039
for semelis is a predatory mite it's a

351
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,200
tropical species

352
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:30,799
and what it's known for is feeding on

353
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,200
two-spot spider mite

354
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:34,078
it's really got one job and that's what

355
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
it does

356
00:12:34,078 --> 00:12:39,599
so it's been used really heavily in

357
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:41,278
greenhouse vegetable production through

358
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,519
the decades it's been used

359
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:46,159
very heavily in strawberry production

360
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,000
especially in california

361
00:12:46,159 --> 00:12:50,639
there's a lot of persimmon production in

362
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,919
california for that very reason

363
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,600
to meet the demands of the uh strawberry

364
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:58,319
producers out there

365
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,200
but several decades ago um that's this

366
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,360
was the first

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,200
commercial beneficial i worked with in

368
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,959
the 90s

369
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,639
was persimmonless and using it in

370
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,518
tropical foliage for spider rank

371
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,720
management

372
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,759
it works amazing you put it out

373
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,480
if there's spider mite eggs immatures or

374
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,720
adults

375
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,320
it eats them but if there's no food

376
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:21,120
source they die

377
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,680
so it's kind of a double-edged sword i

378
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,440
don't know if that's

379
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:28,399
uh right but if you are

380
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,680
let's say a landscape kind of person or

381
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,240
a vegetable producer

382
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:33,519
you kind of want your predators to hang

383
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
around

384
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,600
and and have them on the plants if you

385
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,879
are growing

386
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,639
for ornamental purposes you're good with

387
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:45,039
your beneficials dying because

388
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,680
you do not want to send any plants to

389
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:50,639
market with anything moving on them

390
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:52,239
so the palm growers are okay with all

391
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,159
the beneficials dying off

392
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,159
because even though they're beneficial

393
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:58,159
most people cannot determine if

394
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:00,240
something is a beneficial a pest

395
00:13:58,159 --> 00:14:02,078
or indifferent which most things you see

396
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,799
are completely indifferent and benign

397
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:10,078
um to uh from an agricultural context

398
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:10,719
um so you would release them they'd pass

399
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,399
away

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
of starvation because they everything up

401
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,078
so typically on a persimmonless program

402
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,519
you're releasing about every two

403
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:22,799
weeks well bio b in israel

404
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:26,560
um has come up with a new

405
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:27,599
rearing system for them normally how you

406
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:29,759
rear persimilis

407
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,639
is you have to grow a ton of spider

408
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:32,240
mites

409
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
and then once you have a ton of spider

410
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,198
mites then you go sprinkle some

411
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,120
persimmonlus out there

412
00:14:35,198 --> 00:14:39,439
and then the persimilis multiply and

413
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,039
multiply and multiply and then when

414
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,959
your whole population is almost

415
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:44,958
persimilis you harvest them

416
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,958
you put them in bottles if you're a poor

417
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:48,638
spider mite that survived

418
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:50,399
and you're in that bottle with ten

419
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,839
thousand percent list you're not even

420
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,440
going to make it very long because

421
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,600
they're going to eat you up

422
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
and you get the product and then you

423
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,159
release it

424
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,879
what bio-b has discovered is that they

425
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,639
can

426
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:08,240
raise these predatory mites

427
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,120
on essentially

428
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:13,278
the egg of another mite species called

429
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:16,799
carpoglyphus

430
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:18,958
and it can reproduce off of it

431
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:20,399
so basically instead of having to raise

432
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,719
all these spider mice which have to be

433
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:23,120
raised on plant material but

434
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,639
carpalglyphus

435
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,879
they don't have to raise on plant

436
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,639
material they harvest their eggs

437
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:30,399
and then basically the eggs are like

438
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:31,919
little protein bars and they just feed

439
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,679
them to the persimilis

440
00:15:31,919 --> 00:15:36,479
so it's a more efficient way of raising

441
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,719
them

442
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,759
and with that technology what they're

443
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,600
able to do

444
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:45,440
is then take sachets which

445
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,120
sachets that are used for other mite

446
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
systems are very different than these

447
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
i'll

448
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,440
talk about that in a second but they put

449
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,560
these carpal glyphos eggs

450
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,120
or dead mite eggs in a sachet

451
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:59,039
and so basically you've just set up a

452
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:00,959
sachet with a pile of protein bars in

453
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:03,519
there you put some persimilis in there

454
00:16:00,958 --> 00:16:04,319
and then they've got two kinds of

455
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,720
persimilis

456
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:08,079
they have what's called the the speed

457
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,199
release product

458
00:16:08,078 --> 00:16:12,958
which they say um if you just put that

459
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,198
out it just has persimmons in there in

460
00:16:12,958 --> 00:16:15,838
about five days all the persimilis climb

461
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,039
out

462
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:20,320
so basically it's it's a speed speedy

463
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,120
release to get them on

464
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,278
but if you get what they call the uh

465
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,198
with it the brand is percy plus

466
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:28,799
but if you get the classic percy plus

467
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:30,958
sachets

468
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:34,000
right now they think one of those

469
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:36,559
sachets will release about 300 mites

470
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
oh up to about 12 days so you're getting

471
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,679
almost two weeks of release

472
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,320
those of you that are used to working

473
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,479
with cucumaris and swarsky sachet you

474
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,600
know those last four to six weeks

475
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,519
that's because in those you actually

476
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:50,560
have a breeding system you've got

477
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,278
mites in there that are breeding that

478
00:16:50,559 --> 00:16:55,278
are feeding on fungus that's growing on

479
00:16:53,278 --> 00:16:56,240
brands so it's self-sustaining and these

480
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,799
systems

481
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,600
they just put the the dead mite eggs in

482
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:02,240
there and so

483
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,360
there's no mice to be breeding in there

484
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:07,120
so when they run

485
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:08,798
out of the mite eggs

486
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,719
your breeding system's over but it still

487
00:17:08,798 --> 00:17:13,838
can give you two weeks of release

488
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,038
and this can be important for crops

489
00:17:13,838 --> 00:17:18,000
that you do not want carrier on and you

490
00:17:17,038 --> 00:17:20,160
know cannabis is

491
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,838
one um anything that's got those

492
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,079
trichomes you don't want to see that

493
00:17:21,838 --> 00:17:26,159
carrier stuck all over the plant

494
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:27,759
and even you know like a petunia and

495
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,919
calibrachoa crops

496
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:32,400
you know things like that where you have

497
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,600
the heavy trichomes on them and if those

498
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,080
are going to go to retail you don't want

499
00:17:33,599 --> 00:17:39,359
to see carrier sprinkled all over it

500
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:42,720
so this is going to give you that option

501
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:46,639
for that now this persimilis you can buy

502
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,079
in bottle form 2 not just the sachets

503
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,320
but when you open the bottle and you

504
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,319
look in you're gonna be like what

505
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,480
these are persimmonless and if you've

506
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:55,519
attended in my workshops i've said it a

507
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,120
million times

508
00:17:55,519 --> 00:18:02,639
you cannot use color solely as

509
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:04,159
identification because we have different

510
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,000
color morphs

511
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:08,000
insects and mites colors can be slightly

512
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,200
different depending on their food source

513
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,400
and this percy plus when it's reared

514
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,279
on these mite eggs the persimilis are

515
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
clear

516
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,319
they're almost like a milky creamy color

517
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
they are not red

518
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:21,359
and if you ask anybody what colors are

519
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
prosomalis they're going to be like oh

520
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:24,319
they're bright reddish orange

521
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,558
when they're red on this set on this

522
00:18:24,319 --> 00:18:28,240
different diet they look completely

523
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,119
different they're the first time i saw

524
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,679
him it was like

525
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,079
totally freaky um because it's just i'm

526
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:37,280
so not used to seeing persimilis

527
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:39,038
like transparently creamy color

528
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:40,399
what's interesting though is once they

529
00:18:39,038 --> 00:18:43,599
start to feed

530
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:46,080
on spider mites then they'll turn

531
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:47,599
their red colors so there is a little

532
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,720
potential here that these could be a

533
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:50,558
diagnostic

534
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:53,279
scouting tool that if you put out all

535
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:54,798
these clear colored mites

536
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:56,480
and then you start seeing them turning

537
00:18:54,798 --> 00:18:58,480
red they're finding spider mites

538
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,759
somewhere in your crop

539
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:03,279
um so beware that there's a lot you have

540
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,359
to understand about using

541
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,960
the percy plus persimilis over

542
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:09,599
conventional persimmons

543
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,079
the other thing you have to be aware of

544
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:11,839
is

545
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:14,798
when you buy conventional persimilis

546
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:18,319
which again amazing products out there

547
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:20,400
um when you buy them and they're in the

548
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,918
bottle there has been no food in there

549
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,240
when you buy the red traditional

550
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,360
persimilis so when you release them

551
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,440
they are hungry it's like if you know

552
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,839
you were locked in a room for two days

553
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,200
fasting when you get out man you're

554
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:35,599
gonna be ready to eat

555
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,640
so when you release the traditional red

556
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:39,359
persimilis

557
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,559
and i watched this i i'm sure some of

558
00:19:39,359 --> 00:19:43,279
you heard me talk about i

559
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:44,000
over my cove invocation i had for a year

560
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:46,399
sitting at home

561
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,599
i raised a lot of spider mites and when

562
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
i released the traditional red

563
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,279
persimilis on there

564
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,558
man they are right on it because they're

565
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:54,319
so hungry they go

566
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:56,079
right after the different life stages

567
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:58,240
and they just tear up the persimmons

568
00:19:56,079 --> 00:20:00,399
when i release the percy plus they're

569
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,159
like oh yeah look there's spider mites

570
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,600
over there let me just saunter around

571
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,240
and kind of get settled in

572
00:20:03,599 --> 00:20:07,918
because since they've got food in the

573
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,480
bottle and the sachet

574
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,480
they don't come out of the bottle

575
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:15,839
starving

576
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:18,960
so um that's not necessarily a bad thing

577
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,038
because if you have a very very low

578
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
spider-man pressure or you're doing it

579
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,640
as a preventative

580
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,919
if you can release these pre-fed mites

581
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,038
and you're going to be releasing

582
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,480
all life stages in those you're going to

583
00:20:29,038 --> 00:20:32,240
they're going to live longer on your

584
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,679
plant so they can cruise around looking

585
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,480
for mites longer

586
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,919
the red persimmons you get those are all

587
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
adults you're getting

588
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,159
but they're going to be starving so the

589
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,519
way at this point i kind of see it and

590
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,520
and things may change

591
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:47,440
you know as we use them more in growing

592
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,558
facilities but if you have a current

593
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,159
mite problem

594
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:51,759
you've you've suppressed it with a knock

595
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,559
down spray but you still man we've got

596
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:54,240
mice up there

597
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:55,918
i would definitely at this point go with

598
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,038
the more traditional persimilis

599
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,640
but if you're being preventative um and

600
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:03,119
lots of my growers are man they're just

601
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
putting persimmons out every two weeks

602
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:06,959
it's that basically do not have a spider

603
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,080
mite problem this percy plus may be a

604
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,000
better way to go

605
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:13,759
because they're going to live longer on

606
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,119
your plants because of becoming pre-fed

607
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,720
yeah that makes sense um so when you say

608
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,479
doesn't have a problem does that mean

609
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:22,480
they aren't spotting any spider mites in

610
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,038
their grow or they might only see like a

611
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,120
few

612
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:30,400
in a given area like if you

613
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,719
walk around yeah very low pressure

614
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,000
thing is is with my ornamental growers

615
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,839
in florida

616
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,279
there is no such thing almost as low

617
00:21:35,839 --> 00:21:39,119
pressure down there

618
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,038
you know because when you're outside

619
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:44,079
growing you you

620
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:45,279
it's extremely warm you don't have a

621
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:47,439
winter freeze

622
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:49,200
that's where you have just such intense

623
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
pressure you know some of those guys in

624
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,640
florida you know they could be spraying

625
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,480
for spider mites every three days

626
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,840
where they typically are releasing every

627
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,079
two weeks for some of us but

628
00:21:55,839 --> 00:22:00,319
if you're an indoor grow you don't have

629
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:02,240
a history of spider mites

630
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:04,000
you know your pressure is going to be so

631
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,640
much lower

632
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,919
down there or up there or over there

633
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:11,200
wherever you are

634
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:13,200
that this may be a better choice for you

635
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,400
but if you've gotten spider mites into

636
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,240
your facility

637
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
by bringing in cuts or an employee

638
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:21,120
clothing or

639
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,880
you know somebody did something you know

640
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:24,479
um and you've got a problem you know the

641
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
regular persimil is probably the better

642
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,519
way to go

643
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,480
but again talk to me in six months

644
00:22:27,519 --> 00:22:30,319
because this might

645
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,159
change you know that's the one thing

646
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,839
about bio control

647
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,240
stuff i said even three to four years

648
00:22:33,839 --> 00:22:37,279
ago we know more now and it's not true

649
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,440
anymore

650
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:41,038
and you know that's why we've got this

651
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,000
concept we need to keep learning

652
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:44,640
and trialing and testing and and push

653
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,079
ourselves

654
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:48,799
so that we can improve these programs

655
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:50,158
and get smarter

656
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,079
yeah i mean that makes a lot of sense

657
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,000
and i know you have some exciting stuff

658
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:55,759
uh hopefully coming down the line too

659
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,279
that's not quite at

660
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:59,599
this stage you know there's always

661
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:02,000
things innovation happening so that's uh

662
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:05,759
that's wonderful to hear

663
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,679
yeah no it's great to see it here i mean

664
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:09,200
for me i mean well i get excited almost

665
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,440
over any bug thing but

666
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,720
to have like this handful of new stuff

667
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,000
this year it's

668
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,839
it's really exciting um to have new

669
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,119
innovations and new ways to solve

670
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,079
growers problems

671
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,798
um you know so and i'm happy to see

672
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:24,879
because

673
00:23:22,798 --> 00:23:26,639
you know biobee's been very forward

674
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,000
thinking um

675
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,799
and uh they have some really uh cool

676
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,480
products that

677
00:23:30,798 --> 00:23:34,319
and one of the things which i posted

678
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
about on social media if you saw

679
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:39,359
they basically made pokemon cards for

680
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,760
all the bio-control agents

681
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:44,240
which you know i love stuff like that

682
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,679
man

683
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,558
i went at the hemp show man i was right

684
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,559
there and i'll take one

685
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,639
one one one and i snagged myself an

686
00:23:50,558 --> 00:23:54,240
entire deck of them and i was out of

687
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,720
there there was no way

688
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,240
i was not getting a stack of them and i

689
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,759
talked about them at the show

690
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,679
and then bio b got back to me and

691
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:04,480
they're like oh my god after you talk

692
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,960
they said their booth was like rushed

693
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,640
because

694
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,159
everybody was down there trying to get

695
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,240
these cards and they gave

696
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,919
every card away they had and now they're

697
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,839
getting a request for them

698
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,679
but i think it's a great idea because

699
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:17,038
it's a quick reference card

700
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,559
on the beneficials you know quick

701
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,759
temperature how do you release and

702
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:21,519
things you need to know

703
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:23,519
and again it's really cool like in a

704
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:26,000
pokemon format

705
00:24:23,519 --> 00:24:27,599
yeah no that's that's fine i this is

706
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,400
totally off topic but i was just talking

707
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,240
with uh

708
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,519
ben the other day about how all the

709
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,599
stuff that we saved as kids that we

710
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:35,440
thought would be worth something someday

711
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:36,879
uh like baseball cards are not worth

712
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,759
anything and all the stuff that

713
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
no one really saved like pokemon cards i

714
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:42,879
guess

715
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,400
are worth thousands of dollars so go

716
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,760
figure

717
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,400
you never know well i look at it as

718
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:52,158
if it was sold to be a collectible then

719
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,038
nobody played with it and so there's

720
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,960
lots of it

721
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:56,319
if it was sold to be played with and

722
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,480
then the kids all destroyed it

723
00:24:56,319 --> 00:25:01,119
that's what the valuable stuff is

724
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,919
because not many of them exist

725
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,678
very true very true um well i want to

726
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,480
talk about methods of release but is

727
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,919
there any other

728
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,319
like new products or innovation you want

729
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,000
to cover before we get into that

730
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,918
yes and after i told you i would be

731
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,319
short about all this stuff i'm trying to

732
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:17,759
add

733
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:20,798
some kind of that's fine um

734
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,119
so banker plants you know the

735
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,798
this is more of a regular practice and

736
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,119
vegetable and ornamental production

737
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,319
it's slowly creeping in here and there

738
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,158
in cannabis

739
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:31,839
i have not really seen it executed

740
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,440
extremely well in cannabis yet because

741
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:36,558
some states won't even allow

742
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,840
banker plant systems to be used in the

743
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:40,558
growing operations

744
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:41,918
but the idea is as i mentioned before

745
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:42,639
you're releasing all these beneficials

746
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,520
if there's no

747
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,120
food they starve to death and some of

748
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:48,960
the mites things like cucumbers and

749
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:52,158
persimilis they're not that expensive

750
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,120
but when you get into parasitoids um

751
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,880
and these are the tiny little wasps that

752
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:58,639
control aphids

753
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,720
it can get expensive if you have to

754
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
release them over and over and over

755
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,038
again

756
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,320
so there are these programs for using

757
00:26:05,038 --> 00:26:10,480
plants that you grow aphids on

758
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:11,678
and those aphids will not attack the

759
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,120
crop you're growing

760
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,038
but it basically so when you release

761
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:18,079
your parasitoids if they don't find

762
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:20,480
any aphids in your crop you're growing

763
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:21,918
they can go to these banker plants find

764
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,679
loads of aphids

765
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,320
lay their eggs in the aphids there and

766
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
then those eats those parasitoids emerge

767
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:29,678
and then go out so you're actually

768
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:31,278
building a population

769
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:32,640
in your greenhouse and many ornamental

770
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:34,558
growers do this they start these

771
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,200
programs early spring before the aphids

772
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:36,879
even show

773
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:38,480
up and so they're rearing the

774
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
parasitoids in their greenhouses on

775
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,640
these banker plants so when they even do

776
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,679
show up in the spring they've got this

777
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,480
whole army

778
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:48,480
of parasitoids already there waiting the

779
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,839
program that most people know about and

780
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,640
you've been dating my workshops we've

781
00:26:49,839 --> 00:26:52,558
talked about it

782
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
there's a banker plant system for

783
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:57,839
affidavit colemani

784
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,960
colemani is a parasitoid that controls

785
00:26:57,839 --> 00:27:02,158
and i'm going to give you like the air

786
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:04,558
quote smaller aphid species

787
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,000
we know it does green peach aphid really

788
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:08,558
well it does cotton

789
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,480
melanated really well and it absolutely

790
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:13,278
will parasitize

791
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:15,360
the cannabis aphid the fordon cannabis

792
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,159
the one that everybody's having problems

793
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,759
with

794
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:19,760
don't go running out and think this is

795
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,440
the magic silver bullet it is part of a

796
00:27:19,759 --> 00:27:24,720
program

797
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:27,278
its cousin parasitoid affidious

798
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,240
irvine which is physically much larger

799
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:31,759
it controls

800
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,759
larger aphid species like um

801
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:35,038
it does potato aphid it does

802
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,319
phospholipid

803
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,519
it also does the cannabis

804
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,960
aphid and it's interesting that the

805
00:27:41,519 --> 00:27:46,000
cannabis aphid

806
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,000
um when you start looking at

807
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,759
the parasitoids that have been collected

808
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,398
out of it there have been several of

809
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,960
them

810
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:54,319
and luckily three of them are

811
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,600
commercially produced

812
00:27:54,319 --> 00:28:01,119
at this point um

813
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:05,199
so the idea with the new banker plant

814
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:08,000
is you can grow this larger aphid

815
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,640
on it and it's the larger aphid which is

816
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,119
a p

817
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,960
aphid and it is grown on fava beans

818
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,798
so the new banker plant system that's

819
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,079
coming to market raises a phidious

820
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:21,038
irvine

821
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:22,639
on the fava beans with p aphids the one

822
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:25,519
we have been using

823
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,799
is barley with the bird cherry oat aphid

824
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:29,918
and raising afidius

825
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:31,440
colemani so now there's two banker plant

826
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:34,080
systems that allows you to raise

827
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:35,679
two different parasitoids because the

828
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,960
coal money

829
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:39,919
typically is not going to go over and

830
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
parasitize the p

831
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:44,240
aphids and the afib the larger

832
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
parasitoid the irvine is not going to go

833
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,440
over and parasitize your bird cherry

834
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,720
oats necessarily

835
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,120
again there can be a little crossover

836
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,000
but for the most part

837
00:28:51,119 --> 00:28:55,839
the irvine system is still very new this

838
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,720
is the first year am i growers have

839
00:28:55,839 --> 00:28:58,558
tried it

840
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,720
in ornamentals we've had a few

841
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:01,519
challenges first of all the p85s are

842
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,360
super cool

843
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:05,359
because they're giant and they've got

844
00:29:03,359 --> 00:29:06,240
these beautiful long legs i absolutely

845
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,918
love paving

846
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,919
but if you look at them and give them

847
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,399
the side eye they drop off the plant i

848
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
mean

849
00:29:10,398 --> 00:29:14,079
it's i mean you touch the plant they

850
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,080
drop it's a behavioral thing so if you

851
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:19,199
go to move banker plants

852
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:21,278
are the the pieces on the fava beans

853
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,480
and you knock them your aphids are going

854
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,159
to fall off if they're on rolling

855
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,960
benches that get banged your aphids are

856
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,360
going to fall off

857
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
so it's been a bit of a challenge on

858
00:29:27,359 --> 00:29:31,359
keeping aphids

859
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,519
up on the plant also they don't like

860
00:29:31,359 --> 00:29:36,798
extremely warm weather

861
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:38,158
and that can be true for the aphids on

862
00:29:36,798 --> 00:29:40,558
the banker plant for the smaller

863
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,760
parasitoids um but i do think there's

864
00:29:40,558 --> 00:29:44,558
potential there

865
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:46,079
to build up a colony uh build up build

866
00:29:44,558 --> 00:29:49,200
up a bunch of these

867
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:51,839
parasitoids in your cannabis facility

868
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,360
that both will go after cannabis aphid

869
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:54,639
so that's something new i don't know any

870
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,000
cannabis growers

871
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:00,960
testing this yet but um i think

872
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,720
it uh it it's something we're going to

873
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,640
have to look at and see if it's going to

874
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:08,000
work in those systems

875
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,799
so if i'm a grower what am i buying am

876
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,759
i like raising these you know barley

877
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:15,119
plants for example

878
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:18,240
and then buying the aphid

879
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:21,519
the pafid or how did how does this work

880
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,558
okay so for the smaller aphid banker

881
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:26,720
plant system

882
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:28,639
you actually buy it's a it's a

883
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,640
basically a rockwool i think it's rock

884
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,559
wool or oasis you get a cube

885
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
and it's barley's already growing on it

886
00:30:32,558 --> 00:30:37,440
and it's loaded

887
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,919
with bird cherry oat aphids which don't

888
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,600
freak out if some of the bird cherry and

889
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,759
oats get onto your cannabis

890
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:44,879
because they can't live on it but

891
00:30:43,759 --> 00:30:47,038
growers are

892
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,120
not physically going to be able to tell

893
00:30:47,038 --> 00:30:51,359
bird cherry oat aphids apart from rice

894
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:53,519
root aphid they look identical

895
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,798
but birch area days it doesn't live on

896
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:58,000
cannabis and

897
00:30:54,798 --> 00:31:01,278
the root aphids don't live on barley

898
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,480
so um it's it's they they're not moving

899
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:05,278
back and forth

900
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,839
um but you buy the actual plant when it

901
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,359
comes

902
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:12,879
to the larger avid plant banker system

903
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:14,798
basically you buy p aphids by the gram

904
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,640
that are shipped to you and so you have

905
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:19,359
to have your

906
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,759
fava beans or pea plants already growing

907
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:21,599
for

908
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:23,278
when the aphids arrive you just

909
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:26,319
inoculate them on the plant

910
00:31:23,278 --> 00:31:30,720
and they go nuts on those plants for

911
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:32,879
facilities that are open to the outside

912
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,798
um this is another really great thing

913
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
about these david banker plant systems

914
00:31:34,798 --> 00:31:37,839
is it not only does it raise these

915
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,919
parasitoids

916
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,599
it can also provide food for a lot of

917
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,799
your native beneficials

918
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:46,879
that move in we often find

919
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,319
like lacewing larva on these plants we

920
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,799
often find

921
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,240
surfed flies on these plants and that's

922
00:31:50,798 --> 00:31:52,798
just because they've come in from the

923
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,640
outside

924
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:55,918
and are utilizing it as a food source

925
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,320
but that's fine

926
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,320
because it's the immature life stage

927
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:01,918
that's eating the aphids

928
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,519
they're going to pupate there and then

929
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,120
you're going to have a new adult

930
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:06,960
in your facility that can go lay more

931
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,719
eggs

932
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,079
okay so for those listening i confused

933
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,480
the two um

934
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:17,599
so the pafid does not go with the barley

935
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:19,519
uh i said that right the p aphid goes

936
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,319
with a fava bean

937
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,000
or pea plants yeah and the bird cherry

938
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:27,038
odi that goes on the

939
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,398
barley plants great and then

940
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:30,000
once they're smaller aphids the ones

941
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,479
were bigger and since we're talking

942
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,679
about banker plants the other one

943
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,079
is aureus and uh

944
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,120
um purple flash pepper or something

945
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:41,359
similar i realize

946
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:43,199
we're not talking about uh we're talking

947
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,798
about pollen sources at that point

948
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,558
i believe but that would be another

949
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:48,079
potential banker plant to mention for

950
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:48,720
folks if we're talking banker plants do

951
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,000
you want to just

952
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:53,200
spend a minute on that yeah that's

953
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,278
exactly what you said

954
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,440
it's you use a pepper plant to basically

955
00:32:55,278 --> 00:32:58,960
provide pollen for aureus aureus is a

956
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,200
minute pirate bug

957
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:03,200
it's an excellent generalist predator

958
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,038
it's mainly used for thrips management

959
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,480
but also feed on spider mites and other

960
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:09,038
soft bodied insects

961
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,679
in outdoor hemp and hemp and cannabis

962
00:33:09,038 --> 00:33:14,240
production i find it naturally occurring

963
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:15,038
this little insect loves hemp and

964
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,839
cannabis

965
00:33:15,038 --> 00:33:18,398
the problem is indoors when you're in an

966
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:21,678
indoor

967
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:25,038
grow you can release them in there

968
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,559
but you don't have pollen for them

969
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:29,759
really to feed on because they have to

970
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:31,278
have pollen to be able to reproduce

971
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:33,359
you also have to have a minimum of 12

972
00:33:31,278 --> 00:33:36,480
hours of light throw that into

973
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,719
but um the idea is this pepper

974
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,558
plant then provides the pollen for the

975
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,640
aureus

976
00:33:40,558 --> 00:33:44,000
honestly any of my cannabis growers that

977
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:45,919
have tried it i find

978
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,558
the little shriveled pepper plant in the

979
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,480
corner of a bench being neglected

980
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:54,319
um that's the hardest thing is

981
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
either do banker plants or don't you

982
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:56,879
can't half-ass it

983
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,480
you have to commit to it you have to

984
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,240
have somebody in charge of it and

985
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,120
generally they don't get watered and

986
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:03,919
dried up and die

987
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:05,359
i see it all the time so don't half-ass

988
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:07,440
it and say banker plants don't work

989
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:10,719
unless you truly commit to it

990
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,440
um and do it correctly how

991
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:14,878
far away from your crop can they be

992
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,398
would be question number one and then

993
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:18,878
question number two is

994
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:21,199
it sounds like you said in outdoor

995
00:34:18,878 --> 00:34:23,679
situations you don't necessarily need

996
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:25,759
banker plants where would a greenhouse

997
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,800
fall in that

998
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,440
depend greenhouses we are using them in

999
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,119
there

1000
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,800
just to up our pollen because you can

1001
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,720
still get outdoor

1002
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,919
environmental pollen in a greenhouse

1003
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,398
especially

1004
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:39,598
you know if they they the vents open and

1005
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:42,398
things like that

1006
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,760
um but it just it's really going to

1007
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,440
boost their numbers in there because

1008
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,399
we're even using these

1009
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,639
um and i have you've been against some

1010
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:53,679
of my talks metro line of greenhouses

1011
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,200
we're using these peppers alyssum and

1012
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,480
these other banker plants

1013
00:34:55,199 --> 00:35:00,159
outside uh with mum production because

1014
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,880
mums themselves

1015
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:04,399
um when we're growing um at a growing

1016
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,880
facility it's just all green it's all

1017
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:10,079
vegetation and there's no pollen there

1018
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:12,640
and so we're adding these even outdoors

1019
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,680
uh to encourage the aureus to stay more

1020
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,920
locally

1021
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,679
uh to our plants even though pollen can

1022
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,800
blow in from the environment we're

1023
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:21,118
really just

1024
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,960
concentrating at their form so we still

1025
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,160
i mean we even use these banker plants

1026
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,519
outdoors okay you're just not you are

1027
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,039
getting more pollen it sounds like

1028
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:31,838
outdoors so it's not as

1029
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:32,400
absolutely there was a study done

1030
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:36,078
looking

1031
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,440
at swirsky inside of a greenhouse

1032
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,880
and then outdoors on a pepper crop

1033
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,400
and they provided swirsky

1034
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,480
supplemental pollen because you can

1035
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,519
actually buy cattail pollen

1036
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:52,880
from like biobest to supplement feed

1037
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:54,559
what they found is indoors uh in pepper

1038
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
production it made a huge difference you

1039
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,358
really got an increase

1040
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:02,000
in um the numbers of swarsky

1041
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:03,679
and predation on thrips and everything

1042
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,400
outdoors adding the pollen made no

1043
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:06,239
difference

1044
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,039
because there was enough pollen already

1045
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:12,399
just in the environment

1046
00:36:09,039 --> 00:36:16,320
and how far away can these plants be

1047
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:20,320
you know for aureus i guess specifically

1048
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:21,440
well it kind of depends i mean it could

1049
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,280
be pretty far

1050
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,880
the thing you have to look at and think

1051
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,400
about is so when you go

1052
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,160
into ornamental and vegetable

1053
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,559
greenhouses um

1054
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:32,480
they're not giant wind tunnels a lot of

1055
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,159
cannabis facilities it's like going into

1056
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,400
a hurricane it feels like

1057
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:37,279
and so you have to think about insects

1058
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,280
trying to fly

1059
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:40,880
and move around in that i mean the winds

1060
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,079
like that move your pest

1061
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:47,440
amazingly um also but

1062
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:50,240
if you don't have super high winds

1063
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,880
you know if you i mean the aureus can

1064
00:36:50,239 --> 00:36:53,199
travel

1065
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,720
huge distances but if you have a heavy

1066
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,199
wind it's going to be hard for them to

1067
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,598
fly

1068
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,960
upwind so you may need to put more

1069
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:01,519
plants

1070
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,358
at the head of the direction your wind

1071
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:06,400
is coming from

1072
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:09,119
um but you know you're not

1073
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,880
solely relying on these for your control

1074
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,640
they're a supplement to it

1075
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,320
but i would say of all the cannabis

1076
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,199
facilities i've been at the distance is

1077
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,800
not too far

1078
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:19,118
and if you look at again what we're

1079
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,760
doing outside you know we're doing these

1080
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,400
over about i think about 10 acres

1081
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,079
outside

1082
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,079
putting these banker plants and dotting

1083
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,320
them around

1084
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,519
so it's not going to be a flying's not

1085
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,280
going to be an issue

1086
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:35,838
for obsidius colemanian affidavits irvi

1087
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,640
and aureus in a greenhouse they fly far

1088
00:37:35,838 --> 00:37:38,719
enough

1089
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:40,239
trick of grandma who we do not have a

1090
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,078
banker plant system for

1091
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,799
those are the egg parasitoids for

1092
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:46,960
caterpillars they can't fly for [ __ ]

1093
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,839
so you have to do a ton of release

1094
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,039
points for them

1095
00:37:48,838 --> 00:37:51,759
okay i guess i shouldn't have used that

1096
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,800
word

1097
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,920
they can't fly for for for

1098
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,400
whatever you get my point um

1099
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,960
any you said there's no banker plants

1100
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,880
for them

1101
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,000
um so you're just talking about when you

1102
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,280
release them you have to

1103
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,760
have a greater yeah you can't just like

1104
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,119
open a container in the middle of your

1105
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,440
greenhouse and let them fly out

1106
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:15,119
you can kind of do that with like the

1107
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,559
the aphid pairs of toys lots of people

1108
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:18,240
do they just open the bottle set them

1109
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:19,599
out and let them go

1110
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:21,358
you really want to get them as close to

1111
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:23,359
the plants as possible but just

1112
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,400
you know walk out your door and look at

1113
00:38:23,358 --> 00:38:26,960
the landscape

1114
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,920
if parasitoids couldn't fly any kind of

1115
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,679
distance

1116
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:33,280
how are they going to survive you know

1117
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,358
insects have to be able to travel a

1118
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,960
certain distance in order to be able to

1119
00:38:35,358 --> 00:38:40,159
find a food source

1120
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,559
so in the most grows it's not going to

1121
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,159
be

1122
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:44,159
an issue where they're not going to be

1123
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:46,559
able to get around unless you have these

1124
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:50,719
again hurricane hurricane-force winds

1125
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:54,239
pushing them down to one end of the grow

1126
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:56,239
okay uh so any other other products

1127
00:38:54,239 --> 00:38:58,799
innovation things to cover before we get

1128
00:38:56,239 --> 00:39:00,959
into methods of release

1129
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:01,920
um well one thing i do want to mention

1130
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,599
um

1131
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,200
and remember i'm not paid by any of

1132
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,960
these companies you know bug lady

1133
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:08,559
consulting is completely

1134
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:11,280
neutral on all this i'm just bringing

1135
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:13,519
information um but basf

1136
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,200
has released and unfortunately they were

1137
00:39:13,519 --> 00:39:17,199
really going to promote this

1138
00:39:15,199 --> 00:39:18,799
last year but because of cove and it

1139
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:21,919
didn't really get rolled out

1140
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,039
um a bellafur velifer

1141
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,800
is an insecticide that contains bavaria

1142
00:39:25,039 --> 00:39:29,358
bossiana

1143
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,280
where it's a different strain that's in

1144
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,880
than what is in botana guard but tana

1145
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,839
guard contains the gha

1146
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,200
strain the bavaria basiana and velifer

1147
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:40,880
is the ppri

1148
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:43,919
5339 strain so it's a different isolate

1149
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,760
so if you're finding you're using

1150
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:47,838
one bavaria product and you're not

1151
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:50,640
getting the results you expected you may

1152
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:51,759
try a different strain and different

1153
00:39:50,639 --> 00:39:54,000
formulation

1154
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,000
to see if it works better in your

1155
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:59,440
growing system

1156
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,199
um because again you guys all know

1157
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,800
that there's differences between the

1158
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:04,399
cultivars of cannabis

1159
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
you know it's there's differences there

1160
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,720
well it's the same thing too

1161
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,559
with these microbials there's different

1162
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,159
strains that perform differently under

1163
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:13,199
different conditions and target

1164
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:14,559
different pests

1165
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:15,919
and so you have to find the one that

1166
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,920
works for your particular growing

1167
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:20,079
situation

1168
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,960
what's interesting about this product is

1169
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,480
the oil

1170
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,519
it is in has proven to be pretty darn

1171
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,240
safe i haven't had anybody burn plants

1172
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:31,519
with it

1173
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:35,039
except when somebody tank mixed velifer

1174
00:40:31,519 --> 00:40:35,759
with suffolk you cannot mix two oils

1175
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:38,000
together

1176
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,680
you will absolutely burn your plan

1177
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,960
please do not do that

1178
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:44,318
but just straight up velifer as a

1179
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,240
contact product

1180
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:50,480
for foliar things like thrips

1181
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,399
white flies if you use it tank mixed

1182
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,280
with an igr can be really good with

1183
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
aphids

1184
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:57,519
uh and one of my growers has been

1185
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:59,759
looking at it as a drench for root aphid

1186
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,039
and the photos they showed me have been

1187
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,960
pretty impressive

1188
00:41:01,039 --> 00:41:04,239
is this going to be the be-all magical

1189
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,800
answer for rudy aphids

1190
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,399
no but it may work better in your system

1191
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,119
than some of the other products so i

1192
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,160
definitely think

1193
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,800
it's worth looking at and what's

1194
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:16,719
one thing that's really nice too that uh

1195
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,880
casf has done

1196
00:41:16,719 --> 00:41:20,000
is they do have available from them

1197
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,640
compatibility

1198
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,760
with bio control agents so let's say you

1199
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:26,719
are releasing

1200
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,400
you know cucumaris or using persimilis

1201
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:30,239
and you want to spray velifer and you're

1202
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,480
like hey what's this going to do

1203
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:34,719
they actually have a chart available

1204
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,679
that will tell you about compatibility

1205
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:38,399
with it

1206
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:38,719
so which is it's super useful to have

1207
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,400
because

1208
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,719
most pesticide companies don't provide

1209
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,079
that information

1210
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,039
for folks that want to look that up

1211
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,039
velifer is spelled

1212
00:41:47,199 --> 00:41:50,879
r v-e-l-i-f-e-r there's more information

1213
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,599
on the basf side about it

1214
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,640
just want to throw that out there um you

1215
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:57,359
know

1216
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:59,440
you kind of did a perfect segway into

1217
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,799
microbials and one of the things

1218
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,639
i know we want to talk about methods of

1219
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,920
release or i did but

1220
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:06,559
one of the things you wanted to talk

1221
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,000
about was contaminated

1222
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:12,719
non-epa registered microbial products

1223
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,480
so why don't we skip to that topic first

1224
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:18,719
since we're talking about

1225
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:22,240
you know miticides insecticides um

1226
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:24,719
uh from a microbial perspective

1227
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:26,078
so yes maybe i planned that segue there

1228
00:42:24,719 --> 00:42:27,279
for you because i was gonna make you

1229
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:29,039
talk about this

1230
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,079
yeah and you did highlight this but

1231
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,880
before we get in i want to highlight

1232
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,680
this one more time

1233
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,720
so when we talk about you know

1234
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,679
trichoderma

1235
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:38,078
bavaria basiana even mycorrhizal fungi

1236
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:40,399
or

1237
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:43,599
any of these microbial products they're

1238
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,200
very strain specific so you can't

1239
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,440
you can't just say oh i'm going to apply

1240
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:49,919
bulvaria or i'm going to apply

1241
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,119
trichoderma that's not that's not enough

1242
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,240
information

1243
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,559
they're all different from different

1244
00:42:52,239 --> 00:42:56,559
suppliers different growers and so

1245
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:58,000
people need to differentiate and know

1246
00:42:56,559 --> 00:42:59,279
exactly what they're getting and that

1247
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,639
kind of leads into what you're going to

1248
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,079
talk about here so

1249
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:06,159
take it away right so um i've worked a

1250
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:08,160
long time with these microbial products

1251
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:10,318
and when we say microbial

1252
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:11,440
um mostly what we're going to talk about

1253
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:14,880
right now are our

1254
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:18,000
fungal products uh fungus that

1255
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,280
um the entomopathogenic ones are ones

1256
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,440
that kill insects

1257
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,119
so this is what you know i'm mostly

1258
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:24,720
interested in not as much the disease

1259
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:29,200
management ones

1260
00:43:24,719 --> 00:43:32,480
but on in in the united states

1261
00:43:29,199 --> 00:43:35,838
if you make a claim that your

1262
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,318
product controls an insect or might or

1263
00:43:35,838 --> 00:43:39,920
kills

1264
00:43:36,318 --> 00:43:41,199
anything it has to be epa registered

1265
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,280
unless

1266
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:44,960
you're making what i call the salad

1267
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,319
dressing products which

1268
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:51,199
are basically made out of essential oils

1269
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,199
that are on what we call the 25 b list

1270
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,078
those are the non-epa registered

1271
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,118
products so

1272
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:58,800
that means those products aren't

1273
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,720
aren't registered through the government

1274
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:02,000
but with the government figures is how

1275
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:04,399
here's a list of

1276
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,920
inputs if you want to make a product you

1277
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,200
know you're not going to kill yourself

1278
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,280
you're not going to poison the

1279
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:10,719
environment and

1280
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:12,880
are letting people bring products to

1281
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:15,279
market that way that's why when you

1282
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:17,039
get um some products on the market

1283
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,599
you'll see there's no epa registration

1284
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:19,358
number

1285
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:20,800
if you ask them for any trial work they

1286
00:44:19,358 --> 00:44:22,480
really have no data

1287
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,480
my my favorite thing to see is when they

1288
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:25,838
actually spell insect names wrong on

1289
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:30,480
their labels

1290
00:44:25,838 --> 00:44:34,078
you know it's it's a lot of um

1291
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:38,000
unproven products so

1292
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:42,160
what people are trying to do is sell

1293
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:45,039
microbial products not as pesticides

1294
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:46,639
but as either soil inoculum or just not

1295
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,239
cleaning anything so that they

1296
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:50,960
feel i'm not saying this kills insects

1297
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:53,039
wink wink

1298
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,318
nod nod and we're not going to give you

1299
00:44:53,039 --> 00:44:56,400
any directions

1300
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:58,559
then the epa can't say anything's this

1301
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:00,480
we're just going to sell you metarisium

1302
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,559
or we're just going to sell you isaiah

1303
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:04,719
or hercitella or bavaria

1304
00:45:02,559 --> 00:45:06,078
or claim it's a soil inoculum because

1305
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:09,598
the inoculums are

1306
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:10,880
not really being regulated because in

1307
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,000
the past

1308
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,200
we weren't really using um these

1309
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,318
microbial

1310
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:20,159
into a pathogens as soil inoculums

1311
00:45:18,318 --> 00:45:22,480
but now there's research that has comes

1312
00:45:20,159 --> 00:45:24,639
out like with bavaria basiana

1313
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,519
the active ingredient in and the tana

1314
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:29,039
guard

1315
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:32,318
velifer bioceras that there is some

1316
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:35,119
um inoculation to the roots with it

1317
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:37,119
so what people are trying to do is bring

1318
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:39,838
these microbial products to market

1319
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:41,200
and scoot around the epa which i will

1320
00:45:39,838 --> 00:45:43,838
just tell you right now

1321
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:44,559
you are taking you are taking such a

1322
00:45:43,838 --> 00:45:47,679
huge risk

1323
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:49,759
doing that because the epa products are

1324
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,799
highly regulated i mean they test them

1325
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,760
to make sure

1326
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,039
that the purity forecast all this kind

1327
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,640
of stuff and you can get all that

1328
00:45:55,039 --> 00:45:57,679
information from the company if you talk

1329
00:45:56,639 --> 00:46:00,480
to them

1330
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,318
these non-regulated products and where i

1331
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:03,838
keep finding this is i walk into a

1332
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,519
cannabis facility and i'll see just like

1333
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:06,239
a bag laying there and i'm like what's

1334
00:46:05,519 --> 00:46:08,159
that

1335
00:46:06,239 --> 00:46:09,838
and i this one situation the guy's like

1336
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,960
oh well i bought that at a cannabis

1337
00:46:09,838 --> 00:46:13,199
trade show

1338
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:14,639
and it has like something you would

1339
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,399
print at home

1340
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,078
like a shipping label and it just would

1341
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:19,440
say like you know one tablespoon per

1342
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:23,039
gallon

1343
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,720
the product that we collected um

1344
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:28,318
out in oregon at a facility we took it

1345
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:31,439
and the grower had already been sprayed

1346
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:33,838
this spraying it that particular product

1347
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,720
um that he'd already been using in his

1348
00:46:33,838 --> 00:46:36,960
facility

1349
00:46:34,719 --> 00:46:38,719
actually contained a human pathogen in

1350
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:42,000
it um

1351
00:46:38,719 --> 00:46:43,519
and he wasn't aware the other thing

1352
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,838
that's very concerning

1353
00:46:43,519 --> 00:46:48,000
is when you get these products without

1354
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:49,759
any pesticide label they don't tell you

1355
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,159
about a protective equipment

1356
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,040
if you buy again any of the microbial

1357
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:56,719
products the

1358
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:58,239
the bavaria the botanic guard the

1359
00:46:56,719 --> 00:46:59,838
any of those you're gonna have to wear

1360
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,838
respirator because

1361
00:46:59,838 --> 00:47:03,440
even though bavaria is not a human

1362
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:04,559
pathogen you probably shouldn't be

1363
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,559
breathing it

1364
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:08,078
these contain no warnings like that so

1365
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:08,880
the growers don't think they have to

1366
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,200
wear

1367
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,400
proper protective equipment a ppe that's

1368
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:17,598
required on federally regulated labels

1369
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:19,838
and this particular product the pathogen

1370
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:21,680
that was in there was aspergillus

1371
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:25,039
and growers are freaking out all the

1372
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:26,799
time about failing microbial testing

1373
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,079
and aspergillus is one you are

1374
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,280
absolutely fail

1375
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:34,880
for and here it is being sprayed out

1376
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,599
on the plants by this product um i was

1377
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,920
contacted

1378
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,720
last year maybe earlier this year by a

1379
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,519
grower

1380
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:43,439
in vermont who asked me for directions

1381
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,960
on how to use medirisium

1382
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:47,599
metabolism is the active ingredient in

1383
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,519
met52 but they had just purchased

1384
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:52,079
medium and i'm like well what's on the

1385
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:55,280
label and well there is no label

1386
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,720
and so i asked where they got it they

1387
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,160
sent me a website and it's a product

1388
00:47:56,719 --> 00:48:01,279
that was coming out of china

1389
00:47:58,159 --> 00:48:02,078
again not epa registered and all it was

1390
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:05,119
is it just

1391
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:08,000
you know was labeled as medium so

1392
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,720
we sent that off and that particular

1393
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,159
product

1394
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:16,879
um contained a camera was like 15 or

1395
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:19,358
25 different other fungal and bacteria

1396
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:21,119
in that product in addition to the

1397
00:48:19,358 --> 00:48:24,558
metarisium

1398
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,880
and the metarisium that was in there

1399
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:29,280
had an extremely low what they call the

1400
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:32,160
cfu colony forming unit from what they

1401
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,319
claimed was in there so even that little

1402
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:37,519
bit of metarisium in there

1403
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:39,679
less than 25 of it was viable

1404
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,280
so if you're you know here this person

1405
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,838
was just going to spray it

1406
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,559
no protective equipment and didn't even

1407
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:46,480
know how to

1408
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,480
spray it they could have easily if they

1409
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,519
have breed this stuff you know who knows

1410
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:54,079
also are you gonna fail your test

1411
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:54,800
are there plant pathogens in there that

1412
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:58,640
can cause

1413
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:59,599
problems um i was at another facility

1414
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:02,639
recently

1415
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,680
and uh they had ordered medarisium off

1416
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,838
of alibaba

1417
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,679
um i those two samples are getting

1418
00:49:05,838 --> 00:49:10,159
tested right now

1419
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:12,480
and i've also been ordering samples from

1420
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:15,838
other companies

1421
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:16,480
that basically won't make any pesticidal

1422
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,599
claims

1423
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:22,960
but they're selling like bavaria basiana

1424
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,838
and again they're trying to scoot around

1425
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,400
getting the ep

1426
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:27,279
registered where the stuff again has to

1427
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,119
be looked at

1428
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,960
because there's such an appetite in the

1429
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,280
cannabis industry for these products

1430
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:34,079
and i think all these growers that have

1431
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:36,480
bought this up

1432
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:37,920
do not realize the risk they're taking

1433
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,519
with buying these products

1434
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,000
because they really don't understand

1435
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:45,039
that really this stuff needs to be epa

1436
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:49,280
registered unless it truly is

1437
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:52,159
a soil inoculum and is not being applied

1438
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,200
for use for insect management but

1439
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,879
typically

1440
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:59,919
soil inoculum rates are way lower

1441
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,358
than the insecticidal killing rates for

1442
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,079
these entire pathogens

1443
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:04,719
so even if you buy a legit inoculum and

1444
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,920
spray it

1445
00:50:04,719 --> 00:50:07,439
thinking it's going to work with

1446
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:08,639
insecticidal the rates are going to be

1447
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:12,159
too low

1448
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:13,838
really to get what you need for it to do

1449
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,519
it's super scary to me because i'm

1450
00:50:13,838 --> 00:50:18,639
really concerned someone's getting up

1451
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:19,599
really sick from this so please please

1452
00:50:18,639 --> 00:50:21,279
please

1453
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:23,200
when you're going to buy any of these

1454
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:27,040
microbial products

1455
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:29,039
bavaria isaria i know medarism is nearly

1456
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:31,199
impossible to get unless you're ordering

1457
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:31,759
it from china through like alibaba or

1458
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,318
stuff

1459
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:35,359
you know just i wouldn't do it think

1460
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:38,800
about the risk

1461
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:41,039
um if you do it send the product off to

1462
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,200
a lab to have it tested

1463
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:44,079
i'm going to make a social media post to

1464
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:47,279
show you guys

1465
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:50,800
the plates that came back

1466
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,880
from this medium product being plated

1467
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:54,079
it looks like a four-year-old sneezed on

1468
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,318
the plate and all

1469
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:59,359
the different stuff growing on the leafs

1470
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:02,800
on the auger surface it's disgusting

1471
00:50:59,358 --> 00:51:02,799
no product should look like that

1472
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:07,439
those are all really good points one

1473
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,240
other thing i want to bring up too

1474
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,960
is the risk of heavy metals you don't

1475
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,799
know what

1476
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,880
form of carrier they may be using on

1477
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:16,480
there that could also lead to having

1478
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,079
creating issues down the road we don't

1479
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,400
know if there's any carcinogens involved

1480
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,119
i mean i understand why people want to

1481
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,920
skirt

1482
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,400
these epa regulations because they're

1483
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:29,599
really

1484
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,280
really difficult it's very hard to get a

1485
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:33,599
product epa registered and that's why

1486
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,079
the 25b list is so convenient for a lot

1487
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,400
of companies um

1488
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:39,119
on the you know on that side of things

1489
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,880
but

1490
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:42,318
you know you don't get the level of

1491
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,880
research to know

1492
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:45,838
um or the level of regulation so you

1493
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,119
don't even you don't know if the

1494
00:51:45,838 --> 00:51:47,838
product's gonna be as effective as

1495
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,200
they're claiming

1496
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:51,039
and then you don't know if the product

1497
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:52,799
is as safe as they're claiming

1498
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,400
because even with some of these 25b

1499
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:55,760
products i'm not convinced

1500
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,519
that they're things that are totally

1501
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:59,280
safe i mean time oil

1502
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,199
for example and some of these other ones

1503
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,119
i think still have

1504
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,480
can be applied at concentrations that i

1505
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,280
wouldn't want to be

1506
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:08,960
you know breathing or around necessarily

1507
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,000
um

1508
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,480
and then when we talk about these

1509
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,960
microbials uh you know

1510
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,719
you're trusting the company and i don't

1511
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,760
and that company may be trusting another

1512
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:19,039
company

1513
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,800
and at the end of the day it's something

1514
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:23,358
that i just think i agree with you the

1515
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,960
risk is is way too high go with an epa

1516
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:26,880
registered microbial product

1517
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
if you're going to use it especially if

1518
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:32,640
it has pesticidal

1519
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:35,759
effects and if you

1520
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,000
you know people are all like you know

1521
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
don't want government regulation if this

1522
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,440
doesn't prove to you

1523
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,880
why we need government regulation over

1524
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:45,200
these products i don't know what will

1525
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,240
convince people because this is exactly

1526
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,960
why because again you someone could

1527
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,879
potentially

1528
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:52,960
die from one of these products because

1529
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,599
you don't know what's in it and that's

1530
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:56,000
why

1531
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:58,160
i mean you could say buyer beware but

1532
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:01,039
this is why we have the epa

1533
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:03,279
is to stop bad products like these from

1534
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:05,119
being sold because

1535
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,440
again this this whole industry has

1536
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:08,160
sprung up basically because the cannabis

1537
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,679
industry i do

1538
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:11,279
not find any of these products in

1539
00:53:09,679 --> 00:53:12,558
ornamental or vegetable production and

1540
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,319
never have in past

1541
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:15,599
but in the last two to three years this

1542
00:53:14,318 --> 00:53:18,880
has exploded

1543
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:20,000
in the cannabis industry if you are

1544
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:23,039
going to buy

1545
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:26,239
medium isaiah

1546
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:28,318
bavaria you want to make sure the

1547
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:31,358
product has an epa registration number

1548
00:53:28,318 --> 00:53:33,039
it has a true label on it that

1549
00:53:31,358 --> 00:53:34,719
tells you the protective equipment you

1550
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,039
need to be wearing

1551
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:39,598
um it should tell you you know when you

1552
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:43,759
apply this product how long before

1553
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:45,359
you can go back in i'm finding

1554
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,839
the cannabis industry you're not reading

1555
00:53:45,358 --> 00:53:51,199
pesticide labels i was a at a facility

1556
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:54,400
not too long ago that they were applying

1557
00:53:51,199 --> 00:53:56,159
bt uh israelians

1558
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:58,400
for flight management everybody knows

1559
00:53:56,159 --> 00:53:59,679
about that the problem was the product

1560
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,440
they were using

1561
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,960
and they were drenching their indoor

1562
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:06,639
plants with is

1563
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,679
for outdoor use for ponds

1564
00:54:06,639 --> 00:54:11,118
it was a completely wrong label no one

1565
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,239
had taken the time to actually read the

1566
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,559
label to see

1567
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:15,598
one where we're applying this is it on

1568
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:17,760
the label

1569
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,519
and you cannot use outdoor products

1570
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:20,720
indoor just like some indoor products

1571
00:54:19,519 --> 00:54:23,039
you cannot use outdoor

1572
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,558
because the inerts are different this

1573
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:28,159
was not designed

1574
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:30,000
to be drenched on plant material also

1575
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:31,519
the pests fungus masks weren't even on

1576
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:33,440
the label anywhere

1577
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:34,719
for what they were doing and it's just

1578
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:37,838
completely the wrong

1579
00:54:34,719 --> 00:54:38,798
label and this is a legit legal license

1580
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:41,599
to grow

1581
00:54:38,798 --> 00:54:42,480
but people aren't understanding

1582
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,079
pesticides

1583
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:48,639
and how to use them properly you guys

1584
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:50,160
don't want to be the one that the epa

1585
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:51,598
makes an example out of because it's

1586
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:54,078
going to happen because

1587
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,838
the you know ornamental and vegetable

1588
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:57,599
production facilities and even canvas

1589
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,440
facilities are inspected and you don't

1590
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,640
want to be the people that are using

1591
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,559
the wrong illegal stuff in your facility

1592
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,679
so read those labels

1593
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:09,839
make sure that you know

1594
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:11,199
it's epa registered and also you should

1595
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:13,358
be able if you have a question

1596
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:15,598
pick up the phone and call somebody any

1597
00:55:13,358 --> 00:55:16,318
of this microbial weirdo stuff from

1598
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:17,359
online

1599
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:18,960
you're not going to be able to reach

1600
00:55:17,358 --> 00:55:20,239
anybody that can give you good solid

1601
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:23,920
information like

1602
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:25,519
biosafe bioworks bsf any of those guys

1603
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:27,200
you can always reach people there

1604
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:29,119
to answer your technical questions about

1605
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:31,199
these products and how to be safe about

1606
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:33,440
applying them

1607
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:36,159
and just a friendly reminder there's a

1608
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,039
different bt for

1609
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,159
caterpillars than there is for fungus

1610
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:41,679
gnats so

1611
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:43,199
make sure you're looking at that when

1612
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:46,159
you're buying your uh

1613
00:55:43,199 --> 00:55:47,279
bt and there's actually two different

1614
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,118
caterpillar streams

1615
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,960
oh okay well there you go there's a

1616
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,798
zowie and kerstaki

1617
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:54,400
and there's also a strain for japanese

1618
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:55,599
beetles there's a bunch of different

1619
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,280
strains of

1620
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:58,720
bacillus thuringiensis floating around

1621
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,280
you have to make sure lock and key

1622
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:01,199
system

1623
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:02,480
you got to get the right one for your

1624
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:04,000
past

1625
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:07,599
which leads you back to starting with

1626
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:10,159
identification as the very first step in

1627
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,650
any of this uh just a friendly reminder

1628
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:13,199
on that

1629
00:56:11,650 --> 00:56:15,280
[Music]

1630
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:16,480
i listen when you talk suzanne i pick up

1631
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,720
things it takes me a little while but

1632
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,199
i'll get there

1633
00:56:18,719 --> 00:56:22,078
well i mean anybody i mean besides

1634
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,039
knowing

1635
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:25,760
i love harry potter bugs and star trek

1636
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,199
id

1637
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,040
is probably one of the most important

1638
00:56:27,199 --> 00:56:32,639
things i've preached in

1639
00:56:29,039 --> 00:56:34,639
my life you have got to id what your

1640
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:38,000
problem is before you treat

1641
00:56:34,639 --> 00:56:40,000
you have to yeah and i know i've tried

1642
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:41,838
to send you photos of things like aphids

1643
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,358
in the past and you're like i need a

1644
00:56:41,838 --> 00:56:44,798
better photo i need to really see those

1645
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:46,639
genitals like you really

1646
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:48,798
dive in because you can't necessarily

1647
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:49,598
tell things apart without you know very

1648
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:52,880
specific

1649
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:54,000
key indicators and that's why i guess i

1650
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:55,599
just realized more and more how

1651
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,119
complicated it is to get the right

1652
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:58,079
identification because you've already

1653
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:59,760
talked about how

1654
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,079
you know there's different parasitoids

1655
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:05,599
for different different aphids

1656
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:09,599
it's not a it's not as simple as

1657
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:11,039
a one-size-fits-all with a program

1658
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:13,119
no and i'm going to tell you right now

1659
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:14,400
cannabis growers if there is a mite in

1660
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,079
your soil

1661
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:20,160
it is not australolapse schematist

1662
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:22,160
every might picture that is getting put

1663
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:23,199
on social media everybody's like oh it's

1664
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,519
stressed it's strep

1665
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:27,199
no it's not if you put out a bunch of

1666
00:57:25,519 --> 00:57:28,960
strats and you had a ton of food for

1667
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:32,480
them yeah possibly

1668
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,838
with any living soil with any compost

1669
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,159
anything like that

1670
00:57:33,838 --> 00:57:38,639
you're going to get decomposers in there

1671
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,798
that's living soil living soil has

1672
00:57:38,639 --> 00:57:41,759
living things in it you're gonna see

1673
00:57:40,798 --> 00:57:44,000
mites in there

1674
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:45,839
and they're helping decompose things and

1675
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,039
it's not a black and white you know is

1676
00:57:45,838 --> 00:57:48,719
that my good or bad

1677
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,920
there's a lot of them that are you know

1678
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,199
indifferent they're just living in the

1679
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,639
soil they're not hurting the plant

1680
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,639
they're not predatory

1681
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,719
and there's tons of them in there that

1682
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:58,879
do that and you cannot

1683
00:57:56,719 --> 00:58:00,399
just take a picture with your cell phone

1684
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,798
and post it on facebook

1685
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:04,240
and expect someone to id there is nobody

1686
00:58:02,798 --> 00:58:08,000
that can do that on this

1687
00:58:04,239 --> 00:58:10,239
planet mites are really hard to id

1688
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,639
let alone soil dwelling mites where

1689
00:58:10,239 --> 00:58:15,759
there hasn't been a ton of research done

1690
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:17,440
let alone cell phone images anytime

1691
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,880
you know i'm working with my id most the

1692
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,960
time i have to send stuff off and the

1693
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,960
stuff has to be slide mounted

1694
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,039
you've got to look at all those details

1695
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:29,039
on there so

1696
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:31,599
you know it's very complicated

1697
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:32,480
that's all i can say and facebook is not

1698
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:35,200
going to give you id

1699
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,480
answers on that stuff so maybe the short

1700
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,399
answer is if you see a might

1701
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,079
uh on your soil you don't need to

1702
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,280
necessarily freak out unless you're

1703
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:43,200
starting to see

1704
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,200
excessive amounts of them where their

1705
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:47,439
populations are just exploding or if

1706
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:50,879
you're seeing plant damage

1707
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,000
i i so when it comes to soil mites and

1708
00:58:50,880 --> 00:58:55,680
cannabis

1709
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:58,639
and so far i nor anybody else

1710
00:58:55,679 --> 00:59:00,639
that is a trained entomologist have seen

1711
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:02,000
bulb mites in cannabis even though again

1712
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:02,639
people are seeing their bald mites in

1713
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:06,079
there

1714
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:08,639
um bulb bites in bulb crops

1715
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,119
can be a problem but any soil dwelling

1716
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:11,199
might

1717
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,640
i haven't seen cause any economic

1718
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,838
problems in cannabis

1719
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:16,719
now you could have root disease and you

1720
00:59:15,838 --> 00:59:19,599
don't realize it

1721
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:20,239
and then these secondary mites move in

1722
00:59:19,599 --> 00:59:22,318
that are

1723
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:24,159
eating your dead decaying roots and

1724
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:26,480
people think they're the primary

1725
00:59:24,159 --> 00:59:28,639
they're just a secondary showing up and

1726
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,119
taking advantage of decaying plant

1727
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:31,358
matter

1728
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,160
where normally it's a pathogen that's

1729
00:59:31,358 --> 00:59:34,159
the initial

1730
00:59:32,159 --> 00:59:36,639
problem and that can be very hard to

1731
00:59:34,159 --> 00:59:39,279
tease that all apart

1732
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:41,118
but i haven't seen any mites in cannabis

1733
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:44,559
production to this day

1734
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:47,838
in the soil that have caused any

1735
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:47,839
economic loss in cannabis

1736
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,798
i think that's that's good information

1737
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:55,599
yeah thank you for sharing that

1738
00:59:52,798 --> 00:59:57,519
um you're very welcome the ones that i i

1739
00:59:55,599 --> 01:00:00,559
see the most of in living soils

1740
00:59:57,519 --> 01:00:02,960
would be the um

1741
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:04,160
uh it's isopods i believe and then

1742
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:06,000
springtails where i see

1743
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:07,519
explosions of populations those are the

1744
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:08,559
two things i've had people reach out to

1745
01:00:07,519 --> 01:00:11,440
me with

1746
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,798
um where they just see massive massive

1747
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:14,480
amounts of growth i don't know if you

1748
01:00:12,798 --> 01:00:16,559
want to touch on either of those

1749
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:18,159
since we're talking well the interesting

1750
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:20,720
thing about springtails

1751
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:22,159
is it's not one species they're multiple

1752
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:24,719
species so

1753
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,719
if you're an aetherium grower in europe

1754
01:00:24,719 --> 01:00:27,679
springtails can be a pest and feed on

1755
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:30,719
your roots there

1756
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:34,480
and actually um there have been

1757
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:36,558
some agricultural losses of seedlings

1758
01:00:34,480 --> 01:00:38,798
out in the field terminal which crop it

1759
01:00:36,559 --> 01:00:39,680
was again from springtails feeding on

1760
01:00:38,798 --> 01:00:42,400
those

1761
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:43,440
but that's not what we're seeing in

1762
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:45,519
cannabis

1763
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,559
and again there's multiple species of

1764
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,838
springtails

1765
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:52,960
so yes can springtails be a pest

1766
01:00:49,838 --> 01:00:55,599
yes but have we seen them be of

1767
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,639
a problem in cannabis to cause economic

1768
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:58,640
damage

1769
01:00:56,639 --> 01:01:01,519
no that's why you have to be very

1770
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:04,000
specific about your information

1771
01:01:01,519 --> 01:01:06,159
um knowing the crop where you're located

1772
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,079
all these different kinds of things

1773
01:01:06,159 --> 01:01:10,078
i have not gotten into springtail

1774
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:11,519
identification good lord that's a whole

1775
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:13,599
nother

1776
01:01:11,519 --> 01:01:15,199
i'm sure there's some springtail nerd

1777
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,079
somewhere on the planet that'll be more

1778
01:01:15,199 --> 01:01:19,118
than how to

1779
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:21,519
happy to help you with id um

1780
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:23,440
but for the most part that's not

1781
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:27,199
anything i worry about the only thing

1782
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:28,240
in the soil from an arthropod kind of

1783
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:31,679
standpoint

1784
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:32,159
that you need to worry about is fungus

1785
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:33,919
mass

1786
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:35,838
because they eat your roots they vector

1787
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:36,720
pathogens you just don't want them

1788
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:40,400
around

1789
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:42,959
and those are very manageable if you

1790
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,639
treat them correctly i mean beneficial

1791
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,318
nematodes are amazing at controlling

1792
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,679
them when you get a good quality product

1793
01:01:46,318 --> 01:01:49,279
you apply them correctly there's also

1794
01:01:47,679 --> 01:01:51,118
the beetles there's mice there's all

1795
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,599
kinds of things you can treat them for

1796
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:54,318
and rude aphids rudy birds are the the

1797
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:55,440
oh my gosh

1798
01:01:54,318 --> 01:01:56,558
you're not going to sleep tonight

1799
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,079
because you have root david's because

1800
01:01:56,559 --> 01:02:00,400
they're very hard to manage

1801
01:01:58,079 --> 01:02:01,920
but other than that i mean there's some

1802
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,480
weird things you know we've had fire

1803
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:04,159
ants

1804
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,400
you know feed on cannabis you know we've

1805
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,838
had some cutworm situations

1806
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:13,599
we've had a few root knot nematodes um

1807
01:02:09,838 --> 01:02:16,000
and we have this new situation with um

1808
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,519
the tobacco ring spot virus that's

1809
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:21,039
vectored by nematodes

1810
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:23,599
that is um just been found

1811
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,119
in a crop and that's vectored by plant

1812
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,039
parasitic nematodes

1813
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:29,280
completely different than beneficial

1814
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:32,880
nematodes but for the most part

1815
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:34,960
um there's not you know the the

1816
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:36,559
the foliar pests are probably going to

1817
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,280
take you out before any of the

1818
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,839
the root pests um you know again in hemp

1819
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:44,798
outdoors we've had a few weevil issues

1820
01:02:41,838 --> 01:02:46,239
uh and the soil line but brood aphids

1821
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:47,759
are the ones that

1822
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:49,519
you know are really the only thing to

1823
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,799
freak out about in the soil from an

1824
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,159
indoor growing perspective what about

1825
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:57,038
excessive

1826
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:57,759
levels of isopods you know roly-poly

1827
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,440
bugs

1828
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,839
pill bugs whatever you want to call them

1829
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:04,240
because i have done that

1830
01:03:01,838 --> 01:03:04,960
oh my gosh yeah but it's not super

1831
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:07,519
common

1832
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:09,119
but it self-inflicted too much organic

1833
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:11,440
matter in your soil

1834
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,760
um because you know the american way if

1835
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:16,079
a little something's good more is better

1836
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,359
and the populations just build and build

1837
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:19,760
and build

1838
01:03:17,358 --> 01:03:20,480
and i've absolutely seen them eating the

1839
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,079
plants

1840
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,760
i've talked to people that they're out

1841
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,960
there vacuuming them out you almost

1842
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:26,079
honestly kind of need to change your

1843
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,280
growing system because you're just

1844
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:28,960
sustaining them

1845
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:31,519
by having too much organic matter in

1846
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,639
your soil

1847
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:38,079
great thanks for talking about that um

1848
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:39,279
all right so on to a little bit you know

1849
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,200
i know we've been talking for a while

1850
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,798
now but can we just quickly go over

1851
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:44,558
methods of release

1852
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,239
you know you kind of highlighted a

1853
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:47,680
little bit when you talked about sachets

1854
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,159
but there may be people that don't even

1855
01:03:47,679 --> 01:03:51,279
know

1856
01:03:48,159 --> 01:03:52,399
you know what a sachet is so um i don't

1857
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,160
know the best way to approach this if

1858
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,160
you want to talk about a few different

1859
01:03:54,159 --> 01:03:57,679
insects or if you just want to pick one

1860
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:59,118
beneficial insect and then talk about

1861
01:03:57,679 --> 01:03:59,759
the different ways it could be released

1862
01:03:59,119 --> 01:04:02,720
and

1863
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,599
why that's important well let's talk

1864
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:04,798
about

1865
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:06,798
let's okay let's talk about two

1866
01:04:04,798 --> 01:04:08,318
predatory mites and then we'll talk

1867
01:04:06,798 --> 01:04:10,159
about nematodes because i think those

1868
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:12,159
are the things that i see screwed up

1869
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:13,838
applied incorrectly the most so let's

1870
01:04:12,159 --> 01:04:16,399
jump back to persimilis

1871
01:04:13,838 --> 01:04:18,159
um persimilis there is so many ways to

1872
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,400
apply for similas today

1873
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:21,838
traditionally back in the 90s it would

1874
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,200
just come in a bottle and you would

1875
01:04:21,838 --> 01:04:25,279
sprinkle it out on the plant and there's

1876
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:28,078
a lot of that still going on today

1877
01:04:25,280 --> 01:04:29,680
but depending on plant shape depending

1878
01:04:28,079 --> 01:04:32,079
how you grow if you sprinkle

1879
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:35,038
over the top you're going to lose a lot

1880
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:37,280
of those persimilis to the floor

1881
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,960
i really cringe when people say oh just

1882
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:40,720
pour the persimilis at the base of the

1883
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:43,199
plant they'll find their way up

1884
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:45,279
you know if my mom's taking me to the

1885
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:47,759
mall i want her to drop me at the mall

1886
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,039
not six blocks from the mall because

1887
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,240
it's going to take an awful lot of work

1888
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:53,599
to get to the mall

1889
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:55,118
put them where your pets are think about

1890
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:56,160
it you know get them as close as

1891
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:59,200
possible

1892
01:04:56,159 --> 01:05:00,239
and so the the next progression um from

1893
01:04:59,199 --> 01:05:01,919
those bottles

1894
01:05:00,239 --> 01:05:03,679
on the persimmon list is actually the

1895
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:05,760
vial with the nipple top again

1896
01:05:03,679 --> 01:05:07,118
been to any of my workshops you've been

1897
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,799
to any of my classes

1898
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:10,960
you guys have all of me talk about this

1899
01:05:08,798 --> 01:05:12,960
in fact i'm holding one in my hand

1900
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,480
right now dad as we speak because i keep

1901
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:17,280
it on my desk here

1902
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:18,798
um it's a bile about the size of a roll

1903
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:22,079
of quarters and it looks like

1904
01:05:18,798 --> 01:05:24,719
uh the top of a ketchup bottle you know

1905
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:26,000
the nipple top ones when you hold this

1906
01:05:24,719 --> 01:05:27,919
persimilis will

1907
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,039
run up to the tip of it and then what

1908
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:30,798
you can do is you just

1909
01:05:29,039 --> 01:05:33,280
walk along and touch the plant and

1910
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:36,559
persimilis goes

1911
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:38,880
right out onto the plant and will start

1912
01:05:36,559 --> 01:05:40,160
feeding that way you can see how many

1913
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:42,559
mice are going on your plant

1914
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:44,239
there's no waste in the floor there's no

1915
01:05:42,559 --> 01:05:47,039
carrier on the plant

1916
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:48,798
it's very neat it's very clean i it's my

1917
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:51,039
favorite way to apply persimilis

1918
01:05:48,798 --> 01:05:52,480
and it's been around a long time but i

1919
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:54,319
swear i feel like this was made for the

1920
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,400
cannabis industry even though

1921
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:58,480
you know we've been using it in you know

1922
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:00,000
the interior landscape we're treating

1923
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:01,280
palm trees and malls and things like

1924
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:04,239
that we've been using this

1925
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,240
product for decades so this application

1926
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:10,318
method is a really good way to apply

1927
01:06:06,239 --> 01:06:12,000
them um now again we have

1928
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,000
in the past we've never had persimmons

1929
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:17,358
and sachets now

1930
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:19,760
we're going to get these sachets

1931
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,920
that have the quick release uh you know

1932
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,520
as much as i like biob i'm not sold on

1933
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,240
the quick release sachet because

1934
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:26,079
honestly

1935
01:06:24,239 --> 01:06:27,919
i'd rather instead of having a sash

1936
01:06:26,079 --> 01:06:29,280
hanging a sachet on every plant and then

1937
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:30,639
dealing with sachets

1938
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,280
for the quick release i'd rather just

1939
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,239
use the vial and walk down and touch the

1940
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:37,280
plants

1941
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:38,399
but the slow release sachet may have

1942
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:40,960
something there

1943
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,119
even though it only lasts for two weeks

1944
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,838
and traditionally you only apply

1945
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:45,920
persimilis

1946
01:06:43,838 --> 01:06:47,440
every every two weeks so you kind of

1947
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,599
have to look at your economics

1948
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,960
if you want to hang the sachets out for

1949
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,640
two weeks or again you want to come

1950
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:53,519
through with the vial every two weeks

1951
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:55,838
you're gonna have to look at your

1952
01:06:53,519 --> 01:06:56,639
situation and see what works for you in

1953
01:06:55,838 --> 01:07:00,400
that

1954
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:02,960
now we are starting to see more

1955
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,960
drone releases for outdoor they've been

1956
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:07,760
doing it in strawberries and citrus

1957
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:10,798
and now parabug has been working with

1958
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:13,440
beneficial insectary out in california

1959
01:07:10,798 --> 01:07:15,038
doing outdoor drone releases where they

1960
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:16,079
put the persimilis and the drones and

1961
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:18,720
they fly them out

1962
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:21,359
and and drop them and that's basically

1963
01:07:18,719 --> 01:07:25,038
kind of how you would do

1964
01:07:21,358 --> 01:07:27,038
loose mites um for production

1965
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,960
out there now we're going to talk about

1966
01:07:27,039 --> 01:07:30,960
cucumbers which is a different predatory

1967
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:33,358
might again i love cucumaris

1968
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:35,358
not as much as persimilis but it is a

1969
01:07:33,358 --> 01:07:37,679
freaking workhorse

1970
01:07:35,358 --> 01:07:38,639
what's nice about it is it has a white

1971
01:07:37,679 --> 01:07:41,279
host range

1972
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,879
not only will it gobble up onion drips

1973
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:45,680
western flower thrips

1974
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:47,280
it will destroy broad mites it's heavily

1975
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:49,358
used in ornamental production to prevent

1976
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:52,240
broad might damage on a lot of crops

1977
01:07:49,358 --> 01:07:53,838
if you're one of my consulting customers

1978
01:07:52,239 --> 01:07:54,798
you're most likely using cucumbers in

1979
01:07:53,838 --> 01:07:57,038
your program

1980
01:07:54,798 --> 01:07:57,838
because it's a cheap easy insurance

1981
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:59,760
policy

1982
01:07:57,838 --> 01:08:01,759
against these pests i just mentioned in

1983
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:02,960
addition to we know it will snack on

1984
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:05,839
spider mites

1985
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:06,480
and spider-man eggs out there so um it's

1986
01:08:05,838 --> 01:08:09,358
a good

1987
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:10,079
general mite to release it doesn't have

1988
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:12,400
that same

1989
01:08:10,079 --> 01:08:13,680
fast running up behavior like uh

1990
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:16,560
persimilis does

1991
01:08:13,679 --> 01:08:18,238
so you cannot get it in the release vial

1992
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:21,600
so you have to get the product

1993
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:24,879
loose um loose

1994
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:29,199
or in a sachet but the loose product um

1995
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:30,880
again i'm not super excited about

1996
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:32,559
putting it over the tops of plants

1997
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:33,199
especially cannabis plants that are

1998
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:34,319
large

1999
01:08:33,198 --> 01:08:36,479
because you're going to lose a lot to

2000
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,759
the floor now in plug trays like if

2001
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:41,198
you've just stuck

2002
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:43,838
all your uh cannabis uh cuts

2003
01:08:41,198 --> 01:08:45,119
into like a 10 20 flat before you put

2004
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:47,920
the jiffy dome on

2005
01:08:45,119 --> 01:08:49,759
you could just sprinkle in there lightly

2006
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,920
you know a tablespoon or so

2007
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,399
of cucumbers which i highly recommend

2008
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:56,798
because you have to start your bios

2009
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:58,158
in propagation do not wait people you

2010
01:08:56,798 --> 01:09:00,719
have to start them then

2011
01:08:58,158 --> 01:09:01,920
it's pennies to treat then and again

2012
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:04,798
it's going to start

2013
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:06,319
feeding on all those pest problems then

2014
01:09:04,798 --> 01:09:09,759
before they have a chance to build

2015
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,759
when your plants are that small it's not

2016
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:14,399
that far for them to walk

2017
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:17,520
now the sachets which we've talked about

2018
01:09:14,399 --> 01:09:18,960
you can also do those in propagation

2019
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:21,359
and you can use those on the plants and

2020
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:22,960
the cucumbers comes in that sachet

2021
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:24,719
the slow release sachets they almost

2022
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:26,239
look like tea bags and either come with

2023
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:28,640
a hook or they're on a stick

2024
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:29,519
there is a breeding colony of cucumbers

2025
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,838
in there and

2026
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:33,359
mites will slow release out of a pinhole

2027
01:09:31,838 --> 01:09:36,798
in there for four to six

2028
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:38,880
weeks and the advantage of doing that

2029
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:40,399
is if you hang these in your cannabis

2030
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:42,239
plants instead of having to come through

2031
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,599
every week or every other week to

2032
01:09:42,238 --> 01:09:45,198
lose sprinkle cute camaros and

2033
01:09:43,600 --> 01:09:45,759
everything get it on the floor make a

2034
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:48,719
mess

2035
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:50,960
you just have a naturally slow releasing

2036
01:09:48,719 --> 01:09:51,679
population coming out and it works very

2037
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,158
well

2038
01:09:51,679 --> 01:09:55,520
you can absolutely use those sachets in

2039
01:09:54,158 --> 01:09:57,759
propagation

2040
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,960
but you know the propagation cycles are

2041
01:09:57,760 --> 01:10:01,360
pretty short

2042
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:02,079
so oftentimes if you stick them in there

2043
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:03,519
and then you're going to be

2044
01:10:02,079 --> 01:10:06,719
transplanting in you know

2045
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:08,320
two three weeks maybe uh don't

2046
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,760
give me all kinds of complaints about

2047
01:10:08,319 --> 01:10:11,679
that's not your time

2048
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,280
on average because everybody roots

2049
01:10:11,679 --> 01:10:14,079
differently and different sizes and

2050
01:10:13,279 --> 01:10:16,158
everything

2051
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:17,600
but you know here you put that sachet in

2052
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:18,399
and let's say if you're you're stepping

2053
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:21,039
up the plants

2054
01:10:18,399 --> 01:10:23,039
in two weeks now you've got the sachet

2055
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:24,880
that you still have several weeks

2056
01:10:23,039 --> 01:10:27,039
still left on it you can either put it

2057
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,679
in new propagation trays or you can just

2058
01:10:27,039 --> 01:10:29,760
step them

2059
01:10:27,679 --> 01:10:30,880
up with your crop because you want to

2060
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,199
make sure you get that

2061
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:35,119
full use out of the sachet but these

2062
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:37,519
sachets on the plants have really been a

2063
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:39,840
game changer as far as

2064
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:42,000
labor savings and also having that

2065
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:43,760
consistent slow release

2066
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,279
and if you've got these sachets you can

2067
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,920
absolutely come through

2068
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:48,880
and spray with products like impede

2069
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:51,920
stuff oil

2070
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:52,800
x um any of the the batana guard the

2071
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:54,960
velifer

2072
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:57,600
and since the breeding colony is

2073
01:10:54,960 --> 01:11:00,000
protected inside that sachet

2074
01:10:57,600 --> 01:11:02,079
even if the product you use like suffolk

2075
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,520
is non-selective it will kill predatory

2076
01:11:02,079 --> 01:11:05,279
mites

2077
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,719
so it will kill them on the foliage when

2078
01:11:05,279 --> 01:11:09,279
you're spraying but it

2079
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:09,760
those mites are going to start releasing

2080
01:11:09,279 --> 01:11:11,840
still

2081
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,199
out and so once your soft rolex is dry

2082
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:16,159
any of those mites that emerge

2083
01:11:13,198 --> 01:11:17,919
after that are still going to continue

2084
01:11:16,158 --> 01:11:20,719
to be able to live on the plant

2085
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:23,039
so you can spray and it doesn't disrupt

2086
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,880
the releasing in your system

2087
01:11:23,039 --> 01:11:26,479
as long as you're spraying with products

2088
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,840
that are somewhat compatible with

2089
01:11:26,479 --> 01:11:29,279
biocontrol agents and

2090
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:31,360
generally in cannabis and organic

2091
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:34,479
production we are

2092
01:11:31,359 --> 01:11:37,279
those release sachets

2093
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:38,718
have really been a game changer on

2094
01:11:37,279 --> 01:11:40,238
releasing

2095
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,399
the other release thing i want to talk

2096
01:11:40,238 --> 01:11:44,559
about are beneficial nematodes

2097
01:11:42,399 --> 01:11:46,960
in fact i was just about to post on my

2098
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:48,960
facebook page which is uh for bug lady

2099
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:50,480
consulting please don't send me personal

2100
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:51,279
friend request to suzanne wainwright

2101
01:11:50,479 --> 01:11:53,599
because that's

2102
01:11:51,279 --> 01:11:55,599
where i you know do my cat's dog and

2103
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:57,039
star trek and harry potter stuff

2104
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,360
bug lady consulting is where i put the

2105
01:11:57,039 --> 01:12:01,600
links but basf has done a really good

2106
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:02,960
video on how to apply nematodes and i

2107
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,400
see a lot of people

2108
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:06,000
saying they're applying nematodes for

2109
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:06,559
fungus snack control and not getting

2110
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,479
results

2111
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,199
i think because they're not applying

2112
01:12:08,479 --> 01:12:12,879
them correctly

2113
01:12:11,198 --> 01:12:14,719
there's lots of different ways to apply

2114
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,760
nematodes

2115
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:20,158
and you have to look at your system for

2116
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:22,079
commercial production

2117
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,920
the most standard way to do it is people

2118
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:24,800
mix the images up in a five gallon

2119
01:12:23,920 --> 01:12:27,199
bucket

2120
01:12:24,800 --> 01:12:29,440
and then they use a dosatron to apply

2121
01:12:27,198 --> 01:12:32,158
them out so they get even dosing

2122
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:33,519
um through the crop and that video uh

2123
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:35,920
that gin berg did

2124
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:37,040
explains that which is explained exactly

2125
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:40,480
how to do it

2126
01:12:37,039 --> 01:12:43,119
for smaller facilities or home grows

2127
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,639
typically people are buying sponges

2128
01:12:43,119 --> 01:12:45,039
because you can get smaller counts on

2129
01:12:44,640 --> 01:12:46,320
those

2130
01:12:45,039 --> 01:12:48,399
and you have to wring them out and

2131
01:12:46,319 --> 01:12:49,519
things like watering cans and then you

2132
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:51,119
water your plants

2133
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:53,360
but you have to make sure that your

2134
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,039
nematodes are about the same temperature

2135
01:12:53,359 --> 01:12:56,000
as your water you're mixing them in you

2136
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,840
need to have that

2137
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:59,840
pretty close together you want to make

2138
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,679
sure you use them up as soon as you mix

2139
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:02,400
them because nematodes can drown in the

2140
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:04,719
water

2141
01:13:02,399 --> 01:13:05,519
you don't want to let the water heat up

2142
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:08,800
because that

2143
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:12,080
that can do it also um

2144
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:14,560
with your nematodes too again

2145
01:13:12,079 --> 01:13:15,920
i really like people to buy direct from

2146
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:19,360
the insectaries

2147
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:21,279
so that you're getting the the freshest

2148
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:23,119
the most viable product as possible

2149
01:13:21,279 --> 01:13:24,399
because sometimes the distributors you

2150
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:25,840
don't know if they've stored the

2151
01:13:24,399 --> 01:13:27,839
products correctly

2152
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:29,440
or how long they've even had the

2153
01:13:27,840 --> 01:13:31,840
products

2154
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:34,000
so does that kind of give you an

2155
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:36,000
overview

2156
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,600
yeah did you maybe i missed it did you

2157
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:42,319
talk about ones that come with carriers

2158
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,640
well all the well i don't say almost all

2159
01:13:42,319 --> 01:13:47,599
biocontrol agents come with carriers

2160
01:13:44,640 --> 01:13:47,920
um and even like cucumeris you can buy

2161
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,239
it

2162
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,158
in vermiculite you can buy it in brand

2163
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:53,519
there's different carriers for different

2164
01:13:52,158 --> 01:13:55,359
situations

2165
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,840
typically if you're dealing with like a

2166
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:59,359
legit bio control company

2167
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:01,039
they'll know what you need if you're

2168
01:13:59,359 --> 01:14:03,119
ordering blindly off the internet you

2169
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:06,479
know who knows what you're going to get

2170
01:14:03,119 --> 01:14:08,238
um yeah i guess like i bought um sorry

2171
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:09,599
like it looked like a spice shaker you

2172
01:14:08,238 --> 01:14:12,639
know this was

2173
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:15,920
10 years ago now when i had thrips

2174
01:14:12,640 --> 01:14:18,000
and uh so i was shaking out these

2175
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,679
you know it looked like they looked like

2176
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,800
little granules

2177
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:26,960
um onto you know the

2178
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:28,079
my vegetative plants at the time

2179
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:30,399
i i just didn't know if you want to

2180
01:14:28,079 --> 01:14:31,679
touch on that method of application well

2181
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,119
you're probably you're probably putting

2182
01:14:31,679 --> 01:14:34,880
out cucumaris and you again you're

2183
01:14:33,119 --> 01:14:35,519
probably losing a lot to the floor that

2184
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:37,359
way

2185
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:39,120
what you should have done is once you've

2186
01:14:37,359 --> 01:14:41,119
got your tube

2187
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,640
you lay it on its side for a little bit

2188
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:43,760
you never want to stand bottles up

2189
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,320
always lay them on their side

2190
01:14:43,760 --> 01:14:48,400
and then you roll it slowly to

2191
01:14:46,319 --> 01:14:50,079
reincorporate the mites back in

2192
01:14:48,399 --> 01:14:51,679
then you should open the container and

2193
01:14:50,079 --> 01:14:52,960
then you should have been able to get

2194
01:14:51,679 --> 01:14:54,480
what they call release

2195
01:14:52,960 --> 01:14:56,480
boxes they're basically these little

2196
01:14:54,479 --> 01:14:57,599
square pop-up boxes with a hanger on

2197
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,439
them and you hang them in the plant then

2198
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,320
you walk by with basically a spoon

2199
01:14:59,439 --> 01:15:03,919
and you would put a tablespoon of that

2200
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:06,000
in these little boxes

2201
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:07,920
and then the mites over the next day to

2202
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:09,600
two days will slowly climb out of those

2203
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:11,600
boxes and onto the plant so that way you

2204
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,239
get all your mites on your plant

2205
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:15,039
and you don't have carrier everywhere

2206
01:15:14,238 --> 01:15:17,279
yeah i did

2207
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:20,158
i did have carrier everywhere and uh i

2208
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:23,039
didn't know you 10 years ago so

2209
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:25,039
i have an excuse but now you do that's

2210
01:15:23,039 --> 01:15:25,920
true well i think the sachets just make

2211
01:15:25,039 --> 01:15:29,760
so much sense

2212
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:30,960
um so so tell me if this is right so if

2213
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:32,560
it's really bad

2214
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,560
pest problem you'd probably do a knock

2215
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:35,360
down spray and then follow it up with a

2216
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,480
release

2217
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:40,319
or with sachets when do you lean towards

2218
01:15:38,479 --> 01:15:41,759
and i realize that every situation is

2219
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:42,479
different and i do want to highlight

2220
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:44,800
that

2221
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:47,519
but as a general rule when are you doing

2222
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:48,320
more of a quick release versus a sachet

2223
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:53,040
option

2224
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:56,799
for um you know a lot of these insects

2225
01:15:53,039 --> 01:15:57,279
i look at how long before the crop is

2226
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,039
being

2227
01:15:57,279 --> 01:16:03,679
shipped shipped or harvested i look at

2228
01:16:01,039 --> 01:16:04,479
population density i also look at

2229
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:08,158
threats from

2230
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:09,839
other pests that may show up that we may

2231
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:10,639
have to treat for and how is that going

2232
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:14,560
to interfere

2233
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:17,520
with our other program but if you

2234
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:20,159
start in propagation when your plants

2235
01:16:17,520 --> 01:16:23,600
that's when they should be the cleanest

2236
01:16:20,158 --> 01:16:25,599
you can go in with low rates and again

2237
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:27,120
in those those plug trays you can use

2238
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:28,960
loose product right there now if you use

2239
01:16:27,119 --> 01:16:31,039
an arrow cloner again you probably don't

2240
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,039
want to dump carrier all over the top of

2241
01:16:31,039 --> 01:16:36,399
that because that's going to make a mess

2242
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:39,679
and that's where um you know

2243
01:16:36,399 --> 01:16:42,879
using sachets may make better sense um

2244
01:16:39,679 --> 01:16:43,920
again i it's like ideal when people root

2245
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,400
in

2246
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:48,079
you know 10 20 flats because if you

2247
01:16:46,399 --> 01:16:50,799
sprinkle it on and they just land

2248
01:16:48,079 --> 01:16:52,479
on the the service uh surface of like

2249
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:54,079
the glue plug or the rock wool or

2250
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:56,399
whatever they're using

2251
01:16:54,079 --> 01:16:58,479
you know it's there's so many plants

2252
01:16:56,399 --> 01:17:00,839
right there they're gonna bump into them

2253
01:16:58,479 --> 01:17:02,000
um and that's when i would use the loose

2254
01:17:00,840 --> 01:17:04,400
ore

2255
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,238
if you know if you're uh even though i

2256
01:17:04,399 --> 01:17:09,119
realize most of growers are going to be

2257
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:10,079
cannabis growers but if we're growing

2258
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:13,198
let's say

2259
01:17:10,079 --> 01:17:15,119
basil pot tight on a growing bench and

2260
01:17:13,198 --> 01:17:17,119
it's a four inch pot we may broadcast

2261
01:17:15,119 --> 01:17:19,198
over the top of that

2262
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:21,039
because the plants are touching and it

2263
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:23,039
makes a canopy and most the mites

2264
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:24,719
are going to end up on the plants and

2265
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:27,760
not losing them to the soil because

2266
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:29,520
i actually look at leaf structure too

2267
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:31,600
plants like crotons it's a tropical

2268
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:34,000
foliage plant super big wide leaf

2269
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:35,679
we literally use an orchard air blaster

2270
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:37,840
to blow mites out

2271
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:39,600
because they've got big leaves that can

2272
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,319
catch the mites and then it slides them

2273
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:44,320
down towards the center of the plant

2274
01:17:42,319 --> 01:17:46,000
and they don't fall through you look at

2275
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:47,039
a cannabis plant that's really

2276
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,198
especially they've been

2277
01:17:47,039 --> 01:17:50,880
thinned out they're open they're leafy

2278
01:17:49,198 --> 01:17:52,399
and if you blow mites over the top of

2279
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:54,400
that they're just going to kind of fall

2280
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:55,920
through and fall right to the floor so

2281
01:17:54,399 --> 01:17:56,559
plant structure makes a difference too

2282
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,960
on the

2283
01:17:56,560 --> 01:18:01,280
on deciding how we're going to be

2284
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,719
releasing

2285
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:04,800
okay so we're already running a little

2286
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:05,359
long but i want to put you on the spot

2287
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,440
here

2288
01:18:05,359 --> 01:18:08,880
can you answer two things in the next

2289
01:18:07,439 --> 01:18:13,519
two to three minutes and that would be

2290
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:16,400
um one why it's important to

2291
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:16,960
uh vet the entomologist that you work

2292
01:18:16,399 --> 01:18:18,479
with or

2293
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,840
or let's just say not even use the word

2294
01:18:18,479 --> 01:18:20,799
entomologist because i'll let you touch

2295
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:23,920
on that but

2296
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:25,840
the um i guess

2297
01:18:23,920 --> 01:18:26,960
ipm expert that you work with or

2298
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:30,560
consultant

2299
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:32,719
and then also uh why every environment

2300
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:35,199
is different and there's no

2301
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:37,119
there's no perfect answer that works for

2302
01:18:35,198 --> 01:18:38,238
all situations can you just

2303
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:40,238
i know this could be a whole nother

2304
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:41,359
podcast but i i wanted to get this in

2305
01:18:40,238 --> 01:18:42,718
because i think it's important if you

2306
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:45,759
could just touch on those

2307
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:48,800
uh really quickly right

2308
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:50,239
so um so again my background is a bit

2309
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:52,719
more in the ornamental

2310
01:18:50,238 --> 01:18:54,479
market where there's only a couple of us

2311
01:18:52,719 --> 01:18:55,840
that are consultants there aren't very

2312
01:18:54,479 --> 01:18:56,959
many and when you're a consultant you're

2313
01:18:55,840 --> 01:19:00,079
a consultant

2314
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:03,039
you don't have other revenue streams and

2315
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:05,279
we've gone to college for this

2316
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,880
and do that once i started working a lot

2317
01:19:05,279 --> 01:19:09,198
more in the cannabis industry and i

2318
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:10,880
discovered everybody's a consultant

2319
01:19:09,198 --> 01:19:12,319
and i would ask people you know what are

2320
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,039
your qualifications

2321
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:16,158
and literally well i grew weed for a

2322
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:17,439
year so now i'm going to be a wheat

2323
01:19:16,158 --> 01:19:20,079
consultant

2324
01:19:17,439 --> 01:19:21,519
and i think it's really important to ask

2325
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:24,719
if someone is giving you

2326
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:28,080
advice or identifying something for you

2327
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,960
look at what their qualifications are to

2328
01:19:28,079 --> 01:19:31,920
be giving you this information um

2329
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,319
because

2330
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:36,480
i'm finding there's just so much bad

2331
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,920
information being given out

2332
01:19:36,479 --> 01:19:42,639
and people can say whatever they

2333
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:44,239
want about their background i mean you

2334
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:45,840
can call yourself whatever i could call

2335
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:48,238
myself a zoologist

2336
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:48,960
you know but i didn't go to school for

2337
01:19:48,238 --> 01:19:50,319
that and i

2338
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:51,600
i think it's important to dive into

2339
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:52,479
people's backgrounds did they go to

2340
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:54,800
college

2341
01:19:52,479 --> 01:19:56,319
or these specialized areas i understand

2342
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:58,320
you could be a very good

2343
01:19:56,319 --> 01:20:00,000
grower without going to school i get

2344
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,960
that but when you get into these

2345
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:04,000
specialized

2346
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:06,560
niches of entomology or pathology

2347
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:08,000
or nematology the reality is you need to

2348
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:11,039
have gone to school for this

2349
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,359
and and worked in the field and kept up

2350
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:13,760
with

2351
01:20:11,359 --> 01:20:14,719
all the scientific information because

2352
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:16,400
if not

2353
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:17,760
if the people you're getting information

2354
01:20:16,399 --> 01:20:18,960
from don't you're gonna end up getting

2355
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:22,000
bad information

2356
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:24,158
and you know unfortunately i've learned

2357
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,000
um and it's been frustrating for me that

2358
01:20:24,158 --> 01:20:27,759
cannabis is kind of a social media

2359
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:30,719
popularity contest

2360
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:32,800
and the reality is is i'm sorry guys i

2361
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:35,920
don't have a ton of time

2362
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:36,719
to put up all these flashy social media

2363
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,639
stuff because

2364
01:20:36,719 --> 01:20:40,399
i'm out in the field working i'm working

2365
01:20:38,639 --> 01:20:42,239
with growers i'm

2366
01:20:40,399 --> 01:20:43,679
you know doing experiments i'm

2367
01:20:42,238 --> 01:20:46,238
photographing things

2368
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,840
um that's why i rely on you tad because

2369
01:20:46,238 --> 01:20:48,799
you basically kind of are my social

2370
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:51,360
media

2371
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,960
to get me out there because i just don't

2372
01:20:51,359 --> 01:20:55,439
have time for and i always say

2373
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:58,319
if you've got all this time to be on

2374
01:20:55,439 --> 01:21:00,158
producing all the social media content

2375
01:20:58,319 --> 01:21:02,319
how are you actually working and doing a

2376
01:21:00,158 --> 01:21:04,399
job so i mean just just

2377
01:21:02,319 --> 01:21:05,599
buy or beware on the information you get

2378
01:21:04,399 --> 01:21:07,279
out there

2379
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:09,440
check you know what people's

2380
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:10,158
qualifications are linkedin's great you

2381
01:21:09,439 --> 01:21:12,000
can see

2382
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,079
how many jobs they've had where they've

2383
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:16,800
worked and that kind of stuff

2384
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:18,158
and to answer a question on environment

2385
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,360
um

2386
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:23,359
it's just like uh ever let's just think

2387
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:25,679
about it too with medications

2388
01:21:23,359 --> 01:21:27,279
actually covet vaccines perfectly lots

2389
01:21:25,679 --> 01:21:29,199
of people have gotten the covet vaccine

2390
01:21:27,279 --> 01:21:31,119
we've all responded differently

2391
01:21:29,198 --> 01:21:32,559
same thing with biocontrol agents you

2392
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:34,079
put them out they can respond

2393
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,520
differently in different environments

2394
01:21:34,079 --> 01:21:38,399
where it may work here

2395
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,719
where it doesn't work there so when

2396
01:21:38,399 --> 01:21:42,479
you're

2397
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:44,800
dealing with living breathing organisms

2398
01:21:42,479 --> 01:21:45,919
there's so many variables in the

2399
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,920
environment

2400
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:50,079
we have to test and see which one is

2401
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:52,000
right for your conditions i mean

2402
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:54,079
i have a pretty good idea for because of

2403
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:57,439
doing this like 30 years now

2404
01:21:54,079 --> 01:22:00,399
the good starting point um and

2405
01:21:57,439 --> 01:22:00,799
we're going to tweak it from there but

2406
01:22:00,399 --> 01:22:04,719
um

2407
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:06,400
the environment you know workflow

2408
01:22:04,719 --> 01:22:07,760
you know is there a soybean field

2409
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:10,479
outside your facility

2410
01:22:07,760 --> 01:22:11,520
or are you next to a building you know

2411
01:22:10,479 --> 01:22:15,119
all these kinds of things

2412
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:17,120
play in to how we formulate your pest

2413
01:22:15,119 --> 01:22:18,800
management programs and my goal is for

2414
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:22,079
my growers to have

2415
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:24,480
solid environmentally safe and cost

2416
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:26,000
effective pest management programs

2417
01:22:24,479 --> 01:22:27,678
because if your program's not

2418
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,119
cost effective you're not going to be in

2419
01:22:27,679 --> 01:22:30,800
business then you're not going to be my

2420
01:22:29,119 --> 01:22:33,760
customer anymore and i need you guys to

2421
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:35,279
stay in business so i have a job

2422
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:37,600
yeah that was that was great i want to

2423
01:22:35,279 --> 01:22:40,079
touch on a couple things

2424
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:42,400
first of all i think that if you are a

2425
01:22:40,079 --> 01:22:44,559
large facility

2426
01:22:42,399 --> 01:22:45,920
you could potentially save them money by

2427
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,639
dialing in their program

2428
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,440
or decreasing the amount of pest damage

2429
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:52,960
that they're having

2430
01:22:49,439 --> 01:22:54,559
they may be buying too much of a given

2431
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,760
a given product or maybe there's a

2432
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:56,400
better product out there that you could

2433
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:58,639
recommend

2434
01:22:56,399 --> 01:22:59,679
but every situation is so unique as you

2435
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,760
mentioned you know varying in

2436
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:05,039
temperature humidity

2437
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:07,360
stage of plant airflow all of these

2438
01:23:05,039 --> 01:23:09,519
things that uh it really does

2439
01:23:07,359 --> 01:23:10,960
uh require a lot of experience and

2440
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:12,000
background in order to make a good

2441
01:23:10,960 --> 01:23:13,600
recommendation

2442
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:15,198
and on that note i know i'm gonna get

2443
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:16,880
pushback on the fact that you know you

2444
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:20,238
don't have to go to college

2445
01:23:16,880 --> 01:23:21,840
to know something about about a thing um

2446
01:23:20,238 --> 01:23:23,519
i guess i'm the perfect example of that

2447
01:23:21,840 --> 01:23:24,960
when it comes to my background

2448
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,320
since my background's in special

2449
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:27,119
education but i did get a master's

2450
01:23:26,319 --> 01:23:30,399
degree

2451
01:23:27,119 --> 01:23:32,399
for what that's worth um but i do

2452
01:23:30,399 --> 01:23:33,679
i do think there is a huge advantage to

2453
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,679
going to school

2454
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,319
now for those people that didn't go to

2455
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,600
school or didn't have that opportunity

2456
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:41,039
you know there's there are wonderful

2457
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,880
people in this industry i think kelly

2458
01:23:41,039 --> 01:23:46,560
vance is a great example of that

2459
01:23:42,880 --> 01:23:47,760
but he has a lot of uh experience as a

2460
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:49,520
large

2461
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:51,360
greenhouse grower prior to ever getting

2462
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,360
into insects and then spent a lot of

2463
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:55,519
time doing work with insects

2464
01:23:53,359 --> 01:23:57,439
but be aware that you know you'll even

2465
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:59,679
see variability within these insectaries

2466
01:23:57,439 --> 01:24:01,039
in terms of the level of knowledge

2467
01:23:59,679 --> 01:24:02,639
that they have or these companies

2468
01:24:01,039 --> 01:24:03,600
selling insects i've seen some of the

2469
01:24:02,639 --> 01:24:05,199
recommendations

2470
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,480
on there versus the ones that your you

2471
01:24:05,198 --> 01:24:07,759
know you and i have talked about them

2472
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:11,759
and sometimes they don't really

2473
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:14,320
line up as well so really do vet

2474
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:16,320
um your information and make sure that

2475
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:19,519
you're optimizing it for the

2476
01:24:16,319 --> 01:24:20,719
health of your grow and and doing

2477
01:24:19,520 --> 01:24:23,760
research on something

2478
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,319
doesn't mean googling it uh you know i

2479
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:25,920
see this

2480
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:27,519
growers like well i've researched this

2481
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,719
like well how did you research it well

2482
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,840
you googled it

2483
01:24:28,719 --> 01:24:33,679
there is so much bad wrong

2484
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:35,119
information i mean again i could write a

2485
01:24:33,679 --> 01:24:37,359
whole book on bad

2486
01:24:35,119 --> 01:24:38,238
pest management information on cannabis

2487
01:24:37,359 --> 01:24:40,519
on the internet

2488
01:24:38,238 --> 01:24:42,000
or a coffee table book on the wrong

2489
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,800
identifications

2490
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:45,359

2492
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:48,559

2493
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:52,400
improve

2494
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:54,159
constantly by learning doing more

2495
01:24:52,399 --> 01:24:56,000
rubbing shoulders with you know the

2496
01:24:54,158 --> 01:24:58,079
systematists that are specialists in an

2497
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:00,639
area and and all that

2498
01:24:58,079 --> 01:25:02,238
but i don't know everything and as

2499
01:25:00,639 --> 01:25:04,079
growers

2500
01:25:02,238 --> 01:25:05,519
you have to be good at lots of things

2501
01:25:04,079 --> 01:25:07,119
but in a way i don't don't yell at me

2502
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:09,199
but master of none in a way

2503
01:25:07,119 --> 01:25:10,800
because i don't do fertilization i don't

2504
01:25:09,198 --> 01:25:12,399
do irrigation but you guys have to be

2505
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:14,239
able to handle all that

2506
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:16,079
leave it to the specialist when you're

2507
01:25:14,238 --> 01:25:18,238

2529
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:58,399
them and i don't want more pesticides in

2530
01:25:56,399 --> 01:26:00,319
the environment

2531
01:25:58,399 --> 01:26:01,439
absolutely you know if you're hiring a

2532
01:26:00,319 --> 01:26:03,679
consultant for

2533
01:26:01,439 --> 01:26:04,960
anything they need to be able to provide

2534
01:26:03,679 --> 01:26:06,719
value and you have to be aware of what

2535
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:08,000
that value is prior to ever

2536
01:26:06,719 --> 01:26:09,039
having them out i've had people that

2537
01:26:08,000 --> 01:26:10,479
want me to come out and see their

2538
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,600
facility and you know a lot of times

2539
01:26:10,479 --> 01:26:13,039
they'll be like hey you know maybe a

2540
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:14,880
zoom call be better

2541
01:26:13,039 --> 01:26:16,560
maybe i'm not the right person for what

2542
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,800
you're looking for

2543
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:20,320
but you know like in your case if you

2544
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,840
step into a facility a lot of times

2545
01:26:20,319 --> 01:26:23,198
you'll see things that they might not be

2546
01:26:21,840 --> 01:26:24,560
able to put in a call or an email and

2547
01:26:23,198 --> 01:26:26,079
you'll be like oh my gosh

2548
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:28,159
you know hey you're storing this product

2549
01:26:26,079 --> 01:26:30,960
wrong or oh geez you need to have a

2550
01:26:28,158 --> 01:26:32,638
some sort of uh you know ipm protocol

2551
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,239
for going into this room that you don't

2552
01:26:32,639 --> 01:26:37,520
have established right now

2553
01:26:34,238 --> 01:26:38,319
these little things can save thousands

2554
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,520
of dollars

2555
01:26:38,319 --> 01:26:41,599
hundreds of thousands of dollars

2556
01:26:39,520 --> 01:26:43,760
depending on the scale and so um

2557
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:44,960
that's where a consultant can make a big

2558
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,800
difference and getting the right

2559
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:48,880
consultant because there's no

2560
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:50,000
there's no list of consultants out there

2561
01:26:48,880 --> 01:26:52,960
in the canvas industry

2562
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:54,800
and there's no ratings it's really um

2563
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:56,000
it's really your job as the grower to go

2564
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,199
out there and vet them and make sure

2565
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:59,520
you're getting the right person for what

2566
01:26:57,198 --> 01:27:02,319
you want

2567
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:04,239
absolutely being on on site is critical

2568
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:06,479
because you're absolutely right um

2569
01:27:04,238 --> 01:27:07,359
and again i i if you call me and ask me

2570
01:27:06,479 --> 01:27:08,638
about disease

2571
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:10,238
you know my answer is it doesn't have

2572
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,639
six or eight legs i don't deal with it

2573
01:27:10,238 --> 01:27:13,119
but

2574
01:27:10,639 --> 01:27:15,199
tad you know from knowing me if i don't

2575
01:27:13,119 --> 01:27:16,399

2576
01:27:15,198 --> 01:27:18,319
and i'll get you connected with the

2577
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:20,079
right person that does know

2578
01:27:18,319 --> 01:27:21,439
about that area of specialty that can

2579
01:27:20,079 --> 01:27:23,039

2580
01:27:21,439 --> 01:27:24,479
absolutely yeah that's that's the

2581
01:27:23,039 --> 01:27:26,079
biggest thing and that's one thing i'm

2582
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:27,678
very grateful for too is like that

2583
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:29,600
network of people because if it relates

2584
01:27:27,679 --> 01:27:31,520
to insects i know

2585
01:27:29,600 --> 01:27:33,679
i can get a hold of you if it relates to

2586
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,600
you know pathology or disease

2587
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:38,319
i can talk to you i could talk to chris

2588
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,560
hayes over at bioworks you know there's

2589
01:27:38,319 --> 01:27:42,000
there's there's uh dr greenhouse nadia

2590
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,800
who's just amazing when it comes to

2591
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:45,359
airflow

2592
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:46,239
and things like that so you know having

2593
01:27:45,359 --> 01:27:48,238
the network

2594
01:27:46,238 --> 01:27:50,238
is almost more important than your own

2595
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:51,919
personal knowledge in a lot of cases um

2596
01:27:50,238 --> 01:27:52,319
when it comes to consulting i found or

2597
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:55,279
just

2598
01:27:52,319 --> 01:27:56,000
being able to find answers for questions

2599
01:27:55,279 --> 01:27:57,439
all right well

2600
01:27:56,000 --> 01:27:59,520
and this is an advantage to me being

2601
01:27:57,439 --> 01:28:00,479
like an old person because i've only

2602
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:02,239
ever worked

2603
01:28:00,479 --> 01:28:04,158
in the horticultural industry again i've

2604
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:05,759
got almost over 30 years in the industry

2605
01:28:04,158 --> 01:28:07,679
my husband's been in the industry even

2606
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:09,119
longer than i have and between my

2607
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:10,800
husband and myself

2608
01:28:09,119 --> 01:28:12,158
i think we'll know almost everybody in

2609
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:12,880
the industry and if i don't know the

2610
01:28:12,158 --> 01:28:16,000
specialist

2611
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,920
he knows the specialist so again i i i

2612
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,800
have no problem passing people on to get

2613
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:20,960
the right people

2614
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:22,480
and you know it's like even if like a

2615
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:23,920
eggplant person honestly calls me and

2616
01:28:22,479 --> 01:28:25,039
they're like hey we have a commercial

2617
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,158

a vegetable specialist for greenhouse

2620
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,439
