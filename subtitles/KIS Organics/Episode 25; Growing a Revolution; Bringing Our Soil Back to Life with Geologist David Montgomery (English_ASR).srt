welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:24,059
science podcast I'm your host Todd

4
00:00:21,778 --> 00:00:25,829
Hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:27,329
podcast where we discussed the cutting

6
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,518
edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:31,320
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,359
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,850
share their wisdom and knowledge my

10
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,379
guest this week is David Montgomery

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,530
David studied geology at Stanford

12
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,359
University before earning his PhD in

13
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,100
geomorphology at UC Berkeley he teaches

14
00:00:42,359 --> 00:00:46,378
at the University of Washington where he

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,510
studies the evolution of topography and

16
00:00:46,378 --> 00:00:50,609
how geological processes shaped

17
00:00:48,509 --> 00:00:51,210
landscapes and influenced ecological

18
00:00:50,609 --> 00:00:53,670
systems

19
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,289
he loved maps as a kid and now writes

20
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,000
about the relationship of people to

21
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,730
their environment and other things that

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,590
interested in 2008 he was named a

23
00:00:59,729 --> 00:01:04,469
MacArthur Fellow he lives with his wife

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,000
and in Seattle Washington he's written

25
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,429
multiple books but the ones most

26
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,950
interesting to gardeners are dirt the

27
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,229
erosion of civilizations the hidden half

28
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,900
of nature and growing a revolution

29
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:18,359
bringing our soils back to life in dirt

30
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,460
the erosion of civilizations he explores

31
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:23,340
the compelling idea that we are and have

32
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:26,099
long been using up Earth's soil once

33
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:28,770
Bera protected vegetation and exposed to

34
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:31,019
wind and rain cultivated soils erode bit

35
00:01:28,769 --> 00:01:33,179
by bit slowly enough to be ignored in a

36
00:01:31,019 --> 00:01:35,039
single lifetime but fast enough over

37
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,799
centuries to limit the lifespan of

38
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,829
civilizations a rich mix of history

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,780
archaeology and geology dirt traces the

40
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:45,269
roll of soil use and abuse in the

41
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,210
history of Mesopotamia ancient Greece

42
00:01:45,269 --> 00:01:50,578
the Roman Empire China European

43
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:53,219
colonialism Central America and the

44
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:54,899
American push westward we see how soil

45
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:57,739
has shaped us and how we have shaped

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:02:00,840
soil as society after society has risen

47
00:01:57,739 --> 00:02:03,118
prospered and plowed through a natural

48
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,189
endowment of fertile dirt David

49
00:02:03,118 --> 00:02:07,590
Montgomery sees in the recent rise of

50
00:02:05,188 --> 00:02:10,049
organic and no-till farming the hope for

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,878
a new agricultural revolution that might

52
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:13,200
help us avoid the fate of previous

53
00:02:11,878 --> 00:02:15,449
civilizations

54
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:16,889
in the hidden half of nature which I

55
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,439
will discuss in more detail with his

56
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:21,839
wife and the clay who is a co-author and

57
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,579
also a biologist is a riveting

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,469
exploration of how microbes are

59
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,599
transforming the way we see nature and

60
00:02:25,469 --> 00:02:30,030
ourselves and could revolutionize

61
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:32,669
agriculture in medicine and in his most

62
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,439
recent book growing a revolution david

63
00:02:32,669 --> 00:02:36,329
introduces us to farmers around the

64
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:38,159
world at the heart of the brewing soil

65
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:40,170
health revolution that could help bring

66
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,989
humanity's ailing soil back to life

67
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:44,579
remarkably fast-growing a revolution

68
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,319
draws on visits to farms in the

69
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,510
industrialized world and developing

70
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:50,579
world to show that a new combination of

71
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:52,739
farming practices can deliver innovative

72
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,110
cost-effective solutions to problems

73
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,789
farmers face today I was honored to have

74
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,769
him take time out of his busy schedule

75
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:59,939
for this interview I hope you enjoy it

76
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:03,920
and you can find his books available

77
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:03,919
online at their website at

78
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:38,909
www.growingproduce.com older well sure

79
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:40,620
you know I came to that interest from a

80
00:03:38,909 --> 00:03:42,750
rather unusual route because

81
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,689
professionally I'm a geologist so I

82
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:48,090
study the way that Earth's surface

83
00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,370
features form the kind of geologist that

84
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,310
studies landscape evolution so you know

85
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,019
how rivers shape lowland terrain and

86
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,250
carve valleys out of mountains what

87
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,019
glaciers do to mountains

88
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,259
what limits the height the mountains

89
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:03,030
what creates pools for fish habitats and

90
00:04:01,259 --> 00:04:04,169
mountain streams in the northwest and

91
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:06,239
what happens to rivers and volcanoes

92
00:04:04,169 --> 00:04:08,789
explode all that great geological stuff

93
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,709
that impacts the surface of the earth

94
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:12,689
that we live on that we walk around on

95
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:14,099
and it shapes our not only our daily

96
00:04:12,689 --> 00:04:16,079
lives but you know really sort of the

97
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:17,850
whole lay of the land that we know as

98
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,038
our world so I've been fascinated by

99
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,140
that for four decades professionally and

100
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:24,478
the first thing you want to know about a

101
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:26,409
landscape as a geomorphologist that that

102
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:28,539
flavor of geologist that I am

103
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:30,880
is is their soil on the on the land

104
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,360
because it influences how things are

105
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,279
Road the shape of terrain it's sort of

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,889
the first thing you want to know and the

107
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:42,250
first issue you run into there is well

108
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:43,479
how fast the soil form was a format of

109
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:46,149
how does it form what are its properties

110
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,250
and how fast does it erode because it's

111
00:04:46,149 --> 00:04:50,949
that balance between soil production and

112
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:54,100
soil erosion that shapes how much soil

113
00:04:50,949 --> 00:04:55,810
we have on Earth's landscapes so I came

114
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,520
to the sort of an interest in the soil

115
00:04:55,810 --> 00:05:00,670
and an interest in farming and thinking

116
00:04:57,519 --> 00:05:03,490
about how agronomic practices affect the

117
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:05,319
cultivation of crops from a fairly

118
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,240
unusual direction for someone who thinks

119
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,579
about that stuff so I come from sort of

120
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,829
a bigger picture longer time frame and

121
00:05:09,579 --> 00:05:14,829
bottom-up perspectives rather than

122
00:05:11,829 --> 00:05:16,539
looking at it from the top down and so

123
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:19,569
you've sort of looked at it now from a

124
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:24,580
macroscopic and a microscopic level with

125
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:26,500
the books written yeah when you go into

126
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:28,539
looking at soil and thinking about what

127
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:31,269
makes it fertile and all this sort of

128
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:33,010
the complex relationships between plants

129
00:05:31,269 --> 00:05:35,079
you're growing in soil and what's going

130
00:05:33,009 --> 00:05:37,449
on around the root systems below ground

131
00:05:35,079 --> 00:05:41,019
you run right into the microbial world

132
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:43,240
that world of microscopic organisms that

133
00:05:41,019 --> 00:05:45,310
are you know can be a great benefit to

134
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,340
plants but you know that can also be

135
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:50,709
sources of pests and pathogens and my

136
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:52,659
wife who's a biologist and McClay and I

137
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:57,009
wrote the hidden half of nature about

138
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:59,380
that part of of the whole deal here and

139
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:02,289
so yeah I wouldn't have gone from the

140
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:04,149
broad picture down to worrying about

141
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:06,700
things so small we can't see them but

142
00:06:04,149 --> 00:06:08,918
they have big effects that that not only

143
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,110
affect how we can grow our our food and

144
00:06:08,918 --> 00:06:13,620
other crops but but the sort of the

145
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:16,449
shape and character of Earth's surface

146
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:18,970
so I'm fortunate enough to be able to

147
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:20,829
talk to an here soon regarding the

148
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,300
hidden half of nature so I'm looking

149
00:06:20,829 --> 00:06:24,430
forward to hearing about that book from

150
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,040
her but can you tell me a little bit

151
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,139
more about dirt and growing a revolution

152
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,660
and what inspired you to write these two

153
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:34,779
books yeah sure that you know there's

154
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,669
three books together form one and I sort

155
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:39,549
of partially jokingly call our dirt

156
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:40,449
trilogy because the the dirt book there

157
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:43,329
at the erosion of

158
00:06:40,449 --> 00:06:45,459
was the first one in it that I wrote it

159
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:47,919
came out about 10 years ago 2007 and

160
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:50,169
it's the book that I think helped pave

161
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,730
the way for MacArthur award that I got

162
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,170
back then basically I think on the

163
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:55,240
strength of that book and when I'd done

164
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:56,890
on the environmental history of salmon

165
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,319
that's a whole different story but that

166
00:06:56,889 --> 00:07:00,639
dirt book what it looks at is it's the

167
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:03,639
kind of book you might expect a

168
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,409
geologist to write about soils it's a

169
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:07,779
backwards looking book through history

170
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:10,180
that looks at what happened to ancient

171
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:12,009
civilizations that degraded their land

172
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,170
enough that it compromised their ability

173
00:07:12,009 --> 00:07:16,839
to grow their their food crops their

174
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:20,110
fabric crops their ability to support

175
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:22,810
themselves agronomically by degrading or

176
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,280
losing their soil and it traces that the

177
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,959
course in history of those kind of

178
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:29,729
interactions literally since the dawn of

179
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:32,529
Agriculture right on up through the the

180
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,509
post-war era in the 20th century when

181
00:07:32,529 --> 00:07:36,189
what we know today is modern

182
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:38,500
conventional agriculture the sort of

183
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:41,079
chemical intensive variety of

184
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,540
agriculture really came to be the norm

185
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:47,529
across conventional agronomy so it's a

186
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,990
broad sweeping view of the way that

187
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:52,149
humanity has related to the land

188
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:54,879
over the millennia and how the way we've

189
00:07:52,149 --> 00:07:57,699
treated the land has in turn influenced

190
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,269
the way that the soil has been able to

191
00:07:57,699 --> 00:08:03,099
support civilizations or not once the

192
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:05,349
land was degraded enough that it

193
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:07,870
undercut the ability of societies to

194
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:10,410
feed and provision themselves so it was

195
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,509
a fun look back through history that um

196
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:14,890
the bottom line is essentially societies

197
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:18,459
that didn't take care of their soil

198
00:08:14,889 --> 00:08:22,990
didn't last yeah that's really

199
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:26,169
interesting so as we move into an era of

200
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:29,829
modern agriculture here in sort of the

201
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:31,930
United States and Europe with the end of

202
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:36,039
I believe that was World War two when we

203
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,419
started to see a lot more of ammonium

204
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:39,959
nitrate and some of these fertilizers

205
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:44,949
being used in conventional agriculture

206
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:47,490
how how do you see that influencing our

207
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:49,629
society and the impact that it's had

208
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:52,409
moving forward

209
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:54,129
well you know there's one of the big

210
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:58,059
problems that we face in the 21st

211
00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:00,578
century is that the amount of really

212
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:02,229
productive farmland that we have has

213
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:04,479
been decreasing for the last 100 years

214
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:06,129
but actually big theme of the dirt books

215
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,379
has been decreasing for longer than that

216
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:08,919
but it's it's accelerated in the 20th

217
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,198
century

218
00:09:08,919 --> 00:09:13,019
whereas our human the global human

219
00:09:11,198 --> 00:09:15,490
population is going up at the same time

220
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,740
projected over the next half century to

221
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,209
century and those curves are working

222
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,470
against each other where if we're it's

223
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:22,149
going to become harder and harder to

224
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,490
feed everybody if we have more people in

225
00:09:22,149 --> 00:09:27,759
less land that's in good fertile shape

226
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:29,889
to do it so that that's one of the big

227
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:33,009
concerns and one of the other concerns

228
00:09:29,889 --> 00:09:35,470
is that the ways that we've practiced

229
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:37,240
agriculture with in the modern world

230
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,990
with intensive tillage intensive

231
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:42,879
fertilization and and pesticide use

232
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:44,169
really compromises all that soil life

233
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,289
that you'll talk with Ann about when you

234
00:09:44,169 --> 00:09:50,708
talk about the hidden half of nature and

235
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:53,289
all those microbes live on the organic

236
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:54,849
matter in the soil and modern agronomic

237
00:09:53,289 --> 00:09:56,669
practices have reduced that on average

238
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:59,709
around the world by about 50 percent

239
00:09:56,669 --> 00:10:02,379
roughly half of the organic matter that

240
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:04,419
was in US topsoil that was you know when

241
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:06,818
we were originally breaking ground to

242
00:10:04,419 --> 00:10:09,458
farm it about half of it's gone so we've

243
00:10:06,818 --> 00:10:11,860
drawn down the the fertility batteries

244
00:10:09,458 --> 00:10:13,719
if you will of our nation's soils by

245
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:17,079
about half and that number is roughly

246
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,519
about right for the world - and that's a

247
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:20,799
great concern if when you think about

248
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,019
the problem of feeding the future and it

249
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,059
also comes into concern and when we

250
00:10:23,019 --> 00:10:27,188
think about the quality of crops because

251
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:29,859
it's the interaction there's a lot of

252
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:33,938
interactions between soil life and plant

253
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:36,339
roots that help influence the way that

254
00:10:33,938 --> 00:10:38,528
mineral micronutrients get into plants

255
00:10:36,339 --> 00:10:41,920
the things that build enzymes and that

256
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,838
build healthy plant bodies that are

257
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:46,120
versatile on their own defensive systems

258
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,490
and it also affects phytochemical

259
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,528
production in terms of the kinds and

260
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,839
amounts of chemicals the plants

261
00:10:50,528 --> 00:10:54,730
themselves produce which can affect

262
00:10:52,839 --> 00:10:57,160
their nutritional quality for us or

263
00:10:54,730 --> 00:11:00,600
their medicinal properties and in other

264
00:10:57,159 --> 00:11:03,278
in other arenas and in non-food crops

265
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,829
but we've been learning that the

266
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:09,429
way that we grow our crops or the health

267
00:11:05,828 --> 00:11:11,588
of the soil we grow them in can have a

268
00:11:09,429 --> 00:11:14,498
big effect on the quality of the stuff

269
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:17,050
that comes out now I did a previous

270
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:18,790
podcast with Steve Solomon who was the

271
00:11:17,049 --> 00:11:20,859
author of the intelligent gardener and

272
00:11:18,789 --> 00:11:22,899
gardening west of the Cascades which is

273
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:27,278
a really popular book here in the

274
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:31,379
northwest and one of his influences was

275
00:11:27,278 --> 00:11:35,289
Weston Price and his oh yeah in his book

276
00:11:31,379 --> 00:11:38,528
on remineralization I guess in soils and

277
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:41,730
how the soil in a certain area would

278
00:11:38,528 --> 00:11:44,470
affect a cultures dental health

279
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,509
what are your findings in terms of

280
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,360
mineral levels in soil because you're

281
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:51,009
mentioning phytochemicals and other

282
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,709
influences that the nutrients in

283
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:55,480
different soils are having on plants

284
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:57,878
yeah you know Western price and his work

285
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:00,039
is very interesting as were others of

286
00:11:57,879 --> 00:12:04,120
his peers in that era in the 20s 30s and

287
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:06,969
40s because it's very difficult today to

288
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,828
get good sort of population level data

289
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,410
to try and connect the health of the

290
00:12:08,828 --> 00:12:13,138
soil to the health of people and they

291
00:12:11,409 --> 00:12:15,370
were there's some examples of dental

292
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:17,589
records and other things from back in

293
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:19,209
his era but today one of the problems is

294
00:12:17,589 --> 00:12:20,680
that you know you walk into a grocery

295
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:24,458
store and there's food from all over the

296
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:26,109
world and so you know very few people in

297
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:28,448
the developed world are eating food

298
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:29,860
that's you know primarily grown in soils

299
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:32,649
that you can identify where it came from

300
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:35,740
did it come from a good healthy soil and

301
00:12:32,649 --> 00:12:38,649
in a field off of a farm or did it come

302
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:40,839
from a very degraded farm or a farm in a

303
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,399
very degraded part of the world so it's

304
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:43,839
hard to connect it's hard to get studies

305
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,339
that connect those dots today but

306
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,860
there's some very interesting ones back

307
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,509
in prices day where you could make that

308
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,699
assumption that people were eating food

309
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:54,188
that was grown fairly locally to where

310
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:56,979
they lived so you could examine you know

311
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:59,828
broad scale impacts of things like the

312
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:01,808
the geology the kind of rocks in a

313
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:03,729
region and it were they calcium Richard

314
00:13:01,808 --> 00:13:05,620
is a calcium poor for example in the

315
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:07,329
dental studies and attract through to

316
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:11,188
sort of affect to affect dental health

317
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:13,928
in ways that were we're fairly clear

318
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:16,178
might be fairly crude studies by today's

319
00:13:13,928 --> 00:13:17,199
standards of science but they were

320
00:13:16,178 --> 00:13:20,799
they're interesting

321
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,050
and fairly clear in my view and that

322
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:26,229
opens questions about you know how much

323
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:28,179
does the way we grow our food and the

324
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,980
places that we grow it and how much of

325
00:13:28,179 --> 00:13:32,889
the character of those processes and

326
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:35,080
those those places really translate into

327
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:37,509
things like the mineral density and the

328
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,639
foods that we eat and how does that

329
00:13:37,509 --> 00:13:41,470
translate into health effects for us and

330
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:42,819
Ann and I are working on a new book

331
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,529
that's going to be looking into that

332
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,690
kind of stuff

333
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,949
in as much detail as we can find out

334
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,470
there in the literature as we pull it

335
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:52,140
together but we're literally in the

336
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:55,060
early stages of working on that book oh

337
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,490
that's great I'm really excited to see

338
00:13:55,059 --> 00:13:59,619
how that turns out there just isn't

339
00:13:57,490 --> 00:14:01,840
enough research out there that I've seen

340
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:03,610
at least on human nutrition and its

341
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,920
relation to soil and you've sort of

342
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,460
touched on it in all of your books to a

343
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,379
certain extent especially in the hidden

344
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,300
half

345
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:15,129
yeah we've dug into it in way to the

346
00:14:13,299 --> 00:14:17,079
extent that we could find things and to

347
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:19,360
the extent of those things mapped on to

348
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:21,340
our sort of plan for the arc and flow of

349
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,019
those books and the topics we hit on and

350
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,060
the hidden half is where we got closest

351
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:28,629
to it because we talked about the way

352
00:14:25,059 --> 00:14:31,269
that bacteria and microbes will fungi in

353
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,460
the soil helped to provision mineral

354
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:35,139
elements or to grab them out of mineral

355
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,860
particles in the soil and get them into

356
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:42,730
crops and yeah there needs to be more

357
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:47,050
data that looks at the effect of how we

358
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:49,060
grow food on those on the mineral

359
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:51,789
micronutrients on the phytochemicals the

360
00:14:49,059 --> 00:14:54,759
kind of things in through in plants that

361
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:57,519
we know should be affected by agronomic

362
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:00,819
practices but for which nutritionists

363
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:02,590
don't tend to identify them as as

364
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:04,420
nutrients because there might

365
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,700
micronutrients we don't need very much

366
00:15:04,419 --> 00:15:07,990
or in the case of phytochemicals they're

367
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,490
not really sure what the column are

368
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,210
consider them even though they have

369
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:15,430
demonstrated human health benefits in

370
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,530
other studies so yeah there needs to be

371
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:20,709
a lot more research and look at that

372
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:22,120
it's a fascinating topic but yeah we

373
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,000
touched a bit on it in the hidden half

374
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,470
as I'm sure you'll talk with her about

375
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,330
but there's a lot more that can be dug

376
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:30,399
into and so we're trying to synthesize

377
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,900
as much of that information as we can

378
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:35,899
get our hand

379
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:37,879
yeah it makes me wonder what the future

380
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:40,759
of Agriculture really holds in terms of

381
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:42,320
consumer perception if at some point in

382
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:44,000
time we'll go into the grocery store and

383
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,280
we'll have conventionally grown produce

384
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,259
and we'll have organic produce and maybe

385
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,389
we'll have nutrient-dense produce or

386
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:53,509
similar to the wine industry where

387
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:56,569
certain areas are renowned for their

388
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:58,909
terroir or their mineral content in

389
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:00,920
their soils we you know we may see

390
00:15:58,909 --> 00:16:02,480
something similar in terms of vegetables

391
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:05,479
that are grown in a particular region or

392
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:08,509
grown in a particular manner something

393
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:10,789
like yeah yeah no I know if you look out

394
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:12,610
20 if you look out like 20 or 30 years I

395
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:15,110
would forecast that there's going to be

396
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:17,269
much more in the way of what you might

397
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:20,149
think of like supply chain information

398
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:22,159
on where your food came from and how it

399
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:23,899
was grown at the point of purchase so

400
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,939
you might be able to you know scan a

401
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:28,879
code that would tell you oh this is from

402
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:30,770
s.x farm and it has this much zinc and

403
00:16:28,879 --> 00:16:32,600
this much beta-carotene for carrots or

404
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:34,279
something and you could compare this

405
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,019
batch of carrots over here labeled

406
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:38,149
whatever it is organic or regenerative

407
00:16:36,019 --> 00:16:40,759
or conventional versus that batch of

408
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:43,689
carrots over there and try and actually

409
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:46,970
assess what's the quality of the product

410
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:50,120
as opposed to all we really know today

411
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:51,769
walking into a food store is you know

412
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,500
okay was what's it labeled as a label

413
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:58,069
organic is a label conventional and

414
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,870
there's a huge spectrum of practices in

415
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:02,060
both those arenas convention of

416
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:03,830
conventional AG and organic agriculture

417
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:05,720
and that's a lot of what I wrote about

418
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:08,480
in the the latest book growing a

419
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:10,610
revolution where I was looking at

420
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,470
farmers who had adopted practices that

421
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:15,649
rebuilt the fertility of their soil and

422
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,240
how that affected their their crop

423
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:19,100
yields their diesel used their

424
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,250
fertilizer use their pesticide use their

425
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:25,309
profitability but we didn't end up

426
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:27,619
looking at the quality of the produce

427
00:17:25,309 --> 00:17:31,069
because there wasn't I had a hard time

428
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:32,539
finding enough data to to weave in along

429
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:34,609
with all the other stuff I was looking

430
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:36,230
at which is why Ann and I are taking on

431
00:17:34,609 --> 00:17:38,059
this new project to try and see what

432
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:39,470
kind of data is come to light in the

433
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:44,119
last couple years since I did the

434
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,929
research for grower evolution but in you

435
00:17:44,119 --> 00:17:46,038
know in really

436
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:49,190
a Shinto I think some of your listeners

437
00:17:46,038 --> 00:17:51,019
might be even more interested in it I

438
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:53,600
was really quite surprised to find that

439
00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:55,730
in the cannabis industry they're way

440
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,980
ahead of the vegetable industry in

441
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:01,610
testing the phytochemical abundance and

442
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,710
their products and I would love to see

443
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:07,368
the day when tomatoes would come with

444
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:09,379
the kind of labels that are Gard now

445
00:18:07,368 --> 00:18:12,439
common in the in states where cannabis

446
00:18:09,378 --> 00:18:13,519
has been legalized yeah that's really

447
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,278
interesting I know there are some

448
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:19,548
challenges right now around the testing

449
00:18:16,278 --> 00:18:21,710
methodologies and and how much we can

450
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:24,859
trust these tests from the various labs

451
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:27,980
that we're getting that yeah I would

452
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:29,689
imagine yeah but at least the the

453
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:31,399
testing protocols are there and there's

454
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:34,220
requirements around testing that I think

455
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:36,678
are really important so when it seemed

456
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:39,019
it seems like there's consumer interest

457
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,999
in knowing things like the terpene

458
00:18:39,019 --> 00:18:43,909
profiles of cannabis sort of what are

459
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:46,548
the what are the active ingredients in

460
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:48,409
the phytochemicals that affect the

461
00:18:46,548 --> 00:18:50,179
nature of the product whereas for

462
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:52,519
tomatoes there's no such information

463
00:18:50,179 --> 00:18:54,048
available to consumers at all and yet it

464
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:57,138
would relates directly the flavor and

465
00:18:54,048 --> 00:19:00,168
helpfulness yeah as someone who has an

466
00:18:57,138 --> 00:19:02,269
edible nursery in sells produce I you

467
00:19:00,169 --> 00:19:04,820
know we carried a variety of plants of a

468
00:19:02,269 --> 00:19:06,288
particular you know a particular type so

469
00:19:04,819 --> 00:19:07,428
we have all these different Tomatoes and

470
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:08,898
when you read about a description of

471
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,528
tomato you may hear that this particular

472
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:15,258
one is higher in phytonutrients for

473
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:16,730
example and you know we'll grow it but

474
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:18,470
we don't really know we're not actually

475
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:20,419
testing that tomato to see if these

476
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:22,038
claims are true or what levels the

477
00:19:20,419 --> 00:19:25,730
differences there may act it may be so

478
00:19:22,038 --> 00:19:26,808
minor that it's not even worth not even

479
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,409
worth mentioning but we don't really

480
00:19:26,808 --> 00:19:33,618
know right yeah we're how or how much

481
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:35,450
how you grow it affects the expression

482
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:38,599
of those fight okay those phytochemicals

483
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:40,340
and phytonutrients and that's that's

484
00:19:38,599 --> 00:19:41,449
something where I think that you were

485
00:19:40,339 --> 00:19:42,798
talking about the future of Agriculture

486
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,929
a minute ago and I think in the one

487
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:47,089
level there's this sort of there will be

488
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:49,820
more consumer interest in understanding

489
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:54,709
what is in things but I also think there

490
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:57,849
will be opportunities to explore the

491
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:59,529
degree to which the style of growing

492
00:19:57,849 --> 00:20:01,808
actually affects the expression of

493
00:19:59,529 --> 00:20:03,308
phytonutrients as opposed to just the

494
00:20:01,808 --> 00:20:05,379
hard-baked genetics in different

495
00:20:03,308 --> 00:20:07,119
varieties of crops and you could think

496
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,559
of them as those there are two different

497
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:10,719
dimensions that could be explored

498
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:13,928
agronomically once the crop breeding to

499
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:15,759
manipulate the genetics and the basic

500
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:17,110
practices of how do you treat the soil

501
00:20:15,759 --> 00:20:18,849
you know are you what are you

502
00:20:17,109 --> 00:20:20,798
fertilizing it with are you disturbing

503
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:22,659
the ground surface are you returning the

504
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:23,440
crop residue from the same plant to the

505
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:25,360
same fields

506
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:29,470
do you have other plants growing along

507
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:31,089
in the same soil over time those kind of

508
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:34,480
things are sort of this whole other

509
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:35,769
dimension in to explore in terms of the

510
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:39,159
phytochemical to find a nutrient

511
00:20:35,769 --> 00:20:41,048
expression in in crops so when you wrote

512
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,539
growing a revolution you got to travel

513
00:20:41,048 --> 00:20:46,750
around and visit a lot of these farms if

514
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:48,129
I remember correctly and yeah can you

515
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:49,990
touch on a little bit of some of the

516
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:52,710
different practices that you saw you

517
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:56,919
know the good the bad what really was

518
00:20:52,710 --> 00:21:00,460
what was really working out there sure I

519
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:01,690
mean yeah I what what annal talk to you

520
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,579
about in talking about the hidden half

521
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:06,159
of nature's how she restored the soil

522
00:21:03,579 --> 00:21:08,798
and its fertility in our yard with her

523
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,740
with her gardening practice and and her

524
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:13,389
mulching and her composting and I was

525
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,880
watching this after writing the dirt

526
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:17,980
book about how ancient societies had

527
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,840
destroyed and degraded their land and

528
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:22,919
Anna's turning that whole story around

529
00:21:19,839 --> 00:21:25,389
on his head right and in my backyard and

530
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:27,009
you know it took me a while to sort of

531
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,230
clue in and watch and it took her a

532
00:21:27,009 --> 00:21:31,359
while to notice the changes but they

533
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,940
happened really remarkably fast as I'm

534
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:35,949
sure you guys will talk about um but I

535
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,990
came away from that experience wondering

536
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:40,990
okay what to what degree could similar

537
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:43,569
kinds of practices bring the fertility

538
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:46,210
of our cropland or agricultural soils

539
00:21:43,569 --> 00:21:48,038
back how how long could would it take

540
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,329
could it be done at scale could you

541
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:51,640
doing on big farms because you have

542
00:21:49,329 --> 00:21:53,859
little farms so I took six months off

543
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,320
from teaching at the University of

544
00:21:53,859 --> 00:21:58,949
Washington where I work and visited

545
00:21:56,319 --> 00:22:02,769
farms around the world that had adopted

546
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:04,870
practices to prioritize rebuilding the

547
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:08,190
health of their soil and thereby the

548
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:10,959
fertility of their land and I went to

549
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,710
farms in the Dakotas North and South

550
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,179
Dakota

551
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:19,269
to Ohio and Saskatchewan I went to Costa

552
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:22,059
Rica and equatorial West Africa and

553
00:22:19,269 --> 00:22:24,038
looked at farms that ranged from 20

554
00:22:22,058 --> 00:22:27,849
thousand acres in size for really big

555
00:22:24,038 --> 00:22:30,398
industrialized farms in the Dakotas and

556
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:34,349
then also really small subsistence farms

557
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:38,739
and in Costa Rica and in an in Ghana and

558
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:41,288
when I came away with was the

559
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:44,079
realization that there's a simple set of

560
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:46,808
principles fairly high-level agronomic

561
00:22:44,079 --> 00:22:49,689
principles that if adopted all together

562
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:51,970
as a system really our recipe for

563
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:53,320
cultivating the kinds of beneficial soil

564
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:55,120
life that antal tell you all about

565
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:57,480
because after all she's the biologist in

566
00:22:55,119 --> 00:23:00,099
our in our household on the geologist

567
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:01,599
but there's a set of agronomic practices

568
00:23:00,099 --> 00:23:03,969
that really cultivate that beneficial

569
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:06,069
life that are pretty simple conceptually

570
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,919
it's minimize the disturbance of the

571
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:10,538
soil it's always keep the ground covered

572
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:14,080
with cover crops or some of a living

573
00:23:10,538 --> 00:23:16,690
plant no bare soil don't farm naked

574
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:18,428
always keep the ground covered and the

575
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:20,140
third principle being grow a diversity

576
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:22,450
of things don't just grow one or two

577
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:24,640
crops in the same soil because over time

578
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:27,038
that is an invitation for pests and

579
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,110
pathogens to take root but so either

580
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:32,408
grow a diversity of crops around your

581
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:35,259
cash crop or in a rotation in between

582
00:23:32,409 --> 00:23:36,789
your cash crops and you know those three

583
00:23:35,259 --> 00:23:39,129
simple principles were the common

584
00:23:36,788 --> 00:23:41,288
elements that every farmer I visited

585
00:23:39,130 --> 00:23:43,510
that had restored

586
00:23:41,288 --> 00:23:45,839
you'll remarkably turn their soil around

587
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:48,579
within a decade or two they'd all

588
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:50,379
adopted practices that were faithful to

589
00:23:48,579 --> 00:23:52,449
those principles now

590
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,799
the practices they had in different

591
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:55,390
parts of the world they were different

592
00:23:53,798 --> 00:23:57,369
so you know the guys in Ghana we're not

593
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:59,380
doing the same things as the people in

594
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:02,709
Costa Rica or the people in the Dakotas

595
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:04,120
or Ohio they each had their own specific

596
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:07,028
style of practices to minimize

597
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:09,099
disturbance and to keep the ground

598
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:11,769
covered and to get a diversity in there

599
00:24:09,099 --> 00:24:13,389
but those those 40,000 foot high-level

600
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:16,148
principles were honored across the board

601
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,940
in those systems and they had exhibited

602
00:24:16,148 --> 00:24:20,739
remarkable transformations over you know

603
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:23,230
what a geologist considers to be a

604
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:25,149
really short period of time so I was

605
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:27,278
really impressed with how fast

606
00:24:25,148 --> 00:24:29,888
a different style of thinking about the

607
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,200
soil is the foundation for agriculture

608
00:24:29,888 --> 00:24:34,838
but how big a difference that could make

609
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,879
and it scales from you know our yard in

610
00:24:34,838 --> 00:24:38,469
North Seattle to these 20,000 acre farms

611
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:40,658
and the Dakotas and there's all kinds of

612
00:24:38,469 --> 00:24:42,489
side benefits that come with it in terms

613
00:24:40,659 --> 00:24:45,489
of reduced fertilizer use reduced

614
00:24:42,489 --> 00:24:49,079
pesticide use reduce diesel use and when

615
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:51,879
you look at sort of modern big scale

616
00:24:49,079 --> 00:24:53,949
commodity crop production farms in the

617
00:24:51,878 --> 00:24:56,019
u.s. at least those are the key

618
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:58,389
expensive items on the farms if you can

619
00:24:56,019 --> 00:25:00,638
cut those expenses and keep the yields

620
00:24:58,388 --> 00:25:03,728
up it's a recipe for a more profitable

621
00:25:00,638 --> 00:25:06,008
farm and that's where I turned into an

622
00:25:03,729 --> 00:25:08,830
optimist on this stuff yeah and in that

623
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:10,829
sense as a geologist can you go into a

624
00:25:08,829 --> 00:25:14,439
little bit more why it is important to

625
00:25:10,829 --> 00:25:16,329
not disturb the soil and why it's

626
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,129
important to cover the soil I think

627
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:20,798
those two especially from a geological

628
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:22,748
perspective are really interesting yeah

629
00:25:20,798 --> 00:25:24,190
you know if you if you go out into the

630
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:26,469
woods somewhere and you dig a hole and

631
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:27,879
you look at the profile of the soil so

632
00:25:26,469 --> 00:25:29,200
you like clean off face off and just

633
00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,819
look at the wall of the hole that you

634
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,588
dug and look at the nature of the soil

635
00:25:30,819 --> 00:25:34,418
there's generally a lot of organic

636
00:25:32,588 --> 00:25:36,158
matter on top and the farther down you

637
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:39,489
go you got more mineral matter more

638
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:42,940
broken up rocks and if you think of what

639
00:25:39,489 --> 00:25:45,879
makes soil fertile it's that marriage of

640
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:49,239
geology and biology the mixing of the

641
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:52,748
dead parts of rocks and when with the

642
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:55,298
living stuff of live organisms or the

643
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:57,278
once living organic matter you know

644
00:25:55,298 --> 00:26:01,658
rotting leaves animal carcasses the

645
00:25:57,278 --> 00:26:04,179
whole sort of all the stuff that plants

646
00:26:01,659 --> 00:26:06,159
animals rot into it's that combination

647
00:26:04,179 --> 00:26:08,369
of organic matter and mineral matter

648
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:13,989
that makes a healthy fertile soil and

649
00:26:08,368 --> 00:26:15,908
the most the lion share of fertility in

650
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:18,639
the soils in that surface layer that the

651
00:26:15,909 --> 00:26:20,229
topsoil but it's only about you know six

652
00:26:18,638 --> 00:26:23,348
to twelve inches thick in most places

653
00:26:20,229 --> 00:26:24,700
it's a fairly thin and fragile layer on

654
00:26:23,348 --> 00:26:27,638
the surface of the earth before you get

655
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,259
down into the the subsoil which has far

656
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:31,329
less fertility in it and then get down

657
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:33,819
to the bedrock which you know it's hard

658
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:35,648
to grow plants just and on bedrock some

659
00:26:33,819 --> 00:26:38,689
plants can do it but those tend to be

660
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:40,849
pioneers not the ones we grow for crops

661
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,549
and so if you think about soil is this

662
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:46,279
fairly thin and fragile layer that coats

663
00:26:43,549 --> 00:26:49,250
the surface of the earth that is the the

664
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:51,049
recycling engine for turning all the

665
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:53,240
nutrients that are held in living

666
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:55,279
organisms plants and animals back into

667
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,170
the raw materials to feed the next

668
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,940
generation of living organisms through

669
00:26:57,170 --> 00:27:00,230
the way plants take the stuff up through

670
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:02,690
the roots and then herbivores eat the

671
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:05,029
plants and carnivores eat the herbivores

672
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:09,320
and the whole circle of life goes around

673
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:10,910
and around again soil is a pretty

674
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:13,460
fundamental resource when you think

675
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:15,230
about it that way and yet the big

676
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,850
degrade the history of humanity for the

677
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,490
last ten thousand years that we've been

678
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:23,809
mining soil fertility to feed ourselves

679
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:26,480
in regions around the world and now that

680
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:28,549
we have in a global civilization where

681
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,740
regional food shortages translate into

682
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:34,250
global crises whether through refugees

683
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:35,779
or economic crises and and they're the

684
00:27:34,250 --> 00:27:37,460
roots of some of the the big modern

685
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:41,389
conflicts around the world can be traced

686
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:43,309
to land degradation and conflict over

687
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:47,690
land you know just look at the Middle

688
00:27:43,309 --> 00:27:50,869
East today the soils going to become an

689
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:52,759
increasingly important touchstone and

690
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:55,189
resource for humanity through this

691
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:56,839
century because it's of its very

692
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:59,120
fundamental nature to maintaining

693
00:27:56,839 --> 00:28:00,799
agronomic productivity and production

694
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:02,689
and now I've rambled enough that I

695
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:04,759
forgot where your question was well I

696
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,890
was looking at it no I I found that

697
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,430
really fascinating and I also think it's

698
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:12,470
very interesting how when you look at

699
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,480
culture I was an anthropology major at

700
00:28:12,470 --> 00:28:15,710
the University of Washington so my own

701
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,809
ok great

702
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:19,370
yes all right I looked at it from a

703
00:28:17,809 --> 00:28:22,399
cultural perspective but if we look at

704
00:28:19,369 --> 00:28:26,329
how soil influenced culture it helped

705
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:29,480
and how you know societies grew up based

706
00:28:26,329 --> 00:28:31,099
on you know the fertility of the land I

707
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,329
mean agriculture was sort of what

708
00:28:31,099 --> 00:28:34,549
allowed us to make that next

709
00:28:32,329 --> 00:28:37,129
evolutionary step in a lot of ways from

710
00:28:34,549 --> 00:28:39,409
a cultural yeah so I mean we can note

711
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:41,740
that for that you know there's there's

712
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:44,960
whole courses on just that topic so oh

713
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:46,609
yeah you know the the sort of the food I

714
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,160
like to think of us having gone through

715
00:28:46,609 --> 00:28:50,869
four major agricultural revolutions so

716
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,710
far in the first one we're just thinking

717
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:53,418
about a trio

718
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:56,329
doing agriculture in the first place it

719
00:28:53,419 --> 00:28:58,190
was a it was a radical act and in the

720
00:28:56,329 --> 00:29:00,699
dirt book I talk about the early origin

721
00:28:58,190 --> 00:29:04,190
of agriculture in the Middle East and

722
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:07,788
how it was a process that was in many

723
00:29:04,190 --> 00:29:10,070
ways driven by desperation due to a

724
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:12,589
client due to climate shift coming out

725
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:14,389
of the last ice age there was a cold

726
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:16,308
snap that the the climate in the Middle

727
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:18,740
East snapped back to full-on glacial for

728
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:21,079
about a thousand years at a time when

729
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:25,038
the the hunter-gatherers in that region

730
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:27,048
had come to rely on the new plants and

731
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:30,349
animals of the warming then warming

732
00:29:27,048 --> 00:29:31,849
climate and that all of us in there back

733
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:33,678
to full glacial conditions and their

734
00:29:31,849 --> 00:29:36,528
food sources disappeared except for

735
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:38,600
grasses and that's when we started

736
00:29:36,528 --> 00:29:41,839
cultivating grains like the proto embers

737
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:45,589
and wheats and things that there was a

738
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:48,528
big problem in terms of feeding oneself

739
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:50,449
with in the shrieking shrinking resource

740
00:29:48,528 --> 00:29:52,880
base but once people started

741
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:56,149
intentionally collecting and hybrid and

742
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,340
hybridizing and planting seeds pretty

743
00:29:56,148 --> 00:30:01,369
good at growing food and the population

744
00:29:58,339 --> 00:30:03,048
was able to sort grow and increase and

745
00:30:01,369 --> 00:30:05,178
we've gotten better and better and

746
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:07,609
better at having fewer and fewer people

747
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:10,309
grow more and more food so that today

748
00:30:07,609 --> 00:30:12,439
instead of you know 99% of us being

749
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:14,210
farmers in the United States 1% of us

750
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,730
are farmers we've kind of totally

751
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,440
flipped the ratios in terms of who's

752
00:30:16,730 --> 00:30:20,390
feeding how many people over the course

753
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:22,070
of agricultural history and that of

754
00:30:20,390 --> 00:30:23,929
course lets people like me you know be

755
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:25,099
things like professors at universities

756
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,278
because I don't have to be out working

757
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:29,839
in the fields all the time so a bit

758
00:30:28,278 --> 00:30:32,720
major first step on the road to

759
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:34,970
civilization was was was agriculture and

760
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,538
the audacious act of planting and

761
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,808
tending our food sources as opposed to

762
00:30:38,538 --> 00:30:45,528
just gathering them from you know keen

763
00:30:41,808 --> 00:30:47,599
observational experience in nature and

764
00:30:45,528 --> 00:30:49,130
that I would think the second

765
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,699
agricultural revolution was when we

766
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:54,679
learned how to do things like plant

767
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,019
legumes and crop rotations and rotate

768
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,409
our crops say manure the field things

769
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:02,929
that boost helped to boost soil

770
00:31:00,409 --> 00:31:05,660
fertility through acts of soil husbandry

771
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:07,370
and those were identified by

772
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,140
societies around the world and they

773
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:10,699
became traditional and you'll notice

774
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:12,020
that two of those three principles a

775
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,309
minute mentioned earlier you know

776
00:31:12,019 --> 00:31:15,829
keeping the ground covered with cover

777
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:17,960
crops and having a diverse rotation

778
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:20,809
these are old ideas there's not new

779
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:21,110
ideas societies around the world adopted

780
00:31:20,809 --> 00:31:23,599
them

781
00:31:21,109 --> 00:31:26,089
what's brand new is taking those old

782
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:28,039
ideas of soil husbandry and coupling

783
00:31:26,089 --> 00:31:30,909
them with things like no-till farming

784
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:34,159
that allows us to farm without the plow

785
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:36,380
and that's important because if you plow

786
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:39,650
the surface of the earth and you invert

787
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:41,810
the soil you turn it over it leaves it

788
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,930
bare and vulnerable to erosion by wind

789
00:31:41,809 --> 00:31:47,179
or rain for until the next crop comes in

790
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:50,090
or the or the or weeds take over your

791
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:51,620
field whatever comes in next if you get

792
00:31:50,089 --> 00:31:54,679
a good rainstorm when the ground is

793
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:57,679
ground is bare you get that phenomenon

794
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:59,450
I'm sure that we've all seen of like run

795
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,310
off a construction site where they've

796
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,799
stripped off the vegetation you got bare

797
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:06,200
earth to get raining a muddy muddy water

798
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:08,419
running off well that's fertility just

799
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,490
going right down the drain and that's

800
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:13,370
the story of farming in many ancient

801
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:15,529
societies that relied on the plow for

802
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:18,559
weed control and preparing their seed

803
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:21,649
beds is that over the generations they

804
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:23,690
literally lost their topsoil and then

805
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:25,700
the third agricultural revolution to go

806
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:27,740
back to that thread was mechanization

807
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:30,289
and and the use of chemical fertilizers

808
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:32,480
in the 19th and 20th centuries in the

809
00:32:30,289 --> 00:32:34,159
20th century we then got on to sort of

810
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:37,250
the biotechnology revolution was the

811
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:39,050
fourth revolution looking at the so

812
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:41,119
called green revolution and the

813
00:32:39,049 --> 00:32:43,159
development of GMO crops and so forth in

814
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,379
the agro tech business and I think we're

815
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:48,850
poised now for actually a fifth

816
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:51,440
agricultural revolution that's built on

817
00:32:48,849 --> 00:32:53,839
identifying practices that build the

818
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:56,809
health of the soil as the foundation for

819
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:59,419
a sustainable agriculture not to abandon

820
00:32:56,809 --> 00:33:01,700
modern technology but to essentially

821
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:03,440
integrate the best of modern technology

822
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,539
with the best of ancient wisdom and soil

823
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,250
husbandry in a new system of farming

824
00:33:05,539 --> 00:33:08,930
that honors those three principles so

825
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,700
that's that's where I kind of ended up

826
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:13,820
in the growing revolution book is that

827
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:16,880
we've got an opportunity to rethink how

828
00:33:13,819 --> 00:33:19,609
we look at the soil in agriculture and

829
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,440
that that's you know

830
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,079
a huge opportunity for Humanity the

831
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,759
century to try and get it right this

832
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:28,579
time

833
00:33:24,759 --> 00:33:30,048
so what would you say to people on the

834
00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:32,928
other side of the coin that maybe

835
00:33:30,048 --> 00:33:35,710
looking at the future of agriculture

836
00:33:32,929 --> 00:33:40,370
from the perspective of hydroponics and

837
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:43,190
nutrient solutions that are specifically

838
00:33:40,369 --> 00:33:46,609
created for crops you know and in many

839
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:49,700
cases GMO crops moving it further and

840
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:51,589
further away from organics yeah you know

841
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:54,500
that's a sort of a big debate and I are

842
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:56,959
starting to gather data and to look at

843
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,190
some of those issues for the new book

844
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,110
that we're starting to work on on

845
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,240
relating soil health to human health so

846
00:34:00,109 --> 00:34:04,399
everything I say will be provisional

847
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,919
until we dive in and sort out as much as

848
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:09,559
we can but Kay you based on the work

849
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:13,940
we've done in previous books you've got

850
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:17,559
to wonder about the you know if you're

851
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:19,639
growing plants in a non soil medium

852
00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:23,840
you're just you're growing them either

853
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:25,250
really hydroponically or in a medium

854
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:30,108
that's not really soil where you just

855
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:31,639
have a like a sand or coconut fiber or

856
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:33,199
some substrate that's there to hold the

857
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:36,940
roots up and then you're adding

858
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,529
everything to the mix to grow your plant

859
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,599
what are you missing in terms of the

860
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,609
interaction of that plant with the

861
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:46,069
microbes in the root system of that

862
00:34:43,608 --> 00:34:48,409
plant and and I'm sure tell you a lot

863
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:50,059
more about the the exudates the plants

864
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:51,440
push out into the soil and the things

865
00:34:50,059 --> 00:34:53,869
the microbes make from them that the

866
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:55,668
plants take back up that shapes to fight

867
00:34:53,869 --> 00:34:57,320
a chemical abundance and profile and

868
00:34:55,668 --> 00:34:58,909
plants and them and their mineral

869
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,700
micronutrient concentrations their

870
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:04,099
nutrient density there's what we know

871
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:06,858
enough about the relationship of plants

872
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,839
to their microbiome their microbiology

873
00:35:06,858 --> 00:35:10,009
and that surrounds them in the soil to

874
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,600
know that there's connections between

875
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,780
the state of the soil and what's getting

876
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,250
into plants and so if you then remove

877
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:18,260
soil from the equation or you remove

878
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:21,409
that life from the equation and you just

879
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:22,910
say add zinc or copper or whatever

880
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:26,690
micronutrients you want to add and just

881
00:35:22,909 --> 00:35:28,849
the right proportions for your crop how

882
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:30,829
much are they taking up how much how

883
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:32,690
important was the role of soil life in

884
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,269
actually getting the plants to absorb

885
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:35,309
the

886
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:37,500
nutrients so there's questions there in

887
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:39,570
terms of what the basic effects are but

888
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:43,250
if you look at the problem of say like

889
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:45,450
growing on a lettuce in US in a city and

890
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:48,989
you look at it from an energetic

891
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:53,189
perspective if you're not if you're not

892
00:35:48,989 --> 00:35:55,379
growing that plant in a soil where the

893
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:57,300
biology is doing a lot of the work of

894
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:59,700
nutrient acquisition and provisioning

895
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:01,350
and transport for you then you've got to

896
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:02,939
acquire those nutrients from somewhere

897
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:06,690
else and bring them to your hydroponic

898
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,329
system and add them and that may not be

899
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:11,970
energetically efficient for all

900
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:14,519
nutrients the beautiful thing about a

901
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:17,159
soil it is grabbing a lot of those

902
00:36:14,519 --> 00:36:18,570
nutrients the life in the soil just

903
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:20,699
grabbing a lot of that in the

904
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:23,640
micronutrients out of the mineral

905
00:36:20,699 --> 00:36:25,559
particles and recycling organic matter

906
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,089
and that's a difference a whole

907
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:30,539
different game than if you're just

908
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:34,620
adding you know a little chemical a

909
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:37,920
little chemical B into the mix that said

910
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:39,299
the flip side of looking at hydroponics

911
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,099
I think there's all kinds of interesting

912
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:44,280
opportunities for thinking about

913
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:46,380
microbial amendments and microbial

914
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,480
inoculants both for plants grown in the

915
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,980
soil and also and probably especially

916
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,820
for plants that are grown hydroponically

917
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:56,490
because without a soil there's going to

918
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:58,470
be different in terms of their their own

919
00:36:56,489 --> 00:37:00,959
microbiome so you'd want to have some

920
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:03,809
kind of a compost tea or microbial

921
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,659
amendments and my suspicion is there's

922
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:09,119
an awful lot yet to be learned about how

923
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:10,889
to dial those kind of systems in for

924
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,679
either optimal optimal growing or

925
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:16,889
optimal you know phytochemical and

926
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:19,039
micronutrients of various crops we're

927
00:37:16,889 --> 00:37:21,750
sort of in the early days of

928
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:23,730
understanding how those microbial

929
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:25,289
communities affect plants and a lot of

930
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,409
what the people in the wine business

931
00:37:25,289 --> 00:37:31,440
referred to as terroir a lot of that is

932
00:37:28,409 --> 00:37:34,440
probably shaped and influenced by the

933
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,389
microbial communities in the soil on the

934
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,980
skin of the grapes that get involved

935
00:37:36,389 --> 00:37:40,799
that get involved in the fermentation

936
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:44,820
process there's a lot to still be

937
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,220
learned about how it all works yeah to

938
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:51,119
me it feels you know almost air

939
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:53,759
to think that we can create a nutrient

940
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,490
solution that can match what nature does

941
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,260
in the soil and we don't even know it's

942
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,299
we don't even know half the species in

943
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:02,070
the soil so yeah that we there's no way

944
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,900
that we can match it the quest I think

945
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,809
the real question is with the real

946
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:09,809
arrogance is that we could do better you

947
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:12,840
know that yeah they think that yeah it's

948
00:38:09,809 --> 00:38:14,789
I'm with you on that I mean we know we

949
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:16,410
can grow a plant completely

950
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,639
hydroponically and completely control

951
00:38:16,409 --> 00:38:20,730
that plant's life that's been

952
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,650
established and well accepted now can't

953
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:25,590
prove is that that plant is gonna offer

954
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:26,970
us the same nutritional benefits that we

955
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,880
would be getting from a plant that was

956
00:38:26,969 --> 00:38:32,639
grown in you know in well made soil so

957
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,869
that's the reactor rigs actly and that

958
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:36,059
that's the kind of thing and I are

959
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:39,539
starting to Pokhara noses into and we'll

960
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:41,429
see how far we can get into that but

961
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:43,829
it's a fascinating area because we now

962
00:38:41,429 --> 00:38:45,569
know enough about the science to know

963
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:48,690
that there's some very legitimate

964
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:51,059
questions like you're asking to ask and

965
00:38:48,690 --> 00:38:52,559
there's probably not as much data as

966
00:38:51,059 --> 00:38:54,690
anybody would like to have to answer

967
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:56,250
those questions which makes for an

968
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,409
interesting challenge in terms of

969
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,059
triangulation of you know what kind of

970
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:01,469
perspective and data can we bring in

971
00:39:00,059 --> 00:39:04,889
from different kinds of studies to

972
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:07,529
develop a mature understanding of those

973
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:10,980
connections so that people could make

974
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,930
decisions about you know where they want

975
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,909
their food to be grown how they want

976
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:18,319
their wine to be grown how they want

977
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:21,598
their weed to be grown I mean there's I

978
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,800
think I think in the next in the coming

979
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,490
decade or two we'll see a lot more

980
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,339
people asking questions about all three

981
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:31,669
you know your your comment reminded me

982
00:39:29,338 --> 00:39:34,858
of a book I've been reading

983
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:37,889
it's called proof I believe it's by Adam

984
00:39:34,858 --> 00:39:40,139
price but essentially he talks in the

985
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:41,819
book about sort of the microbial

986
00:39:40,139 --> 00:39:46,588
interactions that go on around alcohol

987
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:48,570
and how with some of these distilleries

988
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:53,279
these famous whiskey distilleries have

989
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:55,530
tried to recreate their their building

990
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:57,089
you know their whole infrastructure half

991
00:39:55,530 --> 00:39:59,910
a mile away from the original facility

992
00:39:57,088 --> 00:40:01,858
and they can't make the same whiskey

993
00:39:59,909 --> 00:40:04,078
they can't get the same microbial you

994
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:06,029
know even that microclimate of microbial

995
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:09,390
life has that much effect on the crop or

996
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,519
they believe that they're the special

997
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:13,318
yeasts are living in the roof of their

998
00:40:11,519 --> 00:40:15,269
buildings so they built another roof on

999
00:40:13,318 --> 00:40:18,088
top of their roof when that roof started

1000
00:40:15,269 --> 00:40:20,759
to fail there's just it's so fascinating

1001
00:40:18,088 --> 00:40:22,288
to me how these microbes influence you

1002
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:24,599
know influence our behavior and

1003
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:27,690
influence our crops and influence oh

1004
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,400
yeah sure and I know Ann isn't really

1005
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:32,039
the one to speak to a lot of the

1006
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:34,318
microbial stuff but you just made me

1007
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:35,970
think of that as we were chatting ya

1008
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:37,380
know it's me it's amazing

1009
00:40:35,969 --> 00:40:40,828
oh yeah we're and we're just becoming

1010
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,740
aware of the magnitude of those impacts

1011
00:40:40,829 --> 00:40:46,530
and the influence of of not the kind of

1012
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:48,808
ideas of you know there's like a

1013
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:50,280
particular disease organism that causes

1014
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:52,859
a particular disease though the whole

1015
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:55,500
German Theory thing but how it's the

1016
00:40:52,858 --> 00:40:58,440
community of microbes for a lot of these

1017
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,480
beneficial effects that matter and when

1018
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:02,250
you think about how little how long it

1019
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,250
took us to actually understand the

1020
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:07,739
community ecology of the nature we can

1021
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:09,690
see with our own senses I mean it took

1022
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:11,429
us a hundred years to figure out that

1023
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,519
taking the Wolves out of Yellowstone

1024
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:16,710
cause the elk to over graze the riparian

1025
00:41:14,519 --> 00:41:18,088
zones which change the river morphology

1026
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,460
and so if you wanted to restore the

1027
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:21,838
river you had to bring wolves back you

1028
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:23,519
know it took us a hundred years to

1029
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,318
figure that out and we can see all the

1030
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,230
animals and the plants and how they

1031
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:29,818
interact and now the water flows so just

1032
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:32,490
imagine how complicated it is to

1033
00:41:29,818 --> 00:41:34,380
understand that microbial community

1034
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:37,858
ecology when we can't even see the damn

1035
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:41,400
things so as someone listening in this

1036
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:43,528
podcast who's cultivating cannabis they

1037
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:45,480
may say who cares they're not eating the

1038
00:41:43,528 --> 00:41:48,869
crop in Joe I mean some of them are but

1039
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:52,170
in general it's being you know combusted

1040
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:54,539
or heated so the nutritional aspects of

1041
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:58,380
the cannabis is probably less important

1042
00:41:54,539 --> 00:42:00,480
to them so why does this data and why do

1043
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:02,880
your books matter I know I'm putting you

1044
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:06,048
on the spot here from the from the

1045
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,059
perspective of cultivation with cannabis

1046
00:42:06,048 --> 00:42:11,369
hello fair enough I don't mind being put

1047
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,640
on the spot see I'm I think that one of

1048
00:42:11,369 --> 00:42:14,309
the connections there

1049
00:42:12,639 --> 00:42:16,929
you know if you're not relying on

1050
00:42:14,309 --> 00:42:22,269
cannabis as a mainstay of your diet

1051
00:42:16,929 --> 00:42:23,710
which I do not recommend if you're then

1052
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:26,558
I can see how you know worrying about

1053
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:29,289
say the micronutrient profile is not

1054
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:31,569
going to be your biggest issue but if

1055
00:42:29,289 --> 00:42:34,539
you look at things like the various

1056
00:42:31,568 --> 00:42:37,509
terpene profiles the balance of CBDs and

1057
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:39,970
THC in cannabis these are things that I

1058
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:42,730
think that most growers probably think

1059
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:45,219
that the biggest influence on those

1060
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:47,048
things lies in the genetics of the plant

1061
00:42:45,219 --> 00:42:48,909
and there's been you know people

1062
00:42:47,048 --> 00:42:50,588
breeding cannabis back since I was in

1063
00:42:48,909 --> 00:42:54,298
high school in Northern California that

1064
00:42:50,588 --> 00:42:56,400
have been you know playing with how to

1065
00:42:54,298 --> 00:42:59,949
influence the expression of

1066
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:01,838
characteristics in that crop but the

1067
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:04,239
whole microbiome connection in the soil

1068
00:43:01,838 --> 00:43:07,869
is another dimension to what could

1069
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:10,868
affect terpene profiles phytochemical

1070
00:43:07,869 --> 00:43:14,650
abundance which could translate into

1071
00:43:10,869 --> 00:43:17,140
either the the relative medicinal versus

1072
00:43:14,650 --> 00:43:20,619
psychoactive effects in case of THC and

1073
00:43:17,139 --> 00:43:24,159
CBD s or even more so I think in terms

1074
00:43:20,619 --> 00:43:26,680
of the flavor profiles and and sort of

1075
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:28,420
the nature of the psychoactive effects

1076
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:30,940
whether you've got something like mere

1077
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:33,250
seen a lot of mere seen or limonene is

1078
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,858
going to affect both flavor and effect

1079
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:38,349
in cannabis and those things the

1080
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:41,159
relative magnitude of phytochemicals are

1081
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:43,660
things that should be influenced by

1082
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:46,179
agronomic practices so you know the

1083
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:46,929
style of hydroponic growing outdoor soil

1084
00:43:46,179 --> 00:43:49,480
sun-grown

1085
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:53,139
you should see differences in the

1086
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:55,719
expression of phytochemicals due to

1087
00:43:53,139 --> 00:43:58,298
those kinds of practices and so as a for

1088
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:01,000
your listener who may be maybe a grower

1089
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:03,429
I guess I would I would suggest is that

1090
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:05,108
if they're thinking about this sort of

1091
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:07,509
the genetic palette that they have to

1092
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:09,969
work with us all the crosses and strains

1093
00:44:07,509 --> 00:44:13,179
and whatever that they have it there in

1094
00:44:09,969 --> 00:44:14,558
their their repertoire shall we say the

1095
00:44:13,179 --> 00:44:17,108
style of growing is another dimension

1096
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,910
it's sort of a different access in terms

1097
00:44:17,108 --> 00:44:21,400
of how to influence the expression and

1098
00:44:18,909 --> 00:44:22,719
character of the product and think

1099
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,059
there's a lot of room to experiment with

1100
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:26,500
that that probably hasn't received as

1101
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:29,800
much attention

1102
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:31,329
in terms of the outcome as the science

1103
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,710
that would that anti are familiar with

1104
00:44:31,329 --> 00:44:35,590
sort of would suggest that it might

1105
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:37,150
warrant yeah that's a great answer and I

1106
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:39,309
think that's a really important aspect

1107
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,650
in fact I have some off to put you in

1108
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:43,420
touch with a friend of mine he just got

1109
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:46,030
some really amazing results down in

1110
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:48,460
phantom farms in terms of their terpene

1111
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:50,019
numbers being so much higher than what

1112
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,470
you're normally seeing in the industry

1113
00:44:50,019 --> 00:44:54,789
and growing using you know living soils

1114
00:44:53,469 --> 00:44:56,289
and these organic practices I think

1115
00:44:54,789 --> 00:44:58,239
that's a really important task yep

1116
00:44:56,289 --> 00:44:59,800
definitely and that and that's exactly

1117
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:02,469
what I think Ann and I would predict and

1118
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,900
we'd love to communicate with that

1119
00:45:02,469 --> 00:45:06,549
person and get them and if they're

1120
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,559
willing to share their data cuz we're in

1121
00:45:06,550 --> 00:45:11,619
the new book we want to have chapters on

1122
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:14,349
you know grains vegetables wine grapes

1123
00:45:11,619 --> 00:45:18,000
and cannabis as sort of a wide range of

1124
00:45:14,349 --> 00:45:20,769
agronomic applications so assuming that

1125
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,420
the listener to this podcast just

1126
00:45:20,769 --> 00:45:24,099
doesn't care about the environment

1127
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:25,659
doesn't care about sustainability I mean

1128
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:28,900
I don't think this is the case but even

1129
00:45:25,659 --> 00:45:32,199
even barring those thoughts and doesn't

1130
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,030
care about organics what did you see

1131
00:45:32,199 --> 00:45:37,269
when you were writing growing revolution

1132
00:45:34,030 --> 00:45:41,230
in terms of pest and disease suppression

1133
00:45:37,269 --> 00:45:44,108
and some of these practices well there's

1134
00:45:41,230 --> 00:45:48,190
some really good examples now in nature

1135
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:50,739
of studies that have looked at the

1136
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:52,720
connection between a healthy living soil

1137
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,919
in the sense of an organic matter rich

1138
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,959
soil with a whole bunch of

1139
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:57,280
microorganisms in it which is sort of

1140
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:01,960
what healthy living soil is shorthand

1141
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:04,030
for the there's a whole bunch of

1142
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:06,250
examples where the defense the

1143
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:08,680
interactions between the that microbiota

1144
00:46:06,250 --> 00:46:10,358
and the soil and the plants sort of

1145
00:46:08,679 --> 00:46:14,799
mediated through what's going out of and

1146
00:46:10,358 --> 00:46:16,269
back into their roots influence that

1147
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,320
Center the defense system of the plant

1148
00:46:16,269 --> 00:46:22,150
and if you have a crop that is sort of

1149
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:26,019
over fertilized and growing in

1150
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:28,480
relatively sterile soil then you've

1151
00:46:26,019 --> 00:46:31,358
essentially dismantled its defensive

1152
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,949
system which is in great part manifest

1153
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:36,429
in its relationship with a soil

1154
00:46:32,949 --> 00:46:37,899
microbiome that makes chemical compounds

1155
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:40,219
that the plant can take up and use for

1156
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:42,079
its defense there's a lot of complicated

1157
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,730
actions and synergies there that I that

1158
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,319
an can probably talk with you about when

1159
00:46:43,730 --> 00:46:48,139
at length and on the hidden half because

1160
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:50,960
that's at the heart of that book but the

1161
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:53,569
key thing is that if you have plants

1162
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,970
growing in a health in a life rich

1163
00:46:53,570 --> 00:46:57,830
fertile soil they're going to be more

1164
00:46:55,969 --> 00:47:00,500
robust and both pests and disease

1165
00:46:57,829 --> 00:47:02,269
resistant and those are experiments that

1166
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,449
go back a hundred years in botany back

1167
00:47:02,269 --> 00:47:07,820
to Hiltner back in the what 1910 teens I

1168
00:47:05,449 --> 00:47:09,259
think it was where you know if you try

1169
00:47:07,820 --> 00:47:11,359
and grow plants in a sterile medium

1170
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,640
they're very susceptible to pests and

1171
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:15,889
pathogens you grow them in an organic

1172
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:18,529
matter rich soil full of bacteria and

1173
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:20,960
fungi the pests and pathogens can't

1174
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:22,700
really get a seat at the table to attack

1175
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:28,460
the plant they get out competed by all

1176
00:47:22,699 --> 00:47:31,730
the bent more less damaging or even more

1177
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:34,340
beneficial organisms that thrive in the

1178
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:37,880
root zone around plants so I think that

1179
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:39,710
in terms of you know sort of net

1180
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:41,900
expenditures on fertilizer net

1181
00:47:39,710 --> 00:47:44,539
expenditures on pesticides what I found

1182
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:47,510
in conventional agriculture was that

1183
00:47:44,539 --> 00:47:49,519
farmers who had adopted practices rooted

1184
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:51,619
around those three principles I talked

1185
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,829
about earlier they were able to reduce

1186
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:56,570
to so reduce their input costs their

1187
00:47:54,829 --> 00:47:58,639
need for pesticides their need for

1188
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:02,300
fertilizers then it saved them a you

1189
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:04,549
know a boatload of money interesting you

1190
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,050
know this is something I might have

1191
00:48:04,550 --> 00:48:08,599
mentioned in previous podcast but it

1192
00:48:06,050 --> 00:48:10,099
made me think of it is I don't know if

1193
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:14,660
you're familiar with the giant pumpkin

1194
00:48:10,099 --> 00:48:15,920
community but these guys the story of

1195
00:48:14,659 --> 00:48:19,429
what community the giant pumpkin

1196
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:20,980
community this is a giant pump Jayant

1197
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:22,848
pumpkins that's correct

1198
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:25,389
that's what I thought you said there's

1199
00:48:22,849 --> 00:48:29,119
like what do you think so these guys are

1200
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:31,868
as passionate as cannabis growers about

1201
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,160
their crop they grow from seed to fruit

1202
00:48:31,869 --> 00:48:36,349
trying to get one the largest pumpkin

1203
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:38,719
they can in a season and they're up I

1204
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:43,160
think over 2,600 pounds now it's it's

1205
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:46,759
insane but initially pumpkin yeah

1206
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:48,409
initially they were they were sort of

1207
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,200
stalling out right around a thousand

1208
00:48:48,409 --> 00:48:53,079
pounds and so by a combination and and

1209
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,369
they were doing it mainly conventionally

1210
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:55,779
they're using all your traditional

1211
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:58,389
conventional things and just pumping

1212
00:48:55,780 --> 00:49:00,820
pumpkins full of nutrients and they're

1213
00:48:58,389 --> 00:49:02,980
getting split stems they were having

1214
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:04,360
other issues and rot to where the

1215
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,730
pumpkins weren't making it to the

1216
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,930
weigh-ins or they stopped they stalled

1217
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:10,389
out on they're growing and so they

1218
00:49:07,929 --> 00:49:14,730
started using organic practices again

1219
00:49:10,389 --> 00:49:16,750
like mycorrhizal fungus and comas and a

1220
00:49:14,730 --> 00:49:19,570
combination of you know improving

1221
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:22,000
genetics and these practices this hybrid

1222
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:23,710
approach of feeding small amounts of

1223
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,389
chemical nutrients in conjunction with

1224
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:27,610
organic practices and building their

1225
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:29,170
soil has allowed him to reach these new

1226
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,240
you know they never thought they'd break

1227
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:34,930
the 2,000 pound barrier you know even

1228
00:49:31,239 --> 00:49:36,549
five six years ago so it's really it's

1229
00:49:34,929 --> 00:49:38,289
right now time a long way and I think

1230
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:40,600
that that's a lot of the future of

1231
00:49:38,289 --> 00:49:43,230
Agriculture's maybe we're not going to

1232
00:49:40,599 --> 00:49:47,259
throw all chemical nutrients and

1233
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:50,920
traditional agriculture away but find

1234
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:52,990
ways to incorporate it back into our

1235
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,579
organic practices in you know micro

1236
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,349
doses

1237
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:58,480
yeah the sort of the happy hybrid kind

1238
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,460
of a way to look at it where you know I

1239
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:02,949
was up you know blissfully unaware of

1240
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:04,510
the giant pumpkin community um let me

1241
00:50:02,949 --> 00:50:06,460
but that sounds like a really

1242
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:12,070
interesting story I might be interested

1243
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:13,510
in digging more into the but a number of

1244
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,519
the farmers I interviewed and growing a

1245
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:18,730
revolution there were conventional

1246
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:20,829
farmers who had so reduced their input

1247
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:22,750
use based on improving the fertility of

1248
00:50:20,829 --> 00:50:24,630
their soil that I started teasing them

1249
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:26,710
that they were organic ish farmers and

1250
00:50:24,630 --> 00:50:28,390
they had better yields than their

1251
00:50:26,710 --> 00:50:30,039
neighbors they had much lower expenses

1252
00:50:28,389 --> 00:50:31,989
of their neighbors it was it seemed to

1253
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:34,900
me to be a really positive combination

1254
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:36,819
and you know and they were not fully

1255
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:39,579
organic they had basically done what you

1256
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:41,470
just described of trying to take some of

1257
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:45,699
the best features of organic agriculture

1258
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:47,859
and reserving the ability or the right

1259
00:50:45,699 --> 00:50:49,329
as some of them put it to use other

1260
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:51,250
means some of that some of the chemicals

1261
00:50:49,329 --> 00:50:53,769
that they've come to rely on when they

1262
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:55,420
thought they really needed them but the

1263
00:50:53,769 --> 00:50:56,949
more they improved their soils I found

1264
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:00,400
the less they needed them and they were

1265
00:50:56,949 --> 00:51:03,909
happy not to buy it that reliance on

1266
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:06,400
petrochemicals too is obviously a global

1267
00:51:03,909 --> 00:51:08,109
issue and global concern

1268
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:12,700
there's yes there's a lot of motivation

1269
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:14,140
there to move away from them so I'm can

1270
00:51:12,699 --> 00:51:16,989
you talk a little bit more than about

1271
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:19,269
the this idea of organic so as you went

1272
00:51:16,989 --> 00:51:20,759
around are you seeing this as sort of

1273
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:23,079
like you mentioned this next revolution

1274
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:25,500
do you really think this is the future

1275
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:27,610
of Agriculture or do you think as

1276
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:29,260
speculation is society are we going to

1277
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:32,740
hit a point where conventional

1278
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:34,660
agriculture just no longer functions you

1279
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:36,789
know if we go there's a report that came

1280
00:51:34,659 --> 00:51:38,019
out in 2015 from the United Nations

1281
00:51:36,789 --> 00:51:40,509
called the global state of the soil

1282
00:51:38,019 --> 00:51:43,509
report assessment I think it was called

1283
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:46,240
and they basically maintained in that

1284
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:48,400
report that we're losing about 0.3

1285
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:50,409
percent of our agronomic production

1286
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:52,990
capacity globally each and every year

1287
00:51:50,409 --> 00:51:56,319
due to ongoing soil degradation and loss

1288
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:57,849
and you know point three percent is kind

1289
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,680
of a small number unless you think out

1290
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:02,289
over the next 50 or 100 years and then

1291
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:07,389
it's another 50 to 15 to 30 percent of

1292
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:10,630
global agricultural capacity reduced we

1293
00:52:07,389 --> 00:52:12,489
if we maintain farming practices that

1294
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,110
continue to degrade the land that we

1295
00:52:12,489 --> 00:52:15,849
depend on to grow our food we're gonna

1296
00:52:14,110 --> 00:52:17,890
get in trouble down the road that's the

1297
00:52:15,849 --> 00:52:19,989
story of ancient societies I laid out in

1298
00:52:17,889 --> 00:52:23,109
the dirt book what I'm really happy

1299
00:52:19,989 --> 00:52:24,939
about is that a lot of these soil

1300
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:27,250
building practices if they were adopted

1301
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:30,130
more widely could reverse that and turn

1302
00:52:27,250 --> 00:52:31,690
it around in shockingly short order in

1303
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:32,860
the way that a geologist thinks about

1304
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,210
things we could actually turn it around

1305
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:37,570
this century we could pull it out of the

1306
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:40,320
fire but it would require thinking

1307
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:44,320
differently about how we farm on our

1308
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:45,700
conventional cropland but I think

1309
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:48,210
there's a lot of opportunities to do

1310
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:51,489
that whether we'll do it I don't know

1311
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:54,699
there's a some fairly large and obvious

1312
00:52:51,489 --> 00:52:57,459
interests that would prefer we maintain

1313
00:52:54,699 --> 00:52:59,289
that what we now call conventional

1314
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,800
agriculture because there's some very

1315
00:52:59,289 --> 00:53:05,110
profitable industries that are built up

1316
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,269
around that that aren't necessarily on

1317
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:09,900
farm but are involved in selling farmers

1318
00:53:07,269 --> 00:53:14,920
things and buying things from farmers

1319
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:16,780
it's one of the big I think big

1320
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,250
environmental issues of our time that

1321
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:19,350
doesn't get anywhere near the attention

1322
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:22,449
that it deserves

1323
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:25,299
but I don't see the downside of trying

1324
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:27,519
to restore health and and fertility to

1325
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:29,050
the world's farmland soils are our

1326
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:31,360
great-grandchildren are gonna need that

1327
00:53:29,050 --> 00:53:34,720
that soil in good shape to make their

1328
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:37,740
living and I think if we can do it

1329
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:40,299
profitably we should pursue that and

1330
00:53:37,739 --> 00:53:43,359
take whatever turn over there is in

1331
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:45,600
terms of its impact on certain

1332
00:53:43,360 --> 00:53:48,160
industries in stride

1333
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:50,409
yeah and we're losing soil too as our

1334
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:52,179
population expands you know we're

1335
00:53:50,409 --> 00:53:55,179
asphalt yeah there are more and more of

1336
00:53:52,179 --> 00:53:56,289
it every day yeah yeah and that most

1337
00:53:55,179 --> 00:53:59,199
things are working in the wrong

1338
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:00,940
direction against each other and so

1339
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,969
we've got to figure out how to you know

1340
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,409
sort of strike a balance I think between

1341
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:07,989
what we've considered to be conventional

1342
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:09,759
agriculture and organic agriculture in

1343
00:54:07,989 --> 00:54:11,619
terms of trying to make more more of

1344
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,840
conventional agriculture this ort style

1345
00:54:11,619 --> 00:54:15,880
of organic agriculture that I argue

1346
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:17,079
about and argue for in the book and

1347
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:19,180
we've also got to sort of think about

1348
00:54:17,079 --> 00:54:20,980
how we going to grow food in cities near

1349
00:54:19,179 --> 00:54:24,190
where people are as more and more of us

1350
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:26,800
or in cities and how do we grow all our

1351
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,530
all our other crops as well from from

1352
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:34,840
from wine to cannabis to took the fibers

1353
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:35,950
that we wear yeah that's a it's not

1354
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,140
anything we're gonna be able to solve

1355
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:40,509
overnight for sure but it's good to know

1356
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:43,719
there's people out there writing books

1357
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:46,750
about it and encouraging people to you

1358
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:49,509
know all these things like regenerative

1359
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,639
agriculture agricultural practices you

1360
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:54,190
know sourcing things locally I know you

1361
00:54:51,639 --> 00:54:57,159
have a garden at your at your house I

1362
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:59,860
have a garden at my house oh yeah

1363
00:54:57,159 --> 00:55:01,659
it's important that people get in and

1364
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:02,860
learn where their food comes from and I

1365
00:55:01,659 --> 00:55:05,710
think that that can't be emphasized

1366
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:09,190
enough yep and there's you know if we

1367
00:55:05,710 --> 00:55:10,690
all if we all improve the soil in our

1368
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:14,019
daily lives whether it's in our garden

1369
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:16,420
or on our farm you know if everybody got

1370
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:17,980
into doing that there's a shocking

1371
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:21,519
amount of carbon that could be parked in

1372
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:23,619
the ground in ways that benefit the

1373
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:26,590
expression of phytochemicals and

1374
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:28,449
micronutrients in our crops that just

1375
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:30,400
benefit the fertility of the land it's

1376
00:55:28,449 --> 00:55:31,869
it's one of those things where if

1377
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,889
everybody could do their own little

1378
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:35,170
piece and their own little core

1379
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:38,170
the world it would add up to a lot if

1380
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:39,400
enough people did it you know you

1381
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:40,869
brought up something that I'd wanted to

1382
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:43,269
ask you about a little bit earlier so

1383
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:45,309
the last topic I would have is when I

1384
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:46,840
was talking about not less disturbance

1385
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:48,579
of the soil I was really looking at it

1386
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,170
from a carbon perspective can you

1387
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:51,639
explain for listeners briefly the

1388
00:55:50,170 --> 00:55:54,760
importance of carbon and a little about

1389
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:57,420
that cycle and and why it's it's such an

1390
00:55:54,760 --> 00:56:01,720
emphasis in regenerative agriculture

1391
00:55:57,420 --> 00:56:04,720
yeah sure um if you think about how

1392
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:07,029
carbon works between the sort of the sky

1393
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:08,949
and the earth plants are the middlemen

1394
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,990
because plants through photosynthesis

1395
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:12,789
grab carbon dioxide out of the

1396
00:56:10,989 --> 00:56:14,469
atmosphere and combine it with water

1397
00:56:12,789 --> 00:56:16,329
that they pull up through their roots to

1398
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:18,579
make carbohydrates sugars the building

1399
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:20,319
blocks of their bodies you know and they

1400
00:56:18,579 --> 00:56:24,130
give off oxygen in the process which is

1401
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:25,780
good for us as well but in in building

1402
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:28,510
their bodies they're grabbing carbon out

1403
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:30,340
of the sky and so then once it's in a

1404
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:33,010
plant's body it sits there over the life

1405
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:34,570
of the plant unless that plant pushes

1406
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:37,360
some of that carbon out of its roots

1407
00:56:34,570 --> 00:56:40,330
into the soil which they do some plants

1408
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:42,340
will push you know 30 40 percent of the

1409
00:56:40,329 --> 00:56:43,840
carbon they capture from the sky out to

1410
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:46,390
their roots into the soil and they do it

1411
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:49,180
in the form of sugars and proteins and

1412
00:56:46,389 --> 00:56:50,589
things we might think of as food because

1413
00:56:49,179 --> 00:56:53,199
they're feeding microbes in the soil

1414
00:56:50,590 --> 00:56:54,820
that do things in return for them that

1415
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,889
annal talk with you a lot about but that

1416
00:56:54,820 --> 00:57:00,610
basically when those microbes in the

1417
00:56:56,889 --> 00:57:02,679
soil die their bodies are rich in carbon

1418
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:04,390
and in nitrogen and phosphorus and all

1419
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:07,359
the other micronutrients that form

1420
00:57:04,389 --> 00:57:09,609
living things that form the constituents

1421
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,630
of the bodies of plants and and and

1422
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:15,940
microbes and so once that that that once

1423
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:19,170
living material that becomes dead it's

1424
00:57:15,940 --> 00:57:21,909
then organic matter and organic matter

1425
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:24,039
the carbon rich compounds that were once

1426
00:57:21,909 --> 00:57:26,170
living that's food for microorganisms

1427
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,079
that break that down and particularly

1428
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:33,010
you know saprophytic fungi things that

1429
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:36,610
eat dead things they break down that

1430
00:57:33,010 --> 00:57:37,840
once living organic matter and reduce it

1431
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:41,920
to it's sort of its elemental

1432
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:44,980
constituents and tend to transform it

1433
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:46,599
into forms that can be taken back up by

1434
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:48,610
the next generation of plants

1435
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:51,279
so you can think of it as a full cycle

1436
00:57:48,610 --> 00:57:54,039
we're living organisms our decay and

1437
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:56,830
recycled into the the ingredients that

1438
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:59,969
are used to build the next generation of

1439
00:57:56,829 --> 00:58:02,889
living things and if those if the

1440
00:57:59,969 --> 00:58:05,589
recycling function in the soil wasn't

1441
00:58:02,889 --> 00:58:07,480
working it wouldn't take all that long

1442
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:11,490
for you know this world to be buried

1443
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:14,349
under dead things if nothing broke down

1444
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:17,799
so it's it's a good thing that system

1445
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:20,650
works so now again I forgotten where you

1446
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:24,280
started with it on the question so we

1447
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:26,139
need carbon in our soils oh yeah so you

1448
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:28,780
can think of carbon as the fuel that's

1449
00:58:26,139 --> 00:58:30,519
feeding the microbes that's helping to

1450
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:33,580
drive the back half of the circle of

1451
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:36,789
life and that is helping to get mineral

1452
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:38,920
micronutrients out of the soil so you

1453
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:41,289
can you can literally think of sort of

1454
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:43,030
the organic matter content or the carbon

1455
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:45,309
content because you know organic matter

1456
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:46,840
is roughly half carbon so the more

1457
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:49,360
organic matter the more carbon the more

1458
00:58:46,840 --> 00:58:51,309
carbon the more organic matter you can

1459
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,900
literally think of it that carbon

1460
00:58:51,309 --> 00:58:56,440
content of the soil is sort of a measure

1461
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:59,200
of the biological batteries that are in

1462
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:01,389
the soil if you have a lot of organic

1463
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:03,609
matter and a lot of life in the soil the

1464
00:59:01,389 --> 00:59:05,949
cycling of nutrients and nutrition and

1465
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:07,510
the per in the acquisition from fresh

1466
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:10,089
mineral particles will just be running

1467
00:59:07,510 --> 00:59:12,400
faster because that that that's what the

1468
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:14,170
Easter the what the ever-ready Bunny of

1469
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:16,269
the soil is just gonna be working mat

1470
00:59:14,170 --> 00:59:18,130
them it's faster and when you run out of

1471
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:20,650
organic matter you're just drawing down

1472
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:24,190
that battery and he's bitten hitting the

1473
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:26,579
drum slower and slower and slower so

1474
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:28,990
that's why biochar or Terra Preta

1475
00:59:26,579 --> 00:59:31,269
from back in the Amazon rainforest was

1476
00:59:28,989 --> 00:59:34,029
so effective as a way of improving soil

1477
00:59:31,269 --> 00:59:36,849
fertility well that's that's part of it

1478
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:38,769
there's um because there's what biochar

1479
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:40,449
is is if you take organic matter and you

1480
00:59:38,769 --> 00:59:43,300
combust it in a low oxygen environment

1481
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:45,129
it becomes charcoal and a lot of the

1482
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:46,900
volatiles are driven off of it in the

1483
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:48,250
process but there's still some and

1484
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:50,170
depending on what temperature you make

1485
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:53,349
it at and what you're making out of in

1486
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:55,150
the first place there can be elements in

1487
00:59:53,349 --> 00:59:58,000
it that microbes can scavenge for food

1488
00:59:55,150 --> 01:00:00,430
in addition to just the raw carbon

1489
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:02,318
matrix but one of the real

1490
01:00:00,429 --> 01:00:04,058
things that I think the biochar does in

1491
01:00:02,318 --> 01:00:07,420
the soil isn't so much the direct

1492
01:00:04,059 --> 01:00:09,490
fertility boost from it but it's that it

1493
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:10,990
increases the water holding capacity of

1494
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:13,778
the soil charcoal is really good at

1495
01:00:10,989 --> 01:00:17,019
holding water and I like to think of it

1496
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:19,119
as as habitat for microbes so some of

1497
01:00:17,019 --> 01:00:21,150
the farmers that I visited in Central

1498
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:24,760
America for example down in Costa Rica

1499
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:26,680
we're using biochar to restore fertility

1500
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:29,079
to their land but they were taking the

1501
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:32,348
biochar and then inoculating it with a

1502
01:00:29,079 --> 01:00:35,048
compost tea that they made from the

1503
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:36,970
mycorrhizal fungi that they would get

1504
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:40,150
from the native forest from out in the

1505
01:00:36,969 --> 01:00:42,689
jungle and so you basically think of

1506
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:46,329
biochars habitat for organisms they were

1507
01:00:42,690 --> 01:00:48,630
populating that habitat with with fungi

1508
01:00:46,329 --> 01:00:50,890
and bacteria out of the native forests

1509
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:53,039
mixing with other biochar then

1510
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:55,389
integrating that into their fields and

1511
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,000
they're essentially cultivating the

1512
01:00:55,389 --> 01:01:00,009
beneficial life in the soil to help

1513
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:01,659
break down the organic matter that they

1514
01:01:00,010 --> 01:01:05,140
would leave on their fields and feed

1515
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:09,818
their next generation crop that's really

1516
01:01:05,139 --> 01:01:11,469
interesting so just to keep this I feel

1517
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:13,750
like we can talk on these topics forever

1518
01:01:11,469 --> 01:01:15,219
I really enjoyed chatting with you is

1519
01:01:13,750 --> 01:01:17,108
there anything else though that you want

1520
01:01:15,219 --> 01:01:21,308
to cover before we sign off in regards

1521
01:01:17,108 --> 01:01:24,159
to your books or some of the history of

1522
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:28,720
soil and how it might relate to cannabis

1523
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:31,690
cultivation oh boy well you know one one

1524
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:33,578
thing if you think about how to restore

1525
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:35,740
soil I haven't really seen anybody write

1526
01:01:33,579 --> 01:01:37,420
or talk much about about this next point

1527
01:01:35,739 --> 01:01:41,828
but I'll just bring it up because it

1528
01:01:37,420 --> 01:01:43,869
crossed my mind if you think about how

1529
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:45,490
it is that you would sort of boost the

1530
01:01:43,869 --> 01:01:49,269
organic matter content of the soil what

1531
01:01:45,489 --> 01:01:51,608
you want to get is organic biomass and

1532
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:53,318
fiber into the soil and there's a

1533
01:01:51,608 --> 01:01:54,730
parallel with the human gut that and

1534
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:56,858
I'll talk to you about with with the

1535
01:01:54,730 --> 01:02:00,278
hidden half of nature but if you know

1536
01:01:56,858 --> 01:02:01,598
but hemp is one of the great crops for

1537
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:04,778
fiber that's why we used to make rope

1538
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:06,818
out of it after all and so if we're

1539
01:02:04,778 --> 01:02:09,309
thinking about you know cover crops to

1540
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:11,829
boost the organic matter content and

1541
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:13,570
fertility of soils getting hemp into the

1542
01:02:11,829 --> 01:02:16,210
crop rotations

1543
01:02:13,570 --> 01:02:20,710
and then using you know some of that

1544
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:23,679
biomass as microbe food in soils is not

1545
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:26,110
a bad idea I

1546
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:27,819
my initial dot on that my one concern

1547
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,410
would be that your the species may be a

1548
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,920
little too closely related and you may

1549
01:02:29,409 --> 01:02:34,210
end up with pest problems but I don't

1550
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:35,920
know of any well but do you know what

1551
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:38,369
but what but what if we put it in

1552
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:40,680
cornfields and put in soybean fields oh

1553
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:43,809
the hemp

1554
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:47,109
yeah yeah no grass I was thinking of it

1555
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:48,779
as a rotation with a cannabis crop no

1556
01:02:47,110 --> 01:02:50,800
what I would that I said you know my

1557
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:52,480
recommendation I haven't thought that

1558
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,710
that deeply about cannabis cultivation

1559
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,690
because I don't have any experience with

1560
01:02:53,710 --> 01:02:57,610
it and I have a brown thumb I can kill

1561
01:02:55,690 --> 01:02:59,349
any plant you give me and it's the guard

1562
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:01,840
and as the gardener in our household she

1563
01:02:59,349 --> 01:03:04,029
may give you better advice but in terms

1564
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:06,430
of getting diversity into rotations with

1565
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:08,920
cannabis I'd encourage farmers to think

1566
01:03:06,429 --> 01:03:10,989
about if you're growing outside think

1567
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:12,849
about planting other plants in between

1568
01:03:10,989 --> 01:03:15,599
your crops don't leave the bound the

1569
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:17,920
ground bare don't let it look manicured

1570
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:20,079
intentionally plant what you might

1571
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:23,710
otherwise call weeds pardon the pun in

1572
01:03:20,079 --> 01:03:27,400
between your cash crop in ways that

1573
01:03:23,710 --> 01:03:30,970
would you think of as green manure and

1574
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:34,900
for for indoor operations I mean maybe

1575
01:03:30,969 --> 01:03:37,059
you grow a low-rise crop in the soil

1576
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:40,210
around the cash crop get diversity into

1577
01:03:37,059 --> 01:03:43,539
the soils by having mixes of low-rise

1578
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:45,579
crops I think that the in terms of the

1579
01:03:43,539 --> 01:03:48,820
pest resistance and disease resistance

1580
01:03:45,579 --> 01:03:51,639
it might be well worth experimenting

1581
01:03:48,820 --> 01:03:54,250
with yeah I see a lot of people running

1582
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:56,109
cover crops with their cannabis crops

1583
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:59,829
now that's that's becoming more and more

1584
01:03:56,110 --> 01:04:03,910
common i Pro good good so it's already

1585
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:05,559
been thought of oh man cannabis farmers

1586
01:04:03,909 --> 01:04:07,509
are very good at experimenting and

1587
01:04:05,559 --> 01:04:09,369
trying new things they're definitely a

1588
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:11,010
cutting edge in that regard which is

1589
01:04:09,369 --> 01:04:15,969
which is why it makes it so much fun

1590
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:17,470
that being said I personally on indoor

1591
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:19,659
facilities haven't seen a lot of people

1592
01:04:17,469 --> 01:04:21,039
pull that off on scale successfully but

1593
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:22,839
I know they're people there are people

1594
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,670
out there doing it I worry about it as a

1595
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:26,190
habitat for pests and disease because we

1596
01:04:24,670 --> 01:04:28,650
do have such a mono cropping called

1597
01:04:26,190 --> 01:04:30,420
and we don't have yeah we don't have

1598
01:04:28,650 --> 01:04:32,730
that diversity of insect life that we

1599
01:04:30,420 --> 01:04:34,079
have outdoors because it is limited so

1600
01:04:32,730 --> 01:04:36,619
the pests they make it in but that

1601
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,090
predator and other diversity may not

1602
01:04:36,619 --> 01:04:41,489
well what what why don't people actually

1603
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:43,289
like you know release predators inside

1604
01:04:41,489 --> 01:04:45,059
their operations oh that's a thing -

1605
01:04:43,289 --> 01:04:47,309
yeah we definitely have a lot of people

1606
01:04:45,059 --> 01:04:49,650
doing beneficial insects I had a couple

1607
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:51,929
podcast yeah already so that's another I

1608
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:53,220
think that's the nature of agriculture

1609
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:54,769
in a lot of ways as we move away from

1610
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:59,879
pesticides

1611
01:04:54,769 --> 01:05:01,829
yeah the examples I've seen on sort of

1612
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:04,829
conventional farms that have gone to

1613
01:05:01,829 --> 01:05:07,590
biological pest management have been

1614
01:05:04,829 --> 01:05:09,779
very successful there's a guy named

1615
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:11,760
Jonathan Lundgren at blue Dasher farms

1616
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:13,950
in South Dakota if any of your listeners

1617
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:15,930
are want to follow up on this stuff go

1618
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:17,309
to his website and check out what he's

1619
01:05:15,929 --> 01:05:19,949
been doing in the research he's been

1620
01:05:17,309 --> 01:05:22,559
doing on alternative means of pest

1621
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:24,449
control it's really impressive but yeah

1622
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:26,190
but if people are interested in in our

1623
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:28,230
books and we've got the dirty rows in

1624
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:29,789
the civilization's book that I wrote the

1625
01:05:28,230 --> 01:05:31,619
hidden half of nature that Anne and I

1626
01:05:29,789 --> 01:05:33,869
wrote and then growing a revolution the

1627
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:35,730
new book about regenerative agriculture

1628
01:05:33,869 --> 01:05:39,299
those you know they're available at any

1629
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:43,230
bookstore we have a website that is dig

1630
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:46,500
to grow calm dig the number to grow calm

1631
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:50,159
and we're active on Twitter we're at dig

1632
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:52,230
the number to grow and you know people

1633
01:05:50,159 --> 01:05:54,299
can reach us via our website if they're

1634
01:05:52,230 --> 01:05:55,769
