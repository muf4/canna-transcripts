00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,760
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,760
science podcast i'm your host tadd

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,439
hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,880
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,039
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:26,879 --> 00:00:30,399
perspective and drawn top experts from

8
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,640
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:35,600
wisdom and knowledge my guest this week

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,359
is ryan lee ryan is an educator breeder

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,120
and researcher specializing in the

12
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:41,359
chemical and genetic diversity of the

13
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:43,119
cannabis species ryan comes from a

14
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:45,280
background in neuroscience focusing on

15
00:00:43,119 --> 00:00:47,359
the endocannabinoid system but later

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,120
focusing on plant breeding technologies

17
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:50,960
and the study of the molecular aspects

18
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:52,479
of the cannabis genome and how we can

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,160
use science to shape and improve the

20
00:00:52,479 --> 00:00:56,159
plant now on to the show

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,439
hey ryan thanks for coming on the

22
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,520
podcast today

23
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:03,759
thanks for having me ted pleasure

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
absolutely can you uh tell listeners a

25
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:07,519
little bit about uh yourself and your

26
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:09,839
background

27
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:13,519
yeah i'm a cannabis breeder i've been

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,118
breeding cannabis for roughly 30 years

29
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:16,560
i've got an undergrad degree in

30
00:01:15,118 --> 00:01:18,478
neuroscience and i studied plant

31
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,719
breeding in biotechnology at

32
00:01:18,478 --> 00:01:22,000
a post-grad level

33
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,000
so i've really been kind of looking at

34
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,519
cannabis from a scientific level more or

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,359
less

36
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:28,879
quite seriously for the last 25 plus

37
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:31,680
years at least

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:33,359
um and growing for about 30 so i've got

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,880
a fair a fair amount experience in the

40
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:36,560
in the space

41
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:39,039
um

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,280
yeah i've got to see a seed company in

43
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,600
europe called chimera genetics

44
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,799
which some people may know

45
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:48,719
and i operate as a consultant and

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,640
genetic supplier to companies in north

47
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:53,200
america while really canada

48
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,200
and then globally

49
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
through our legal export system

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,240
so that's kind of where i come from

51
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:04,319
yeah i first heard you speak at emerald

52
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:05,919
cup uh a few years ago now um with seth

53
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,478
crawford and

54
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,640
jeremy plum and i know you and jeremy

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,319
are good friends and he said that you

56
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,159
were the one i need to talk to when it

57
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:15,598
came to this topic

58
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:17,520
and i'm going to admit right at the

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:18,959
beginning of the podcast

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,800
i don't know much about breeding it's

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,560
not something that i've really dived

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
into or having experience with so this

63
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,159
is just going to be an organic

64
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,000
conversation off the cuff

65
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:30,799
just kind of

66
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,120
talking about talking about breeding and

67
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,360
you know i kind of wanted to start with

68
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,840
sort of a historical aspect here in

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:40,160
terms of how cannabis has been bred and

70
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,080
get into sort of you know where you see

71
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:44,079
it going uh in the future

72
00:02:44,719 --> 00:02:51,359
yeah that's a huge interesting topic

73
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,199
um so

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,720
different plants have different breeding

75
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:58,158
systems okay

76
00:02:54,719 --> 00:03:01,280
and that dictates a lot about

77
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:04,079
what traits persist in the genome and

78
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:06,158
what traits get purged and taken out of

79
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,040
the genome cannabis is called an

80
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,560
obligate outcrosser which means

81
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,878
in nature

82
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,800
no plant will ever never ever really

83
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:16,560
self-fertilize i mean we can talk about

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,840
intersex plants to a degree and there is

85
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:19,680
a certain degree of inbreeding that

86
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:21,759
happens with those plants

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,599
but the standard kind of method for

88
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:26,560
breeding or for cannabis to breed in

89
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:29,280
nature is a male plant has to land on a

90
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,598
different female plant for progeny or

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,598
for a seed to be made

92
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:35,679
and

93
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,798
that natural state

94
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,040
is really designed to preserve

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,920
a wide genetic

96
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,598
diversity within the genome

97
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:47,039
because things don't get purged out you

98
00:03:45,598 --> 00:03:50,318
never you know

99
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,519
it's just a factor of the mating system

100
00:03:50,318 --> 00:03:55,518
that traits kind of stick around forever

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,840
and it leads to a huge variability in

102
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,519
the population you know of the species

103
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,519
as a whole let's let's kind of look at

104
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,400
it from that perspective

105
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,480
um

106
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:06,000
so when when humans

107
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,679
really got into

108
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,280
breeding drug cannabis i would say

109
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,239
seriously

110
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,199
you know mid 20th century

111
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,759
call it

112
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,519
60s and 70s

113
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:20,319
people started taking plants from

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,079
populations that they could get right so

115
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:24,079
you know say you're a grower in the late

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,918
60s

117
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,839
you know you're probably selecting seeds

118
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:30,159
out of like colombian or mexican flower

119
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:32,879
that's coming into the united states

120
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,320
being shipped all over

121
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:35,918
and

122
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,439
you know you would just kind of cross

123
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,039
those plants with the seeds you grow

124
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:40,959
them and the next year you'd collect you

125
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,800
know more more seeds over the bud that

126
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:44,799
you were buying and smoking of plants

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,040
that were a flat of weed that was kind

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,120
of exceptional or better quality and

129
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,879
you'd breed that in to the plant next

130
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,360
year and so

131
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,120
this one-to-one type of breeding system

132
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,280
is very different from the way the

133
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,680
cannabis produces in the wild right in

134
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:01,038
the wild you get these large stands of

135
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,560
plants

136
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,879
say

137
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,639
well i mean it depends on the stand as

138
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:08,000
the to the number of vigils individuals

139
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,439
but you say that there's like you know

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,439
somewhere between 10 and 100 or a

141
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,360
thousand individuals and they're kind of

142
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,759
having this like big orgy where all the

143
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
males are fertilizing all the females

144
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,080
and so it's just like kind of like a big

145
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,439
shuffling of

146
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,000
traits

147
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,759
ongoing generation after generation and

148
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,600
that's good because

149
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,000
you have genetic variability so that

150
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,759
when you when those seeds move from one

151
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,038
location to another

152
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,400
there's usually enough built-in

153
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:36,879
variability

154
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:38,239
that no matter the new location or the

155
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,000
environmental conditions in the new

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,439
location there's going to be some plants

157
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,038
in that population that will survive

158
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:46,879
so we kind of changed the

159
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,719
the script on that in the like the 60s

160
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,240
and 70s when we started breeding plants

161
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,479
one to one

162
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,319
um you know taking one male some some

163
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:56,478
grower would think oh i like the the

164
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:59,199
structure and the habit of this male

165
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,719
plant and it smells good when i rub stem

166
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,639
and so let's cross a little bit of that

167
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,919
pollen to each one of our females and

168
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,400
then you know the next year they'd kind

169
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:08,560
of make selections from you know which

170
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:10,719
breeding events or reading experiments

171
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
turned out well right

172
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,160
um

173
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,319
and that's one way to do it but that's

174
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:19,360
not really the way that if you were a

175
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,400
scientist you would

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,560
um

177
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:24,000
start you know

178
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,839
measuring you know if you're a scientist

179
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,800
you're breeding wheat or corn

180
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:31,119
every little trait is considered from

181
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,840
from pest resistance to mold resistance

182
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:34,399
to

183
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:36,239
you know rate of growth yield flavor of

184
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:37,198
the plants you know all that kind of

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,000
stuff

186
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,079
and

187
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,759
it's been a little more loosey-goosey

188
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,639
the way that cannabis growers have done

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,720
it so

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,720
that practice really

191
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:49,759
took hold for i would say you know from

192
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,479
like let's again call it late 60s to

193
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,560
late 90s and in the late 90s some people

194
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:56,318
started

195
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,240
breeding plants with a little bit more

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:01,439
accuracy and scientific intention either

197
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,400
measuring cannabinoids or terpenoids

198
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:04,478
um

199
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:06,159
and really going after specifically

200
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:08,639
changing the chemical profile of the

201
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,000
plant and you can't really do that i

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,680
mean you can do it with smell by your

203
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,199
nose a little bit but the real way to do

204
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,519
that is to use like an analytical

205
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
laboratory

206
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:18,799
so that you're actually analyzing the

207
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,000
chemistry or the chemicals that are in

208
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,240
the plant

209
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
and then making breeding decisions on on

210
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,800
individual plants based on that lab

211
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,439
analysis

212
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,280
um so that's kind of like really i you

213
00:07:29,439 --> 00:07:34,478
know in a short summation where we've

214
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:35,918
come from in the past kind of 50 years

215
00:07:34,478 --> 00:07:38,120
now i think that can ask you a quick

216
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,240
question here so absolutely so

217
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,000
philosophically um

218
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,360
speaking from an evolutionary

219
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,959
perspective

220
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,120
you know from the cannabis plants

221
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:48,560
perspective having greater genetic

222
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,800
versity you know pollinating a whole

223
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,000
bunch of plants with a whole bunch of

224
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
different genes

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,560
allows it a better chance to survive in

226
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,079
a variety of environments you know

227
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,360
someone's going to live on that's one of

228
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:01,680
the reasons as humans we have these

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,080
stigmas against um you know breeding

230
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,879
with our our close relatives

231
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:08,878
in every culture um

232
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,360
so you know i think of michael pollan's

233
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,879
book you know this idea that cannabis

234
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,400
and some of these other crops have sort

235
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,960
of

236
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:18,478
enslaved humans to

237
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:20,159
look for these traits in their own

238
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,279
survival and then

239
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
so now

240
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:26,638
i look at cannabis as having as a plant

241
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,759
sort of used humans as a way because of

242
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,918
the effect that it gives to breed for

243
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:34,320
you know more specific traits so now it

244
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,679
may be more evolutionary advantageous to

245
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,000
produce higher

246
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,958
thc because of the effects it has or

247
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,559
higher cannabinoid content

248
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,000
is that

249
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,239
i mean i know i'm kind of rambling here

250
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
but does that make make sense or is that

251
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,959
sort of something from a philosophical

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,639
perspective or evolutionary perspective

253
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:54,559
uh for the play

254
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:57,039
it totally makes sense i mean i tried

255
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,439
not to answer promorthai's plans too

256
00:08:57,039 --> 00:09:02,240
much that's fair that's fine

257
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,800
really you know all organisms on the

258
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,759
planet are just different forms of dna

259
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:10,240
and different expressions of dna

260
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:13,120
trying to replicate itself right

261
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,799
and so it's an organism could be said to

262
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,799
be successful i mean this is one

263
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,079
perspective of course

264
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,159
an organism could be said to be

265
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,639
successful if it reproduces

266
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,719
right and so from that perspective

267
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:28,480
anything that a plant can do

268
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:28,480
to increase its chances to

269
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,838
reproduce to have more progeny and go on

270
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,519
you know in an evolutionary context

271
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
is a win right and i don't think the

272
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,480
plant really cares what it does it's

273
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,278
just

274
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,720
these traits come along or they evolve

275
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:45,039
and then we as humans come in and we

276
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,399
start reinforcing those traits because

277
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:48,559
you know like look the plant that we

278
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:50,159
found when humanity came in contact with

279
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:52,639
cannabis was nothing like the plant that

280
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,719
it came today it was a small little kind

281
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,000
of weedy plant that followed camps

282
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
around

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,879
because we would you know eat the seeds

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,480
and stuff like that

285
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,159
and it probably produced very little

286
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,759
cannabinoids and like

287
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:06,240
you know

288
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:09,120
a lot less terpenoids and volatile smell

289
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,278
molecules than it produces now

290
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,879
and over generations of generations and

291
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:15,120
generations of humans growing these

292
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:16,958
plants let's call it you know over the

293
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,600
last it's hard to put a time scale on it

294
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,278
but say 10 000 years at least

295
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,680
um

296
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:25,919
we've done we've changed the plant right

297
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:27,599
we've selected for things in the plants

298
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,759
or individuals that we would find in the

299
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,680
population of plants

300
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,799
that might suit our use so you know for

301
00:10:31,679 --> 00:10:35,439
fiber we

302
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:38,159
we for example we took plants and use

303
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,920
them to make cordage right and ropes

304
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:43,919
and so plants that had long fibers

305
00:10:41,919 --> 00:10:45,838
which is a result of like large

306
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,599
internode spaces you know that was a

307
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,200
useful trait so we changed we

308
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,480
essentially changed these plants over

309
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
time

310
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,159
um you made a really good point

311
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,399
when you when you mentioned humans and

312
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,719
how humans humans breed breed humans are

313
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,399
also obligate outcrossers like we can't

314
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,040
have

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,958
offspring without mating with

316
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,439
an individual of the opposite opposite

317
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,199
sex right and so

318
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,800
very much like cannabis our mating

319
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,040
system is the same kind of way it's

320
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:14,479
designed if you look at humanity across

321
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:16,000
the globe

322
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,480
there's this huge amount of genetic

323
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,720
variation not only in skin and eye color

324
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,399
and hair color but every conceivable

325
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,639
trait

326
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
there's variation present in the species

327
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:26,879
right

328
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,000
lengths of fingers even number of

329
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:29,838
fingers i mean we have these like

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,839
polydacty people that have like six

331
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,000
fingers right and so there's all these

332
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
little weird mutations that can exist in

333
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,799
this in in the species

334
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:41,039
but we don't as humans go in and

335
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,879
actively breed for those traits and

336
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:45,919
certainly like you said

337
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:48,000
we don't breed tightly within our family

338
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:48,759
right because we've learned probably

339
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,120
through

340
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:53,200
experimentation in the past

341
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,120
that like you know when you have

342
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,480
kids with someone that's closely related

343
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,560
to your family

344
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,159
you know there's problems that arise and

345
00:11:58,559 --> 00:12:01,359
you can point to any of the royal

346
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,199
families

347
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:05,120
that have existed around the world over

348
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,120
the last you know few hundred years as

349
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,399
an example of like you know there's like

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,000
a spanish

351
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,039
royal that they essentially bred the

352
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,278
line within within a given family to the

353
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:16,958
point of sterility right

354
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,679
and this also happens with cannabis when

355
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:20,399
you

356
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:23,439
you start um taking these very unnatural

357
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:26,799
breeding programs and you self-implant

358
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,639
you know say over five generations right

359
00:12:26,799 --> 00:12:30,000
you really narrow down the gene pool and

360
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,519
you start uncovering a lot of the

361
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,839
negative deleterious traits that are

362
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,879
buried within the within any any given

363
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,880
individual's genome

364
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,199
so um these are you know these are the

365
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,120
consequences of things that we have to

366
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,040
think about on a very top level when

367
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:47,120
we're going about about our breeding

368
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:48,559
programs and i think that

369
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,078
a lot of people

370
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,278
that come into the cannabis breeding

371
00:12:50,078 --> 00:12:52,638
world

372
00:12:51,278 --> 00:12:54,159
they come from

373
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,240
being growers and then they want to

374
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:58,639
start to make their own plants and the

375
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,879
truth is is that

376
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,320
as much as there is an art involved in

377
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:04,559
selecting plants and mating them

378
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:07,040
together there also is a science and a

379
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:09,759
math behind the art

380
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:11,519
right and so to be truly the most

381
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,759
effective that you can be

382
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,919
you combine that art and passion and

383
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,120
love for the plants and knowledge about

384
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:19,120
you know that you

385
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:23,360
acquire about plants growing you know a

386
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,360
species over say 10-15 years or more

387
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,800
when you add in that level of science

388
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,959
and math and plant-breeding

389
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:31,599
understanding you can really make some

390
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:33,599
quite significant gains right

391
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,040
compared to what we're doing today

392
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,159
uh on the whole i would say

393
00:13:37,039 --> 00:13:39,679
i don't know that's a good answer to the

394
00:13:38,159 --> 00:13:41,278
question yeah yeah i'm just trying to

395
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:44,159
decide if i want to talk a little bit

396
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:45,600
then about what your selection process

397
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:48,799
is because

398
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:51,440
i i realize you have to pick for you

399
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:53,679
know maybe a single trait or a small

400
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,160
group of traits at any given time

401
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:59,359
whether that's powdery mildew resistance

402
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:01,198
or it's uh you know more vigorous root

403
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,360
growth or

404
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:06,958
a particular terpene expression or

405
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:09,680
cannabinoid content or thc um

406
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:12,319
what's sort of the thought process

407
00:14:09,679 --> 00:14:13,120
behind that

408
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,360
well

409
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,879
you know it's it's really no different

410
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,839
than i think the way that anybody looks

411
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,799
at it

412
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,320
um

413
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:21,679
the the only difference is you know

414
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,000
there's look there's every time you

415
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:25,278
breed a plant there's a cost right

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,519
there's a cost in terms of you're

417
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:29,838
selecting one plant over another

418
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:32,320
but there's also like materials cost to

419
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:34,160
grow the plants and then if you're doing

420
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,920
either genomic or

421
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:38,159
chemical analysis

422
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,559
those are like extra costs that start to

423
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:41,600
add up like really really quick

424
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:44,638
you know

425
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,959
you say you know i know in california

426
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,519
last few years you can get a cannabinoid

427
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,278
and a rudimentary terpene test done for

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
like roughly 100 bucks

429
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:54,799
right but if you grow if you're growing

430
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,919
100 individuals from a seed line and

431
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,599
trying to really understand what's

432
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,039
happening in the population and select

433
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
for rare plants

434
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:01,919
that's a ten thousand dollar bill like a

435
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:03,679
hundred times a hundred bucks right

436
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:06,000
hundred individuals 100 bucks per test

437
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,838
that's a ten thousand dollar analytical

438
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,078
chemistry bill just from the lab for

439
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:11,680
that one crop

440
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:13,359
and we haven't even talked about genomic

441
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,039
selection or anything so

442
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:18,720
it's really about balancing

443
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,078
the money that you have to spend on

444
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,680
doing r d

445
00:15:20,078 --> 00:15:23,439
with the results

446
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:25,198
i think that we're entering this world

447
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,480
now

448
00:15:25,198 --> 00:15:28,159
where

449
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,800
you know obviously there's these public

450
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:32,319
publicly traded companies and and and

451
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:34,078
companies that have been invested in by

452
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,600
even private individuals

453
00:15:34,078 --> 00:15:37,278
that have pretty significant budgets

454
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,680
that understand hey

455
00:15:37,278 --> 00:15:42,078
if you're gonna do you know when you do

456
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:44,479
research research and development

457
00:15:42,078 --> 00:15:46,559
yeah it there is a cost

458
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,759
but at the end of the research and

459
00:15:46,559 --> 00:15:49,278
development

460
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,320
you you should end up with something

461
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:52,078
better

462
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,600
like a product that's better in the end

463
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,519
from which you can then make up those

464
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,720
costs right those added costs that you

465
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,959
took on

466
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
um and so this is kind of like the the

467
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,799
debate between

468
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,799
you know the small farmer home grower

469
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,639
versus

470
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,719
more of a corporate style of breeding

471
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,320
which is funded and i've you know i've

472
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,800
had the

473
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,000
pleasure but i've had the ability to do

474
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,799
both

475
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,559
um

476
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:18,240
and i gotta tell you after building a

477
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:21,679
really high throughput lab with really

478
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,959
sensitive um analytical equipment

479
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:24,159
once you've done it that way you really

480
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:26,078
would have a hard time going back to

481
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,559
doing it the other way without all that

482
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,399
chemical analysis because the gains that

483
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:31,679
you can make when you're analyzing

484
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,759
plants

485
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,838
and and looking at them not only from

486
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,919
like the passionate perspective that we

487
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,240
all have as growers of you know 20 plus

488
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:41,838
years you also get all this nerd data

489
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,120
that tells you about like

490
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:45,360
you know the quant the cannabinoid

491
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,278
content or profile or the terpene

492
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:50,079
content and profile

493
00:16:47,278 --> 00:16:54,480
that influences smell and taste you know

494
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:54,479
it's really hard to go back to less data

495
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:59,758
yeah you have a huge advantage um i mean

496
00:16:57,679 --> 00:17:01,838
what i'm hearing is

497
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,800
to a certain extent that you know these

498
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:04,720
small

499
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:06,000
breeders small farmers are just at a

500
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,078
huge

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,078
disadvantage i mean

502
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,399
is it almost becoming a lottery ticket

503
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:14,399
to a certain extent in that case yeah

504
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,959
well i would i would say the smaller

505
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,959
farmers that are doing it without

506
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,318
um

507
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,160
without that kind of funding without

508
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:24,879
that kind of chemical analysis it is a

509
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:28,079
lottery right you really are counting on

510
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,079
luck in your ability

511
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:34,319
as a grower and a or a selector to go

512
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:36,160
through a population and find plants

513
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,918
you're going to miss like i'll just you

514
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
know from my perspective if you do it

515
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:41,520
that way you're going to miss things in

516
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,038
the in the mix because for example it's

517
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,798
really hard to

518
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:46,720
you know buy organoleptics like for

519
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:50,480
example tasting every plant and smoking

520
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,480
every plant it's really hard to identify

521
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,798
not only the differences in like that

522
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,200
top tier cannabinoid production plant

523
00:17:54,798 --> 00:17:59,440
but also like it's like near impossible

524
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:02,640
to find a plant that has cbd

525
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:05,200
or thcv or cbdv for example some of

526
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,960
these more rare cannabinoids like

527
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,360
you because those things are not they

528
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,798
don't have a psychoactive impact on the

529
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,399
on the

530
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,679
yeah sorry i don't know

531
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,759
the psychoactive can be a problem

532
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,000
problematic word

533
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:20,960
if those compounds don't produce a high

534
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,359
right so it's really hard to

535
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,798
quantify them or even qualify plants say

536
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,038
you know you can't pick out a plant that

537
00:18:24,798 --> 00:18:28,798
has thcv or cbdv

538
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:30,798
by smoking it

539
00:18:28,798 --> 00:18:32,400
right so i would say in that [ __ ] in

540
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:34,079
that sense they are at a disadvantage

541
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,720
you know the the people that put the

542
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:36,720
money into

543
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,440
analytics be again either be it chemical

544
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:43,038
analysis or genomic analysis they

545
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,160
definitely have an advantage you know

546
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:46,160
they've got a leg up

547
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:50,399
so following that

548
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
line of thought like where do you see

549
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,559
the industry headed as

550
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,679
we get federal legalization here in the

551
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:59,359
united states as more states come online

552
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:02,160
and more of these big egg companies get

553
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:03,759
into it i mean are we going to end up

554
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,880
is it going to be like when you order

555
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:06,798
corn or

556
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:09,360
tomatoes are we going to lose genetic

557
00:19:06,798 --> 00:19:09,359
diversity

558
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,279
well i i mean i would argue that we're

559
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,880
already losing genetic diversity because

560
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,960
and we have been for the last 20 years

561
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
right and even like say the last 15

562
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,000
years since the

563
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,599
you know the occurrence of like og and

564
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,079
these these cushy plants i guess we're

565
00:19:21,599 --> 00:19:25,599
closer to 20 years at this point in time

566
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,599
um

567
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:29,759
that flavor profile like you know if you

568
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,678
if you do a chemical analytical survey

569
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,679
of the plants on the market the vast

570
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,400
majority of plants are beta-carotelline

571
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:39,120
near seen limonene dominant right and

572
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:41,280
that's that's the cushy market profile

573
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,239
that cushy market profile that everybody

574
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,720
wants that gassy nose

575
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,880
is a very small subset of the plants

576
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,839
that cannabis can produce right so we

577
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,160
already are going towards

578
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:55,759
um a smaller genetic diversity

579
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,960
by

580
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:01,038
consumer choices right

581
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,440
um

582
00:20:01,038 --> 00:20:03,440
i don't

583
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:07,359
i don't know that big ag is gonna be

584
00:20:06,558 --> 00:20:09,200
i mean

585
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,558
look it's if for these big pot companies

586
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,640
that we see that are building right now

587
00:20:10,558 --> 00:20:15,119
these msos the multi-state operators

588
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,799
like cure leaf and tree leaf

589
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:18,798
once a company becomes like a public

590
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:21,519
company it's really their only goal is

591
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:23,519
to make more money

592
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,079
right they want the stock to go up for

593
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,200
their investors

594
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,158
and so

595
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,558
those type of companies are not really

596
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,960
too too keen to put like millions of

597
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:36,639
dollars into a breeding program

598
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,919
because it's a cost it's a cost center

599
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
right it's something that's always going

600
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,440
to just be costing you money all the

601
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,440
time

602
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,879
okay um

603
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:45,798
i would just say could one argue too

604
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,120
that

605
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:50,879
consumer uh

606
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:52,558
the consumer-driven markets in the sense

607
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,240
that people always are chasing the next

608
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:58,960
type strain or cultivar will keep things

609
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,519
you know somewhat fresh and and keep

610
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,038
maybe smaller breeders in in the running

611
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:04,079
for

612
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,480
you know

613
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:07,918
genetics down the road or

614
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,038
i think yeah i think that there's always

615
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
going to well i think that the breeding

616
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:12,240
will be done by smaller companies or

617
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,240
smaller groups um i don't think it's

618
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
going to be you know these small smart

619
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,038
small farms are really going to be

620
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,120
leading the way because like i said it's

621
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,679
quite hard to compete

622
00:21:19,119 --> 00:21:23,038
against plants that are bred you know

623
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,200
for example i mean one of the companies

624
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:26,798
i worked for down in california we had a

625
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,919
client that we did some breeding for and

626
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:29,679
they actually ended up winning the

627
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,799
emerald crop with a cut with a with a

628
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,159
cult a cultivar called lemon crush

629
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:36,400
and that year

630
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,480
the lemon crush like you know we we used

631
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
a lab to obviously to guide our

632
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,759
selection process

633
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,720
and our breeding process

634
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,400
and

635
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,640
that left the lemon crush plant beat the

636
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
competitors by like a really significant

637
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,759
amount like all the people that you know

638
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:51,200
all the judges of the emerald crop were

639
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:54,480
really quite

640
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:56,720
unanimously blown away by this one plant

641
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,798
um

642
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,120
you know i think i think it had like

643
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:03,440
you know it was like 30 to 40 or maybe

644
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:04,959
it was 20 to 30 percent more votes than

645
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,159
any other plant in the competition which

646
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,319
is like that that's really quite

647
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,440
significant right it wasn't a close

648
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:10,960
margin

649
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,038
um

650
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,000
so i think that we'll probably see less

651
00:22:13,038 --> 00:22:15,679
people

652
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,839
breeding in the future i mean there'll

653
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,759
be more people playing around

654
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,079
the the the flip side to the coin is

655
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,400
that you know

656
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:26,158
this market-driven approach that always

657
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,679
depends something new is a little bit

658
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:29,200
fickle it's a little bit fickle it's

659
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,880
really fickle to the point where it's

660
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,240
kind of ridiculous like

661
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,640
you know the market wants something new

662
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
every six months you can't breed plants

663
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,280
that fast to be finding new plants that

664
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:40,879
quickly right that are truly

665
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:42,558
better plants

666
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,799
um

667
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:45,759
so i think that like the the market

668
00:22:44,798 --> 00:22:47,119
height

669
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:48,960
side that we have has kind of

670
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:51,279
accelerated to the point where it's like

671
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,960
it's ridiculous at this point in time

672
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:56,399
um and people need to you know

673
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,919
i just don't think fashions need to

674
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,240
change that much and really when you

675
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,480
look at these plants chemically

676
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,319
the names change but chemically

677
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:06,000
the plants aren't changing that much

678
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:08,399
right like the plant that was popular

679
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,839
six months ago or eight months ago is

680
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,360
really no different chemically than the

681
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:13,439
plant that is popular today it just has

682
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:15,678
a new fancy name

683
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,080
yeah that's a that's a great point and

684
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,840
when i think of other crops like

685
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:22,240
tomatoes you know i'll see a couple new

686
00:23:19,839 --> 00:23:25,038
varieties maybe come out in a given year

687
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,200
but everyone's going back you know and

688
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:29,279
i know i have my favorites that i order

689
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,519
every year i like to run a sakura red

690
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:33,200
cherry tomato for example and

691
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:34,558
i love the fact that i know exactly what

692
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,240
i'm going to get

693
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,158
as a gardener and i can order those

694
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,120
seeds and they're consistent and that's

695
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:41,360
uh

696
00:23:39,119 --> 00:23:42,879
that's really nice um

697
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:44,639
do you see something more like a

698
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,880
traditional crop

699
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,880
experience for gardeners down the road

700
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,840
like uh the way we currently get a lot

701
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,840
of our vegetable seeds

702
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:55,119
yeah well again like okay so tomato is a

703
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:57,359
really

704
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:59,038
interesting example because

705
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:01,119
tomato is kind of the opposite breeding

706
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:02,480
system of cannabis it's not an obligated

707
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:04,479
crosser it's it's called a salting

708
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,919
species so

709
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,000
selfers

710
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,759
once they've been bred and purged out

711
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,759
like the negative genes which tomato has

712
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:13,379
done over really the last

713
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:16,000
few thousand years

714
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:18,159
[Music]

715
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
they're like when you grow if you buy an

716
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,960
heirloom tomato seed and you save the

717
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
seeds and you you know you rot off the

718
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,240
that like the whatever the material is

719
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,320
that surrounds the seeds you kind of

720
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,319
have to decompose it

721
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,158
and then the seed is able to germinate

722
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:33,839
if you plant those seeds the next year

723
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
and you harvest the tomato from the

724
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:37,678
second generation they look almost

725
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,440
identical and taste almost identical to

726
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:41,679
the tomatoes that you got from the year

727
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,278
before and also they all look identical

728
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,880
to their cohorts in the in the

729
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,400
population right like all the brothers

730
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,600
and sisters

731
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,278
come up looking the same yeah um

732
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:53,199
and if you again breed it again another

733
00:24:51,278 --> 00:24:54,720
generation or on for like you know say

734
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,278
20 generations

735
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,640
those seeds look they're the fruit look

736
00:24:57,278 --> 00:24:59,919
and taste the same in the 20th

737
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,679
generation as they did in the first

738
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,200
generation that doesn't happen with

739
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,960
cannabis right

740
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,640
um because again it's not like an

741
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,000
outcrosser just like you have you have

742
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
brothers and sisters or the audience

743
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,599
members that have brothers and sisters

744
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:13,200
they know aside from twins

745
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:14,719
that your brothers and sisters might

746
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
share traits that you have but they

747
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,000
don't look identical to you right

748
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,960
they're not the same

749
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
um

750
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,798
and so i don't think that like

751
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,799
i think really once we have full

752
00:25:22,798 --> 00:25:26,720
legalization

753
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:28,240
in multiple markets across the world i

754
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,400
really don't think that there will be

755
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,440
much of a seed market

756
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,960
um

757
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,640
i think the majority of people that are

758
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,400
growing from growing will grow from

759
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,080
clone or tissue culture

760
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,400
and you know we get to that point call

761
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:42,000
it 10-15 years down the road

762
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,440
then you will actually have breeding

763
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,558
companies that put in the time and the

764
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,159
work

765
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:47,678
to make

766
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,520
um

767
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,080
crops that are plantable from seed and

768
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:53,599
uniform chemically that you know like in

769
00:25:52,079 --> 00:25:54,558
the the corn analogy that we're giving

770
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:56,959
before

771
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:58,558
where you know you talk if you have like

772
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,159
you know you want to plant an acre or 10

773
00:25:58,558 --> 00:26:01,839
acres of corn you can go out and buy

774
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,120
corn seed and they all come up and they

775
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,278
grow the same height and they have the

776
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:07,278
same number of ears per

777
00:26:05,278 --> 00:26:09,679
plant and they're all like what i call

778
00:26:07,278 --> 00:26:11,599
bulletproof they're all resistant to

779
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,360
pests and diseases and drought and they

780
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,399
all have high yields and they all look

781
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,000
the same

782
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
right eventually we will get there with

783
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,839
cannabis but i really don't think that

784
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,600
that type of breeding is going to be

785
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,519
done by people on a small scale that's

786
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:27,119
going to be done by

787
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:29,119
companies that put work into you know it

788
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,599
they put resources into

789
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,759
genetic analysis and chemical analysis

790
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:35,678
right and they they truly create uniform

791
00:26:33,759 --> 00:26:37,038
plants using

792
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,480
like

793
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,079
more let's just say more advanced

794
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,038
breeding technologies

795
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:44,558
right

796
00:26:41,038 --> 00:26:46,480
are we at risk of roundup ready seeds

797
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:49,200
hemp seeds or cannabis seeds down the

798
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,720
road i don't i don't think so as long as

799
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,120
we have

800
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
the straight the stringent chemical

801
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:56,719
controls that we have on the plants

802
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,079
right i mean

803
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,240
i think you're in washington so you guys

804
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:01,918
have like a pretty regulated system i'm

805
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,359
in canada we have a federally regulated

806
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
system and it's very clear that you

807
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
can't have

808
00:27:04,558 --> 00:27:09,359
more than a specific number of parts per

809
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:11,599
billion of any given chemical chemical

810
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:12,879
pesticide right and so really you don't

811
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:14,719
want to be using chemicals on your

812
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,919
plants because it there ends up being a

813
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,000
trace

814
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,600
or like even a disqualification of your

815
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,079
crop if the cow

816
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:24,079
chemical burden is too high right so i

817
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:25,278
really don't see roundup ready being a

818
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,960
thing

819
00:27:25,278 --> 00:27:29,679
um

820
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,038
in cannabis right i just it's like you'd

821
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,840
end up with all this roundup in the

822
00:27:31,038 --> 00:27:36,720
final extract or flowers and that's just

823
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:38,398
that's not allowed by the regulations so

824
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,919
you know i think that the regulations

825
00:27:38,398 --> 00:27:41,278
kind of protect us from a lot of those

826
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,038
bad they're not not that they're bad

827
00:27:41,278 --> 00:27:45,519
practices but they're necessary

828
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:47,679
practices to do

829
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:49,759
you know to do again like 10 000 acres

830
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,399
of corn right when you're in iowa or

831
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:54,480
somewhere in the midwest and every your

832
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:56,158
neighbors are all growing either soy or

833
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,839
corn or whatever it is

834
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:59,278
everybody's growing the same crop right

835
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:00,798
and so pests can come in and just

836
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,960
destroy things

837
00:28:00,798 --> 00:28:04,639
and that's why you end up using these

838
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:06,159
you know agrochemicals to essentially

839
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,320
protect the crop from either weeds or

840
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,799
pests

841
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:13,439
so um

842
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:16,319
i know your talk

843
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,320
or your panel uh this was like probably

844
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:21,839
four years ago now maybe five years ago

845
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:24,480
at emerald cup was about uh crispr

846
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:26,639
and and talking about

847
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,679
gene editing

848
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:31,600
and there was a lot of concern from

849
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,960
in gmos and there was a lot of concern

850
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,439
from the organic folks in the audience

851
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,480
of uh gmo cannabis

852
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,960
what

853
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:43,200
if anything has changed in the last few

854
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,840
years on that or what are your thoughts

855
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,840
on that

856
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,600
i mean

857
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,200
i come from like the opposite end of the

858
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:52,959
spectrum i mean don't get me wrong i'm

859
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,360
like you know i'm pretty hippie-minded

860
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,440
and the environment is a big deal for me

861
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:59,439
um

862
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,558
that said i also studied like like i

863
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,120
said i studied plant breeding and

864
00:29:00,558 --> 00:29:04,558
biotechnology at a post-grad level in

865
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:06,558
university

866
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,278
so i like i have a pretty good grasp of

867
00:29:06,558 --> 00:29:12,798
like you know genetic mutation and

868
00:29:09,278 --> 00:29:15,119
how genomes change over time um and even

869
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:17,200
you know you know like for example like

870
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,879
there's there's viruses and bacteria

871
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,640
that change plants that they create

872
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,080
genetically modified plants and a lot of

873
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,320
the species that we

874
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:25,678
we work with and we use as egg crops

875
00:29:24,319 --> 00:29:28,720
have undergone these genetic

876
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,159
transformations naturally in the wild

877
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:32,640
right and so

878
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,640
i i'm like i'm not a religious person i

879
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,120
don't believe in like

880
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:39,038
i don't really believe in the concept of

881
00:29:37,119 --> 00:29:40,959
there's a god making all these decisions

882
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:42,158
for us so when people start talking

883
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,240
about like

884
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,760
it's not the way nature intended like

885
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,359
nature does all these things and we

886
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,879
harvested these tools for genetic

887
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,199
modification

888
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,200
um and we're at the point now where we

889
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:57,278
can you know

890
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:59,278
we can very specifically change

891
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:01,519
genetic bases and plants to make those

892
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,919
plants have traits that we that the

893
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,879
plant might not have right

894
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,880
um

895
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,240
so my anyway my point is i'm a little

896
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,320
bit biased and i think that a lot of

897
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,519
people would probably disagree with me

898
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:13,200
but i think that when you get to the

899
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:14,960
point where you really understand that

900
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,480
the cannabis genomes or genomes in

901
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,480
general are always in flux

902
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,440
they're always changing and so

903
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:25,679
humans using

904
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,960
crispr or similar technologies to go in

905
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:32,640
and very specifically and precisely edit

906
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,278
base pairs to induce changes is not that

907
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,640
it's not only not dangerous it's

908
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:39,119
gonna be the only thing that's gonna

909
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,480
allow humanity to survive the next few

910
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:42,239
hundred years

911
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
with this insane

912
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,599
global climate change situation that

913
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,200
we've created

914
00:30:45,599 --> 00:30:48,839
we're gonna have mass famines we're

915
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,440
gonna have

916
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:52,558
areas geographical areas that were crop

917
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,919
production areas that are going to

918
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,200
become destroyed by the changing

919
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:56,480
environment and we're going to have to

920
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,720
adapt

921
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:00,798
plants to regions that they weren't able

922
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
to grow in like really damn quickly if

923
00:31:00,798 --> 00:31:04,240
we're going to have any shot at all

924
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:05,839
and so you can't do that through

925
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,240
conventional breeding like you have to

926
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:10,240
really use all the technologies

927
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,159
that we have learned about to get to

928
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,038
that point right so

929
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,399
um

930
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,599
that'll probably upset some of your

931
00:31:14,398 --> 00:31:17,599
listeners but that's kind of my

932
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:19,439
perspective on it

933
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:22,879
it's all good so you do see this as

934
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,880
being the future with um

935
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,278
with cannabis i guess

936
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:29,760
it yeah and it's you listen for me it's

937
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:32,558
it's not an inevitably feature

938
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:34,319
it's just a technology and like for me

939
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,759
technologies are tools

940
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:37,439
right it's like you know i gave this

941
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,359
analogy

942
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,120
on the show a couple of weeks ago

943
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:43,038
it's like having a golf it's like having

944
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:44,959
a golf game right if you're out on the

945
00:31:43,038 --> 00:31:46,558
golf you don't just take your driver out

946
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,679
every time you need to hit the ball and

947
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:48,480
smack it

948
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,360
right

949
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,720
you you learn to have

950
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:56,959
a toolbox of shots that you can pull out

951
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,120
at the time when you need it right so

952
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,440
not everything is a crisper

953
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:03,599
solution right sometimes you need to

954
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,940
make a crisper modification to a plant

955
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,319
to induce a trait

956
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:08,480
[Music]

957
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,158
um but then from that point on you just

958
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:11,919
classically breed you use classical

959
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,760
mendelian breeding techniques to shuffle

960
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,200
that trait around right

961
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,879
and look there's genetic modifications

962
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,640
that you can do to plants

963
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,399
that don't ever end up passed on into

964
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,000
the offspring right it's just something

965
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,759
that you would use for a seed production

966
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,679
technology so

967
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,359
there's a lot of ways to use these words

968
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,600
like crispr these technologies like

969
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:31,839
crispr and i think that like a lot of

970
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,839
the anti

971
00:32:31,839 --> 00:32:35,839
um

972
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:37,678
this anti-gmo

973
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,759
kind of ethos comes from people that

974
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,360
don't really understand the science

975
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:43,359
and i think once you start to understand

976
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,839
the science and the way that cannabis

977
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:47,519
genomes are in flux already

978
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:50,240
that like these things don't become too

979
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,240
much of a big deal right

980
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,319
well you know i know this is totally off

981
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,880
the cuff too and this wasn't a topic we

982
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:59,839
planned on talking about but um

983
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,519
for me as someone who

984
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:05,038
falls on this the organic side of things

985
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:06,558
and you're right i don't

986
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:08,079
i don't totally understand the science

987
00:33:06,558 --> 00:33:09,119
behind it i'll be the first to admit

988
00:33:08,079 --> 00:33:11,599
that

989
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,518
my concern is more the corruption of

990
00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:15,678
these these major

991
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,480
agrochemical companies i don't trust

992
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,559
them

993
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,079
i don't feel that they have our best

994
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:22,558
interest in mine and i think that their

995
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:25,119
bottom line is going to supersede our

996
00:33:22,558 --> 00:33:26,558
health and i feel like our government to

997
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:28,000
a certain extent is willing to push

998
00:33:26,558 --> 00:33:30,720
these things through through lobbyists

999
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,359
and so my concern is that

1000
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,880
even if the technology is okay

1001
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:37,199
there may be

1002
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,519
uses of it that could be

1003
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,120
dangerous for human health

1004
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,720
down the road i mean when we talk about

1005
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,000
roundup for example and roundup ready

1006
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,079
crops

1007
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,759
there's there is more and more research

1008
00:33:46,079 --> 00:33:49,678
that maybe this wasn't as safe as we

1009
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,158
thought it was and you know it's been

1010
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,880
used to bankrupt a lot of indian farmers

1011
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:58,640
in terms of their inability to afford

1012
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,880
the seed and litigation around um

1013
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,559
you know drift of of pollen and things

1014
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,399
into other organic crops i mean it's

1015
00:34:02,558 --> 00:34:05,440
become a little bit of a contentious

1016
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,839
issue

1017
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,878
so i think that's sort of my perspective

1018
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:10,639
on it because you're right i absolutely

1019
00:34:08,878 --> 00:34:12,878
don't understand all the science behind

1020
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,200
it listen that that's totally a fair

1021
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:17,679
perspective and i i can't i disagree

1022
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:19,358
with you there at all

1023
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:21,760
but you know it's like to me it's like

1024
00:34:19,358 --> 00:34:25,039
nuclear technology we can build safe

1025
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,520
clean thorium reactors that can safely

1026
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,199
produce nuclear energy or we can take

1027
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,440
plutonium and make bombs out of it or

1028
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:33,118
hydrogen bombs right

1029
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,358
those are like

1030
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,760
let's not confuse the tool or the

1031
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:40,159
technology with the use of the tool

1032
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:43,119
right by unscrupulous people with

1033
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,679
you know with unscrupulous unscrupulous

1034
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:47,519
agendas right like there's always going

1035
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,519
to be people that take the technology

1036
00:34:47,519 --> 00:34:51,838
and they try to develop it for their own

1037
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:52,960
financial interest

1038
00:34:51,838 --> 00:34:55,039
but that doesn't mean that you should

1039
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,199
throw the technology out because

1040
00:34:55,039 --> 00:35:00,480
you can also use technology to to

1041
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:02,078
benefit humanity and i think that

1042
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,519
you know the the points that you're

1043
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,200
making are very fair given

1044
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:08,480
the track records of the companies that

1045
00:35:07,199 --> 00:35:10,559
have developed

1046
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,960
um these technologies i.e you know

1047
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,480
monsanto and the roundup ready thing

1048
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,400
you're right

1049
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,320
we made these plants resistant to a

1050
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,760
chemical and i think a lot of people

1051
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,440
don't realize that monsanto was a

1052
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,960
chemical company right they made

1053
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,159
chemicals that was what they did before

1054
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,400
they got into plant breeding and then

1055
00:35:24,159 --> 00:35:28,319
they developed then they found this gene

1056
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,838
and the whole company business switched

1057
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:32,000
because they found this gene they could

1058
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:33,759
put into plants they had a patent on

1059
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,800
that genetic construct

1060
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,720
and

1061
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,480
that really gave them

1062
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:41,358
the ability to switch into this kind of

1063
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:43,599
life sciences company right or ag big ag

1064
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:46,000
company

1065
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,599
and the the only the only goal

1066
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,599
was to make these resistant plants so

1067
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:51,680
they could sell more chemicals

1068
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,920
right sure sure

1069
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:56,838
yeah so anyway i guess i i think people

1070
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,119
should understand again it is a fine

1071
00:35:56,838 --> 00:36:01,358
discussion i think that we have to

1072
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,160
separate the technologies

1073
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:03,759
from

1074
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:05,279
the the technology and the potential

1075
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,200
good uses from

1076
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,800
bad actors using those technologies for

1077
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,879
their own profit

1078
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:12,400
right because we can't you don't just

1079
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,240
throw away the baby with the bathwater

1080
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
because there's people doing bad stuff

1081
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,118
right

1082
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,919
these technologies really can

1083
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,599
change the way that agriculture is done

1084
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,960
they can we can make better more

1085
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,720
resistance healthier more nutritious

1086
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,119
plants right

1087
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,559
um and we should be if we have

1088
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:32,079
technologies do those things i think

1089
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,159
that we should be doing those things to

1090
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:35,119
make our ecological footprint on the

1091
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,319
planet

1092
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,320
lower

1093
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,160
right sure well i mean you bring up a

1094
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,760
good point like we may need some of

1095
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:45,039
these technologies just to survive as a

1096
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:46,960
species down the road um

1097
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:48,800
i you know i don't know but i could i

1098
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,320
could very well see that being the case

1099
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,000
and

1100
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,519
um you know whether i like it or not

1101
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,800
it's going to happen and i think that's

1102
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:58,880
the that's the aspect of it that uh

1103
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,800
i think i think i'd be cognizant of is

1104
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,240
it doesn't really matter what my opinion

1105
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,599
is on it at the end of the day there's

1106
00:37:02,239 --> 00:37:05,919
gonna be people out there that are going

1107
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,320
to do it whether it's uh

1108
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,159
you know whether i like it or not so

1109
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,838
what and can it be done in the safe way

1110
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:13,598
that protects consumers right and i

1111
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,599
think that the science has shown at this

1112
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:18,000
point in time that it really can

1113
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:19,519
um and that's that's why we have

1114
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,800
you know i'm not sure what the process

1115
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,358
is in the states but i'm pretty sure

1116
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,800
that the epa must have some say about

1117
00:37:23,358 --> 00:37:26,880
the release of genetically modified

1118
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,240
crops i know that in canada

1119
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,920
you can't just take a genetically

1120
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,838
modified organism and release it to the

1121
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,680
environment without like millions of

1122
00:37:31,838 --> 00:37:37,039
dollars worth of studies

1123
00:37:33,679 --> 00:37:38,719
right so there is like a big regulatory

1124
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,400
pushback

1125
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,559
on a lot of these technologies where you

1126
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,039
have really do have to demonstrate that

1127
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,838
the plants are safe

1128
00:37:45,039 --> 00:37:47,039
so

1129
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:48,960
okay i want to i want to change

1130
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,759
directions on this a little bit in the

1131
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,039
sense that you know i see a lot of

1132
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,960
breeding happening for

1133
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:58,719
you know the retail market

1134
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
is there much breeding being done i mean

1135
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:03,439
i know there's some but where do you see

1136
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,000
this going in terms of identifying

1137
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,679
specific compounds or effects uh for a

1138
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,920
more medical nature like around

1139
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,000
anti-seizure or

1140
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,079
you know anti-nausea or some of these

1141
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,079
other benefits that people are seeing in

1142
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:18,800
cannabis how do we get more consistency

1143
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,800
there

1144
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,160
well yes through breeding and product

1145
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,320
development right like it's kind of

1146
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:25,598
those two aspects go hand in hand one of

1147
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:27,280
the things that with the company that i

1148
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,880
worked for in the states

1149
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:31,440
they were they owned a series of

1150
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,039
dispensaries or one of their affiliate

1151
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,720
companies owned a series of dispensaries

1152
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:36,719
and so the r d was really designed to

1153
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,838
see to create products

1154
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:39,679
that that could end up in those

1155
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,799
dispensaries or could end up benefiting

1156
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,239
you know

1157
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,760
benefiting patients

1158
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,559
and so we did a whole series of breeding

1159
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,640
programs using like thcv and cbdv and

1160
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,480
cbg

1161
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:52,960
to like up regulate those compounds and

1162
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,880
create new cannabinoid profiles

1163
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,639
that might have some

1164
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,200
therapeutic advantage right and i think

1165
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:01,920
epilepsy is like one one area where i

1166
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:02,799
think we made some decent gains

1167
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,720
um

1168
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,480
some people might not know that this cbd

1169
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:08,799
v compound

1170
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,800
is very much like c cbd but it's got a

1171
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,960
shorter little chain on the side of the

1172
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,560
molecule

1173
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,800
that compound is more effective for

1174
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:17,679
epilepsy than cbd is

1175
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,839
and

1176
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:23,919
so we we had bred a line that had

1177
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:25,599
elevated levels of cbd cbdv

1178
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,880
and you know at the time we were doing

1179
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,160
all this work where we were pairing

1180
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:32,800
specific cannabinoid profiles

1181
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:35,039
with various terpene profiles

1182
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,320
kind of to like optimize the entourage

1183
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,199
effect right

1184
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,000
um

1185
00:39:37,199 --> 00:39:41,679
or the concept of an entourage effect so

1186
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,280
i looked into the literature and started

1187
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:45,440
look figuring out trying to figure out

1188
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,920
what terpenes and terpenoids

1189
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:49,358
had anti-spasmodic or anti-convulsant

1190
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,320
properties

1191
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:53,838
and realized that both

1192
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,359
beta-caryophyllene and linolol

1193
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:56,719
each have some of those properties and

1194
00:39:55,358 --> 00:40:00,960
so

1195
00:39:56,719 --> 00:40:02,879
i started hybridizing our cbdv line into

1196
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,039
plants that were high in beta carotene

1197
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:07,119
and little law and after a couple of

1198
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,119
generations of shuffling we ended up

1199
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,680
with plants that were essentially cbdv

1200
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,680
dominance and had terpene profiles that

1201
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,759
were dominant in beta-carotene and

1202
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:17,759
little law and so the idea is that

1203
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,640
you've now got a plant that not only has

1204
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,000
a cannabinoid that is directed towards

1205
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:26,159
you know epilepsy or reducing seizures

1206
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,760
but all the compounds

1207
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:29,838
the sorry the other major compounds that

1208
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:31,599
are in the plant also have

1209
00:40:29,838 --> 00:40:33,440
anti-convulsive or you know

1210
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,039
anti-spasmodic properties with the idea

1211
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,519
being that

1212
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:40,079
these flowers could then be given to

1213
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:42,079
to people that have these conditions or

1214
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,240
you would use those to make extracts

1215
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,760
right that are that are more suited to

1216
00:40:44,239 --> 00:40:48,159
giving to like for example kids for

1217
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,839
example right you don't want like

1218
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,279
four-year-olds to have to be smoking big

1219
00:40:49,838 --> 00:40:52,559
fat joints

1220
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,640
so it's better to give them an extract

1221
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:57,039
that they can take orally right

1222
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,358
yeah no that's really exciting

1223
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,119
for anyone listening that may be dealing

1224
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,559
with these sort of medical issues do you

1225
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:04,000
have any

1226
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:06,159
recommendations where people might be

1227
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,239
able to get their hands on genetics or

1228
00:41:06,159 --> 00:41:09,118
reach out to companies that may

1229
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,559
be able to point them in the right

1230
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,640
direction

1231
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:14,318
yeah unfortunately that's the

1232
00:41:12,639 --> 00:41:16,159
the corporate trade offside to this

1233
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:17,519
whole thing right it's like these

1234
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,799
companies that develop that kind of

1235
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:21,358
intellectual property they don't just

1236
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,519
give it away um

1237
00:41:21,358 --> 00:41:25,679
i mean can you buy the seeds even though

1238
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:28,000
or can you no uh

1239
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:30,078
buy the product you can't

1240
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:32,079
i i'm not sure what the status of the

1241
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,880
products are in their dispensaries these

1242
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,640
days

1243
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:36,880
um because again i've been i've been

1244
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:38,719
going for that company for you know five

1245
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,318
years at this point in time

1246
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:42,000
but um

1247
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,440
yes i don't really know what the status

1248
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,039
of their availability is i know they

1249
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,280
filed some patents and i think that

1250
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,759
their their business model was more

1251
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:51,440
about trying to find other businesses to

1252
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,960
license the technology to and license

1253
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,559
those plants too rather than getting out

1254
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,519
with patients

1255
00:41:54,559 --> 00:41:57,358
um

1256
00:41:55,519 --> 00:41:58,639
which is a bummer but i mean it's it's

1257
00:41:57,358 --> 00:42:00,000
kind of the way that things are done

1258
00:41:58,639 --> 00:42:01,279
again if you're spending hundreds of

1259
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,199
thousands of dollars or even millions of

1260
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,519
dollars building these labs

1261
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:07,519
and running breeding programs to fill

1262
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:09,280
you know we're talking like

1263
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,400
tens of thousands of samples going to

1264
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,400
the lab

1265
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,400
that's a pretty hefty bill right a lab

1266
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,240
bill and they want they they obviously

1267
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,000
want to recupe a return on their

1268
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:19,598
investment so

1269
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,119
handing out seeds to some growers in

1270
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,960
humboldt that are going to multiply them

1271
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,400
and hand them out for free

1272
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:26,000
isn't really part of their business

1273
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,680
model

1274
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,639
yeah i was just curious if there if they

1275
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,838
were

1276
00:42:28,639 --> 00:42:33,279
you know even selling clones or offering

1277
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,159
uh the final

1278
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,079
you know

1279
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:38,480
end product in a form that people could

1280
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,640
purchase if that was something that

1281
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,400
i mean at the end of the year

1282
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:44,559
yeah i mean look we're still stumbling

1283
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:46,559
out of [ __ ] prohibition right

1284
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,838
and i think that you know give it like

1285
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,039
let's call it 20 years i mean that's

1286
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:52,880
pretty far out but even 15 to 20 years

1287
00:42:51,039 --> 00:42:54,400
after legalization

1288
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,480
people are going to have you know the

1289
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,240
united states and canada as well will

1290
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,240
have really good systems for protecting

1291
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:02,239
the ownership of plants for for breeders

1292
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:03,919
that actually develop new plants you'll

1293
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:04,959
be able to register it

1294
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,559
and

1295
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,240
those things when they're propagated or

1296
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,519
sold through nurseries the breeders will

1297
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:11,838
get

1298
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:13,280
you know little bits of royalty right

1299
00:43:11,838 --> 00:43:15,838
that come back to them

1300
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:17,200
and as those systems develop i think

1301
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:21,519
that we'll see

1302
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:23,279
a much more robust legal clone sales

1303
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:25,039
right so that growers don't have to buy

1304
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,200
seeds and search through

1305
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:29,119
to find winter winter plants like you'll

1306
00:43:27,199 --> 00:43:31,598
be able to go in

1307
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,240
to any nursery and select from probably

1308
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,160
i would say 100 to 300

1309
00:43:34,239 --> 00:43:37,838
different genetic types

1310
00:43:36,159 --> 00:43:40,000
right that have been selected for either

1311
00:43:37,838 --> 00:43:42,239
specific cannabinoid profile or specific

1312
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,400
terpene profile or flavor

1313
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:46,078
um

1314
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:48,240
so are you talking tissue culture now at

1315
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:50,000
this point

1316
00:43:48,239 --> 00:43:51,358
yeah i would say a lot of that stuff

1317
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,199
they might not be the plants that you

1318
00:43:51,358 --> 00:43:55,199
buy might not be from tissue culture but

1319
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:57,118
hopefully the moms went through tissue

1320
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:59,118
culture right

1321
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,039
um i think all of these systems that we

1322
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,559
use in cannabis including including

1323
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:04,318
nurseries like i think

1324
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,559
growing plants mother plants not using

1325
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:09,119
tissue culture those days are pretty

1326
00:44:06,559 --> 00:44:10,960
much done or they're you know we're

1327
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,240
we're seeing the beginning of that that

1328
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,679
the extinction

1329
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:15,439
of that process

1330
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:17,759
i think mother plants should be fed from

1331
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,039
tissue culture they should be certified

1332
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:23,920
past and virus and viroid free

1333
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,279
um and then those clones get turned into

1334
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:27,119
moms

1335
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,640
like you know and mothers are probably

1336
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:30,000
going to be replaced like mother plants

1337
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:31,279
will be replaced either every three or

1338
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,559
six months

1339
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,800
right and you wouldn't run them that

1340
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,719
much longer you're constantly

1341
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,839
you should constantly reproducing your

1342
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:40,159
your

1343
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:42,400
mother stock with new tissue culture

1344
00:44:40,159 --> 00:44:44,239
plants for that same genetic type

1345
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,559
right so that just helps me

1346
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,078
let's talk about that a little bit so uh

1347
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:51,119
for growers with mother plants from a

1348
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:52,720
genetic perspective you know if you're

1349
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:53,920
what's best practice here so we have

1350
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:56,559
some people that will keep a mother

1351
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,880
plant for let's say six months

1352
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:00,719
you'll have others that will every crop

1353
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:04,240
start a new mother plant

1354
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,959
as they uh take more cuttings now i i am

1355
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,799
aware that mutations can be more likely

1356
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,760
to occur due to

1357
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,200
plant stress of of any type um which

1358
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,760
could affect your next crop but in

1359
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:17,199
theory you know your your clone is

1360
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,520
a clone of the

1361
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:20,879
prior plant what are the what would be

1362
00:45:19,519 --> 00:45:24,318
best practice or what are the risks

1363
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,318
associated with either model

1364
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:29,679
good question so i think one of the

1365
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:31,358
risks with tissue culture is again just

1366
00:45:29,679 --> 00:45:33,679
to say not all tissue culture lobs are

1367
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,400
the same a lot of tissue culture labs

1368
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:37,358
use hormones

1369
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,599
to

1370
00:45:37,358 --> 00:45:41,039
ramp up multiplication rates or plant

1371
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,280
growth rates

1372
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,559
those same hormones that have all those

1373
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:47,040
properties that are beneficial for

1374
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:48,559
tissue culture like for example phi

1375
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,239
diazeroline one of the one of the

1376
00:45:48,559 --> 00:45:51,759
negative traits with that one which is

1377
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:53,358
very often used in cannabis tissue

1378
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,640
culture is that it increases the

1379
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:57,279
mutation rate

1380
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:58,559
and so there is the opportunity that

1381
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,079
that

1382
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:01,920
that your plant is going to change

1383
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:03,599
genetically as a result of going through

1384
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,639
the process and good tissue culture

1385
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:06,800
companies

1386
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:08,159
they monitor the you know the genetic

1387
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,240
stability of plants going through

1388
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:12,960
culture to make sure that they're not

1389
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:14,639
creating a whole bunch of off types

1390
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,760
um

1391
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:18,719
you know

1392
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:20,880
this stuff also happens in outside of

1393
00:46:18,719 --> 00:46:23,439
the tissue culture lab too plants

1394
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,079
undergo natural mutation rates all

1395
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:27,280
eukaryotic organisms have a natural rate

1396
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:29,440
of mutation

1397
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,880
i like i like to use the pinot noir

1398
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:35,519
pinot gris pinot blanc example

1399
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:38,240
pinot gris pinot blah are just

1400
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,239
they're they're

1401
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,559
white and pink grapes that actually

1402
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,880
derive they're actually cloned copies of

1403
00:46:42,559 --> 00:46:47,838
pinot noir which is a purple grape right

1404
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,838
it's just that through natural mutation

1405
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:51,759
of cells dividing

1406
00:46:49,838 --> 00:46:54,078
some clump of cells lost the ability to

1407
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,119
produce that purple pigment and

1408
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,720
therefore the grapes on that branch grew

1409
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,720
white right and somebody was walking

1410
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:02,078
through a vineyard at some point in time

1411
00:47:00,719 --> 00:47:04,639
probably harvesting the grapes and

1412
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:07,920
realized that this one branch of a vine

1413
00:47:04,639 --> 00:47:09,759
had a had a um a white grape and so they

1414
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,639
they took that branch off and cloned it

1415
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,640
and

1416
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,639
you know started making mother earth

1417
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:16,318
started that plant to be more or less a

1418
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,078
mother donor plant

1419
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:19,199
and propagated a whole army of those

1420
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:21,119
plants right

1421
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:23,039
so anyway the point is is that like

1422
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:25,200
mutations are a natural part of life

1423
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:26,480
they happen anyway they're happening all

1424
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:28,799
the time

1425
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,800
um

1426
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:33,040
yeah so i don't know like i think that

1427
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,240
like

1428
00:47:33,039 --> 00:47:35,838
you know if you think about all the

1429
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:37,199
other negative stuff that can happen

1430
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:39,679
when you're just using mother plants

1431
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:41,519
like obviously the huge pest burden and

1432
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:44,719
viruses and virus like we've seen with

1433
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:44,719
the hot plate and viroid

1434
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:49,519
if you're not maintaining like really

1435
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:51,039
good sterility practices and like making

1436
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,639
sure that you don't

1437
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,440
cut more than one plant with the same

1438
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:59,679
razor blade or scissors or like you know

1439
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:01,280
pruning shears or whatever that's how

1440
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:02,399
those viruses and viroids are passed

1441
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,960
around

1442
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,960
right so

1443
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,880
i think that there's obviously benefits

1444
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,400
to d with tissue culture and monitoring

1445
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,000
the health of your tissue culture plants

1446
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,079
with molecular biology tools to make

1447
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,239
sure that you are virus free

1448
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,160
right there's a huge benefit to that so

1449
00:48:16,239 --> 00:48:19,759
i think that that model is probably

1450
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,199
going to change like i think it's

1451
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,440
already starting to change in the next

1452
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:24,719
five years most people will be buying

1453
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:26,159
plants that

1454
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:27,679
came from

1455
00:48:26,159 --> 00:48:29,440
they're either tissue culture plants or

1456
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,838
more likely

1457
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:35,519
the tissue culture plants were feeding

1458
00:48:32,838 --> 00:48:37,599
um like the the tissue culture process

1459
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,599
was feeding mother rooms which were then

1460
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:41,760
being propagated for say three to six

1461
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,519
months

1462
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,720
to make clones and then that whole

1463
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:50,000
process just starts over again and

1464
00:48:46,719 --> 00:48:51,759
so as a seed producer you don't see that

1465
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,960
as a viable industry down the road you

1466
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:55,040
think everyone's gonna be moving to

1467
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:57,039
tissue culture

1468
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,480
and clothing

1469
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:59,920
we're gonna go through phases i think we

1470
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,199
already already are moving to tissue

1471
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,480
culture now

1472
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:03,919
um

1473
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,760
seed production

1474
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,599
i mean look it depends on the crop right

1475
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,520
if you're growing cbd distillate it

1476
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,359
doesn't matter if the plants all look

1477
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:13,199
the same or not

1478
00:49:11,358 --> 00:49:14,719
it would be better if they did

1479
00:49:13,199 --> 00:49:16,879
right but i don't think that you're

1480
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:18,879
going to spend the money

1481
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:21,358
to buy tissue culture plants to plant in

1482
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:23,440
a field when like cheap hemp seeds that

1483
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:25,759
all produce cbd anyway

1484
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,880
are just being you know co-extracted to

1485
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,640
make a cbd distillate right

1486
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,400
yeah so for different parts the

1487
00:49:30,639 --> 00:49:34,159
different parts of the market like

1488
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,240
different strategies will

1489
00:49:34,159 --> 00:49:39,679
prevail but i think that like

1490
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:42,000
flower producers will probably

1491
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:43,039
have mothers it'll go through phases

1492
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,400
right like

1493
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,800
the current next phase is going to be

1494
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,280
tissue culture and then call it 10 15 20

1495
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,440
years down the road once real breeders

1496
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:54,480
have really had a chance to like

1497
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:56,880
get into towards stabilizing lines

1498
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:59,760
then we'll probably see crops being

1499
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:02,079
planted from seed right again

1500
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,800
but until we get the level of uniformity

1501
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:06,240
that you can expect from a clone crop

1502
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,839
i don't think that we'll end up seeing

1503
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,879
flower crops grown

1504
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,639
from

1505
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:13,119
seed until we have that like level of

1506
00:50:10,639 --> 00:50:14,960
breeding right and the price of seeds

1507
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,680
will have to come down too

1508
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,079
um i would think as well

1509
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:21,279
you'd be surprised man like for example

1510
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,318
like you know

1511
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:26,480
monsanto you know you're looking at like

1512
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:28,480
depending on the the seed and then the

1513
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,599
seed supply you're looking at like 15 to

1514
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,199
25

1515
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,720
of the revenue from the crop goes back

1516
00:50:31,199 --> 00:50:34,639
to the seed supplier

1517
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,719
and the reason that they pla they pay

1518
00:50:34,639 --> 00:50:37,920
that amount is that like i said the

1519
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:39,118
farmer knows that they've got a

1520
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:44,159
bulletproof

1521
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,838
crop and so if you're growing 100 acres

1522
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,679
of corn

1523
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,759
and 25 is going to go to the seed

1524
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,358
supplier or 25 of costs are going to go

1525
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,200
to the seed supplier you'll just plant

1526
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:54,880
an extra 25 acres

1527
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:56,480
right because when you're planting corn

1528
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:57,680
it's really not that much work you've

1529
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,240
got one of those

1530
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:02,318
you know gps guided john deere tractors

1531
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:04,318
that you just essentially plug the data

1532
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:05,679
into an ipad and it go it goes and does

1533
00:51:04,318 --> 00:51:08,400
the work

1534
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:11,919
right um but i think there will be like

1535
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,519
a premium cost for premium seed

1536
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,280
but

1537
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:17,358
usually those things are scaled to make

1538
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:19,200
sense in in you know they're they're

1539
00:51:17,358 --> 00:51:20,838
scaled to make sense to the operator

1540
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:22,078
right

1541
00:51:20,838 --> 00:51:24,719
sometimes provided

1542
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:27,599
government's still subsidizing corn and

1543
00:51:24,719 --> 00:51:29,039
all that other nonsense but

1544
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,880
i don't want to get an industrial egg

1545
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:32,800
but i i hear your point so you're saying

1546
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,559
there's a value there for the farmer

1547
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:37,680
that would still allow for

1548
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:40,720
higher seed prices um essentially

1549
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:43,358
exactly that's a better way to say it

1550
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:47,679
so uh real quick what about uh what

1551
00:51:43,358 --> 00:51:49,920
about this idea of genetic drift or uh

1552
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,358
you know genetic degradation of clones

1553
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,519
over time

1554
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:55,838
beyond you know stress or random

1555
00:51:53,519 --> 00:51:57,599
mutation are we really looking at there

1556
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:58,880
being any

1557
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,480
issues

1558
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:02,559
and then i've also heard

1559
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,318
people say oh you just need to take your

1560
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:06,880
indoor plant and grow it outdoors and

1561
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:08,880
then uh that sort of restores the vigor

1562
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:09,838
of the plant can you kind of touch on

1563
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,079
those

1564
00:52:09,838 --> 00:52:14,159
uh those topics

1565
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,079
yeah for sure so genetic drift is like

1566
00:52:14,159 --> 00:52:17,759
the wrong word to use to describe that i

1567
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:18,880
know that everybody in the cannabis use

1568
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,520
industry or a lot of people in the

1569
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:23,519
cannabis usually use that word genetic

1570
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,440
drift really means like

1571
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:27,519
a change in the genetic frequencies of a

1572
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,480
population from one generation to the

1573
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,440
next

1574
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,119
and so

1575
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:32,720
that's really the definition of genetic

1576
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:33,599
drift i've heard what you're talking

1577
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:35,519
about

1578
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:36,880
use that word you're talking about or

1579
00:52:35,519 --> 00:52:38,239
the concept that you're talking about be

1580
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,720
described by

1581
00:52:38,239 --> 00:52:42,159
clonal drift

1582
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,039
which is really just

1583
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,639
you know somatic mutations building up

1584
00:52:45,039 --> 00:52:49,039
was a research paper that came out in

1585
00:52:46,639 --> 00:52:52,078
the last couple of months

1586
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:53,838
that showed well it purported to show

1587
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:55,359
huge levels of genetic mutation they

1588
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:57,838
actually they took a mother plant from a

1589
00:52:55,358 --> 00:53:00,558
canadian facility and it was this big

1590
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:02,558
unhealthy mom that had been grown for

1591
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,079
you know well over a year and they took

1592
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,519
clones from the top of the plant and

1593
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:06,880
they took clones from the bottom of the

1594
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:08,159
plant and they took clones from the

1595
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,920
middle of the plant

1596
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,399
and they sequenced those clones all

1597
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,920
individually and the rese their paper

1598
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:16,079
showed that there was all these

1599
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:17,760
accumulating mutations in in mother

1600
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,440
plants

1601
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,440
i think there was actually some flaws in

1602
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,000
their data because like

1603
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:25,200
it just it doesn't ring true to me

1604
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,280
that there would be that degree of

1605
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:28,879
mutation i've grown i've have plants in

1606
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,920
my library that i've had for 20 plus

1607
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:33,440
years you know approaching 30 years

1608
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:35,920
and

1609
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:37,838
they haven't changed right like they i

1610
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,880
can tell you they look and taste and

1611
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:40,719
smell

1612
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,200
and grow the same way they did like when

1613
00:53:40,719 --> 00:53:44,399
i selected them from their seats right

1614
00:53:43,199 --> 00:53:45,919
um

1615
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:47,920
so i i just

1616
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,400
those two pieces of data just don't go

1617
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,318
together with me if we're having this

1618
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,639
uh huge rate of selection and there's

1619
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,318
another genomics company out of boston

1620
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:57,440
that was that's been doing a lot of work

1621
00:53:56,318 --> 00:53:59,199
in cannabis

1622
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,800
and he said that he thinks there's some

1623
00:53:59,199 --> 00:54:02,239
flaws in the study so

1624
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:04,318
the point is is i don't think we have a

1625
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,239
conclusive answer to the question or the

1626
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:07,358
question you're answering but it is

1627
00:54:06,239 --> 00:54:09,358
important to

1628
00:54:07,358 --> 00:54:12,480
to know that all all plant species and

1629
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,799
even animal species like you know you've

1630
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,318
got as your skin cells are dividing you

1631
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,480
look down at your wrist or your hand you

1632
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,199
know the skin around those wrists it

1633
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:22,480
might get a mutated genetic mutation

1634
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:24,558
in humans

1635
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:25,920
a genetic mutation in your skin cells is

1636
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,599
never going to get passed on there you

1637
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,440
know especially if it's in your hand

1638
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,800
that has no way of getting passed on to

1639
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,559
your offspring

1640
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:33,519
right but

1641
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,280
plants

1642
00:54:33,519 --> 00:54:37,039
especially cannabis don't really operate

1643
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:39,200
that way like a plant

1644
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:43,279
if a branch has a genetic mutation that

1645
00:54:39,199 --> 00:54:45,279
say destroys a thc gene or a

1646
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:48,480
pathogen resistance gene or even a

1647
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,559
terpene flavor gene

1648
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:52,719
that can be passed on if that branch is

1649
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:53,920
then cut and used to make a mother plant

1650
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,199
right

1651
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,559
um

1652
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,439
so

1653
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:01,040
yeah i don't know that's true so so

1654
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,119
essentially there are some level of just

1655
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:04,480
natural mutations that occur

1656
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:05,519
but

1657
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:07,920
stress

1658
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,798
plant stress can lead to

1659
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,318
more mutations so it's very important to

1660
00:55:10,798 --> 00:55:14,159
keep healthy mothers and clone off of

1661
00:55:12,318 --> 00:55:16,400
healthy plants

1662
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:17,838
short answer does that does that kind of

1663
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:20,000
summarize

1664
00:55:17,838 --> 00:55:21,838
yeah more or less like when people say

1665
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,318
like stress causes mutations i don't

1666
00:55:21,838 --> 00:55:27,599
think that we necessarily know that to

1667
00:55:24,318 --> 00:55:28,960
be true but for example

1668
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,318
you know

1669
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:32,240
well i mean what what do you define to

1670
00:55:30,318 --> 00:55:33,679
stress change in ph like high

1671
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:35,919
temperatures

1672
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:37,679
you know like definitely like pests or

1673
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,159
vectors for viruses and stuff and

1674
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:44,480
viruses cause genetic changes

1675
00:55:40,159 --> 00:55:44,480
or can cause changes right um

1676
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:48,719
so i would say that like the

1677
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,318
in theory the practice is true i don't

1678
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:52,399
know that like what i don't think we

1679
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:54,079
really know what stresses

1680
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,358
induce mutations because we just haven't

1681
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:57,760
really done those kinds of studies in

1682
00:55:55,358 --> 00:56:00,078
cannabis right sure i was just thinking

1683
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:01,040
environmental stress whether that's past

1684
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,960
cold

1685
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:04,798
heat water

1686
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:08,639
um

1687
00:56:04,798 --> 00:56:10,400
you know this idea of cloning off of a

1688
00:56:08,639 --> 00:56:11,598
unhealthy plant

1689
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,519
um

1690
00:56:11,599 --> 00:56:15,200
you're more likely to have

1691
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,960
mutations is that i mean and maybe i'm

1692
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:18,318
wrong like i said this is not my area

1693
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,159
wt's

1694
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,599
mutations is probably not the best word

1695
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:23,039
there i think that the concept that

1696
00:56:21,599 --> 00:56:26,240
you're talking about is called

1697
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:28,719
epigenetics okay and epi epigenetics

1698
00:56:26,239 --> 00:56:30,318
just means like epi means above

1699
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:33,118
so it's like a level of genetic

1700
00:56:30,318 --> 00:56:34,960
regulation that happens above or on top

1701
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:37,119
of the genetic level

1702
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,358
uh and it's something called dna

1703
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:42,240
methylation that happens on the genome

1704
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:43,759
and it and it really like

1705
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:46,798
you can think of it like you know dna

1706
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:48,640
comes in like these big bundle.coils and

1707
00:56:46,798 --> 00:56:49,920
we have these proteins that regulate

1708
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:52,318
that

1709
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:54,159
winding or the compression of the dna so

1710
00:56:52,318 --> 00:56:55,358
that it gets coiled up and is efficient

1711
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:57,598
to package

1712
00:56:55,358 --> 00:56:59,440
right and then when genes need to be

1713
00:56:57,599 --> 00:57:01,280
transcribed

1714
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:03,280
machinery will come along and and

1715
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:05,040
unravel that piece of the genome so that

1716
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,680
the dna can be read

1717
00:57:05,039 --> 00:57:09,679
and so dna when it's coiled can have

1718
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:13,598
these little methylation sites added to

1719
00:57:09,679 --> 00:57:16,399
it which tell the machinery you know

1720
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:18,079
transcribe this gene more or less

1721
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,880
right and those things are actually

1722
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:23,039
heritable or they can be heritable

1723
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:25,838
um but it's not actually a genetic

1724
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,358
change it's a

1725
00:57:25,838 --> 00:57:30,558
is it a change in like a more

1726
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:32,159
deleterious expression of the genetic

1727
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,960
of the genetics

1728
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:36,480
sometimes but sometimes it might be

1729
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:38,798
beneficial

1730
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:41,039
okay right so yeah it's hard to make

1731
00:57:38,798 --> 00:57:42,079
those kind of those like hard and fast

1732
00:57:41,039 --> 00:57:44,719
rules

1733
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:46,079
about genetics right like you know for

1734
00:57:44,719 --> 00:57:47,439
example

1735
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,680
somebody was saying the other day like

1736
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,519
all genetic mutations are negative well

1737
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:53,199
[ __ ] if you're if you're trying to find

1738
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:55,599
a plant that has

1739
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,159
cbg in it you want a plant that has a

1740
00:57:55,599 --> 00:58:01,280
broken or mutated thc gene

1741
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:03,759
so that that thc gene can't turn the cbg

1742
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:05,599
precursor into thc

1743
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:08,720
right and when you have that mutation

1744
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:10,000
what happens is cbg backs up right and

1745
00:58:08,719 --> 00:58:13,118
so

1746
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:14,480
sometimes we want to destroy a gene

1747
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,318
right like for example there's a number

1748
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,880
we were talking about powdery mildew

1749
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:20,318
earlier on um they've just showed this

1750
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:22,720
genetic sequence

1751
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:25,440
that we have a susceptibility gene to

1752
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:27,118
powdery mildew so if you have this gene

1753
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:28,880
then the plant is more susceptible to

1754
00:58:27,119 --> 00:58:30,400
powdery mildew infection

1755
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,720
it's like has to do with like a docking

1756
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,200
protein of how powdery mildew like

1757
00:58:32,719 --> 00:58:37,838
actually attaches to the plant and so if

1758
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:39,358
you can break that gene in the plant

1759
00:58:37,838 --> 00:58:41,199
you kind of destroy the docking

1760
00:58:39,358 --> 00:58:43,199
mechanism and it makes it

1761
00:58:41,199 --> 00:58:45,598
so in that in that

1762
00:58:43,199 --> 00:58:48,159
example destroying a gene makes the

1763
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:50,400
plant more resistant to battery melted

1764
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:51,440
right so this idea that like

1765
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,318
yeah

1766
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:53,519
there's

1767
00:58:52,318 --> 00:58:56,000
people got to kind of get rid of the

1768
00:58:53,519 --> 00:58:57,599
idea that like broken genes are bad

1769
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:59,679
things because sometimes a broken gene

1770
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:00,640
might have a phenotype that we actually

1771
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:02,399
like

1772
00:59:00,639 --> 00:59:04,480
right that is beneficial for us as

1773
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,400
humans right

1774
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:07,519
are you referencing the paper from dewey

1775
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,599
scientific

1776
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:10,880
uh that came out a little while ago

1777
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:13,280
because i actually had someone on the

1778
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,640
podcast recently uh jordan zagger

1779
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:17,119
talking about

1780
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:19,519
a paper directly relating to that

1781
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:21,440
powdery mildew gene no this is so that's

1782
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:23,358
the other side of the equation so

1783
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,920
there's they found two genes in powder

1784
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:28,318
ability one group in canada found this s

1785
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:30,880
gene which is the susceptibility gene

1786
00:59:28,318 --> 00:59:32,480
and then cess group working with dewey

1787
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,400
out of washington

1788
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:36,318
they found a resistance gene

1789
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:38,720
and so it's like there's two those so

1790
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:40,400
those are like two separate independent

1791
00:59:38,719 --> 00:59:42,558
genetic factors

1792
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:44,079
one that causes resistance

1793
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:46,400
the other one and so you want the

1794
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:48,798
resistance scene but the other gene

1795
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,200
causes susceptibility and you don't want

1796
00:59:48,798 --> 00:59:52,159
that gene right so you can stack the r

1797
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:54,719
gene

1798
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:56,798
with the broken s gene then you're

1799
00:59:54,719 --> 00:59:58,159
you're kind of off to the races right

1800
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:00,960
yeah

1801
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:02,719
so sometimes you're in a better position

1802
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,559
yeah i wanted to come back to this idea

1803
01:00:02,719 --> 01:00:06,558
of taking uh

1804
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:09,599
a long cloned plant and growing it

1805
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:10,880
outdoors as some way of restoring

1806
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:12,640
vigor to it

1807
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:14,318
have you heard this

1808
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,719
yeah we've seen it we've done it and

1809
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:18,558
actually to a degree it works right like

1810
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,759
i think what happens is a lot of times

1811
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,200
people have these plants in these

1812
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:23,440
libraries and they're either growing in

1813
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:24,399
them like you said past they got pests

1814
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:26,240
or

1815
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,760
low light conditions or whatever and

1816
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,078
there seems to be something about

1817
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:31,520
putting these plants out in the intense

1818
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,680
sun in the summer

1819
01:00:31,519 --> 01:00:35,280
allows that plant to like get back to

1820
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,440
traditional health

1821
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,720
um i don't think there's i don't again i

1822
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,039
don't think there's been any studies in

1823
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:44,159
cannabis but it might be that like you

1824
01:00:41,039 --> 01:00:46,079
know intense real sun is able to rip

1825
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:48,960
some of that methylation off the dna

1826
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,798
again that's just pure speculation but

1827
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,798
um there is definitely something going

1828
01:00:50,798 --> 01:00:55,199
on with certain plants that like

1829
01:00:52,798 --> 01:00:57,119
whether it's the soil or being held in

1830
01:00:55,199 --> 01:00:59,598
these compact root systems where it's

1831
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:01,680
the light or it's like all those things

1832
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:03,519
over a year you know when you take that

1833
01:01:01,679 --> 01:01:06,000
plant back out and put it back outside

1834
01:01:03,519 --> 01:01:08,400
of nature where it evolved it seems to

1835
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:10,480
bump back into optimum health right

1836
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,639
that's really interesting so there is

1837
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:14,639
something potentially to that

1838
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:16,480
um you would hypothesize but we don't

1839
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,400
have the research yet to really identify

1840
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:20,719
exactly what that might be

1841
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,358
yeah i've seen plants go from like weird

1842
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:25,759
kind of [ __ ] up like you know not in

1843
01:01:23,358 --> 01:01:27,838
the viroid sense but like just not

1844
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:29,119
performing very well and then you take

1845
01:01:27,838 --> 01:01:30,880
them outside and you put them in the sun

1846
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,039
and they like kind of kick back into

1847
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,200
into hell so i don't i don't know what

1848
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:37,039
it is i don't think that's like a

1849
01:01:35,199 --> 01:01:39,358
solution to every problem

1850
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:41,119
but it does seem to work on some plants

1851
01:01:39,358 --> 01:01:44,239
that are suffering a little bit for for

1852
01:01:41,119 --> 01:01:45,599
some reason right yeah

1853
01:01:44,239 --> 01:01:48,318
fascinating well

1854
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,519
we've been talking for a while now

1855
01:01:48,318 --> 01:01:52,159
is there anything else you'd like to

1856
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,679
share with listeners uh before we end

1857
01:01:52,159 --> 01:01:56,078
the call i know we kind of jumped around

1858
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:58,159
quite a bit

1859
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:59,839
no just keep growing seeds i mean i i

1860
01:01:58,159 --> 01:02:02,318
you know i think people should always go

1861
01:01:59,838 --> 01:02:03,920
and see it even if it's just like a few

1862
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,519
you know in their gardens you can't find

1863
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:07,519
anything new we can't ever move the

1864
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:09,119
species forward unless we're making

1865
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:11,838
seeds right

1866
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:13,358
and growing seeds so don't ever stop

1867
01:02:11,838 --> 01:02:14,960
growing seeds

1868
01:02:13,358 --> 01:02:17,038
um it might have to be like a small

1869
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:19,358
little patch that you do on the side

1870
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:20,960
just to keep things normal but yeah

1871
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,598
i'd like to see us getting back into

1872
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:25,519
growing more seeds um

1873
01:02:23,599 --> 01:02:27,440
because and i think we are as we see

1874
01:02:25,519 --> 01:02:29,679
legalization coming you can see more

1875
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:32,159
people like in california like

1876
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:34,639
you know five ish years ago there was

1877
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:37,118
really this like seed growing like

1878
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:39,440
explosion right and people stopped

1879
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:41,200
really leaning on clones as much clones

1880
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:43,358
are fine you know great for uniformity

1881
01:02:41,199 --> 01:02:46,318
and you can do all these interesting

1882
01:02:43,358 --> 01:02:47,519
things when you have you know a ton of

1883
01:02:46,318 --> 01:02:50,798
biomass

1884
01:02:47,519 --> 01:02:52,400
to make like specific flavor profile

1885
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:54,719
extracts but you're never going to find

1886
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:55,680
that next profile without going back to

1887
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:58,000
feed

1888
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:59,519
so i i you know i always like when

1889
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,079
people grow sleep

1890
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,480
so even with all the disadvantages uh

1891
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:07,039
for that small home grower that wants to

1892
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:08,400
play around with breeding you'd still

1893
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,440
encourage them to do it because at the

1894
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,838
end of the day they might come up with

1895
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:14,720
something really novel and exciting or

1896
01:03:11,838 --> 01:03:15,599
that works really well for them

1897
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:17,519
yeah

1898
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:19,039
well it's just you know it's like they

1899
01:03:17,519 --> 01:03:20,318
listen they might not fly and create the

1900
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:21,680
perfect plant but it's like you've

1901
01:03:20,318 --> 01:03:23,199
probably seen this freak show plant

1902
01:03:21,679 --> 01:03:24,879
right the plant with the weird

1903
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,038
serrations the leaves kind of look like

1904
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,519
ferns yeah it's like that was stumbled

1905
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:32,160
across by a small home grower

1906
01:03:29,519 --> 01:03:33,038
um and it might turn out that that trait

1907
01:03:32,159 --> 01:03:35,679
has

1908
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:38,079
some kind of advantage right like you

1909
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:39,679
that maybe maybe that plant is less

1910
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:41,359
susceptible to powdery mildew again

1911
01:03:39,679 --> 01:03:42,798
because like

1912
01:03:41,358 --> 01:03:44,480
you know

1913
01:03:42,798 --> 01:03:46,480
the powdery mildew just can't grow

1914
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:48,079
across the leaf like it would normally

1915
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,039
or maybe it allows more air through the

1916
01:03:48,079 --> 01:03:50,720
leaves

1917
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:52,480
right and so again it's like doesn't

1918
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:54,000
mean that the people that are

1919
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:55,679
discovering the new thing are going to

1920
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:57,760
build the bulletproof plant but it's

1921
01:03:55,679 --> 01:03:59,440
like it takes

1922
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:02,079
you know it takes a whole community of

1923
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,679
people growing all this different stuff

1924
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,640
and just randomly somebody is going to

1925
01:04:03,679 --> 01:04:06,399
find

1926
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,798
something new right and then hopefully

1927
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:10,480
that gets shared with the community and

1928
01:04:08,798 --> 01:04:12,239
these things kind of get

1929
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,159
passed around and integrated and

1930
01:04:12,239 --> 01:04:17,038
optimized right

1931
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:19,279
yeah see i speculated that um

1932
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:21,920
we were at a level in the last five ten

1933
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:24,319
years of the greatest diversity in this

1934
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:26,639
plant genetic diversity because of all

1935
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:29,199
the the legalization that's happened

1936
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:30,400
and um how many more people are growing

1937
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32,000
it that we would have seen more

1938
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:34,000
diversity but you think we've already

1939
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,559
sort of limited or funneled down that

1940
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:38,960
diversity towards a very specific

1941
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,960
range

1942
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,240
there's two forces right at play like

1943
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:45,199
one of them like you said we got more

1944
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:46,239
people growing more seeds but also the

1945
01:04:45,199 --> 01:04:47,919
market

1946
01:04:46,239 --> 01:04:50,239
there's a fashion in the market right

1947
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,760
and that fashion is for gas

1948
01:04:50,239 --> 01:04:54,078
right and so

1949
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:55,520
it's like you go into a dispensary and

1950
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:56,798
i've seen it in california i've also

1951
01:04:55,519 --> 01:05:00,000
seen it in canada i've been to a

1952
01:04:56,798 --> 01:05:02,159
dispensary and there's like 20 different

1953
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,440
cultivar names on the menu

1954
01:05:02,159 --> 01:05:05,038
but really when you go through and you

1955
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,720
look at the plants from chemistry it's

1956
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:09,520
like 18 of them all have the same

1957
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:10,639
chemical profile right so it's like even

1958
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:12,559
though there probably is genetic

1959
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,719
diversity

1960
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:17,519
across the population it doesn't really

1961
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:19,519
make it to the marketplace

1962
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:21,199
right yeah well is this where

1963
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:23,759
uh

1964
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:25,838
the the skill of the grower comes into

1965
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:27,359
play in terms of bringing out certain

1966
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,199
aspects of

1967
01:05:27,358 --> 01:05:30,639
those genetics through the way that they

1968
01:05:29,199 --> 01:05:32,239
grow the plant because

1969
01:05:30,639 --> 01:05:33,598
i mean obviously your genetic expression

1970
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,159
is going to be tied to how the plants

1971
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:38,000
cultivated

1972
01:05:36,159 --> 01:05:40,078
it is but there's also plants that just

1973
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,679
don't like you know there's plants that

1974
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:44,240
are like for example i have this really

1975
01:05:41,679 --> 01:05:45,118
equatorial plant so a hybrid that i had

1976
01:05:44,239 --> 01:05:46,879
made

1977
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:49,039
and we ran through the lab and it came

1978
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:52,000
back to have like

1979
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:53,839
high levels of pinene and limonene and

1980
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:56,159
almost nothing else which is a

1981
01:05:53,838 --> 01:05:57,759
relatively rare terpene profile it's

1982
01:05:56,159 --> 01:06:00,480
really like associated with what people

1983
01:05:57,760 --> 01:06:02,960
would call a classic haze plant

1984
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:05,280
so we're talking like you know 13 14

1985
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,960
week flowering time

1986
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:08,640
to grow it indoors i think we had like

1987
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,280
three plants on that and that produced

1988
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:13,199
like a quarter pound total right and

1989
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:14,640
we're talking like three three three

1990
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:17,598
foot plants but it's like it really

1991
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:19,519
didn't yield [ __ ] yeah but the flower

1992
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:21,200
was exceptional

1993
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:21,920
um and the rosin

1994
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:24,719
that

1995
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:26,480
came back at a very low rate was even

1996
01:06:24,719 --> 01:06:28,480
better than the flower

1997
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:30,880
right but it's like you'd need to grow

1998
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:32,719
acres an acre that's of that stuff to

1999
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:33,440
have enough material to make an extract

2000
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:35,199
so

2001
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:36,318
it's like some plants just don't produce

2002
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:37,838
enough

2003
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:39,838
um

2004
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,159
so the genetics are still the driver in

2005
01:06:39,838 --> 01:06:43,679
your opinion and you know we can

2006
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:45,358
pull some levers

2007
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:46,798
on the cultivation side at the end of

2008
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:48,960
the day it all comes back to good

2009
01:06:46,798 --> 01:06:50,880
genetics

2010
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:53,119
yeah the genetic i think the genetics

2011
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:55,119
are really the key to diversified

2012
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:56,318
products in the marketplace

2013
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:59,200
right like you know if you're going to

2014
01:06:56,318 --> 01:07:02,239
build a rosin brand

2015
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,960
it's fine and dandy to have gas but like

2016
01:07:02,239 --> 01:07:08,078
everybody's got gas right and so like if

2017
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:09,519
you want to build like a unique brand

2018
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:11,599
you might want something like with a

2019
01:07:09,519 --> 01:07:12,838
really ripe garlic smell or like a

2020
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:14,640
really

2021
01:07:12,838 --> 01:07:16,719
floral

2022
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,960
kind of little

2023
01:07:16,719 --> 01:07:21,038
like a real flowery kind of smell to it

2024
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:22,400
right

2025
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:24,400
because i think those are the things

2026
01:07:22,400 --> 01:07:25,440
that are really going to have

2027
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:26,960
those are the things that are really

2028
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:28,960
going to be able to get

2029
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,639
traction in the market

2030
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:34,318
right or or like we said before with the

2031
01:07:30,639 --> 01:07:36,639
epilepsy plant right like

2032
01:07:34,318 --> 01:07:38,639
you want like having a specific plant

2033
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:40,960
that produces a specific chemical

2034
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:42,558
profile that's therapeutic for

2035
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,318
you know a whole segment of the

2036
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,119
population like it's the genetic that

2037
01:07:44,318 --> 01:07:48,159
allows that product to exist right

2038
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:50,640
so i think

2039
01:07:48,159 --> 01:07:53,759
you know again i'm biased as a plant

2040
01:07:50,639 --> 01:07:55,199
greener geneticist but like

2041
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:57,920
i really do think that the genetic

2042
01:07:55,199 --> 01:07:59,838
diversity is a lot is what allows the

2043
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:02,480
product differentiation on the market

2044
01:07:59,838 --> 01:08:06,078
it's you know

2045
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:07,760
it's not like i don't think the growers

2046
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:09,920
if everybody has the same plants i don't

2047
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:11,440
think one grower is going to be better

2048
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:13,280
than everybody else

2049
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:15,440
right but if that one grower has a

2050
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,279
unique genetic they might be able to

2051
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,560
fulfill a market niche that nobody else

2052
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,759
can

2053
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:21,039
right

2054
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:24,880
i mean yes and no coming from the

2055
01:08:21,039 --> 01:08:26,158
cultivation side i would say that

2056
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:29,119
given

2057
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:31,439
you know the same genetics to different

2058
01:08:29,119 --> 01:08:33,920
growers you could see

2059
01:08:31,439 --> 01:08:35,119
a different plant structure different

2060
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:37,199
expression

2061
01:08:35,119 --> 01:08:38,798
different quality of flower

2062
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:40,318
just based off of the ability of the

2063
01:08:38,798 --> 01:08:42,079
grower and not just the ability to

2064
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:43,839
grower but the environment which i tied

2065
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:46,079
to the grower the light spectrum that

2066
01:08:43,838 --> 01:08:46,960
the plants given the light intensity

2067
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:48,960
um

2068
01:08:46,960 --> 01:08:50,560
you know we're able to manipulate plants

2069
01:08:48,960 --> 01:08:52,880
quite a bit

2070
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,400
on that side but i don't think that

2071
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,838
discounts like what you're saying in the

2072
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,358
fact that at the end of the day it's

2073
01:08:55,838 --> 01:08:59,198
really the genetics that are are going

2074
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,640
to drive

2075
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:04,079
a lot of your

2076
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:04,079
of how that plant is going to finish

2077
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:07,838
yeah i feel like i'm i'm a grower too

2078
01:09:06,158 --> 01:09:09,278
don't don't let me sound like i'm

2079
01:09:07,838 --> 01:09:11,519
discounting the role of the grower in

2080
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:13,600
the creation of a great product right

2081
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,719
um it definitely there's a huge role

2082
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:18,319
when you know this from wine and you

2083
01:09:14,719 --> 01:09:20,319
know it's from food right like

2084
01:09:18,319 --> 01:09:22,400
the grower has definitely an impact on

2085
01:09:20,319 --> 01:09:25,920
the outcome of the quality

2086
01:09:22,399 --> 01:09:27,119
but without that diversity in genetics

2087
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:29,279
you know you can have an excellent

2088
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:30,719
grower in a shitty genetic

2089
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:32,480
and that grower is not going to be

2090
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:34,480
successful commercially

2091
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:36,158
right but if you had an excellent grower

2092
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:37,439
or even a good genetic like they they

2093
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:39,838
might be

2094
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:42,158
successful and if you have that grower

2095
01:09:39,838 --> 01:09:43,198
a really interesting or unique genetic

2096
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:46,399
then they're really going to be able to

2097
01:09:43,198 --> 01:09:48,559
set themselves apart in the marketplace

2098
01:09:46,399 --> 01:09:50,318
right yeah yeah no i like that i like

2099
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:54,239
that that's a fair

2100
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:56,320
fair analysis i'll give you that one um

2101
01:09:54,238 --> 01:09:57,439
