yes so for listeners I just want to

39
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:36,799
mention I met Christine virtually when

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,960
you sent me an email about a course that

41
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:40,200
you're putting together at the

42
00:01:37,959 --> 00:01:43,239
University of British Columbia uh also

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,439
UBC and uh I was so excited to hear from

44
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:47,280
you and hear that about this course can

45
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:49,639
you talk a little bit more about the

46
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,879
course and what your process was and and

47
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:54,759
sort of putting it

48
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:59,078
together yeah sure um so the course at

49
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:01,000
EBC is called biology of cannabis um and

50
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:03,839
this was really something that I worked

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,319
on with a research faculty here uh in

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,759
the botney department at UBC we actually

53
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:10,478
have several people who work do their

54
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:13,318
research on cannabis within the botney

55
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,519
department so um this was one research

56
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:19,439
faculty who was interested in creating

57
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,360
this course I have a strong Um passion

58
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:23,959
and love for cannabis myself so I was

59
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,440
also very interested uh in this concept

60
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:28,959
of a biology of canvas course um so we

61
00:02:26,439 --> 00:02:31,840
work together to get the course created

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,360
get it through the approval process um

63
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,800
and it is really designed to be a course

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,480
that can be taken by any any

65
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,800
undergraduate in the university for

66
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:43,079
their science breath requirement um so

67
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,719
it's not just for biology Majors it's

68
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,040
for everyone um and it's really the

69
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:51,680
concept behind it is to use cannabis

70
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:55,120
kind of like a like a case study or a

71
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,840
vehicle for teaching students about

72
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,200
foundational biological Concepts so

73
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,039
things like genetics

74
00:03:00,199 --> 00:03:08,359
and um biochemistry and uh metabolism

75
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:10,919
ecology Evolution photosynthesis you

76
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:14,840
know process of science so um using it

77
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:17,318
as like a context to uh get these to

78
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:21,319
help students understand these Concepts

79
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:23,000
um so I I worked with this faculty

80
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:25,119
member to get the course created and

81
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,759
then once we knew it was approved once

82
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,759
it was on the course schedule um then I

83
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,039
got to work with uh developing it and I

84
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:35,239
was going to be the one to teach the

85
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:39,000
first version of it uh which happened

86
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:40,799
last spring um and I am I'm my expertise

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,598
is in teaching and learning in biology

88
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,519
at the undergraduate level it's it's not

89
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:48,399
in cannabis so the first thing that I

90
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,438
decided to do was to go out and talk to

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
as many people as I could who were

92
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:55,878
actually working with cannabis in real

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,640
world ways um and figure out okay what's

94
00:03:55,878 --> 00:04:00,359
going on with Biology in the in the real

95
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:02,238
world cannabis space

96
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,519
um and how can I bring this into the

97
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,519
course to make it real world oriented to

98
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,920
really ground it in what's going on uh

99
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,560
within cannabis um and to make it

100
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:14,359
interesting and relatable and you know

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,358
understandable to students I I was

102
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,639
really focused on making it as real

103
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:22,478
world oriented and interesting and

104
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:25,879
relatable uh and meaningful as

105
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:28,000
possible that's that's really great so

106
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:30,439
in this course you were really talking

107
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,959
about a lot of high Lev

108
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:35,680
biological Concepts just trying to

109
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:38,638
expose listeners and using cannabis sort

110
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,280
of as your tool for this is sort of a a

111
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,918
path towards learning about all these

112
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:44,079
different topics is that sort of the

113
00:04:41,918 --> 00:04:46,879
gist of what what the goal was of the

114
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,279
course absolutely yeah yeah so cannabis

115
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,800
was really it was like the vehicle it

116
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:53,198
was like the the selling point to get

117
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,918
students to understand and be interested

118
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,680
in these foundational biological

119
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,159
Concepts so I know you reached out to me

120
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:02,959
obviously that's how I met you

121
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,919
um and we had a conversation um via

122
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:08,198
email about uh some of the curriculum

123
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:10,799
that you were putting together uh can I

124
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:11,800
ask like who else you reached out to and

125
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,680
you know if you're not comfortable

126
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,840
saying names maybe you could talk about

127
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,879
what sorts of topics or areas of

128
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:20,198
expertise that these people had and and

129
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:24,560
kind of what sort of feedback you

130
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:27,080
got yeah so I talked to people in a very

131
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,439
diverse range of aspects within cannabis

132
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:32,198
so I talk to people in cultivation so

133
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:34,240
people who are involved in breeding um

134
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,080
people who are involved in growing

135
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,840
cannabis um I talked to people who were

136
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:41,680
researching cannabis in different ways

137
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:44,359
um I talked

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,600
to uh people who were involved in

139
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:49,800
product production and quality assurance

140
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,160
within cannabis cultivation facility um

141
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,919
I talked to people who were involved in

142
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,800
medical cannabis so doctors who were

143
00:05:52,918 --> 00:05:58,079
actually using this within their

144
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,879
practice their clinical practice um and

145
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:01,560
and different types of doctors too who

146
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:06,439
were focusing on different uh

147
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:07,918
populations of patients um yeah I I

148
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:09,519
talked to a lot of different people and

149
00:06:07,918 --> 00:06:11,318
it started off kind of like it was a

150
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:13,918
little bit of a snowball approach where

151
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:19,680
I just started reaching out to people

152
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:23,240
who I at first had connections to um so

153
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,959
for example uh I use cannabis myself and

154
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:29,800
so I reached out to the person who owns

155
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:31,959
the store of the Cannabis that you know

156
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,038
that I usually go to and um she

157
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:36,519
connected me to some people who grow it

158
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:39,120
and um and then you know they connected

159
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:41,318
me to some other people and and as I

160
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,038
kept doing these interviews one question

161
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:45,080
that I would always include in the

162
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:47,839
interviews was is there anyone else that

163
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:52,399
you recommend I talk to so as as you can

164
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:55,239
imagine this this you know became almost

165
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:58,079
exponential in my list of potential

166
00:06:55,240 --> 00:07:00,680
interviewees and it really led me to

167
00:06:58,079 --> 00:07:02,359
lots of different typ typ of people that

168
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,400
I never would have come into contact

169
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,800
with and I probably never would have

170
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:09,878
even known about that aspect of cannabis

171
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,520
for example you know talking to someone

172
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:13,919
who works on quality assurance in a

173
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:16,959
cannabis facility I guess I kind of knew

174
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:20,079
that that sort of position existed but

175
00:07:16,959 --> 00:07:22,638
um it you know being able to actually

176
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:27,399
talk to someone who does that uh really

177
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:30,759
made it real um and yeah it was it was

178
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:33,439
just such a unbelievable learning

179
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,720
experience to talk to all of these

180
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:38,079
different

181
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:40,840
people yeah now one personal curiosity I

182
00:07:38,079 --> 00:07:43,439
had was was there anything that you

183
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,918
learned from this process that was

184
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,120
really interesting that you were just

185
00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:49,198
unaware of you mentioned the quality

186
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,560
control um but from talking to all these

187
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,319
people was there something just like an

188
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:56,158
interesting fact about cannabis or

189
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:59,560
something that was uh unexpected in your

190
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:02,719
research I mean I I just everything

191
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,519
honestly everything I went into this

192
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,039
process thinking that I had a pretty

193
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:10,478
good understanding of cannabis but I

194
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:13,079
realize I did not at all um and and I

195
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:14,478
think this really made it clear to me

196
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:16,839
that when you are going to be teaching

197
00:08:14,478 --> 00:08:19,519
about something you know as a individual

198
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:21,000
you only have a limited understanding

199
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:22,719
you really need to go out and you need

200
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,279
to talk to the people who are actually

201
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,800
working with that topic in the real

202
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:28,038
world so I mean I I learned about I

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,919
didn't know about photo period

204
00:08:28,038 --> 00:08:33,598
sensitivity uh before doing these

205
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:35,399
interviews I didn't know about um really

206
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
the intricacies of the the breeding

207
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,719
process that was just really fascinating

208
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
yes

209
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:46,399
um I learned about the importance of

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,879
emission control which became part of

211
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,039
this you know this cultivation game that

212
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,639
I incorporated into the the course um

213
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:55,240
based on someone who was studying that I

214
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,639
never would have known that that was a

215
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:00,399
big aspect of growing cannabis you know

216
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:02,799
being able to manage the the odors that

217
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:06,440
are coming from the cultivation facility

218
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:09,000
especially in in urban areas um

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:13,839
gosh in all of the different ways that

220
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,919
cannabis is used um uh by by humans in

221
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,959
the in the

222
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:20,559
medical uh industry so talking with

223
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:25,759
these different doctors and and really

224
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:27,838
um learning about how they were um

225
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,519
prescribing cannabis the types of

226
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,279
cannabis that they were prescribed the

227
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,120
the process that they were using and and

228
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:36,559
the different types of um indications

229
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:39,320
that they were prescribing Canabis for I

230
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:41,479
mean every I I just learned I learned so

231
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,959
much it was incredible how much I

232
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,639
learned and I probably don't have to

233
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,278
tell this to you Tad because you

234
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,319
probably have some a very similar

235
00:09:47,278 --> 00:09:52,919
experience with this podast I mean

236
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,959
probably everyone that you interview you

237
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,278
just it's it's little Revelations that

238
00:09:55,958 --> 00:10:01,639
come up uh and you just you learn so

239
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:05,320
much by talking to someone in a 30

240
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:07,480
minute conversation um I found that I

241
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:10,040
learned so much more in that 30 minute

242
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,879
conversation talking to these cannabis

243
00:10:10,039 --> 00:10:14,519
professionals than I ever could have by

244
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:16,919
spending hours and hours of research on

245
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,600
my own um and it was more understandable

246
00:10:16,919 --> 00:10:21,958
because it was in context like they were

247
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:25,879
talking about cannabis in real world

248
00:10:21,958 --> 00:10:28,679
ways and how they were um interacting

249
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:31,159
with it and so it made the what they

250
00:10:28,679 --> 00:10:32,919
were telling me even more

251
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,799
understandable yeah you brought up two

252
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:39,439
points that I I just wanted to highlight

253
00:10:34,799 --> 00:10:41,319
so um one is this idea of real world

254
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,800
experience and that was one of the

255
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,278
reasons I started this podcast was

256
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,159
because we have research happening at

257
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:49,720
you know various universities now um but

258
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,039
there's a huge gap between that and

259
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:55,000
what's happening in reality in an actual

260
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:57,278
working facility and there's always

261
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,320
these sacrifices that we have to make in

262
00:10:57,278 --> 00:11:01,120
in any grow environment that just

263
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,760
doesn't happen in these universities in

264
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,839
a growth chamber where they can control

265
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,639
every aspect of the grow and they have

266
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,920
you know grant funding to be able to

267
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,839
afford um you know all the equipment

268
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:14,639
that they need to create this you know

269
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,120
quote unquote perfect experiment so um

270
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:19,000
the goal with the podcast was really to

271
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,799
sort of bridge that gap between Academia

272
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,600
and research and share that you know

273
00:11:20,799 --> 00:11:24,159
more broadly with Growers but now I'm

274
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:26,800
trying to bring in more Growers to share

275
00:11:24,159 --> 00:11:29,759
about sort of their experential

276
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,838
experience knowledge uh and with because

277
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,759
I think that's really important too and

278
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,200
I'm really excited to talk about this uh

279
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,679
cultivation game that you put together

280
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,000
because it really sort of highlights

281
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:41,679
this process in a very simplified easy

282
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,240
to understand manner uh so so that was

283
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:45,599
one thing but the other thing that you

284
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,879
brought up was this idea of of reaching

285
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,639
out to various people in the industry

286
00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:52,399
and experts in their you know

287
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:55,320
prospective Fields um I've I've done the

288
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,399
same and in my in my experience personal

289
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,240
experience is people are really willing

290
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,559
to share their knowledge and willing to

291
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,759
to talk to you and take a take some time

292
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:07,958
just because they they're passionate

293
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:10,000
about what they're doing and and so um I

294
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:12,559
I would encourage people if you read

295
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,639
something or you find someone to to to

296
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:16,759
try writing to them or or reaching out

297
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,360
to them and you know you will get

298
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:20,958
rejected I get rejected all the time for

299
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,560
this podcast um with people but at the

300
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:24,198
same time I'm amazed at how many people

301
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:26,719
do get back to me I mean even people

302
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:28,078
like yourself uh at University willing

303
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:32,399
to take some time to have this

304
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:33,838
conversation um about about topics that

305
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,519
that you know that they're knowledgeable

306
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,440
in so um yeah I just wanted to share

307
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,240
that a similar experience as what you

308
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,760
what you had in building this

309
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,839
course yeah and and I will Echo that

310
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:48,278
because almost everyone that I reached

311
00:12:44,839 --> 00:12:50,800
out to agreed to talk to me which I was

312
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,799
so honored by um because I I feel the

you put together and maybe I can put

327
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:26,720

this uh this class activity it's I I

335
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:49,399
kind of think of it as kind of a game um

336
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,720
it came out of my conversation with you

337
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:54,919
and also from listening to your podcast

338
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,720
episodes and um I must say when I was

339
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:58,479
doing interviews you know I would always

340
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,839
ask people who someone I should talk to

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,639
your name came up quite a bit and your

342
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,560
podcast came up quite a bit um and so oh

343
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,839
that's amazing oh well thank you I'm

344
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:11,198
honored yeah so as I was talking to you

345
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:14,399
and as I I was listening to your podcast

346
00:14:11,198 --> 00:14:16,278
um you really helped me to understand a

347
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,078
couple things you help me to understand

348
00:14:16,278 --> 00:14:22,519
that there are um some really key

349
00:14:20,078 --> 00:14:25,319
aspects that are necessary for growing

350
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:27,919
cannabis so for example um to grow

351
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:29,839
cannabis you need to provide the plants

352
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:32,240
with lights you need to provide them

353
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:35,759
with water and nutrients you need to

354
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,120
provide them with um proper atmospheric

355
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:40,720
conditions and Pest

356
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,679
Management um and and especially in the

357
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,160
case of indoor growth you know these are

358
00:14:42,679 --> 00:14:46,958
all things that you really have to cons

359
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:50,360
you have to have as part of your um your

360
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:54,198
cultivation facility as as um as you're

361
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:57,320
in your growth uh but beyond that there

362
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:59,240
are many many different ways to be able

363
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,199
to provide plants with light there are

364
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,240
many different ways to provide plants

365
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:06,519
with nutrients and water uh with

366
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,919
atmospheric conditions and there's many

367
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,600
different ways to you know do Pest

368
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:15,879
Management so um those were two key

369
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:18,839
things that uh that I've really learned

370
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:21,120
from you and your podcast and those were

371
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:22,839
two things that I realized students need

372
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
to like this is what students need to

373
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:27,560
know about growing that there are these

374
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:30,719
key foundational things that canvas

375
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,518
plants need to grow but there are

376
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:35,000
there's also a lot of different options

377
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:38,399
within all of all of those uh key

378
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,120
factors um so I started to think about

379
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:45,759
uh getting students to understand this

380
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:49,318
in the form of a a game um a cultivation

381
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:53,199
facility game so in this activity I

382
00:15:49,318 --> 00:15:54,958
first um I first put well it's a it's

383
00:15:53,198 --> 00:15:58,519
kind of a two-stage activity it involves

384
00:15:54,958 --> 00:16:01,318
two sets of groups um the first group is

385
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,879
known as the expert group so I split up

386
00:16:01,318 --> 00:16:07,078
students into um these expert groups

387
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:09,198
where they were assigned to uh really

388
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:10,679
investigate and learn about one of the

389
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:15,439
key variables so there was a Lighting

390
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:17,399
Group um and as a group they had to uh

391
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:20,000
do some research and figure out okay why

392
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,958
is lighting so important um what what do

393
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,720
the plants get out of light that they

394
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:27,958
need um and then I gave them some

395
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:30,240
options for how light is often uh

396
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:32,559
provided to PL plants in a cultivation

397
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:36,318
facility so the three major options that

398
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:41,479
I gave them were um fluorescent grow

399
00:16:36,318 --> 00:16:44,599
lights uh hid high density oh goodness

400
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:46,639
I'm uh high intensity discharge high

401
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,079
intensity discharge grow light so this

402
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:51,720
includes that's your HPS sort of

403
00:16:49,078 --> 00:16:53,559
approach yes exactly yeah and then the

404
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,480
third option I gave them was LED grow

405
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:59,679
lights um so for each of those options

406
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:04,240
they had to research the pros and then

407
00:16:59,679 --> 00:17:06,399
also the cons um because none no option

408
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,279
is perfect every option comes with its

409
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:12,360
its pros and cons um so then so in

410
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:14,078
addition to a Lighting Group I also had

411
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:16,399
a Pest Management Group so their job was

412
00:17:14,078 --> 00:17:18,399
to really uh Research Pest Management

413
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,919
what goes into that why it's important

414
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
and then I gave them three options so

415
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:25,600
they had to look into the pros and cons

416
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:28,279
of tape strips or monitoring cards uh

417
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,399
beneficial insects and pesticides and

418
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:30,759
fungicides

419
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,000
um and then I had another group for

420
00:17:30,759 --> 00:17:37,359
atmospheric conditions um uh another

421
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:40,279
group for uh water and nutrient options

422
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,000
so um I gave them you know they had to

423
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:44,759
research media based systems so

424
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,679
inorganic media and organic soil um

425
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:48,879
along with different irrigation systems

426
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:51,400
so Hand watering sprinkler system and

427
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,799
drip irrigation and then they also um

428
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,280
had to look into the pros and cons of

429
00:17:53,798 --> 00:17:59,319
different water-based systems so

430
00:17:55,279 --> 00:18:03,079
Hydroponics aeroponics and aquaponics um

431
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:05,839
and then I I also had an emissions

432
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:07,038
control group because like I mentioned

433
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:08,678
this is something that came out of one

434
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:10,519
of the interviews I learned that this is

435
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,919
an important aspect of growing cannabis

436
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:15,038
emission control um so then I gave them

437
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,559
a number of of options for that group to

438
00:18:15,038 --> 00:18:20,279
also look at the pros and cons so once

439
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:23,798
all of these groups had time to research

440
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:28,918
their um their specific growth growth

441
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:30,679
factor um then I split them up into

442
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:33,080
what's known as jigsaw groups so this

443
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,919
this is an activity known as a jigsaw uh

444
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:38,359
and the concept is that in the second

445
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:41,759
set of groups the jigsaw groups you have

446
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:43,399
an expert from uh expert representative

447
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:46,000
from each of the expert groups that's

448
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,080
now coming together so that this new

449
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,119
jigsaw group has all of the different

450
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:52,759
pieces of the puzzle that they're going

451
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:56,839
to need to do something in this case to

452
00:18:52,759 --> 00:19:00,000
create a cultivation facility um so now

453
00:18:56,839 --> 00:19:02,038
in the jigsaw groups there was is uh an

454
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,880
expert from the lighting an expert from

455
00:19:02,038 --> 00:19:07,879
nutrient and water uh an expert from

456
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,960
atmosphere an expert from emission

457
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,159
control an expert from pus management

458
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:13,200
and I gave them some time to just

459
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:15,600
educate one another inform one another

460
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,159
about what the different options were

461
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:21,279
and you know maybe share which one that

462
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:23,200
they thought was best based on their

463
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:26,240
understanding of the pros and the cons

464
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:28,720
um and then as a group they had to make

465
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,679
a choice about what they were going to

466
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,440
to choose for each of these major

467
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:35,679
factors um and they also had to provide

468
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,240
me with um you know a one to two

469
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:41,798
sentence explanation just to let me know

470
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:44,319
what led them to that that option um so

471
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:47,400
that's that was the gist of the game um

472
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,558
and just one other thing to mention uh

473
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:53,120
was before they came into class I wanted

474
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:55,200
them to have some sort of um exposure to

475
00:19:53,119 --> 00:19:57,038
these different options and also to see

476
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,519
you know what's what cultivation

477
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:02,919
actually looks like so as a pre-class

478
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:06,679
assignment I asked them to watch these

479
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:08,880
little um video clips of Tours through

480
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:11,679
some different types of um cultivation

481
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,919
facilities and I really tried to uh give

482
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,000
them videos of different types of

483
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,759
facilities so some were warehouses some

484
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,240
were green houses um they some used

485
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:23,960
Hydroponics some used organic soil some

486
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:25,480
use inorganic um and so they got to

487
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:28,240
actually see what this looked like

488
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,440
through these video tours and um and

489
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:33,400
here from the people that were actually

490
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,558
growing cannabis and talking and they

491
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:40,000
talked about um the different uh parts

492
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:41,639
of their facility and and and you know

493
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,240
how it worked and so on so they did come

494
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:46,559
in with a little bit of background

495
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:49,640
knowledge about each of these

496
00:20:46,558 --> 00:20:53,000
options yeah I I love that this exercise

497
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:55,000
or this game is is um structured around

498
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,038
the idea of limiting factors because

499
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:00,319
it's one of my favorite ways to approach

500
00:20:58,038 --> 00:21:02,279
uh cultiv ation in general is to look at

501
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:04,558
what the limiting factor is people

502
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:06,038
always head straight to fertility but a

503
00:21:04,558 --> 00:21:07,480
lot of times it can be your watering or

504
00:21:06,038 --> 00:21:09,440
your environment or your lighting and

505
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,839
all these things and so it's man it's

506
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,880
It's All About Management of these

507
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:15,519
limiting factors and so uh in in that

508
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:19,000
manner I think this exercise is really

509
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:21,798
interesting and and you gave each group

510
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,599
a you know an imaginary what $12 I think

511
00:21:21,798 --> 00:21:26,200
or 12 money bags as your as it's shown

512
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:29,000
here in the video and then they have to

513
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,919
make choices based on energy cost yield

514
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,960
and sustainability and everything has

515
00:21:30,919 --> 00:21:33,520
sort of a

516
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:36,159
rating

517
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:38,798
and it's it's interesting me funny

518
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:41,278
enough that aquaponics was the winning

519
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,798
choice of the um ones that were sent to

520
00:21:41,278 --> 00:21:46,400
me because it's probably the least

521
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:48,079
common actual um method of cultivation

522
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:51,120
especially commercially it's just not

523
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,359
very common um it's interesting that the

524
00:21:51,119 --> 00:21:55,639
students gravitated towards that um do

525
00:21:54,359 --> 00:21:59,199
you want to touch on that before we go

526
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:02,840
over some of the options that people had

527
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:07,159
yeah um you as far as the like their

528
00:22:02,839 --> 00:22:09,000
choice for the aquaponics or just as the

529
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,440
the different results that came out from

530
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,880
the students what they chose I I was

531
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,038
thinking more in terms of aquaponics but

532
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,799
if you want to talk about the different

533
00:22:14,038 --> 00:22:17,400
results I think that's ultimately what I

534
00:22:15,798 --> 00:22:18,918
want to get into here as we go through

535
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,080
it because I think it's it's kind of

536
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:21,960
fascinating and we can talk about some

537
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:25,519
of the options that people had to choose

538
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:28,960
from on the various um different

539
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:31,440
topics yeah I mean I was also really

540
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:33,759
struck by how many groups chose

541
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:36,840
aquaponics well first of all pretty all

542
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:40,679
of the groups chose a water-based system

543
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:43,439
none of them chose organic soil or um

544
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:46,120
inorganic media they all chose um either

545
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,440
aquaponics Hydroponics or aeroponics and

546
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:50,798
most of them like you mentioned uh

547
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:53,240
aquaponics um and yeah I I thought this

548
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:56,000
was quite interesting too I don't quite

549
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:58,880
know what to make out of it um from my

550
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,919
understanding this is quite rare in the

551
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,720
you know it is there's a lot of

552
00:23:00,919 --> 00:23:05,038
challenges around it it breaks my heart

553
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,240
a little bit that they no one chose uh

554
00:23:05,038 --> 00:23:08,480
actual soil and I feel like if I had 10

555
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,038
minutes in front of them I could talk

556
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,558
them all into it but um that's not the

557
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:14,319
point of this

558
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,480
exercise

559
00:23:14,319 --> 00:23:22,000
yeah yeah I mean and and this is where

560
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,798
it's it's kind of curious to think about

561
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,919
where they're coming up with these ideas

562
00:23:24,798 --> 00:23:29,599
because you know they had just very

563
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,080
quickly seen these different types of

564
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:35,000
cultivation

565
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:37,439
fa research looking at internet sites

566
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,599
you know internet research um looking at

567
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,558
pros and cons so I mean ultimately what

568
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:47,519
led them to these decisions was their

569
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:50,278
own research um but also their you know

570
00:23:47,519 --> 00:23:52,558
their values so some things that that

571
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:56,480
that go into making these choices are

572
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:59,000
definitely you know your context um your

573
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:00,400
location um your budgetary constraints

574
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,038
like you mentioned I did give them a

575
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,640
budgetary constraint so I only gave them

576
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,679
12 money bags and for each option there

577
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:12,400
were there was a cost associated with it

578
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,240
so for example like with lighting um

579
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,880
fluorescent grow lights that was half a

580
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,919
money bag so they were cheaper uh if

581
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,799
they wanted to choose the high intensity

582
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:22,600
discharge grow lights that was two money

583
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,599
bags so they were they had to spend more

584
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:27,519
for that type of lighting and the LED

585
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:30,158
grill lights that was three money backs

586
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:33,798
um so they had to make choices depending

587
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,440
on um the amount of upfront cost uh I

588
00:24:33,798 --> 00:24:40,679
also gave them information about you

589
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:43,120
know energy required to operate um so

590
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:45,159
more energy required means more or

591
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:48,278
higher ongoing operating cost and a

592
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:49,919
higher uh carbon footprint so if

593
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,759
students were caring about you know

594
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,840
energy required to operate then that

595
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,919
might have gone into their um their

596
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:58,678
decision-making process I gave them

597
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:01,000
information about yield so some of these

598
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:03,880
options you know are more conducive to

599
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,240
higher yields than others um and then I

600
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,080
um gave them information about

601
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,599
sustainability so how sustainable each

602
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,398
of these options were so um yeah

603
00:25:09,599 --> 00:25:13,000
students you know it's it's quite

604
00:25:11,398 --> 00:25:14,798
interesting to think about what was

605
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,440
going into their decision-making process

606
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,359
it was their understanding of the pros

607
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,720
and cons um their own values associated

608
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:25,918
with maybe cost Effectiveness

609
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:27,278
sustainability um energy usage um so

610
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,759
there was something though about

611
00:25:27,278 --> 00:25:33,720
aquaponics that that was really drawing

612
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:35,839
them um well just on the lighting

613
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:38,200
exercise alone since you brought that up

614
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:41,439
um I mean the choice is really between

615
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,399
sort of this the HID lights and LEDs

616
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,759
just based on the light intensity and

617
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,038
yields um this is a decision that I see

618
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:50,599
facilities have to face in the real

619
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:54,879
world all the time is can I afford The

620
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:57,519
Upfront cost of you know going with LED

621
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,799
lights and a lot of that is dependent on

622
00:25:57,519 --> 00:26:00,519
the energy provid

623
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,000
and if they offer rebates and things

624
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,679
like that a lot of times LED lights can

625
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,919
become more affordable um but then

626
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,679
looking at because of the massive amount

627
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:11,200
of electrical costs associated with

628
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:13,919
running an indoor facility uh we just

629
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,000
did a um we just put together an

630
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:19,120
estimate for uh a company here in

631
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:22,240
Washington that's one of the largest

632
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:25,359
indoor producers and they would have um

633
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,880
an an Roi by switching to LEDs because

634
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:32,199
they initially set up as HPS you know 10

635
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:33,880
years ago uh in less than a year just

636
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,000
just off the electrical not counting the

637
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:38,919
yields for raising their overall you

638
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,278
know ppft levels but just on the

639
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:44,440
um just on the electrical savings alone

640
00:26:42,278 --> 00:26:46,558
and the rebates from the Electrical

641
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,519
Company their energy provider uh would

642
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,359
give them an Roi of less than a year but

643
00:26:48,519 --> 00:26:52,918
this is a real decision I mean do I

644
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:55,519
spend the money upfront to have a more

645
00:26:52,919 --> 00:26:57,520
efficient way of growing or am I sort of

646
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:59,240
Tapped Out on resources and setting up

647
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:01,000
this facility in the infrastructure to

648
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:05,000
where I have to go with a you know a

649
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,079
more affordable option like you know HPS

650
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,558
um initially knowing that I'm going to

651
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,839
end up paying a lot more down the road

652
00:27:08,558 --> 00:27:12,678
in electrical and it's not as

653
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:15,558
sustainable so um I I love that you put

654
00:27:12,679 --> 00:27:17,519
that in there and then on the aquaponic

655
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:20,240
side um interesting enough I looked into

656
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:23,158
aquaponics myself because I think I I

657
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,798
think as someone who's been to UPC and

658
00:27:23,159 --> 00:27:27,640
actually dated someone from UBC for a

659
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:29,119
little while uh I I kind of fit with

660
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,720
that mentality and to kind of understand

661
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,519
the sort of student that would be drawn

662
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,000
there um I looked into aquaponics myself

663
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,240
and found that in Washington state where

664
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,440
I live I would have to have a heated

665
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,798
indoor space I couldn't run aquaponics

666
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,399
in my Greenhouse to keep the fish alive

667
00:27:42,798 --> 00:27:48,278
um through the winter in a sustainable

668
00:27:45,398 --> 00:27:50,199
fashion so I moved away from that for my

669
00:27:48,278 --> 00:27:52,000
in vegetable growing and all that but it

670
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,440
was something that I was drawn to

671
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,720
initially um for that sort of idealism

672
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,960
of the whole of the whole concept

673
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,519
yeah yeah so that that's quite

674
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:05,240
interesting so maybe it would work in

675
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:09,240
some locations and and not in others um

676
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,919
and this really drives home this um you

677
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,759
know personalized approach to making

678
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,480
these decisions you you have to take

679
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,839
into account the

680
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:21,399
context um where what are your

681
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:25,278
constraints um what are your goals do

682
00:28:21,398 --> 00:28:27,000
you want to scale up or or not you know

683
00:28:25,278 --> 00:28:28,960
would you be able to scale up if you if

684
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,759
you chose a certain option

685
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,120
um what are your values what do you most

686
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:34,839
care about like you mentioned you know

687
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:37,719
the student population they might be

688
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:39,519
bringing in certain values that are

689
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:41,679
driving their

690
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,440
decisions yeah so with your permission

691
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,640
I'll share these so people can kind of

692
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,558
see this online um and get an idea of of

693
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,519
real life choices that I think every

694
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,200
facility should be thinking about so if

695
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:53,679
I mean even if you're just at the very

696
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,519
beginning levels of setting up a

697
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,440
cultivation facility this kind of lists

698
00:28:55,519 --> 00:28:59,919
out the sorts of questions you should be

699
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:02,240
asking yourself in a very simplified

700
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:04,320
manner uh um in terms of the choices

701
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:06,960
that you'll be making As you move

702
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:08,759
forward uh but one of the reasons that I

703
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,880
really want to get you on the podcast

704
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:14,200
and I think in terms of

705
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,600
um actionable useful information for

706
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:20,120
Growers that that listen to the podcast

707
00:29:16,599 --> 00:29:22,439
is is this next part of it um is this

708
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:25,038
lecture you put together on evaluating

709
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,600
sources of cannabis information and this

710
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,919
I I think this speaks more broadly

711
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:30,918
across all of society now noway we're

712
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:32,679
just inundated with information on the

713
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,360
internet you know obviously your

714
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:38,320
students were um influenced by the

715
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,839
information that they read Around

716
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:43,359
aquaponics in their research to go that

717
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:46,439
direction and I think that's really

718
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,519
interesting it it makes me wonder

719
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:52,320
um how do we best I guess the question

720
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,399
I'm asking is how do we best evaluate a

721
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,759
product or best evaluate an

722
00:29:54,398 --> 00:30:00,278
authoritative source of information on

723
00:29:56,759 --> 00:30:03,960
the internet um to know that it's you

724
00:30:00,278 --> 00:30:07,038
know factual or or really good quality

725
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,159
information um why why don't we start

726
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:12,640
there I I think that's a great great

727
00:30:09,159 --> 00:30:14,679
topic to really dive into oh yeah I mean

728
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,720
that that is just it's that's so

729
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,720
interesting um this is another thing

730
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,558
that I got from you in my conversation

731
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,319
with you and actually from several other

732
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,839
people that I talked to several people

733
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,558
talked about the importance of being

734
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,240
able to evaluate

735
00:30:26,558 --> 00:30:31,200
information um especially about cannabis

736
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,038
because there's just so much there's

737
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,519
some really great information out there

738
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:38,720
and there's Just Junk um

739
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:40,960
misinformation and so you know how do

740
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,960
you SE how do you separate that that out

741
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:45,000
how do you separate out uh maybe

742
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,640
marketing from useful information you

743
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,640
know there's so much marketing out there

744
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,720
that's that's disguised as information

745
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,720
but it's actually really trying to sell

746
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,519
something um and learning to be a

747
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,240
Discerning consumer of information is

748
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:58,720
just so power it's a powerful useful

749
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,359
tool in today's society um so this is

750
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
something that you know I got from you

751
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:05,199
and from from others and I decided then

752
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,360
to uh that it had to be included in the

753
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,319
course I had to include training and

754
00:31:07,359 --> 00:31:11,678
practice with information evaluation in

755
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:13,879
the course and so I tried to incorporate

756
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:18,278
it in different ways throughout the term

757
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,960
um so in in the course we started off

758
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,440
very early on I think this was the the

759
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:26,480
fourth class session uh we did a lesson

760
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:30,200
specifically on information evaluation

761
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,839
and I first asked students to do an

762
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,720
internet search using a query a query

763
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:36,959
about cannabis so they could use

764
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:39,558
whatever internet um you know search

765
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,600
engine they wanted but I had them all

766
00:31:39,558 --> 00:31:44,798
type in the same query so I had them

767
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:47,278
type in does CBD help to treat

768
00:31:44,798 --> 00:31:48,599
anxiety because we were kind of talking

769
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,880
that was something that we were talking

770
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:52,798
about in the class uh and then once they

771
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,000
type that in and hit the return button I

772
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,839
had them evaluate the top 10 websites

773
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:02,278
that were listed in their results and to

774
00:31:58,839 --> 00:32:04,879
determine which uh source which result

775
00:32:02,278 --> 00:32:06,839
from their search they thought was most

776
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,000
reliable or TR trustworthy and which was

777
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:12,839
least reliable or trustworthy um and to

778
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,240
explain their choices um so for example

779
00:32:12,839 --> 00:32:15,959
what characteristics made them think

780
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,319
that a site that they chose was most

781
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,960
reliable and what characteristics made

782
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:22,000
them think that a site that they chose

783
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,558
is least reliable was actually least

784
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,319
reliable so they said some really

785
00:32:23,558 --> 00:32:29,240
interesting things um so some of the

786
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:31,119
things that they mentioned as far as

787
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:33,200
what they thought made something

788
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,719
reliable was that it provided high

789
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:38,798
quality sources as evidence for claims

790
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:40,200
um if it was a peer-reviewed article

791
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:42,398
that was published in a reputable

792
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:44,880
academic Journal um so students really

793
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,558
put a lot of weight in that you know uh

794
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,559
you know peer-reviewed published um

795
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:52,480
articles if it was written or reviewed

796
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:54,359
by someone who was a credentialed expert

797
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,919
in the field or if it was a reputable

798
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,479
organization they would site things

799
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,440
likego or.edu

800
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:03,278
uh sources as being more reputable uh if

801
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,960
the information was comprehensive and

802
00:33:03,278 --> 00:33:07,159
fact-based if it didn't appear to be

803
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,720
biased and if the site you know the the

804
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:11,200
source looked professional in appearance

805
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:14,120
and then some things that they said made

806
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,558
them think a site was unreliable was if

807
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,398
it was written by someone without

808
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:19,038
credential expertise in the field so a

809
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:20,719
lot of them pointed to a certain site

810
00:33:19,038 --> 00:33:23,240
that was kind of a Blog that was written

811
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,360
by someone who didn't have any sort of

812
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,359
credentialed um expertise in CBD um if

813
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,678
there were grammar sentence structure

814
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:33,000
issues uh if it didn't cite where the

815
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:34,960
information was coming from when they

816
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,599
were making a claim or if it cited poor

817
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,840
quality evidence such as like a blog or

818
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,319
something um if the information was too

819
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:44,439
general or lack specifics if it was

820
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:46,960
anecdotal such as you know just one

821
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,679
person's experience and if they saw a

822
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:51,880
lot of advertising or a very

823
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:54,559
heavy-handed effort to try to solve

824
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:57,840
products um so these were things that

825
00:33:54,558 --> 00:33:59,918
that they said and great this is yeah

826
00:33:57,839 --> 00:34:03,038
this is actually what I probably would

827
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,480
have told them to look

828
00:34:03,038 --> 00:34:06,679
for yeah I mean I I agree with

829
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:09,159
everything that they said I think that

830
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:12,720
was a very those are very thoughtful

831
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:14,559
answers on their part in my ex personal

832
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:17,959
experience I think in the Cannabis

833
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,398
industry especially um we put too much

834
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:22,960
emphasis on this idea of recognized

835
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:26,440
Authority or who the industry lifts up

836
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:28,679
based on number of followers or views um

837
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,119
around social media because I think some

838
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:33,760
of the best and smartest people I see in

839
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:35,559
this industry um don't don't necessarily

840
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:37,159
have a large social media following

841
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:40,519
because their focus is on Research or

842
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:41,800
education or or they're a successful

843
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:44,599
grower and they're spending their time

844
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:47,359
running a facility they're not posting

845
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,760
videos every day on social media so that

846
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,559
that is one thing that I think um not to

847
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,359
your students but just in general to

848
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:58,320
this industry that I do push back on a

849
00:34:54,358 --> 00:35:00,358
little bit in regards to um liability

850
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,559
is um I tend to I tend to put less

851
00:35:00,358 --> 00:35:03,679
emphasis on recognized Authority unless

852
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:05,000
this person you know unless we're

853
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:07,799
talking about a researcher we're talking

854
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:10,719
about someone who is um

855
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,960
has put in the time and really um has

856
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:14,679
been shown to have peer-reviewed work

857
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,599
that they're

858
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:19,199
promoting I I don't know if you have any

859
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:22,880
thoughts on that yeah no no that's

860
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:25,078
that's quite interesting um yeah I I can

861
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,920
definitely see that um and and I think

862
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:29,960
probably cannabis is um a special

863
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,559
situation in that

864
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:34,199
case yeah and and obviously you know I

865
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:37,639
think about this from the lens of

866
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:40,279
someone that look turns to on my podcast

867
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:42,799
uh I'm obviously a for-profit company

868
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:45,640
that puts together this podcast I have a

869
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,880
a skew and bias towards living soils

870
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,279
even though I I do try to get people on

871
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,680
that will talk about other topics

872
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,560
there's definitely a heavy lean in

873
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:57,199
content towards Organics um and I do

874
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,440
also you know manufacture soils and

875
00:35:57,199 --> 00:36:01,279
products and I think people should take

876
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,519
take that into account when evaluating

877
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,480
the quality of of you know the podcast

878
00:36:04,519 --> 00:36:07,838
as a source of information and I don't

879
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,679
think that that discredits the

880
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,039
information that's provided on here but

881
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:14,759
I think it needs to be viewed through

882
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:16,440
that lens just to be objective and to be

883
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:18,440
fair there's podcasts that I've

884
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:20,200
published that I now if I could wave a

885
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:23,960
magic want I would go back and probably

886
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:26,279
delete uh as as I've evolved as a

887
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,599
cultivator and in my understanding of

888
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,519
the product or or or of the of the

889
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:32,559
industry I mean because I think some

890
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,920
people do did come on to the podcast and

891
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,920
neither shared information that I don't

892
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,318
feel

893
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:41,318
was fully accurate you know there there

894
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:42,679
there was sort of a gray area there on

895
00:36:41,318 --> 00:36:45,519
some of the information they shared or

896
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:48,759
it may have been focused more around a

897
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:51,880
product or technology than I would have

898
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:54,839
necessarily liked to see if that makes

899
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,960
sense yeah no that's that's really great

900
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:59,239
that you have that sort of

901
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:02,079
self-awareness about this too and um

902
00:36:59,239 --> 00:37:06,639
that you are aware of your own biases

903
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:10,318
and and expectations and um and I think

904
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:13,199
that is that's one of the key aspects of

905
00:37:10,318 --> 00:37:16,400
being able to effectively evaluate

906
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:19,118
sources is just be we all come in with

907
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,760
our own biases we all have it this is

908
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,960
something I had to deal with too as I

909
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,240
was creating this course I I bumped up

910
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:31,039
against my own biases several times and

911
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:34,399
um but being aware of them allows you to

912
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,639
then be able to overcome them or make it

913
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,880
so that they're not clouding your

914
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:41,078
judgment in in that evaluation or in the

915
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,920
information that you're taking you're

916
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:46,680
not discounting something that is

917
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,318
actually quite reputable and credible

918
00:37:46,679 --> 00:37:51,838
and you're not putting unnecessary stock

919
00:37:49,318 --> 00:37:55,639
in something that you just you want to

920
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:58,639
be true or you you you want to believe

921
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,639
that

922
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:02,519
yeah I mean agree with you and I think

923
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,159
that's well

924
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:08,079
said um did you want to dive into some

925
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:09,679
of these scenarios that you created in

926
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:12,400
terms of talking

927
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:14,358
about this idea of evaluating a source

928
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,680
would that be a good you think use of

929
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:20,318
time or um is there another way to

930
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:22,519
approach it well well actually Tad I'm

931
00:38:20,318 --> 00:38:24,239
wondering because you know after we had

932
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:27,119
kind of chatted a little bit through

933
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:30,078
email um and I was really fast you had

934
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,200
shared with me your process for

935
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:38,720
evaluating products and I thought it was

936
00:38:34,199 --> 00:38:42,759
really um really quite insightful um and

937
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,879
I I really appreciated your process so

938
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:46,880
um I'm wondering if you can share a

939
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,838
little bit about your I I'm happy to

940
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,920
share that yeah yeah I can share that I

941
00:38:48,838 --> 00:38:53,279
will say I I put this together pretty

942
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:55,400
fast I did go back and pull up the email

943
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,720
so I could see what I wrote you um so I

944
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,880
didn't put as much thought into it but

945
00:38:56,719 --> 00:39:00,480
it's sort of ingrained into me now that

946
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,440
it didn't it didn't take me more than 10

947
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:04,119
minutes to write this up because it's

948
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,119
something that I guess I spent more time

949
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,119
thinking about than I even realized um

950
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,240
so sure I'll I'll read off this list if

951
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,318
if that if you think that would be good

952
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,639
and then maybe you can give me your

953
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:16,800
feedback on it and tell me you know good

954
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:18,799
bad in areas that I might have missed or

955
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,519
what maybe what my bias is as I as I

956
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,079
share this with you because I um I found

957
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:27,639
it is sort of an interesting process

958
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:29,039
so my cognitive process when evaluating

959
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,920
product online and I hope that other

960
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:33,480
people would have a similar process even

961
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:34,920
if the steps are a little different is I

962
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:36,639
always start from a process of

963
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:38,838
skepticism and this is me picturing

964
00:39:36,639 --> 00:39:40,318
myself walking around an industry trade

965
00:39:38,838 --> 00:39:41,719
show I don't know why in my head that's

966
00:39:40,318 --> 00:39:44,318
just where I went to as I was going

967
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:46,318
through this um and so I always Start

968
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,960
From perspective of of skepticism and

969
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:50,719
then I collect data information to sort

970
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:53,199
of change my mind so I always assume

971
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:55,399
that the product doesn't work and then

972
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:57,960
they or myself has to convince myself oh

973
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,119
no this this might have a possibility um

974
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,318
I always like to start reading the

975
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:02,838
ingredient label and see what the person

976
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:04,838
decided to put on the package and if

977
00:40:02,838 --> 00:40:07,119
most of it is you know

978
00:40:04,838 --> 00:40:08,239
proprietary that's a pretty big red flag

979
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,200
and that's going to be a hurdle that's

980
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,118
going to be very very challenging for me

981
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:15,159
to get past um that's not to say it's a

982
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:17,480
deal breaker but it it's going to be a

983
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,118
pretty substantial hurdle um if there's

984
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:21,760
not a lot of information about that

985
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:23,599
product online beyond the website so as

986
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,560
other people are not talking about it

987
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:28,480
and it makes uh its marketing peels are

988
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:30,279
primarily test testimonials or side

989
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,159
by-side photos I just don't put a lot of

990
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,760
weight in those as credible sources and

991
00:40:32,159 --> 00:40:37,199
I know that's something that your

992
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,119
students um mentioned as well um if it's

993
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:40,919
a company I've not heard of before or is

994
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,880
not established in the horiculture or

995
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,318
agricultural Industries and is just

996
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:50,160
marketing to cannabis that to me is a

997
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:51,559
bit of a red flag uh just because the

998
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:54,000
that it's such a

999
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:56,400
narrow industry

1000
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:58,079
Focus um if it's a uh let's see what

1001
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,880
else if it's a nutrient or plant growth

1002
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,000
enhancer but has a low amount of

1003
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:05,200
fertility so not a lot of NPK or claims

1004
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,400
to have a new or better mode of delivery

1005
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:09,318
or assimilation by the plant you know

1006
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,800
you hear things like nanotechnology or

1007
00:41:09,318 --> 00:41:15,440
micronized or

1008
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:17,599
um I had a guy telling me about his um

1009
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:19,039
prehistoric carbon source and it turned

1010
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:20,880
out it was he was just talking about

1011
00:41:19,039 --> 00:41:23,279
humic acid but we were talking about

1012
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,640
dinosaurs you know so a lot of is just

1013
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,359
the framing of it I mean these terms

1014
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:29,719
exist for a reason some of these some

1015
00:41:27,358 --> 00:41:31,480
these Technologies are are very valid

1016
00:41:29,719 --> 00:41:33,439
but um it's definitely something I'm a

1017
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,880
little more skeptical around and then I

1018
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,720
like to see if a product is actually

1019
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,240
registered you know if if it's supposed

1020
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:40,039
to be registered with the Washington

1021
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:42,519
State Department of Agriculture Oregon

1022
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:46,039
Department of egg California Department

1023
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:48,239
of egg um that tells to me that shows me

1024
00:41:46,039 --> 00:41:50,960
that you know this company's done their

1025
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:53,239
due diligence to be legally marketed and

1026
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,039
sold and I can also read what they

1027
00:41:53,239 --> 00:41:57,559
registered the product for in terms of

1028
00:41:55,039 --> 00:42:01,679
heavy metals and and PK value vales what

1029
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:03,279
their guaranteed analysis is and then um

1030
00:42:01,679 --> 00:42:05,000
if I've gotten this far and I'm still

1031
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,640
interested then I look at is this

1032
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,159
product closing an ecological Loop or is

1033
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:11,519
it more sustainable than anything that

1034
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:13,598
I'm doing right now and and here I think

1035
00:42:11,519 --> 00:42:16,639
of things like biochar where we're

1036
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,960
reclaiming carbon or insect frass where

1037
00:42:16,639 --> 00:42:21,000
we're able to take a waste product that

1038
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:23,400
the insect and can consume youit from

1039
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,760
our compost and make into a usable

1040
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,960
nutrient product um is there less of a

1041
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,359
fossil fuel cost as to get the same

1042
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,920
nutrients or fertility that I would get

1043
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:35,480
um and here I think of something like

1044
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:38,440
guano which is you know shipped from

1045
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:41,318
overseas uh has a huge fossil fuel cost

1046
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:42,960
is damaging to the local ecology um even

1047
00:42:41,318 --> 00:42:44,800
though it's organic it's not necessarily

1048
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:49,119
something that I would necessarily

1049
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,480
choose to use so uh if I get through all

1050
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,039
of that and I'm still interested then

1051
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,358
I'll set up a trial and if I get a

1052
00:42:52,039 --> 00:42:57,199
positive response from that then I'll

1053
00:42:53,358 --> 00:43:00,679
figure out um from there if what what

1054
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:02,480
limiting factor in my buau was that or

1055
00:43:00,679 --> 00:43:03,919
cultivation practices was that product

1056
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,358
addressing and then I'll say okay is

1057
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,599
there a more affordable way for me to

1058
00:43:05,358 --> 00:43:08,960
get there then this product and if not

1059
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,039
then this product is something that I

1060
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,199
want to add to my list and um so it's

1061
00:43:13,039 --> 00:43:18,239
quite a uh quite an extensive

1062
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:20,199
process uh and then the last thing I

1063
00:43:18,239 --> 00:43:21,959
mention on here that I look for is the

1064
00:43:20,199 --> 00:43:24,279
network of people that I trust so for

1065
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:26,760
example when it comes to entomology or

1066
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:29,640
IPM stuff if my friend Suzanne way W

1067
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:31,119
Evans the bug lady if she recommends it

1068
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,000
that to me is usually enough just

1069
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,000
because she is so authoritative to me in

1070
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:39,000
terms of my respect for her knowledge

1071
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,199
and uh expertise in her field that I

1072
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,000
don't I don't need to question it um and

1073
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,598
I would skip all of the above steps that

1074
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,760
I listed for that reason because I know

1075
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:50,160
she's already done all that for me um

1076
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,520
much more thoroughly than I could be

1077
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:52,960
based on her expertise and there are a

1078
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,480
few people in the industry that I turn

1079
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,559
to like that but it's a very select list

1080
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:59,880
so okay I've been talking for a long

1081
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:02,519
time that was that was sort of all of it

1082
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:06,079
what are your thoughts I well I think

1083
00:44:02,519 --> 00:44:08,199
that this is I I was so um happy that

1084
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:09,880
you shared this with me I think it's so

1085
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:13,239
insightful it really

1086
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:16,079
showcases um all of your experience over

1087
00:44:13,239 --> 00:44:18,679
you know over years like honing this

1088
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:21,079
process and figuring out what has worked

1089
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:22,519
and you know what have been some of the

1090
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,599
you know things that have led you astray

1091
00:44:22,519 --> 00:44:27,559
in the past and like uh and putting that

1092
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,119
in now to your process so that you don't

1093
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:32,000
make those same mistakes in the future

1094
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,318
and I especially um I because I've you

1095
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,119
know I listen to your podcast quite a

1096
00:44:33,318 --> 00:44:38,318
bit and I know that you refer to Suzanne

1097
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,838
qu a lot and so that one in particular I

1098
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:42,719
I also think is so important for people

1099
00:44:40,838 --> 00:44:45,358
to have some sort of like an anchor

1100
00:44:42,719 --> 00:44:48,118
Source um of you

1101
00:44:45,358 --> 00:44:50,799
know someone a trusted anchor source to

1102
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,079
go to when you're unsure uh and I think

1103
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,039
this can be especially helpful

1104
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:56,440
especially if you're not very familiar

1105
00:44:54,039 --> 00:44:58,558
with that given field or context and and

1106
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:00,519
you know this could be be an expert kind

1107
00:44:58,559 --> 00:45:02,480
of like Suzanne for you it could be a

1108
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:04,400
reputable organ organization or company

1109
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,119
that's proven their credibility to you

1110
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,800
and that that you really trust I mean I

1111
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:11,200
think that's the main thing you find

1112
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:13,079
someone who you know that you can trust

1113
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:15,759
um and if you're insur you reach out to

1114
00:45:13,079 --> 00:45:17,079
them and so you don't have to you know

1115
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,240
reinvent the wheel you don't have to do

1116
00:45:17,079 --> 00:45:21,920
all this research yourself you can you

1117
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:23,959
know find someone and and it can be

1118
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:25,800
different people in different contexts

1119
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:27,519
that that can serve as this anchor

1120
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:29,599
source for you

1121
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,239
um another thing that you mentioned that

1122
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:34,559
I think is so important is starting from

1123
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:37,318
a place of skepticism you know go into

1124
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,079
viewing each new source or product or

1125
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:41,679
whatever with a healthy dose of

1126
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,440
skepticism not taking anything at face

1127
00:45:41,679 --> 00:45:46,679
value um but expecting that it will need

1128
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:50,280
to convince you rather than you giving

1129
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:53,639
it the benefit of the doubt um so yeah I

1130
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:55,960
I I love your list I think it's fabulous

1131
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:57,440
um maybe a couple other things that I

1132
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,800
might add to

1133
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:02,480
a list um that we you know we've already

1134
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:04,519
talked about is be aware of your biases

1135
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,920
and expectations going in you know we

1136
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:10,318
all bring our own baggage based on our

1137
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,240
prev experience what we want to hear um

1138
00:46:10,318 --> 00:46:13,920
and this can either cause us to

1139
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,000
disregard something credible or to

1140
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,760
overlook glaring red flags um both of

1141
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,358
which will prevent us from being able to

1142
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:24,000
properly evaluate that that information

1143
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:25,799
or that source and as humans you know

1144
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:28,159
we're very prone to something called

1145
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:29,800
confirmation bias it's this tendency to

1146
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:31,358
seek out and favor things that will

1147
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,960
confirm or support what we already

1148
00:46:31,358 --> 00:46:35,960
believe or what we want to believe um

1149
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:39,280
but but it's quite dangerous it can

1150
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:41,199
Cloud our judgment so just being aware

1151
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,280
of you know biases and expectations

1152
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:45,960
going in

1153
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:47,720
um another thing I might say is compare

1154
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,480
the information with other sources don't

1155
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:51,838
just stop with one source but you know

1156
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:54,800
compare it with with other things if

1157
00:46:51,838 --> 00:46:56,960
you're seeing something that you know is

1158
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:59,280
way out from what you've seen elsewhere

1159
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,880
you know that that could be a red flag

1160
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:05,559
um and yeah just just keep

1161
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:09,640
practicing keep practicing it's being

1162
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:11,400
able to evaluate is like it's it's a

1163
00:47:09,639 --> 00:47:13,679
skill that you develop over time it's

1164
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:16,559
like these eyes that you develop over

1165
00:47:13,679 --> 00:47:19,159
time and you just you get better and and

1166
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:23,040
I can I could tell with your list like

1167
00:47:19,159 --> 00:47:26,000
that was the results of you practicing

1168
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:27,880
evaluating for a very long time you

1169
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,679
you've honed you've honed your

1170
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:32,000
evaluation

1171
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:34,759
eyes well it's because I made mistakes

1172
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,079
you know I've when I first came into

1173
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:39,599
this industry because I I came I came to

1174
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,119
cannabis sort of in a unique fashion I

1175
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:46,359
wasn't initially a cannabis user um I'd

1176
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:49,280
never grown cannabis and my parents had

1177
00:47:46,358 --> 00:47:52,400
owned a Nursery and Landscaping business

1178
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:54,599
for 20 years at this point um so I grew

1179
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:56,838
up around plants but not around cannabis

1180
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,920
necessarily though my father was pretty

1181
00:47:56,838 --> 00:48:00,679
pretty big cannabis user I found out

1182
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:03,960
later

1183
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:07,558
um but basically when I first started

1184
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:10,800
researching it um I went into my first

1185
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:12,359
Hydro shop um and at the time there was

1186
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,839
there was medical program but it was

1187
00:48:12,358 --> 00:48:17,558
pretty small in Washington state there

1188
00:48:13,838 --> 00:48:20,078
was no recreational program and uh so

1189
00:48:17,559 --> 00:48:21,599
walking in there I felt like I I felt

1190
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,880
like a Target like maybe there was a cop

1191
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,519
waiting around the corner sort of a

1192
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,440
thing um it was like a park down the

1193
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:29,239
street sort of a feeling uh it was dirty

1194
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:30,920
there were no plants in the shop which

1195
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,639
was really weird to me because the shop

1196
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:34,760
was geared toward growing plants but yet

1197
00:48:32,639 --> 00:48:37,838
there were no plants in there but there

1198
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:40,559
were all these bottles that had uh you

1199
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:43,440
know really cool stickers of of fake

1200
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,480
giant plants or like women and scantily

1201
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:48,079
clad outfits um nothing like the stuff

1202
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,000
that my parents were selling in their

1203
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:53,519
Garden Center at their Nur plant nursery

1204
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:55,000
and so I was wondering like should I be

1205
00:48:53,519 --> 00:48:56,920
using these things with my vegetables

1206
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,719
like are these Pro what makes these

1207
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:02,200
products so unique they're so expensive

1208
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,719
um I was really excited at first I was

1209
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:06,239
like oh my gosh I think I've discovered

1210
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:09,480
something here and then as I started

1211
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:11,519
learning more uh I realized I don't need

1212
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,358
all these things um one at the time I

1213
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:15,079
couldn't afford them anyway so I had to

1214
00:49:13,358 --> 00:49:18,078
come up with alternative ways and for me

1215
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:19,839
that was learning um doing research on

1216
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:21,318
on internet forums at the time because

1217
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:22,798
there wasn't a lot of authoritative

1218
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:24,759
information around

1219
00:49:22,798 --> 00:49:28,079
cannabis um seeing what other people

1220
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:30,920
were having success with um and now I

1221
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:33,119
feel like sort of social media has

1222
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:35,358
turned into this Echo chamber where one

1223
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,358
company might get pretty big in a given

1224
00:49:35,358 --> 00:49:43,598
space everyone Echoes their sentiments

1225
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:45,960
and it becomes very product focused um

1226
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,599
instead of necessarily looking at the

1227
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:49,639
technology and figuring how we can do

1228
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:53,079
things more sustain sustainably or

1229
00:49:49,639 --> 00:49:56,759
without using all of these you know

1230
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,920
products um and part of that you know

1231
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,400
that's what led me to some of these

1232
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,760
things like when I think about going on

1233
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,480
the wsda or the cdfa website when I go

1234
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,520
look up the products of some of these

1235
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,079
companies and and and find what

1236
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:10,440
information they have around heavy

1237
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,440
metals or around NPK or if they're even

1238
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:16,679
registered um that to me was a way of

1239
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:18,240
sort of validating or discrediting what

1240
00:50:16,679 --> 00:50:22,039
I was seeing on social media because

1241
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:24,000
social media can be very convincing um

1242
00:50:22,039 --> 00:50:25,759
and it's very easy I think to go to a

1243
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,960
social media you know an Instagram

1244
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,799
account or YouTube page and see all the

1245
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,760
people echoing and commenting and

1246
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:35,759
validating what the person is saying and

1247
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:38,440
I've seen it on my pages too I'm not

1248
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:40,920
this isn't unique to to me

1249
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:44,119
um but I don't think that provides a

1250
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:46,639
very authoritative or

1251
00:50:44,119 --> 00:50:50,000
reputable credential in terms of what's

1252
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:53,318
actually being shared in the Canada

1253
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,880
space yeah yeah absolutely yeah uh and

1254
00:50:53,318 --> 00:50:57,519
thank you for sharing your experience

1255
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:59,440
too I you know

1256
00:50:57,519 --> 00:51:01,039
this is this is a journey that we have

1257
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,960
to go on

1258
00:51:01,039 --> 00:51:07,079
to you know figure out how to evaluate

1259
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:10,240
in like this is a whole new skill in

1260
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:13,160
this day and age um and the more that we

1261
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:15,000
can share with each other tips uh the

1262
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:16,798
the easier that this gets so thank you

1263
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,199
for for sharing

1264
00:51:16,798 --> 00:51:22,880
those well one of the things that I

1265
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:27,039
discovered too was um by going

1266
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:29,680
to graduate school um even though I was

1267
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:33,000
studying special education I was forced

1268
00:51:29,679 --> 00:51:35,239
to read a lot of research articles a lot

1269
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,239
of them you know were on behavioral

1270
00:51:35,239 --> 00:51:38,759
techniques and things around education

1271
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:41,039
you know similar to I think some of the

1272
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:44,079
stuff that you studied in in in your

1273
00:51:41,039 --> 00:51:46,519
educational Journey um it wasn't so much

1274
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:49,839
about the research that I read but it

1275
00:51:46,519 --> 00:51:52,318
was about learning how to read these

1276
00:51:49,838 --> 00:51:54,239
papers and understanding what sorts of

1277
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:56,239
conclusions I can really draw from them

1278
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:58,000
and what I can't because one thing one

1279
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:59,838
other issue that I see is people will

1280
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,239
read a paper and we see this in the news

1281
00:51:59,838 --> 00:52:03,719
all the time with these you know

1282
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:06,519
sensationalized headlines and PE and and

1283
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:09,598
people will take a a research paper and

1284
00:52:06,519 --> 00:52:13,480
then draw all of these Health

1285
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:15,400
implications um or you know cultivation

1286
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:17,559
decisions around things that the

1287
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:20,119
research really wasn't

1288
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:22,559
saying uh and I think that's a really

1289
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:25,599
interesting thing to talk

1290
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:29,000
about yeah absolutely I mean you have to

1291
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:33,039
be so care careful with you know news

1292
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:35,159
articles about cannabis science

1293
00:52:33,039 --> 00:52:37,159
um because like you said you know first

1294
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:39,558
of all the titles are so sensationalized

1295
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:41,879
and overblown and oftentimes the

1296
00:52:39,559 --> 00:52:44,400
reporting is you know it's not po they

1297
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:47,480
might not be pointing out those red

1298
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,400
flags um or those those issues with the

1299
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,679
study or they might be you know

1300
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:54,160
interpreting the results in way that are

1301
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:56,039
not appropriate or you know not

1302
00:52:54,159 --> 00:53:01,440
associated with the scale that was done

1303
00:52:56,039 --> 00:53:04,838
with the stud itself um I I read so uh

1304
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,639
there's a quote by Dr Peter grinspoon

1305
00:53:04,838 --> 00:53:09,400
this is one of the people that I I did

1306
00:53:06,639 --> 00:53:12,159
consult with through the the process of

1307
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:14,240
um creating this course and there's a

1308
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:17,000
quote from a book that he wrote that was

1309
00:53:14,239 --> 00:53:20,239
just I thought really well encapsulated

1310
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:22,000
this unique problem with cannabis um and

1311
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:24,318
maybe I'll share this uh with you

1312
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,280
because I just I really like this quote

1313
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:29,759
um so he said unfortunately due to its

1314
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,839
poom aized history cannabis is not in

1315
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,720
the category of regular science where

1316
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:36,078
you just give the benefit of the doubt

1317
00:53:33,719 --> 00:53:37,759
and trust that everything's kosher with

1318
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:40,160
cannabis you always have to look beyond

1319
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:42,359
the headlines read the entire study

1320
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:44,719
check on the references try to discern

1321
00:53:42,358 --> 00:53:46,920
the perhaps unconscious agenda of the

1322
00:53:44,719 --> 00:53:48,439
researchers and take note of the social

1323
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,119
context in with the in which the

1324
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,920
research is being performed as well as

1325
00:53:50,119 --> 00:53:53,760
funding source and the affiliation of

1326
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,798
the authors it's just it's very

1327
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:58,720
complicated so even being able to like

1328
00:53:56,798 --> 00:54:02,039
like you said read these papers and be

1329
00:53:58,719 --> 00:54:05,279
able to glean the information from them

1330
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:07,679
and and to evaluate the research

1331
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,040
because not all cannabis research is

1332
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:12,480
created equal there's some very very

1333
00:54:10,039 --> 00:54:14,798
high quality research that's being done

1334
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:16,318
and there's some lowquality research

1335
00:54:14,798 --> 00:54:19,000
that's being done that's also being

1336
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:23,480
published in in peer- reviewed journals

1337
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:28,798
um so it's it's really up to us as

1338
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:30,519
consumers of information to be know eval

1339
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,798
to have these evaluation skills and to

1340
00:54:30,519 --> 00:54:34,280
make these decisions we cannot depend on

1341
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:37,079
other people to be doing this for us

1342
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:39,400
because it leads us astray it's it's

1343
00:54:37,079 --> 00:54:41,960
unfortunate but that's just that is the

1344
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,960
case with

1345
00:54:42,318 --> 00:54:46,519
cannabis yeah and I see this on the

1346
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:49,599
cultivation side

1347
00:54:46,519 --> 00:54:52,719
around products or concepts for example

1348
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,920
um I I grew up around air rated compost

1349
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:56,558
tea my parents my dad started an air

1350
00:54:54,920 --> 00:55:00,240
compost tea business was one of the very

1351
00:54:56,559 --> 00:55:03,680
first people doing this um when it first

1352
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:06,078
uh was a thing uh you know with the soul

1353
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,879
food while I've been Dr Ingam

1354
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:11,599
and the research around it was very

1355
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:13,880
mixed and so you have one side you had

1356
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,440
Dr Ingam sharing all this research of

1357
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,480
How It's suppressing disease and having

1358
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,679
all these benefits and it's

1359
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:21,559
miraculous uh Silver Bullet and then on

1360
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:23,558
the other side you had someone like Dr

1361
00:55:21,559 --> 00:55:25,280
Linda Chalker Scott saying that compost

1362
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:26,680
tea is snake oil and it doesn't work and

1363
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:29,960
they both had research to to support

1364
00:55:26,679 --> 00:55:31,879
what they were saying um personally I

1365
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,400
think all the research around this topic

1366
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:36,200
is is not good because you're talking

1367
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,480
about a biological entity that's

1368
00:55:36,199 --> 00:55:41,399
constantly changing and you can't

1369
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,519
recreate um because of the fact that

1370
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,039
this microbiology is going to be

1371
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:45,880
different in every Brew so there's no

1372
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:49,039
way you can have a good control around

1373
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:52,838
it um but it it's interesting how

1374
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:56,000
research can be spun to either support

1375
00:55:52,838 --> 00:55:57,679
or discredit a you know a topic or a

1376
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,079
tech technology in this case area

1377
00:55:57,679 --> 00:56:02,159
compost te and I don't think either side

1378
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:03,359
was is totally right in this case I

1379
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:05,199
think I think the middle ground is

1380
00:56:03,358 --> 00:56:07,119
really where this lies but it it was a

1381
00:56:05,199 --> 00:56:09,078
matter of going through and looking at

1382
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:12,240
the methodology that they used how did

1383
00:56:09,079 --> 00:56:15,280
they brew the tea how um how

1384
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:18,639
many um you know how many plants were

1385
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:23,880
they applied to like um I went I went

1386
00:56:18,639 --> 00:56:27,118
and gave a talk to a uh group of uh um

1387
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,680
landscapers you know 15 years ago and Dr

1388
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,640
ly shock Scott was one of the speakers

1389
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:32,798
there and she shared a trial that she

1390
00:56:30,639 --> 00:56:35,838
was talking about

1391
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:38,038
um for why she was recommending wood

1392
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,239
mulches in gardens and was based on a

1393
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:41,920
trial that she did and that's not to say

1394
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:44,879
that wood mulches are bad but in the

1395
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,440
trial she only had 10 plants and she

1396
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,400
didn't know the name of the plant that

1397
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:50,280
she used and so the idea of me of

1398
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:52,680
applying this broadly this concept

1399
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:56,000
broadly across all of landscaping in

1400
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:57,558
this case or you know um it didn't it

1401
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,199
was wasn't authoritative enough or the

1402
00:56:57,559 --> 00:57:01,039
methodology wasn't strong enough for me

1403
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,759
to feel like you could make that jump

1404
00:57:01,039 --> 00:57:04,319
and so maybe I would look to other Is

1405
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,400
there further research to support this

1406
00:57:04,318 --> 00:57:06,719
that other people have done where

1407
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:08,440
they've used you know a variety of

1408
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:11,598
plants or where they've used different

1409
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:15,519
mulches um and that's when I'd start to

1410
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:18,119
look into like does this have um

1411
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,599
credibility I guess and and I hope

1412
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:23,798
people really are doing this process and

1413
00:57:20,599 --> 00:57:26,720
looking Beyond social media um for their

1414
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:29,318
answers and I I or even this podcast or

1415
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:32,118
other other sources of information is as

1416
00:57:29,318 --> 00:57:33,960
credible as they may sound um I try like

1417
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,599
you said with our biases I try to apply

1418
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,599
my bias to this podcast when I think

1419
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:39,440
about what sort of people I have on the

1420
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,960
podcast or what sort of topics I talk

1421
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:44,440
about um but I know it's not perfect and

1422
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,358
like I've said before I've made multiple

1423
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:48,519
mistakes over the course because I've

1424
00:57:46,358 --> 00:57:50,960
done you know over a 100 podcasts now

1425
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:53,000
and some of them I I absolutely no had

1426
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:56,679
bias and we're sharing information that

1427
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:00,280
I no longer feel is necessarily

1428
00:57:56,679 --> 00:58:03,000
in in our in our body of

1429
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,319
knowledge yeah yeah no thank you for

1430
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:07,000
sharing that um and I I think that

1431
00:58:05,318 --> 00:58:08,679
speaks to you know all of this is a

1432
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,679
journey and it's all a process and this

1433
00:58:08,679 --> 00:58:15,358
has been your this podcast has been your

1434
00:58:10,679 --> 00:58:17,639
learning process too um yeah um but yeah

1435
00:58:15,358 --> 00:58:20,679
I I want to Echo what you mentioned

1436
00:58:17,639 --> 00:58:23,159
about you know not putting all of your

1437
00:58:20,679 --> 00:58:28,239
trust in one study you have to remember

1438
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:29,920
one study is just one study and you know

1439
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:32,318
different studies vary in quality it

1440
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,680
could be a a poor quality study so you

1441
00:58:32,318 --> 00:58:37,239
definitely don't want to put your trust

1442
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:41,639
all in that one study the it's much

1443
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:43,519
better to look at the the whole of the

1444
00:58:41,639 --> 00:58:46,838
field look at all of the different

1445
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:50,358
research that's that has been done um

1446
00:58:46,838 --> 00:58:52,838
and you put it all together because like

1447
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:54,558
like you said it's it's probably

1448
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:56,519
somewhere in the middle it's it's not

1449
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:59,400
it's very things tend to be much more

1450
00:58:56,519 --> 00:59:01,079
complex than we think that they are and

1451
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:02,960
if you just are looking at one study

1452
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:06,400
you're looking at a very simplified

1453
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:08,639
maybe a simplified um methodology or

1454
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,160
study system or like you said maybe

1455
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:13,400
there's only a few plants in there um

1456
00:59:11,159 --> 00:59:15,879
but looking at you know a larger breath

1457
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:18,760
of studies and seeing how they relate to

1458
00:59:15,880 --> 00:59:20,160
one another um that's that's I think a

1459
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,799
really important aspect of getting

1460
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:27,639
closer and closer and closer to the

1461
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:30,639
truth so what what do you think um is in

1462
00:59:27,639 --> 00:59:32,719
store at UBC in terms of this this

1463
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,719
course so first of all let's talk about

1464
00:59:32,719 --> 00:59:36,078
what what do you feel like your students

1465
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:38,038
really took away from the course when

1466
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:39,920
you went back and and really evaluated

1467
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:41,799
it what were your thoughts about this

1468
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:44,760
first the first time

1469
00:59:41,798 --> 00:59:48,280
through I I thought it was it was really

1470
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,280
fabulous I mean I didn't go in wanting

1471
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,839
students to leave with a lot

1472
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:57,000
of information like that was not

1473
00:59:53,838 --> 01:00:00,000
important to me I really wanted them to

1474
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:02,838
shift their mindset about cannabis I

1475
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:07,960
wanted them to be able to think about it

1476
01:00:02,838 --> 01:00:11,279
in a more holistic U more complex way um

1477
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:13,079
and I think we were able to do that um

1478
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:15,039
by all the different topics that we

1479
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:16,880
covered by you know looking at different

1480
01:00:15,039 --> 01:00:19,520
sources really interrogating where

1481
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,680
information is coming from um looking at

1482
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:27,759
things in different ways different

1483
01:00:21,679 --> 01:00:31,199
perspectives um and the the way that I

1484
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:33,480
could get a sense for if their mindset

1485
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:35,919
was shifting about cannabis was at the

1486
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,920
very beginning of the course I had them

1487
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:41,400
respond to three statements um and they

1488
01:00:38,920 --> 01:00:45,240
had to respond to it based on a like a

1489
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:48,079
spectrum so the first statement was um

1490
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:52,639
well the Spectrum was between zero to

1491
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:56,000
100 zero being cannabis has no benefits

1492
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:57,598
and 100 it was Cannabis has lots of

1493
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:59,679
benefits can be used for a lot of things

1494
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,760
so they had to pick a number between Z

1495
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:03,960
and 100 between that Spectrum um and

1496
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:08,839
then I the second one I gave them was 0

1497
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:10,960
to 100 zero being cannabis has no harms

1498
01:01:08,838 --> 01:01:13,119
um and then 100 was Cannabis is very

1499
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:15,639
harmful uh and they had to pick a number

1500
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:18,400
and explain and then the last one I gave

1501
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:21,118
them was um zero to 100 zero was

1502
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:23,200
Cannabis has legalization of cannabis

1503
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,440
because I'm in Canada so cannabis is

1504
01:01:23,199 --> 01:01:29,558
legally um federally legal here

1505
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:32,039
so uh zero was Cannabis legalization has

1506
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:33,640
been negative for society and then 100

1507
01:01:32,039 --> 01:01:35,760
was Cannabis legalization has been

1508
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:37,440
positive for society so they had to

1509
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,760
choose a number and explain and I looked

1510
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,240
at the numbers they chose at the

1511
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:41,480
beginning of class and the numbers that

1512
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:43,519
they chose at the end of class and it

1513
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:45,358
was a really really interesting to see

1514
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:50,480
their perspectives change and to see

1515
01:01:45,358 --> 01:01:54,400
their um their explanations become much

1516
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:56,440
more comprehensive much more complex uh

1517
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:59,119
they were they were struggling a lot a

1518
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:02,679
lot more with with really finding a

1519
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,798
number um because they had they had a

1520
01:02:02,679 --> 01:02:07,358
greater understanding of the complexity

1521
01:02:04,798 --> 01:02:09,239
and the Nuance associated with cannabis

1522
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:12,199
so that was that was my overall goal to

1523
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:15,239
shift their mindset um because you

1524
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:17,278
know we've all been we you know we've

1525
01:02:15,239 --> 01:02:21,558
been exposed to so much negative

1526
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:23,480
messaging um and we tend we tend to have

1527
01:02:21,559 --> 01:02:26,119
a limited understanding of cannabis

1528
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,440
based on the messaging that we have come

1529
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:31,720
across throughout you know our lives um

1530
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:35,278
but having the ability to uh expand our

1531
01:02:31,719 --> 01:02:37,519
understanding um again the more you know

1532
01:02:35,278 --> 01:02:40,880
the closer it gets you to the truth it's

1533
01:02:37,519 --> 01:02:42,278
a more messy truth but um it gets you

1534
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,640
and I think in in theory with this

1535
01:02:42,278 --> 01:02:46,719
exercise the point is not necessarily

1536
01:02:44,639 --> 01:02:50,480
for their answers to move in One

1537
01:02:46,719 --> 01:02:53,639
Direction or another uh it's it's just

1538
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:55,838
for them to be to make a more educated

1539
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:59,519
choice for how they would how they would

1540
01:02:55,838 --> 01:03:01,599
would measure things um what what were

1541
01:02:59,519 --> 01:03:04,079
your findings though if you're open to

1542
01:03:01,599 --> 01:03:06,640
sharing if if you did sort of average

1543
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:09,798
them out what direction did they move on

1544
01:03:06,639 --> 01:03:13,278
their answers from where to where yeah

1545
01:03:09,798 --> 01:03:15,920
so um for the first one about the

1546
01:03:13,278 --> 01:03:18,838
benefits of cannabis they shifted up so

1547
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:23,880
they shifted towards cannabis has more

1548
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:26,838
benefits um for the harms they shifted

1549
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,960
down where and no one ended the course

1550
01:03:26,838 --> 01:03:31,880
saying like zero cannabis has zero harms

1551
01:03:28,960 --> 01:03:34,760
no one said that um but they shifted

1552
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:38,160
their conception of the harmful aspect

1553
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:40,278
of cannabis down and then um for the

1554
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:43,440
last one as far as Society they there

1555
01:03:40,278 --> 01:03:46,000
was a slight shift towards be it being

1556
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:47,440
positive legalization is positive um and

1557
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:52,679
a lot of that came from you know we

1558
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:55,599
talked about um you know pesticide use

1559
01:03:52,679 --> 01:03:59,000
and um you know heavy metals and you

1560
01:03:55,599 --> 01:04:01,400
know things that are now being regulated

1561
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:04,039
because of the legalization of cannabis

1562
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:05,400
which you know is positive for society

1563
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:07,520
and there's all these sociological

1564
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:09,720
aspects you know people are not going to

1565
01:04:07,519 --> 01:04:11,960
prison for this anymore and families are

1566
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:15,078
not dealing with all the you know the

1567
01:04:11,960 --> 01:04:18,798
The Fallout of the criminal system and

1568
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:20,880
um but also I realized early on that

1569
01:04:18,798 --> 01:04:23,639
students were coming in with very very

1570
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:26,039
negative views of cannabis I I asked

1571
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,798
them uh in one of the first assignments

1572
01:04:26,039 --> 01:04:29,039
to really reflect on the messages that

1573
01:04:27,798 --> 01:04:30,440
they had received about cannabis

1574
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:32,760
throughout their lives you know in

1575
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,559
school from family from religious

1576
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:39,680
institutions from you know media the

1577
01:04:35,559 --> 01:04:41,798
news and movies and everything and um

1578
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,118
they they were coming in with very

1579
01:04:41,798 --> 01:04:46,358
negative

1580
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:48,519
connotations um so it makes sense to me

1581
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:49,838
because of you know the biases that were

1582
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:51,239
they were bringing in the negative

1583
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:53,199
biases that they were bringing in based

1584
01:04:51,239 --> 01:04:54,199
on all of these different messages that

1585
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:56,960
they had received throughout their

1586
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:59,358
lifetime that like that makes sense to

1587
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,480
me as you learn more that their

1588
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:02,480
understanding of the benefits would

1589
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:04,920
increase as they were exposed to

1590
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:07,159
positive messaging you know to balance

1591
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:09,519
that out and their understanding of the

1592
01:05:07,159 --> 01:05:13,960
harms you know it's it's not as harmful

1593
01:05:09,519 --> 01:05:16,719
as maybe they had been um taught to

1594
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:20,798
believe it's interesting the demographic

1595
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:22,199
that would choose to take a course in

1596
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:24,599
called the biology of cannabis that

1597
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:26,439
maybe necessarily was skewed towards

1598
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:29,519
thinking of it as a harm

1599
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:33,119
ful negative

1600
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:34,400
um thing yeah plant yeah yeah I was

1601
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:36,240
quite surprised by that too I was

1602
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:38,920
thinking why I'm curious why you took

1603
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:41,598
this course if you're coming in you know

1604
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:44,920
um with some negative feelings about it

1605
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:47,680
um but I I think it just speaks to uh

1606
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:52,278
just how interesting how fascinating

1607
01:05:47,679 --> 01:05:55,798
cannabis is um and why it was such a you

1608
01:05:52,278 --> 01:05:58,119
know effective beautiful vehicle to use

1609
01:05:55,798 --> 01:06:00,559
to get students to understand biology

1610
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:02,278
you know we're we're couching it within

1611
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:03,760
this within something that maybe they

1612
01:06:02,278 --> 01:06:06,920
have negative feelings about but they're

1613
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:06,920
still very interested

1614
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:12,838
in that's wonderful so do you see this

1615
01:06:09,358 --> 01:06:14,480
course continuing at EC yes I would love

1616
01:06:12,838 --> 01:06:17,318
to see it continue on I'm going to be

1617
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:19,599
co-teaching it with um my c-course

1618
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:22,159
Creator the person the research faculty

1619
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:26,200
who helped me create it um we'll be co-

1620
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:28,000
teing it in January in the spring so

1621
01:06:26,199 --> 01:06:30,000
yeah it we'll at least have one more

1622
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,278
offering well I think it's so great and

1623

I appreciate you sort of sharing your

1624
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:35,880
findings in process with us here today

1625
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:38,558
uh I really enjoyed the

1626
