00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:18,640
welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:21,160
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,719
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,518
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,759
organic growing from a science-based

7
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,079
perspective and drawing top experts from

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,240
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:32,039
wisdom and knowledge this first first

10
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,920
episode is just to give some background

11
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:35,878
on why I created this podcast and what

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
sort of cultivation I believe is the

13
00:00:35,878 --> 00:00:40,039
future of cannabis production too much

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,960
of the information surrounding cannabis

15
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:43,960
is myth and speculation that has been

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,520
spread through internet forums and poor

17
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,558
science my aim with this podcast is to

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,280
bridge the gap between horiculture and

19
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:53,558
cannabis Growers based on our experience

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,359
scientifically supported principles and

21
00:00:53,558 --> 00:00:58,238
a debunk many of the myths surrounding

22
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,000
this industry this podcast is intended

23
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:02,000
to be a resource for both beginner and

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,558
longtime Growers alike and to bring

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
together the existing body of knowledge

26
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,719
in one location it's not intended to be

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,040
an exhaustive work on all the ways and

28
00:01:07,719 --> 00:01:11,599
Equipment you can use to grow cannabis

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:13,439
rather our goal is to focus on

30
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:15,399
sustainable and organic cultivation

31
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,000
methods using the best practices

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,478
available based on current research much

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,519
of this research has come from long

34
00:01:19,478 --> 00:01:23,959
hours reading Journal articles and

35
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:25,920
discussions with people far smarter than

36
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:27,640
myself we've worked hard to make

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,920
cannabis cultivation more sustainable

38
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,439
and economically viable for Growers as

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,200
as well as focusing on Organics to

40
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,359
provide the safest and most effective

41
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,320
medicine to Consumers now if you're

42
00:01:35,359 --> 00:01:39,519
currently a chemical nutrient or hydr

43
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:42,158
grower I'd ask that before you turn this

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:44,280
podcast off please hear me out Organics

45
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,680
is no longer some hippie idea where your

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,079
sacrificing quality or yield but rather

47
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,000
the path to Growing the highest quality

48
00:01:49,078 --> 00:01:52,718
cannabis and if you're a commercial

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,399
grower and this is your livelihood then

50
00:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,478
I think it's even more important that

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,399
you stay tuned the more traditional

52
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:00,640
cultivation techniques of buying cheap

53
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,478
soils or sterile media that then require

54
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,718
bottled nutrients to feed your plant are

55
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:07,478
outdated in my opinion sure they do work

56
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:09,118
but they are way too expensive and many

57
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:11,598
of these ingredients can be sourced in

58
00:02:09,118 --> 00:02:13,800
raw form saving the grower a ton of

59
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:15,359
money there's a reason you don't see

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,680
General Hydroponics or advanced

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,319
nutrients in the agricultural world or

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,800
being used on Commercial basil or tomato

63
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:24,598
crops not to mention the excessive

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,200
nitrates and phosphates polluting our

65
00:02:24,598 --> 00:02:28,479
groundwater when Growers dispose of

66
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,439
their spent soil and the labor required

67
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:31,479
to constantly be moving soil in and out

68
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:33,680
of the

69
00:02:31,479 --> 00:02:36,119
facility these types of programs and

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,080
cultivation we discuss in this podcast

71
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,200
have an average cost on a commercial

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,319
scale of 1 to 5 cents per gram or under

73
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:46,839
$5 a pound by the second year that's for

74
00:02:44,318 --> 00:02:48,759
both your media and nutrients along with

75
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:51,039
the added benefit of reduced labor

76
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:53,079
inputs we have been working with Growers

77
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:55,239
now who have been reusing the same soil

78
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,040
for over 5 years and getting really

79
00:02:55,239 --> 00:02:59,280
consistent yields over 2 pounds per

80
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:01,759
light indoors and commanding top dollar

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,640
in dispens iies and stores we have a

82
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,399
couple of talented Growers who have even

83
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:09,238
gotten over 3 lb per light or 60 G per

84
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,239
square foot and while some of what we do

85
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,200
is proprietary like our soil mix recipes

86
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,120
my goal with this podcast is to get as

87
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,679
much information out to Growers as

88
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,920
possible so everyone can save money be

89
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,080
more sustainable and organic without

90
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:24,439
sacrificing plant health and yield now

91
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,159
to give you a little background on

92

nutrients compost tea supplies and soil

125
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,639
amendments this all came about because I

126
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:51,000
grew up with my parents running a Retail

127
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
Nursery Landscape Company I was always

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,560
around plants and forced to work Long

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,080
Summers as a laborer for the maintenance

130
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,759
and construction Crews it was tough work

131
00:04:57,079 --> 00:05:01,120
and while I learned a lot from hands-on

132
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:03,240
experience it wasn't something I really

133
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,319
enjoyed I went off to college at the

134
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,759
University of Washington and wasn't

135
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:09,759
really interested in horiculture after

136
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,199
undergrad I went back to school at

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,160
mcquary University in Sydney Australia

138
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:16,639
to pursue a master's degree in special

139
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,479
education when I got out of school my

140
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,960
parents had sold the nursery business

141
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,879
and my father had started a business

142
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:24,839
making compost tea brewing systems I

143
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,399
tried a few odd jobs but ultimately

144
00:05:24,839 --> 00:05:28,679
decided to come back and help my father

145
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,599
with running the compost tea business it

146
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,439
was a new industry and he had just

147
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,560
finished conducting experiments with Dr

148
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:36,600
Elaine Ingam of soil food web and

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,199
determining such things as optimal Brew

150
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,039
length dissolved oxygen levels and if

151
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,400
pathogens like eoli could survive the

152
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,879
Brewing process it was a fun time

153
00:05:43,399 --> 00:05:46,799
because it was a really a brand new

154
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,759
industry and anyone with a bit of

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
patience and a microscope could test out

156
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,000
their own theories and further the body

157
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,359
of knowledge around this

158
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,918
technology I went to hear people like Dr

159
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:58,319
Ingam and Jeff Lenell speak and read

160
00:05:56,918 --> 00:06:00,719
everything I could on the topic to

161
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,039
educate myself having just finished grad

162
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,600
school where I was forced to read

163
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:05,839
peer-reviewed Journal articles and

164
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,280
studies all day was a great background

165
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:09,439
for waiting through the information

166
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:11,559
available on the internet through this

167
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:13,160
process I got to know Jeff personally

168
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,360
and also met a gentleman named Tim

169
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,199
Wilson who at the time was also active

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,759
in the Yahoo group on compost tea that

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,680
Jeff moderated he was only a few hours

172
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,319
north of me in Vancouver Canada and

173
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,319
actually took the time to come down and

174
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,319
teach me how to best identify these

175
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,240
microorganisms and really use the

176
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:31,479
microscope he taught me to challenge

177
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:33,280
conven beliefs and not just accept

178
00:06:31,478 --> 00:06:36,240
something as fact just because an expert

179
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,959
happened to say so during his week visit

180
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
we conducted a variety of experiments

181
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:41,918
that I still reference today regarding

182
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,240
humic acids and compost tees Brewing

183
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:47,038
lengths various microbial products and

184
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,960
much more over the past 15 years I've

185
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:50,478
been so fortunate to meet a lot of

186
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,478
really intelligent and passionate

187
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:54,000
individuals who have furthered my own

188
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,719
knowledge and I felt like it was

189
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,519
important to create a platform to share

190
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,080
this information more publicly

191
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:02,120
especially in the Cannabis world I

192
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:05,198
remember my first time seeing a cannabis

193
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:07,000
plan it was almost a mystical experience

194
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,800
I was visiting a friend and he took me

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,959
down into his basement and all of my

196
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,199
senses were overwhelmed the lights were

197
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:15,038
way too bright the humidity was super

198
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,000
high and the smell coming out of the

199
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:19,719
room was so intense much of what he told

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,199
me about his growing process seemed to

201
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,599
clash with what I had learned from my

202
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,038
parents from growing up around the

203
00:07:22,598 --> 00:07:27,279
nursery and in our own Greenhouse why

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:29,680
were we throwing away the soil what were

205
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:31,318
these fancy bottles I'd never heard of

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,319
I'd never seen them before at a garden

207
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:35,400
center and rather than being a plain

208
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:37,598
label with an ingredient list they had

209
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:40,318
cartoonish figures of monster plants or

210
00:07:37,598 --> 00:07:43,439
girls and bikinis I was blown

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:45,158
away now while all of this was going on

212
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,120
I had done some searches for aided

213
00:07:45,158 --> 00:07:48,879
compost te on Google and the two

214
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,478
websites that really stood out to me

215
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,919
were one on cannabis called IC mag where

216
00:07:51,478 --> 00:07:56,360
I joined the organic soil Forum as CT

217
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,478
guy the other was a giant pumpkin Forum

218
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,199
called bigpumpkins.com where I joined

219
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:02,000
using my real name

220
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,280
these two groups of Growers growing

221
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,879
entirely different plants both had a

222
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:07,959
passion that went beyond what I was used

223
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:09,639
to seeing from backyard gardeners and

224
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:12,000
were're really pushing the envelope in

225
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:14,038
regards to plant size and yield giant

226
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,720
pumpkin Growers for example start with a

227
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:18,839
seed in the spring and finish in the

228
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,639
fall with a pumpkin over 2,000 lb at the

229
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:22,239
time of this recording the current world

230
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,918
record is

231
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,000
2,624 lbs but let me back up again it

232
00:08:25,918 --> 00:08:29,918
was about 10 years ago that I went to a

233
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,918
hydro shop in Portland Oregon with my

234
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,439
microscope to give a talk on air rated

235
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,478
compost teas I must have posted

236
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,120
something on IC mag about it because

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,879
Clackamus Co showed up I got to meet him

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,440
in person and we started talking about

239
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,200
soils this really sparked my interest as

240
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,560
to how we could develop soils that were

241
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,839
more sustainable without sacrificing

242
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,199
plant quality and yield through many

243
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:54,560
long phone conversations he was able to

244
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,480
help guide me in regards to ingredients

245
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:59,479
ratios and sourcing amendments so I

246
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
could nail down the best inputs as I was

247
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,519
just beginning to experiment with soil

248
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,039
recipes and testing a guy by the name of

249
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,078
G Palmer stopped by he had done a bunch

250
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:09,799
of Internet research regarding compost

251
00:09:08,078 --> 00:09:11,719
teas and found that we were one of the

252
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:14,039
few companies doing microscope work and

253
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,399
lab testing and happened to be local

254
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:18,319
when he showed up I was literally mixing

255
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,519
my very first batch of our water only

256
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,839
soil mix in the driveway in one of those

257
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:24,639
compost tumblers and after talking for a

258
00:09:22,839 --> 00:09:26,600
bit we hid it off and I gave him some

259
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,519
soil to take home and try out with his

260
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,480
plants now prior to this Jai had tried

261
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,879
just about every line of organic bottled

262
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:36,159
nutrients out there he was a Botanicare

263
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:38,600
user at the time but also doing compost

264
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:40,559
te's and other nutrient applications

265
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,839
after growing a plant in my soil and

266
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,919
just using water where he got comparable

267
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:47,640
yields for Less work and nutrient cost

268
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:49,439
he was sold on the process from there we

269
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,759
worked hand inhand in refining the

270
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,240
process doing lab testing on successive

271
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:56,879
grows to determine optimal levels for re

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,639
amending the soil with his help we were

273
00:09:56,879 --> 00:10:00,759
able to keep the same soil in production

274
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:02,360
for a number of years I'm looking

275
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:04,639
forward to having ji on the show here

276
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,399
soon to tell his story as he is a wealth

277
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,240
of information and one of the smartest

278
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,679
and most passionate Growers I've ever

279
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,959
met so that's a little history about me

280
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:14,239
and my

281
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:15,799
background so what's the basis of our

282
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,399
gardening practices that make them

283
00:10:15,799 --> 00:10:19,719
different than conventional growing

284
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,839
techniques well for starters I think we

285
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:24,680
need to look at cannabis as a high value

286
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,560
agricultural crop and treat it as such

287
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:28,799
sure it's an amazing plant with many

288
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:30,199
medicinal and recreational properties

289
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:32,479
but that does doesn't mean we need to

290
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,680
ignore the existing Body Of Agricultural

291
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,240
and Horticultural research like much of

292
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:37,159
the bottled nutrient marketing would

293
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,039
have you

294
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:41,639
believe one thing all good Farmers know

295
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:44,519
is that their soil is their most

296
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:46,039
important asset without good soil you'll

297
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:48,078
be constantly battling nutrient

298
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,639
deficiencies and disease problems as the

299
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,759
plant won't be healthy enough to fight

300
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:55,360
off insects fungal pathogens and other

301
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:57,078
pests there's no reason we can't be more

302
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,680
sustainable with our growing methods and

303
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,559
save money in the process so here's the

304
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,638
foundation of our growing process it's

305
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:06,159
really quite simple you start with a

306
00:11:03,639 --> 00:11:07,959
good base media that means investing in

307
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:10,719
your soil mix because you'll be using it

308
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:12,479
for years to come with a good soil mix

309
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,320
that's chalk full of nutrients and good

310
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:16,680
beneficial biology your plant is going

311
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
to get off to a much better start then

312
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,719
as simple as adding a micro risal

313
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,799
inoculant when planting your rooted

314
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:23,680
clone and then just using water or a

315
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:25,199
light nutrient solution because most of

316
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,599
the nutrients will be in the soil since

317
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,278
we're using a premium mix once you're

318
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,000
done vegging your plant you can move the

319
00:11:29,278 --> 00:11:32,439
plants into your flower room and

320
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,078
preferably you would have raised beds in

321
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:36,079
your flower room there's so many

322
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:38,759
advantage to this that it makes it well

323
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:41,120
worth the setup one they give plants

324
00:11:38,759 --> 00:11:43,519
Roots access to more soil and also most

325
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,399
more space to spread out by doing this

326
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,480
root space is no longer a limiting

327
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,399
factor for growth have you ever grown

328
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:51,320
two plants side by side with one in a

329
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:53,078
container and one in the ground I have

330
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,200
mulberry trees in our Nursery right now

331
00:11:53,078 --> 00:11:57,359
that bend in containers for 3 years

332
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:58,920
they're about 3 to 4 feet in height and

333
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,680
the one I planted in the ground at the

334
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,919
same time we got the other ones in is

335
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:06,239
now over 10t tall it really does make a

336
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:08,319
difference uh two they make a lot of

337
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,919
sense if we plan on reusing the soil

338
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,879
because watering becomes so much easier

339
00:12:10,919 --> 00:12:14,559
I have a future podcast on Blue Mets

340
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:16,078
with the North American distributor so I

341
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:17,799
won't spend too much time on it right

342
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:19,719
now but you can literally hook up a

343
00:12:17,799 --> 00:12:21,359
soaker hose or drippers around the beds

344
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,560
that will maintain the moisture content

345
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,560
in the soil perfectly without any human

346
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:27,359
intervention not only does this save a

347
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:29,399
ton of money on labor but it also

348
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,278
reduces the total amount of water using

349
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:33,958
and eliminates those wet dry Cycles in

350
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,958
the soil that slow down plant growth I

351
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,039
can't emphasize enough how important

352
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,879
proper watering is and it's so much

353
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:41,480
easier in a large container or bed to

354
00:12:39,879 --> 00:12:43,600
water properly than it is in a small

355
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,240
container especially as the plant starts

356
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,959
to become root bound and then three when

357
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,680
you're done growing you can literally

358
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:52,078
just pull out the plant roots and shake

359
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,759
off any soil back into the beds then

360
00:12:52,078 --> 00:12:55,638
after harvesting your plant you'll mix

361
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:58,480
back in about half of one of our regular

362
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,278
nutrient pths per yard of soil along

363
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,399
with a cubic foot of compost and you're

364
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:05,039
up and running again 24 hours later with

365
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,839
your next flowering crop now every other

366
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,919
cycle you'll probably want to add in a

367
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:11,040
little bit of Iration in the form of

368
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:13,159
pmus or perlite or lava rock but it's

369
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:15,360
really that simple in fact some of our

370
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:17,039
Growers don't even pull the roots but

371
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,039
just let but just cut the base of the

372
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:21,159
plant and Transplant next to it letting

373
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,599
the roots break down in the next

374
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:25,879
cycle other considerations to this

375
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,839
growing growing type are that you don't

376
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:30,519
need to pH any of your nutrient teas or

377
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:33,519
Solutions or pH your water provided it's

378
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:35,839
not at a crazy pH to start with good

379
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,360
organic soil has amazing buffering

380
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,959
capacity you can remove the chlorine but

381
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,879
we've even run test grows with straight

382
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:43,719
City tap water and the plants perform

383
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:47,000
great the goal here is really to

384
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:49,079
simplify the entire garding process as

385
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,639
for other nutrients you can use well we

386
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,000
typically like to make our own nutrient

387
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,680
teas out of things like seaweed extract

388
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:59,720
powder uh unsulfured black strp molasses

389
00:13:56,679 --> 00:14:01,799
kelp meal humic acids fish hydraulic at

390
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:04,360
or wildcrafted plant tees using things

391
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:06,120
like comfrey or horsetail or nettles in

392
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:08,039
addition you can make arated compost

393
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:10,120
tees to increase biological diversity

394
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:11,559
and biomass in your soil and we will

395
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:13,720
cover these topics in further depth

396
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:15,239
throughout the podcast series and have

397
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,519
experts talking on these subjects so I

398
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,799
don't want to spend a lot of time on it

399
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:20,639
right now but you can even use your

400
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:22,399
current bottled nutrient program

401
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:24,399
provided it's organic as long as you go

402
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,559
with very light doses you see you don't

403
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,159
want to put any of too much nutrient

404
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:30,799
into the soil because that can create

405
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:32,679
excesses or efficiencies over time and a

406
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:34,639
simple soil test will allow us to view

407
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:37,278
these and make uh the proper

408
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,839
recommendations or changes to our soil

409
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:42,399
to maintain it at optimal levels year

410
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,000
after year and while it's not my

411
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,078
preferred method of growing we are

412
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,120
seeing some uh chem Growers using our

413
00:14:46,078 --> 00:14:49,519
soil and getting better growth and yield

414
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,720
but they are then throwing out the soil

415
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,600
and starting over every cycle you can

416
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,040
check out green Rush on Instagram if you

417
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,519
want to see what that looks like they

418
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,039
have some phenomenally greatl looking

419
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,919
plants uh if you want want to see what a

420
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:03,519
autoflowers look like in this type of

421
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,519
method with the soil you can check out

422
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,360
Alaska Autoflower he's got a really good

423
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,679
Instagram feed as well now if you turn

424
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:12,639
to the giant pumpkin Community which is

425
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:14,319
the other set of fanatic Growers that

426
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,198
like to push the envelope in regards to

427
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:19,560
yield you'll see that they were growing

428
00:15:16,198 --> 00:15:22,120
with just chemical nutrients um up until

429
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:23,679
I'd say the early 2000s and the records

430
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,560
world records were topping out around

431
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:28,599
1,000 to 1200 lb then they started

432
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:30,479
incorporating back in some organic

433
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:33,159
methods and products like micro risal

434
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,800
fungi and compost teas and that in

435
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:37,360
conjunction with ever improving genetics

436
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:40,078
they have gotten the world record over

437
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,199
2,600 lbs right now it's amazing they

438
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,758
can go from seed to Giant pumpkin in a

439
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:45,958
matter of months and get that kind of

440
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,278
growth you can literally see the pumpkin

441
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:51,318
grow on a daily

442
00:15:48,278 --> 00:15:53,078
basis uh in fact my favorite micro risal

443
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:55,360
inoculant right now comes out of the

444
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:57,078
giant pumpkin Community uh it's by a

445
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,480
former world record holder it's called

446
00:15:57,078 --> 00:16:03,039
wow pumpkin Pro and and it's uh it's

447
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,039
sold by Ron Wallace uh we have it on our

448
00:16:03,039 --> 00:16:07,078
website it's the right species for most

449
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:09,278
vegetables but also fruit trees and

450
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,000
cannabis I have a great blog post on

451
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,198
micro risal fungus if you want to learn

452
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,159
more as well as our very first podcast

453
00:16:13,198 --> 00:16:16,799
interview is with Jeff lowenfels who

454
00:16:15,159 --> 00:16:19,719
wrote an entire book on the subject

455
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:21,278
recently called teaming with fungi so

456
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,319
this is the outline of what the podcast

457
00:16:21,278 --> 00:16:25,318
is all about we've got some amazing

458
00:16:23,318 --> 00:16:27,559
guests lined up so far on a wide variety

459
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:30,198
of topics I've worked hard to Source the

460
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,399
very best information on these subjects

461
00:16:30,198 --> 00:16:33,879
and make sure that it was all

462
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:35,078
science-based and available to Growers

463
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,480
though if you know of anyone that you

464
00:16:35,078 --> 00:16:38,318
think I should interview please have

465
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,199
them contact me through the website and

466
