hi Robert welcome to the show Good

48
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,439
Morning Tad nice to be here yes so let's

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,759
start off uh with a little bit of your

50
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,280
background can you tell me a little bit

51
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,039
about yourself and how you got into this

52
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,120
industry okay um I'm an analytical

53
00:02:14,039 --> 00:02:19,519
chemist and um I used to work for an

54
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,000
analytical instrumentation company I

55
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:24,920
work for them for 25 years I started off

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,919
in the UK and then they transferred me

57
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:30,318
to the US in the late

58
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:33,839
1980s and my speciality was in Atomic

59
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:36,039
and mass spectroscopy which is basically

60
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,598
an instrumental technique that measures

61
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:42,359
small amounts of Trace metals or heavy

62
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:46,199
metals in anything um so that was my

63
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:49,319
background and um I became a an

64
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:51,079
application scientist for them where I

65
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:52,958
traveled all over the world talking

66
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,879
about the technique and particularly

67
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,920
talking about the benefits of using the

68
00:02:56,878 --> 00:03:01,479
instrumentation um that I was trained on

69
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,559
the company was called perk and Elmer

70
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:04,719
and they were one of the largest

71
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,319
instrument companies in the world at

72
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:11,439
that time anyway um I took an early

73
00:03:09,318 --> 00:03:15,079
retirement package in the early 2000s I

74
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:17,919
worked for them for almost 25 years and

75
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,840
um not that not that I wanted to change

76
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:22,518
but I felt that it was the right time

77
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,799
the the the retirement package was very

78
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,920
attractive so I decided to leave that

79
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,120
company and Venture into the world on my

80
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:33,759
own and I found the world of science

81
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,959
writing um I used to write a lot of

82
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:38,598
papers and application

83
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:40,239
reports um on the technique that I

84
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:43,759
specialized in so I had a lot of

85
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,200
editorial contacts out there so I tapped

86
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:50,598
into those and um I found out that there

87
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:53,839
was a demand for me for someone who

88
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:56,759
spent uh almost 25 years working in

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,759
these techniques but also I spent a lot

90
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,000
of time

91
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:02,598
writing so um I found out there was a

92
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,840
demand for me as a freelance science

93
00:04:02,598 --> 00:04:08,158
writer which I was a little bit shocked

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:12,000
but uh I took advantage of it and my

95
00:04:08,158 --> 00:04:15,158
first big project was a tutorial series

96
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,238
on icpms icpms is the most widely used

97
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:22,560
traced element technique in the Cannabis

98
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:24,879
industry um and um it's a technique that

99
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,918
I've been working on working in for the

100
00:04:24,879 --> 00:04:30,240
past 40 years having actually cut my

101
00:04:27,918 --> 00:04:32,959
teeth on the first commercial

102
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:36,439
icpms ever ever built in

103
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:39,079
1983 anyway um they were interested in a

104
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:42,639
tutorial series for for beginners so

105
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:44,680
they called it a beginner guide to icpms

106
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,360
and I got a nice contract where I wrote

107
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,879
an article every month and it turned out

108
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,960
to be a 15-part tutorial series that

109
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,240
kind of put me on the map which was

110
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:58,799
great as as a freelance writer you

111
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:02,038
obviously like credibility and uh and

112
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,759
recognition so that led to a lot of

113
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:05,759
other gigs a lot of other writing

114
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:11,080
projects which was which was wonderful

115
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:15,199
for me um and then um I was um you know

116
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:17,560
happy doing that um when someone okay a

117
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,280
colleague of mine said you know that

118
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,800
tutorial series that you wrote that

119
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:24,038
would make a wonderful book or it would

120
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,280
make the start of a wonderful book so

121
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:30,759
they put me in touch with a book

122
00:05:26,279 --> 00:05:32,198
publisher and um we discussed it and um

123
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,038
they said yeah we we'd be very

124
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,080
interested in publishing something like

125
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:41,240
this so I realized that it probably

126
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:43,359
wasn't enough on its own so um I spent

127
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,240
the next six months deciding what would

128
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,000
be included in my first book and not

129
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,400
only the fundamentals but I wanted to

130
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,680
talk about um the applications of the

131
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,478
technique I wanted to talk about what

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,000
was important for beginners for novices

133
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:02,599
so the the the goal was to write a book

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,399
which was which was focused on novice

135
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:09,120
users so in

136
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:11,519
2004 um I started that it took me about

137
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,680
another 12 months and the book came out

138
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,799
in 2005 and that was called a practical

139
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:19,079
guide to

140
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,319
icpms it has since led to four editions

141
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:24,478
um the most recent one has just been

142
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,160
published in September of this year so

143
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:30,879
um that gave me a lot of opportunities

144
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,439
and it led me to become a lot more you

145
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,839
know recognized in the field in the

146
00:06:33,439 --> 00:06:39,279
interim period um in between writing

147
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:40,758
different additions for this one book um

148
00:06:39,279 --> 00:06:44,598
I was doing a lot of work for the

149
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:47,120
American Chemical Society and I I led

150
00:06:44,598 --> 00:06:50,399
the heavy metal Task Force at the

151
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:53,000
analytical reagent committee for the ACs

152
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:57,079
so that put me in contact with the

153
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,120
pharmaceutical industry because um our

154
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:02,159
specifications and guidelines for re

155
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,680
aent chemicals were widely used by

156
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,080
pharmaceutical

157
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,199
manufacturers and at that time United

158
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:12,680
States pharmac was going through the

159
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,598
process of updating its heavy metal test

160
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,918
the heavy metal test which was used by

161
00:07:14,598 --> 00:07:20,038
United States

162
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:23,359
fapia and the ACs was a colorometric

163
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:25,680
precipitation method for doing lead and

164
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,720
other heavy metals and it was very time

165
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,478
consuming and it relied on the color um

166
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:35,639
of a precipitate which was developed by

167
00:07:32,478 --> 00:07:39,038
adding a sulfide chemical

168
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:43,079
unfortunately it was very user dependent

169
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:46,158
and it was not very sensitive so USP was

170
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:48,878
looking for a more sensitive test and

171
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:51,759
they decided that it would require a

172
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:56,639
test using plasma spectr chemistry which

173
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:59,479
was my speciality so um in in late in

174
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,680
the late 1990s USP together with with

175
00:07:59,478 --> 00:08:04,800
the help of the American Chemical

176
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,400
Society um sat down together to write a

177
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,280
brand new method for doing heavy metals

178
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:14,679
in Pharmaceuticals and I was intimately

179
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:19,359
involved with that process and then in

180
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:22,560
2018 um both the ACs and USP came up

181
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,120
with a standardized method using ICP

182
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,158
Optical emission and ICP Mass

183
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,720
spectroscopy um which was approved by

184
00:08:28,158 --> 00:08:36,479
the FDA so that came out in 2018 and I

185
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,240
was involved in that process and um at

186
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,479
that time um it was a lot of hard work

187
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,639
because uh the pharmaceutical industry

188
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,200
had never used these techniques before

189
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,360
so they didn't particularly want to

190
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:51,080
change their

191
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,680
methodology um but United States um

192
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,519
Pharmaca and the

193
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:58,958
FDA uh decided that they could not use a

194
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,320
colorometric test for carrying out a

195
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,639
very precise and accurate measurement of

196
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,600
heavy metals in

197
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:06,799
Pharmaceuticals anyway um as I mentioned

198
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,240
that came out in

199
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:10,559
2018 and that's when a colleague of mine

200
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,079
at United States

201
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:16,319
pharmacopia said you should you should

202
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:18,078
take a look at the at the Cannabis

203
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,920
industry because they are in a very

204
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:24,719
similar situation that they don't really

205
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:27,439
understand sources of heavy metals um I

206
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,399
I was very honored at that time to be to

207
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,320
actually um work with the United States

208
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,159
pharmacopia and write another textbook

209
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,720
which was measuring Elemental impurities

210
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:38,078
in pharmaceutical materials so that came

211
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,040
out in

212
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:43,399
2019 so again that gave me a lot of

213
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:47,120
visibility to the pharmaceutical

214
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:49,440
Community anyway um in 2019 that's when

215
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,399
I ventured into the Cannabis industry

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:55,320
started talking to lots of people trying

217
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,360
to understand where they were coming

218
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,320
from what they were doing and just

219
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,480
learning to talk to cannabis users into

220
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:05,640
the Cannabis industry about what was

221
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,680
important to them and I realized that

222
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:11,159
there was a lot of ignorance a lot of

223
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,039
navity and I thought I could really help

224
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:14,159
and

225
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,120
so in

226
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:20,078
2019 I started the process of beginning

227
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:21,679
to understand what was required and I

228
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:25,239
quickly realized that there was an

229
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:27,239
opportunity to write another book and um

230
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:30,000
I took that opportunity and 12 months

231
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,159
later I came out with another book

232
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,320
measuring Elemental contaminants in in

233
00:10:33,159 --> 00:10:38,639
cannabis and hemp and that put me on the

234
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,040
road of then writing a lot of

235
00:10:38,639 --> 00:10:45,600
educational material for the industry so

236
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:48,958
um cut a long story short that led me to

237
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:51,600
getting to understand the the demands of

238
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:54,078
the industry and really using my

239
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,040
knowledge and expertise to write

240
00:10:54,078 --> 00:11:01,519
educational material um give talks

241
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:03,360
um really do as did as much as I could

242
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,399
to really help the

243
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:08,440
industry understand that they probably

244
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,399
could be doing better so that brought me

245
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,000
to that brought me to um getting

246
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:18,278
requests to do lots of interviews and

247
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,919
podcasts and um chair symposiums and uh

248
00:11:18,278 --> 00:11:22,838
you know that's where I am today and I'm

249
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:25,319
sorry for the for the for the longwinded

250
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:27,959
response but uh my journey has been

251
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:31,760
pretty long but quite

252
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:33,599
adventurous oh that's wonderful and I I

253
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,759
I agree with you this is an area that we

254
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,278
don't have a lot of information as an

255
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,519
industry and I'm really excited to talk

256
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:43,720
to you about lab testing and also

257
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:46,120
cultivation and extraction but I want to

258
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,480
back up just a little bit um so as

259
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:51,519
someone with a chemistry background uh

260
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,680
why why is this so important in the

261
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,078
first place because these regulations

262
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,159
kind of Hit the Cannabis industry and

263
00:11:56,078 --> 00:11:59,958
like we all understand that lead's bad

264
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:02,278
everyone's heard of the the Flint Water

265
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:05,559
Crisis but why is it so important that

266
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:08,399
we're measuring and and regulating these

267
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:12,039
heavy metals in in our final

268
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,720
product well um I learned very early on

269
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,759
that cannabis and hemp are hyper

270
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,440
accumulators they've been used for

271
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:21,078
decades to clean up contaminated soil

272
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,320
and contaminated land you might be aware

273
00:12:21,078 --> 00:12:26,958
that um Industrial Hemp was used to

274
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:31,160
clean up Chernobyl after the nuclear

275
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:34,159
accident in two in 198 6 so um as an

276
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:37,759
analytical chemist I knew that I knew

277
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:40,039
that certain plants have been used for

278
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:42,198
remediation I wasn't that familiar with

279
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:44,879
cannabis and hemp but I soon learned

280
00:12:42,198 --> 00:12:47,919
getting into the industry that here's a

281
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:50,799
crop here's a plant that is used to

282
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,719
clean up contaminated soil of heavy

283
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:57,559
metals um you know radio nucleid

284
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,759
isotopic um Isotopes which are um you

285
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:02,479
know been have been generating ated by

286
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:04,799
nuclear fusion and nuclear accidents and

287
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,159
nuclear waste but here's a plant that

288
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:09,078
was also been

289
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:11,198
used you know to produce cannaboids

290
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:14,359
which were being used for medicinal and

291
00:13:11,198 --> 00:13:17,078
for recreational purposes so I thought

292
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,759
hey um this doesn't quite compute you

293
00:13:17,078 --> 00:13:22,519
surely there must be you there must be a

294
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:25,639
process to make sure that hemp and

295
00:13:22,519 --> 00:13:28,839
Canabis that's grown for cannaboid

296
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:32,240
production is not going to be planted in

297
00:13:28,839 --> 00:13:34,680
in soil or land which could potentially

298
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,440
be contaminated with some kind of

299
00:13:34,679 --> 00:13:40,838
industrial pollution now I found out

300
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,760
early on that a lot of the Cannabis I'm

301
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:45,680
not so much hemper cannabis back in the

302
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:48,439
early days was grown indoors was grown

303
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:51,078
in indoors facilities where the growing

304
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,800
environment is far more controlled um

305
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:55,439
you know Hydroponics were one of the

306
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:58,879
processes that was used um but also to

307
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,560
use grow medium where you could control

308
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:04,360
what was in in the material in the

309
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:06,958
product so back in the early days heavy

310
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:09,879
metal contamination was not such a huge

311
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:13,599
problem um but then when hemp became

312
00:14:09,879 --> 00:14:16,679
legal to grow um people started talking

313
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:21,959
about planting acres and acres of hemp

314
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:23,599
in land and um um areas of the US where

315
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:26,399
you know where there might be a lot of

316
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:30,480
industrial activity and certain in many

317
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:32,320
areas of the western part of the us um

318
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,600
you know the nuclear industry in

319
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
certainly uh areas which have been used

320
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,040
for mining of of gold and silver where

321
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:42,720
there might be

322
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:47,599
contamination um you know so so there

323
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:51,079
didn't seem to be any diligent um

324
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,600
diligent way of finding out where there

325
00:14:51,078 --> 00:14:57,879
was contamination and um when hemp

326
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:01,560
became legal um back four or five years

327
00:14:57,879 --> 00:15:04,480
ago um there didn't seem to be any real

328
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:05,758
interest in finding out was there any

329
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,399
industrial

330
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:11,680
contamination in that you know in that

331
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,159
particular soil so I felt that here was

332
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:16,838
here was something which was potentially

333
00:15:14,159 --> 00:15:19,120
going to be a huge huge problem so you

334
00:15:16,839 --> 00:15:22,440
know so that's when I started getting

335
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:25,240
involved in it um because it was

336
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:28,079
potentially something where I had a lot

337
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,278
of experience in working in those

338
00:15:28,078 --> 00:15:31,838
Industries

339
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,639
to use my techniques to better

340
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:38,199
understand how soil is contaminated and

341
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:40,278
in what way it can be cleaned up so you

342
00:15:38,198 --> 00:15:43,120
know that got me really interested in a

343
00:15:40,278 --> 00:15:46,000
in a in an industry where there was no

344
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:49,879
real there you know there was no there

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:53,000
was no real um way to find out if hemp

346
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:54,799
was being grown Outdoors whether that

347
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,839
particular so or that particular

348
00:15:54,799 --> 00:16:02,000
contaminate land had been contaminated

349
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,000
from any any previous industrial

350
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:07,159
use yeah and I just want to highlight

351
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:10,240
for listeners that there's a lot of

352
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,958
research out there in terms of I I see

353
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,399
primarily around lead and arsenic

354
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:19,239
relating to neurological disorders birth

355
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:21,519
effects um and other major fairly

356
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,360
catastrophic health effects associated

357
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,399
with consumption or exposure to these

358
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:29,159
heavy metals um is that anything that

359
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:32,720
you want to touch on before iow sure

360
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:35,879
yeah um yeah I you know I think it I

361
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:37,759
think it's fair to say that um that you

362
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:38,919
know that we've known about the

363
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:41,759
potential

364
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:45,278
contamination of all Heavy I mean not

365
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,480
only heavy metals but transition metals

366
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:50,600
um you know radio nucleid um you know

367
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,639
lots of metals from the all the

368
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:56,759
industrial processes that have occurred

369
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:59,639
in the US over the past few decades and

370
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,480
certainly having a lot of experience in

371
00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,400
the environmental field in the clinical

372
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,160
toxicology field um we knew as

373
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,720
analytical chemists that were

374
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:12,959
specializing in heavy metal

375
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,160
contamination um that there were that

376
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,880
that that there were ways to minimize

377
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:22,038
the uptake of heavy metals um but it was

378
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:25,640
you know tended to be cost prohibitive I

379
00:17:22,038 --> 00:17:28,640
mean we know based on um food plants

380
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:31,559
that are that are that that are grown in

381
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,280
areas where there might be environmental

382
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:36,759
pollution from uh you know a power plant

383
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:41,119
or maybe a steel works that there's the

384
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:44,079
potential to absorb heavy metals into

385
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:46,678
any um any food crops that are grown you

386
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:49,240
know not just root crops but any any

387
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:52,679
kind of um any kind of vegetable or

388
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,159
fruit um if it's in the soil it will

389
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,798
find its way into the plant into the

390
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,320
root into the fruit into what you know

391
00:17:57,798 --> 00:18:03,519
whatever is planted nearby so there are

392
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:06,279
you know there are ways of minimizing

393
00:18:03,519 --> 00:18:09,119
that uptake obviously um you you you

394
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:12,798
know you got to understand the heavy

395
00:18:09,119 --> 00:18:15,719
metals or the you know the contaminated

396
00:18:12,798 --> 00:18:18,158
land but um you know there are Min there

397
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,759
there are ways to minimize the uptake of

398
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,280
heavy metals into our food source but it

399
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:25,279
but there didn't seem to be a way the

400
00:18:23,279 --> 00:18:28,960
Cannabis industry the Cannabis and hemp

401
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:30,678
industry didn't seem to

402
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,319
I I wouldn't say they wouldn't okay they

403
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:36,679
weren't concerned but they but they kind

404
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:38,679
of um they you know they kind of felt

405
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,840
that um maybe

406
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,880
[Music]

407
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:47,240
um you know the process of of a of a of

408
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:51,440
hemp or cannabis um absorbing that heavy

409
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:53,519
metal um if it's if it's planted in uh

410
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,400
sort of clean soil which is away from

411
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,519
any industrial activities you know there

412
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,240
was a good chance uh that you know the

413
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:04,440
uptake wouldn't be that serious but I

414
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,440
think I think we found um with a number

415
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:10,759
of different crops if they're planted

416
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:12,640
near any industrial sites um there's you

417
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,000
know there's there there is a good

418
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,559
chance there could be a certain amount

419
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,519
of heavy metal uptake into that plant

420
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:22,839
whether it's a root vegetable or whether

421
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:26,119
it's a fruit U you know or um you know

422
00:19:22,839 --> 00:19:29,319
or whatever it is but I I think I think

423
00:19:26,119 --> 00:19:31,439
it's fair to say that when the Cannabis

424
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:36,038
when the Cannabis and hemp industry came

425
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:38,919
along there didn't seem to be um there

426
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:41,759
didn't seem to be a way of making sure

427
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:44,120
that the land where it was being planted

428
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:47,359
was free of environmental contamination

429
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:49,678
particularly the heavy metals so um yeah

430
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:52,359
I you know I think it's fair to say that

431
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:56,798
many industries were concerned about

432
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:58,439
heavy metal uptake um but it it it

433
00:19:56,798 --> 00:20:00,720
didn't seem to be serious at that that

434
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:03,480
time but here was an industry that was

435
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,240
not really doing any diligent homework

436
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:07,919
about heavy metals that might be

437
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,038
resident in the soil where where where

438
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,520
it was being

439
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:13,720
planted yes so I have a question that

440
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:16,240
kind of leads into one of the questions

441
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:18,798
I have that I get a lot from Growers and

442
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,839
I think it's a fair question

443
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:24,038
um you know what level of risk do you

444
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:26,879
personally associate with cannabis being

445
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:30,519
that it's a hyper accumulator of metals

446
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:34,200
compared to vegetables tobacco our water

447
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:37,359
um Leed gasoline from small aircraft uh

448
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:39,159
and environmental factors around uh all

449
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:41,719
the leaded gasoline we used to use back

450
00:20:39,159 --> 00:20:43,440
in the 80s and 90s or just all the other

451
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:47,200
things that we're exposed to on a daily

452
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:50,080
basis is it fair that this testing is

453
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,640
coming coming in so tight on cannabis

454
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:54,918
relative to all these other Industries

455
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,600
and and exposure

456
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:59,960
risk um you know I mean that's a really

457
00:20:57,599 --> 00:21:01,399
good question I think it's fair to say

458
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,279
that

459
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:07,000
um that the that the Cannabis industry

460
00:21:04,279 --> 00:21:10,359
exploded um I mean I came into it four

461
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,679
years ago but uh um having talked to

462
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:15,959
people who were in the industry way

463
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:18,480
before me um there was not a great deal

464
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,798
of thought that went into sort of heavy

465
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,759
metal contamination and

466
00:21:20,798 --> 00:21:27,400
historically um you know United States

467
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:30,640
pharmac Capia was responsible for um you

468
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,960
know certainly responsible for

469
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:36,200
pharmaceuticals and um you know

470
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:39,840
Pharmaceuticals are regulated by the FDA

471
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:43,840
obviously and um it took a it took a

472
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:46,519
long time for the pharmaceutical

473
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:49,798
industry to come up with any meaningful

474
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:50,679
regulations and I think it's fair to say

475
00:21:49,798 --> 00:21:54,200
that

476
00:21:50,679 --> 00:21:56,640
when um when the FDA got involved with

477
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,720
regulating Pharmaceuticals um

478
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,440
particularly for heavy metals

479
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,960
I don't think they were aware that they

480
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,880
that they didn't really consider that

481
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:10,600
heavy metals was a potential problem but

482
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,278
I think as the pharmaceutical industry

483
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:16,480
realized that there are that there are

484
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:19,480
many pharmaceutical which are which are

485
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,640
derived from products which are grown um

486
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,360
which are planted um you know

487
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:26,799
particularly nutriceuticals and dietary

488
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,678
supplements and I think they they then

489
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:32,240
took a vested interest

490
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:34,400
in understanding heavy metals and um you

491
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,759
know United States pharmacopia when they

492
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,720
first came out with uh you know methods

493
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:40,640
for

494
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:44,278
pharmaceuticals um came up with a a a

495
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:47,038
method for 24 Elemental impurities and

496
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:49,919
initially when they were just monitoring

497
00:22:47,038 --> 00:22:52,278
a small group of heavy metals basically

498
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,120
lead was the only was the only heavy

499
00:22:52,278 --> 00:22:58,278
metal they were interested in but I

500
00:22:54,119 --> 00:23:00,599
think they soon realized that when your

501
00:22:58,278 --> 00:23:03,519
producing Pharmaceuticals particularly

502
00:23:00,599 --> 00:23:07,038
Pharmaceuticals which might be made from

503
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:09,720
products that are grown um there is the

504
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,679
likelihood of finding a whole slew of

505
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,679
heavy metals in them so that's why it

506
00:23:12,679 --> 00:23:17,559
took them about 25 years to go from

507
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:20,038
basically monitoring one heavy metal

508
00:23:17,558 --> 00:23:25,119
lead to eventually monitoring

509
00:23:20,038 --> 00:23:27,519
24 and um so I think I think the um the

510
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,399
Cannabis industry had a model that they

511
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:32,679
could that they could follow

512
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:37,559
Unfortunately they did not follow that

513
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:39,600
model they decided that um the four most

514
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,480
um you know the four most toxic heavy

515
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:45,319
metals lead cabum Asic and Mercury were

516
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,400
the ones which are of most concerned so

517
00:23:45,319 --> 00:23:53,639
they started with those um and then when

518
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:56,240
the states started getting um um you

519
00:23:53,640 --> 00:24:00,200
know when when State started to regulate

520
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:03,038
them um state Regulators felt that four

521
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:05,240
heavy metals was enough because you know

522
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:08,119
Lad last cadri Mercury was were

523
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:11,278
considered the most toxic

524
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:13,959
um but with regard to

525
00:24:11,278 --> 00:24:15,839
Pharmaceuticals um they realized that it

526
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:18,120
was not enough just to monitor lead

527
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:22,158
cabney mtic and mury that's why they

528
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:24,599
eventually ended up with a list of 24

529
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,880
unfortunately the Cannabis industry have

530
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:28,398
not progressed from that and state

531
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,159
regulators

532
00:24:28,398 --> 00:24:33,519
um felt that um as long as they

533
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:36,360
monitored those big four they felt that

534
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:39,359
was enough some states decided to expand

535
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:41,959
that list um but even even the most

536
00:24:39,359 --> 00:24:44,879
diligent States for example New York

537
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:48,558
state only only monitors eight eight

538
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:51,919
heavy metals so State Regulators State

539
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:54,678
cannabis Regulators have not have not

540
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:57,840
felt that it was necessary to expand

541
00:24:54,679 --> 00:25:03,120
that list but clearly the pharmaceutical

542
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:05,879
industry um has um set a standard of 24

543
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:07,719
Elemental impurities and that is that is

544
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,480
the standard United States pharmacopia

545
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:12,679
test for all Pharmaceuticals but as we

546
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,440
know um there are there are many

547
00:25:12,679 --> 00:25:19,038
cannabis products that are used for

548
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:21,399
pharmaceutical grade products so um I

549
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:24,000
think it's only a matter of time before

550
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:25,558
they eventually end up monitoring more

551
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,038
than the big four some states are

552
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:30,639
proactive like New York and is monit in

553
00:25:28,038 --> 00:25:32,200
eight um but I think it's only a matter

554
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:35,880
of time and there's enough evidence in

555
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:39,000
the public domain to suggest that uh if

556
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:42,000
you start looking at um if you start

557
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,519
monitoring a whole bunch of the other

558
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,759
heavy metals up to 24 you know you'll

559
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:46,759
find

560
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:52,799
them yeah I I I get the sense and I

561
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:55,000
understand from a chemistry chemist

562
00:25:52,798 --> 00:25:58,200
perspective that you're for you're

563
00:25:55,000 --> 00:26:00,960
protesting um which makes sense and I I

564
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:03,480
would say that I am too in a lot of ways

565
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:05,079
but I also realize like as a grower or

566
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:07,200
from a cultivator perspective it's

567
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:09,558
really really challenging because one

568
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:12,880
it's expensive it puts the onus on the

569
00:26:09,558 --> 00:26:16,240
grower to do this testing and when we

570
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,679
have to do this testing um it raises our

571
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,519
costs which I think pushes people to the

572
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:22,880
black market in a lot of ways too so I

573
00:26:21,519 --> 00:26:25,000
think there's a risk associate there

574
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,200
that I hope Regulators look at but the

575
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,200
other thing I've been thinking about

576
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:31,600
lately too is like when I go to the

577
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,519
store and I you know being healthc

578
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:37,439
conscious try to buy organic foods where

579
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:40,519
I can if I buy organic onions out of

580
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,919
Mexico for example what Assurance do I

581
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:45,119
have that those weren't grown near an

582
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,038
aluminum smelter or a mine of some sort

583
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:48,918
where I may be exposing myself to a much

584
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,158
higher health risk than if I bought

585
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:53,880
onions that were grown in say California

586
00:26:51,159 --> 00:26:57,320
using conventional meth fertilizers and

587
00:26:53,880 --> 00:27:00,679
pesticides um that that's where I feel

588
00:26:57,319 --> 00:27:04,960
like this testing onus is is not being

589
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:07,798
fairly um expressed ac across all of our

590
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,240
potential risks to our society does that

591
00:27:07,798 --> 00:27:12,918
does that make sense yeah yeah it does

592
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,079
um yeah you know the only way I can

593
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,480
answer that is that um I've been in this

594
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:21,599
field for almost 50 years you know Trace

595
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:23,599
element and heavy metal analysis and um

596
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:28,199
you see Industries go

597
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:30,398
through a logical phase in going to

598
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,798
understand where heavy metals play a

599
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:37,319
role in that industry and you'll find

600
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:40,960
that um Industries or application areas

601
00:27:37,319 --> 00:27:43,759
that that um that uh you know decided to

602
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,558
be proactive with regard to looking at

603
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:50,919
heavy metals obviously the EPA is a is a

604
00:27:47,558 --> 00:27:55,158
big incentive um you know for you know

605
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:57,919
for drinking water companies for um um

606
00:27:55,159 --> 00:28:00,360
you you know companies that that uh are

607
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:05,320
involved in the environmental business

608
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:08,719
but I think with the case of um large

609
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:11,319
Industries out there um there's a

610
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,600
there's there's there's I think there's

611
00:28:11,319 --> 00:28:17,119
a

612
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:19,398
um there's a feeling that um you know

613
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:23,000
heavy metals have been around for a long

614
00:28:19,398 --> 00:28:27,158
time and we are an industrial society

615
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:30,278
and um we've managed to um you know

616
00:28:27,159 --> 00:28:33,799
we've managed to be an industrial um you

617
00:28:30,278 --> 00:28:36,278
know economy for a long time but I think

618
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:40,158
I think the point that I'd like to make

619
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:42,798
is if we are aware of a potential Hazard

620
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:45,278
um I think we should do our utmost to

621
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:48,240
make sure if there are large consumers

622
00:28:45,278 --> 00:28:51,200
of that product where heavy metal

623
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,720
contamination could you know could be an

624
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:57,000
issue I think we have a vested interest

625
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:59,240
to fully understand how we can reduce

626
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,839
the EXP exposure of

627
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,839
consumers um you know that might be

628
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:07,119
exposed to high levels of heavy metals

629
00:29:04,839 --> 00:29:08,398
and being an anal an analytical chemist

630
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:12,959
which is

631
00:29:08,398 --> 00:29:16,759
specialized in um in this area for the

632
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,519
past 50 years um I see different

633
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,359
Industries going through different

634
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:24,200
cycles and different phases and I just

635
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:27,918
feel that the Cannabis industry at the

636
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:31,000
moment is um is going through through a

637
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,559
phasee where I think it understands that

638
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,640
there is a potential problem but at this

639
00:29:33,558 --> 00:29:39,119
present moment in time they're only

640
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,840
being required to monitor the big four

641
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:44,239
and in some cases in some states a few

642
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:46,639
more but

643
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:49,798
clearly heavy metal environmental

644
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:53,200
pollution is a serious concern I mean uh

645
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:56,359
you know the the the the the EPA have

646
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
been doing soil analysis for decades and

647
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:01,158
they're finding

648
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:04,158
that near near industrial sites there's

649
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:07,399
a lot of industrial pollution and

650
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,799
certainly if any crops are being grown

651
00:30:07,398 --> 00:30:13,678
anywhere near the industrial uh you know

652
00:30:09,798 --> 00:30:17,079
the industrial site um the you know the

653
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,798
EPA for example will um you know will

654
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:23,960
make sure that those Industries are

655
00:30:19,798 --> 00:30:26,200
being diligent in making sure um that

656
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:28,600
they're you know that they're monitoring

657
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,120
um these industrial sites for these

658
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:33,158
heavy metals or whatever you know metals

659
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:36,158
are required I

660
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:40,360
feel that the Cannabis industry at this

661
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:42,080
present moment in time um they're okay

662
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:44,839
they're going through the process of

663
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:49,359
trying to clean up their industry but

664
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:53,119
clearly you can see that based on

665
00:30:49,359 --> 00:30:55,798
environmental pollution which um you

666
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:59,278
know we we know is out there but

667
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:02,359
certainly um if you're not looking for a

668
00:30:59,278 --> 00:31:04,599
wider panel of environmental pollutants

669
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:07,719
you're not going to find them but I but

670
00:31:04,599 --> 00:31:10,240
I think it's fair to say that in many of

671
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:14,200
the studies that have been carried out

672
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,359
um up to now that they're finding that

673
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:18,960
um you know they're finding

674
00:31:16,359 --> 00:31:21,918
environmental pollutants which go beyond

675
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:23,360
the big four and we know for example

676
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:26,000
that the national in Institute of

677
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:28,959
Standards and Technology are coming out

678
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,679
with you know reference materials for

679
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:36,960
cannabis and hemp which is finding 13 14

680
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:38,919
15 Metals which um you know are not

681
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,278
being the either big four being

682
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:46,038
monitored but they're finding um there's

683
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,038
you know in industrial hemp out there

684
00:31:46,038 --> 00:31:49,879
which is which is absorbing a lot more

685
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:52,519
than the big four and for example

686
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:54,760
they're finding elements like uranium in

687
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:58,359
them and that's because they're being

688
00:31:54,759 --> 00:32:00,119
planted in in Sal which is contaminated

689
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:05,278
we know that

690
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:07,798
um we know that um ASM have um you know

691
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:11,599
come up with a standardized method for

692
00:32:07,798 --> 00:32:13,839
doing heavy metals um in cannabis

693
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:17,558
material and they just come out with a

694
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:20,480
method and they found out um that there

695
00:32:17,558 --> 00:32:24,918
were that there were up to 24 Elemental

696
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:28,000
impurities in the um in in the standard

697
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:30,399
method because because the um because

698
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,480
the Cannabis and hemp that they use to

699
00:32:30,398 --> 00:32:35,918
develop the method contain quite high

700
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:38,960
levels of other heavy metals which are

701
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,840
not being monitored so we know they're

702
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,240
getting into the product um but I think

703
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:49,398
we're at a stage with the regard to um

704
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:52,038
you know standardization and making sure

705
00:32:49,398 --> 00:32:55,239
um that we're coming up with a

706
00:32:52,038 --> 00:32:58,158
standardized method that um we're not at

707
00:32:55,240 --> 00:33:01,759
a point yet where we're beginning to

708
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:04,519
look for a wider slew of heavy metals I

709
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:07,119
think it's only a matter of time before

710
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:09,919
once we start testing carrying out a

711
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:11,079
wider testing a wider panel it's only a

712
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,360
matter of time before we're going to

713
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:13,359
find

714
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:17,879
them yeah I think you're I think you're

715
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,840
probably right I think we are going to

716
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,399
see more and more testing and I think as

717
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,798
we see more testing we'll find more

718
00:33:21,398 --> 00:33:27,479
things and it's it's hard to make an

719
00:33:23,798 --> 00:33:31,079
argument against testing for heavy metal

720
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:32,759
from a regulatory perspective um people

721
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:34,038
want to know that things are safe I just

722
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:36,319
think it's crazy that you know we can

723
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:38,119
have heavy metals in our baby food you

724
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,519
know I live on an island with about

725
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:44,119
8,000 homes that's about 15 miles from a

726
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:46,919
super fun site and I have 10 to 20 PPM

727
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:49,119
of arsenic in my soil I know that and as

728
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:51,240
a grower I won't grow vegetables or

729
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:52,839
fruit trees on my property but I see

730
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,319
them on all my properties and other

731
00:33:52,839 --> 00:33:56,959
people around me and people are eating

732
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:59,960
it and it's just I think it's unfort

733
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,360
forunate that I feel like and nicotine

734
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:02,840
would be another great example of this

735
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:05,638
we don't have this level of testing with

736
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:08,719
nicotine but uh at the end of the day it

737
00:34:05,638 --> 00:34:10,878
is what it is and I think it's here so

738
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:13,319
let's let's dive into some of the the

739
00:34:10,878 --> 00:34:15,239
nitty-gritty of it then uh

740
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:17,879
sure I want

741
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:21,078
to so I kind of broke this up into three

742
00:34:17,878 --> 00:34:23,559
sections uh vaping and consumption lab

743
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:25,039
testing and cultivation and extraction I

744
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:26,559
kind of want to go straight to lab

745
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:29,119
testing because you were talking about

746
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:31,159
the of testing that's happening and I

747
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:34,800
know this is really your strongest area

748
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,878
of expertise so as a grower when I send

749
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,760
in my samples um how confident can I be

750
00:34:37,878 --> 00:34:43,440
in that lab testing um and that result

751
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:46,320
so if it comes back and says it has this

752
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,079
much ppms of Arsenic and this much

753
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:51,480
cadmium

754
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:52,919
um how how accurate is that number truly

755
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:55,559
like what's the standard deviation that

756
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:58,400
we're talking about with such a small

757
00:34:55,559 --> 00:35:02,519
number uh for pass and

758
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,039
fail well um yeah I mean that's that's a

759
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:08,159
really good question because the

760
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:11,039
Cannabis industry is new um and I think

761
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:13,879
it's fair to say that uh some some of

762
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,679
the some of the labs are out there and

763
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,800
not of the highest caliber and that's

764
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:20,519
not me meant to be overcritical but it's

765
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:25,000
a an industry that's grown you know

766
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:26,920
rapidly in the past 5 to 10 years and um

767
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,239
you know testing labs are springing up

768
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,440
all the time and uh I think there's

769
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:33,838
somewhere like 750 testing labs in the

770
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,920
whole of the US well you divide that by

771
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:38,078
the number of states where cannabis is

772
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:40,400
legal which I think is about 40

773
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,599
approximately um you know so there's a

774
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:47,000
whole bunch of testing Labs um in every

775
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:51,119
state where cannabis is legal is the

776
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:53,239
quality consistent absolutely not I mean

777
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,519
I think some of them are well-run and

778
00:35:53,239 --> 00:35:58,279
they they have a high level of expertise

779
00:35:56,519 --> 00:36:01,880
but you got to understand that these

780
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,400
testing Labs have sprung up so quickly

781
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:07,599
and they've hired people who don't

782
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,000
necessarily have the desired expertise

783
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:13,318
to run a technique like ICP Mass

784
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:15,519
spectrometry which often requires a

785
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:18,000
decade of experience to fully understand

786
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:21,559
how to get the best out of it it's a

787
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:24,358
complicated Tech technique um and it's a

788
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:27,279
technique that can give you bad data if

789
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,440
you're not using it correctly I'm not

790
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,640
being over critical here but I think

791
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,159
many of these testing Labs have sprung

792
00:36:31,639 --> 00:36:37,838
up so quickly and they've um you know

793
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:40,239
they've ended up in warehouses in in

794
00:36:37,838 --> 00:36:43,440
places which are not ID suited to put a

795
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:45,559
lab so the contamination issues are

796
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,960
there maybe the expertise of the

797
00:36:45,559 --> 00:36:51,440
operator is not there that uh sometimes

798
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,039
uh they don't hire the U you know the

799
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,119
best people so all of a sudden you find

800
00:36:54,039 --> 00:36:57,159
that there's people running these

801
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,440
instruments in warehouses they don't

802
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,078
have a lot of experience in using an

803
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,079
ultr Trace element technique that can

804
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,039
get down to part per quadrillion um but

805
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:11,000
if they're being run in a warehouse it's

806
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:14,480
almost meaningless so um you can argue

807
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,760
that the 750 or so lab testing

808
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,880
facilities in the US um I'm not saying

809
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:23,240
that they're all generating bad data but

810
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:26,358
you got to understand that icpms is a

811
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:27,239
very specialized technique so so knowing

812
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,719
that

813
00:37:27,239 --> 00:37:35,239
there there is the potential for lab

814
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:39,759
error or um issues with with with

815
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:42,358
various Labs um this is such a costly

816
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,960
fail for a grower you know sometimes it

817
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,480
can be the difference between bankruptcy

818
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:49,079
or or staying in business um because

819
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,838
it's we're talking thousands if not tens

820
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:55,200
of thousands of dollars if you get a

821
00:37:50,838 --> 00:37:59,519
failure um what can we do on the grower

822
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,960
side uh to to better ensure that we we

823
00:37:59,519 --> 00:38:02,838
pass a test I'm not talking I don't want

824
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,159
to get into cultivation side yet but I

825
00:38:02,838 --> 00:38:08,239
mean like should we be washing our

826
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:11,598
samples should we be sending it to more

827
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:13,279
than one lab prior to going in for that

828
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,160
final test

829
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,960
um is is is dust something that's really

830
00:38:16,159 --> 00:38:20,039
a relative concern

831
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:23,480
with you know with when we're talking

832
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:26,119
about such small amounts um in such

833
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:30,039
precise testing well I I think we have

834
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:33,800
to be real istic that um these are um

835
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:37,239
you know these labs are are being put

836
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:39,839
together very quickly um an icpms is an

837
00:38:37,239 --> 00:38:41,799
ultra sensitive technique and some of

838
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,719
the contamination is some of the

839
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,318
contamination issues are not being

840
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:48,639
addressed so I think with the best

841
00:38:46,318 --> 00:38:51,119
intent in the world that you can hire

842
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:53,199
someone who's you know reasonably

843
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:56,519
competent but but because you put in the

844
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:58,199
instrument in basically a warehouse um

845
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,119
and they're not going into specialized

846
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:03,838
rooms you you got to be aware that

847
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,280
contamination is a huge huge problem for

848
00:39:03,838 --> 00:39:09,358
a technique that's capable of measuring

849
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,160
down to parts per quadrillion so it so

850
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:15,679
so it's not that um it's not that the

851
00:39:12,159 --> 00:39:18,719
that the the people who run in them um

852
00:39:15,679 --> 00:39:23,239
you know are I mean sometimes they're in

853
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:25,639
experien but the fact is that icpms is

854
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:27,879
typically placed in a clean room it's

855
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:30,118
typically placed in a specialized room

856
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,720
where there can be no contamination uh

857
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,640
they have to have a positive pressure so

858
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:36,879
in other words you you know nothing can

859
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:41,598
be blown in from outside um normally the

860
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,880
sample preparation area is uh um is

861
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:45,200
separate from the instrumental um you

862
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:47,039
know from the instrument because you're

863
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:49,480
worried about you know

864
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:52,440
contamination um when you when you

865
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:55,000
digesting the samples which contain high

866
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,960
concentrations of mineral acids uh you

867
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:59,159
know so you got to make sure that

868
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:01,199
there's minimum contamination and I

869
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:04,559
think what's happened is that these

870
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:07,960
Cannabis Testing Labs have grown so

871
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:09,838
rapidly over a short period of time is

872
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,199
that they're doing the best job they can

873
00:40:09,838 --> 00:40:14,679
do but you got to understand this is a

874
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:18,159
technique that was developed back in the

875
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:20,318
early 80s to measure down to parts of

876
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:23,199
quadrillion level now it's very

877
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:25,800
difficult to explain what that means but

878
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:29,759
this is a technique that was developed

879
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:32,560
to measure ultra low levels and the you

880
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:35,200
know the um the levels that are being

881
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:37,119
requested by the Cannabis industry are

882
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,439
not that particularly low the you know

883
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,318
the technique is probably capable of

884
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:47,358
measuring um a thousand times lower but

885
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:50,559
because they are being um housed in

886
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:52,199
non-specialized equipment um you're

887
00:40:50,559 --> 00:40:54,318
obviously not going to get the best out

888
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,759
of the technique uh you know that

889
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,759
together with maybe they're not hiring

890
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:00,640
the best people who don't really

891
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:03,920
understand the capability of the

892
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:06,559
technique so you can get all kinds of

893
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,240
contamination problems um you know when

894
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:12,480
you combine that

895
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:15,639
together um I think it's fair to say

896
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,760
that maybe the the okay the the the data

897
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:20,519
that's been

898
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:23,200
generated um I mean not by all Testing

899
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,920
Lab but you know many testing labs are

900
00:41:23,199 --> 00:41:27,679
not considering the technique they're

901
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,039
using and they're not considering where

902
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:32,559
the technique is being housed and I

903
00:41:30,039 --> 00:41:36,480
think I I think that's detrimental to

904
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:38,838
get the the best data and the highest

905
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,079
accuracy so for those of us that are not

906
00:41:38,838 --> 00:41:44,199
familiar with ICP I've never been in a

907
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,519
lab for example um what are some

908
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:49,318
potential sources of contamination that

909
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:52,559
I may not have considered um you

910
00:41:49,318 --> 00:41:54,358
mentioned being house in a warehouse but

911
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:56,920
like let's say someone does have a clean

912
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:59,598
room um what could for

913
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:02,159
example

914
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:05,519
um I I don't know the clothing that

915
00:42:02,159 --> 00:42:08,159
someone was wearing or potentially other

916
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:10,719
things uh like could could a prior

917
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:12,199
sample potentially contaminate the next

918
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:14,519
sample like what are some of the things

919
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:16,199
that they people should be looking for

920
00:42:14,519 --> 00:42:17,719
yeah I've I've I've actually published

921
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:21,318
quite widely on this yeah there there

922
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:23,078
are there are things that people do um

923
00:42:21,318 --> 00:42:26,279
if they're not used to working in the

924
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:28,800
ultr trace environment they just do

925
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:33,119
things where it's pretty easy to

926
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:35,280
contaminate the sample um just by um you

927
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:37,640
know digesting and dissolving the sample

928
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,400
for example these are typically done in

929
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:43,239
microwave digestion systems um well if

930
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,280
you're not diligent about keeping your

931
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:49,919
microwave digestion equipment clean or

932
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:53,800
or using Ultra Pew Ultra Clean acids

933
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,800
Ultra Clean chemicals making sure um

934
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:56,839
that it's that it's done in in in an

935
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:00,280
area

936
00:42:56,838 --> 00:43:02,799
which is away from any um you know maybe

937
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:04,319
sample preparation maybe you know an

938
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:07,119
area where they're bringing the sample

939
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:08,679
in um you know bringing the Cannabis

940
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:11,599
sample in bringing the flow in or

941
00:43:08,679 --> 00:43:14,239
bringing the plant in um you know that

942
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:18,000
that that has to be kept away from where

943
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:22,000
the sample is digested um obviously you

944
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,960
have to have um it has to be done in a

945
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,400
um in a in a positive pressure so it has

946
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,559
to been done within a Tom Hood which is

947
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:33,200
if there's if there's any environmental

948
00:43:30,559 --> 00:43:36,000
contamination um you you have to have a

949
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,279
positive pressure um under the hood so

950
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,199
you're actually you're actually taking

951
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:44,119
away any contaminants obviously when

952
00:43:41,199 --> 00:43:47,279
you're using something like um a very a

953
00:43:44,119 --> 00:43:49,318
very sensitive technique many Industries

954
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,599
how you know you have to use specialized

955
00:43:49,318 --> 00:43:54,558
equipment um you you know you have to

956
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:57,440
use specialized acids which are very

957
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:00,880
clean acids or you might have to dress

958
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:03,800
up in what are called bunny suits so so

959
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,079
you the analyst is not actually contamin

960
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:08,920
in the sample that's quite that's quite

961
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:11,200
common in the semiconductor industry um

962
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:12,838
but also when you're preparing the

963
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:15,439
sample when you're delu in the sample

964
00:44:12,838 --> 00:44:16,960
you got to make sure that your acids are

965
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,599
clean you got to make sure that you're

966
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,240
using the cleanest um Ultra Pure you

967
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:26,359
know deionized water and then you have

968
00:44:23,239 --> 00:44:28,639
to make sure that the instrument itself

969
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:30,719
um you have positive extraction of the

970
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,799
instruments and there's there's nothing

971
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:36,639
that can actually drop down into where

972
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,160
the sample is going and um you know

973
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:41,799
there there there are many examples

974
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:45,039
where Industries which are used to

975
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:48,599
working in an ultra clean environment to

976
00:44:45,039 --> 00:44:50,599
take take multiple steps to make sure

977
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:54,079
that there's no contamination taking

978
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:56,519
place in the sample um I think in

979
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:59,318
general um you know the cannabis testing

980
00:44:56,519 --> 00:45:03,400
Labs do a reasonable job at that but I

981
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:06,440
think many of them don't and I think um

982
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:08,559
you know the data you're generating is

983
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,400
only as good as your sample preparation

984
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,880
area and having seen a number of the

985
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:17,519
sample preparation areas of some of the

986
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:19,599
Cannabis Testing um Labs um you know it

987
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:21,358
leaves a lot to be desired because

988
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,559
they're just not used to working in the

989
00:45:21,358 --> 00:45:28,239
ultr trace environment and um the

990
00:45:24,559 --> 00:45:31,839
Cannabis industry and can Labs have have

991
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:34,358
you know have have been set up often in

992
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:37,639
you know in warehouses or in in Labs

993
00:45:34,358 --> 00:45:41,078
which are not considered ultra clean so

994
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:43,480
once a lab gets signed off on um by

995
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:45,640
Regulators is anyone auditing these Labs

996
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:50,039
on a consistent

997
00:45:45,639 --> 00:45:54,318
basis um the state yeah I mean yeah it's

998
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:58,599
a it's it's a state responsibility and

999
00:45:54,318 --> 00:46:01,719
um Within within the Cannabis

1000
00:45:58,599 --> 00:46:03,838
um with with within the the okay the

1001
00:46:01,719 --> 00:46:06,639
state sort of Cannabis Testing Labs that

1002
00:46:03,838 --> 00:46:10,239
are people who have expertise in that

1003
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:12,239
area um but I'm not you know I'm not too

1004
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:15,279
sure they're being super diligent I

1005
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,639
think uh I think it's fair to say that

1006
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:21,519
these Cannabis Testing Labs have sprung

1007
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:22,598
up very very quickly and um they fall

1008
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:26,960
under the

1009
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:29,200
responsibility of the um you know

1010
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:33,280
of you know the state Cannabis Testing

1011
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:35,000
folks which um it you know there there

1012
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:37,760
can be a lot of expertise within that

1013
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,760
state lab or you know or they might not

1014
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:43,119
be and I think it's fair to say that

1015
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:45,559
it's not like it's a semiconductor lab

1016
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,358
which uh um you know the semiconductor

1017
00:46:45,559 --> 00:46:51,040
industry is used to working in the ultr

1018
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:55,239
trace environment so they know how to

1019
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,400
set up an ultr Trace Testing Lab um I

1020
00:46:55,239 --> 00:46:59,439
think

1021
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:03,240
probably you know cannabis

1022
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:05,960
um I mean State cannabis Labs um have

1023
00:47:03,239 --> 00:47:08,479
you know have not really had to do that

1024
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:10,079
um and I think you know some of them

1025
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,280
some of them might be lacking I'm not

1026
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,599
saying they're all they're all you know

1027
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:16,800
they're all lacking but I think it's

1028
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:19,760
fair to say that

1029
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:23,559
um that you know that some of the State

1030
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:25,800
Labs have um I think have other

1031
00:47:23,559 --> 00:47:30,319
priorities and they might not be so

1032
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:33,800
diligent in making sure um that the labs

1033
00:47:30,318 --> 00:47:36,599
uh you know are doing a really good job

1034
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,079
um you know it's difficult to know that

1035
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:40,160
that's why I guess this is the one of

1036
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:43,559
the other reasons I I have a big issue

1037
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:45,799
with um adding more testing is until

1038
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:50,359
they have the regulatory side figured

1039
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:53,680
out and consistent to where um the the

1040
00:47:50,358 --> 00:47:56,598
the burden of proof and and the and the

1041
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:59,279
um the impact is so catastrophic on

1042
00:47:56,599 --> 00:48:00,838
Growers for a failed test until we can

1043
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,359
have any confidence in these tests it

1044
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:05,519
just doesn't seem right to roll out more

1045
00:48:02,358 --> 00:48:07,159
tests but um I do want to move on just

1046
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:10,039
because I have a bunch of questionss for

1047
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:11,639
you um so since we can't do anything

1048
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,880
about the testing we can't really do a

1049
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:16,519
lot about the regulations in the short

1050
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:18,800
term um this is the environment that

1051
00:48:16,519 --> 00:48:20,838
we're stuck with what can we do as a

1052
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,318
grower to better improve our chances of

1053
00:48:20,838 --> 00:48:24,838
passing a test so I I think I mentioned

1054
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,199
before like should we be washing our

1055
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:30,599
samples with something like deionized or

1056
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:32,759
RO water to remove any dust or particles

1057
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:34,680
that may have landed on the on the bud

1058
00:48:32,760 --> 00:48:37,400
um is that something that you would

1059
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:40,480
recommend um what are your thoughts on

1060
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:43,519
that before I ask other questions well

1061
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:46,679
yeah I mean I think

1062
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,440
um yeah I mean I'm not too sure whether

1063
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:52,960
that's uh you know that's kind of cost

1064
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:55,798
effective I think it's fair to say that

1065
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,639
um you know the Cannabis industry has

1066
00:48:55,798 --> 00:49:03,759
has um has you know got to the point

1067
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:07,480
where um it's grown it's grown very very

1068
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:11,200
rapidly o over a short period of time

1069
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:13,679
and um I think you know I think I think

1070
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,480
Growers do a reasonable job of making

1071
00:49:13,679 --> 00:49:20,639
sure that their you know that their

1072
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:24,199
product um is being tested but I'm you

1073
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,078
know I mean I'm not too sure whether

1074
00:49:24,199 --> 00:49:29,639
it's kind of cost effective

1075
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,160
to go on sorry I'm just talking about

1076
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:34,400
like if I'm going to send in a sample to

1077
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:36,318
a lab for a 5B lot for example yeah to

1078
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:39,680
be able to pass should I be cleaning

1079
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:41,920
that small sample um what I so to phrase

1080
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:44,039
this another way like for example

1081
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,680
because of where I live let's say I walk

1082
00:49:44,039 --> 00:49:48,679
outside and I'm carrying my sample and

1083
00:49:46,679 --> 00:49:50,679
some of the dust that I know is 10 to 20

1084
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:52,519
PPM of arsenic may have been kicked into

1085
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,838
my facility or may have been kicked up

1086
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:58,119
on my way to my truck um how how would

1087
00:49:55,838 --> 00:49:59,920
that impact my sample passing or failing

1088
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:01,880
is that little bit of dusk a real risk

1089
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:04,280
when we're talking about such a precise

1090
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,599
instrumentation that's that's really yet

1091
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:07,720
so like should I be cleaning just my

1092
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,400
small sample not my entire

1093
00:50:07,719 --> 00:50:11,798
crop

1094
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:13,920
um I don't know you know I don't know

1095
00:50:11,798 --> 00:50:16,960
how to answer that question I mean

1096
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:20,798
certainly um if you're talking about

1097
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,559
taking um a small weight of the sample

1098
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:24,559
typically half a gram is taken for

1099
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,960
analysis is that half a gram

1100
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,119
representative

1101
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,119
of what's being sampled I mean I don't

1102
00:50:28,119 --> 00:50:33,519
know um I think I think it's unlikely

1103
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,559
that washing is going to impact that

1104
00:50:33,519 --> 00:50:40,759
half a gram of sample that's actually

1105
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:43,760
taken for analysis um and I you know I

1106
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:46,240
think I think it's fair to say that um

1107
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,680
you know I think Growers do a reasonable

1108
00:50:46,239 --> 00:50:50,439
job of getting you know getting the

1109
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:54,879
sample in a convenient form um you know

1110
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:58,599
for testing um but I think I think the

1111
00:50:54,880 --> 00:51:00,680
question I have is is is monitoring just

1112
00:50:58,599 --> 00:51:03,640
four heavy metals you know

1113
00:51:00,679 --> 00:51:07,078
representative of what's in the sample

1114
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,759
and I think based on the number of

1115
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:10,839
different growing conditions throughout

1116
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,839
the US I think it's fair I think it's

1117
00:51:10,838 --> 00:51:16,880
fairly well understood that based on um

1118
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:20,358
what we know from environmental

1119
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,160
pollution from a multitude um of crops

1120
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:24,880
that are grown you know you for

1121
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:28,399
commercial purposes whether it's for you

1122
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:31,240
know veget vbl or whether it's for um

1123
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:34,000
you know any type of

1124
00:51:31,239 --> 00:51:35,798
um I mean any I mean anything I think

1125
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,159
it's fair to say that there's so that

1126
00:51:35,798 --> 00:51:39,838
there's so much environmental

1127
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:42,318
contamination out there that you know

1128
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:44,639
clearly that there's a lot more than

1129
00:51:42,318 --> 00:51:48,000
than you know just the big four heavy

1130
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:50,519
metals which could be potentially

1131
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,519
contaminating any vegetable crop out

1132
00:51:50,519 --> 00:51:57,759
there so um I you know I think it's fair

1133
00:51:54,519 --> 00:52:00,400
to say that uh that that many of the

1134
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,960
industries um which have grown up

1135
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:07,000
through um you know from the from the

1136
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:11,358
food processing industry um have you

1137
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:14,480
know have taken a I think have taken a

1138
00:52:11,358 --> 00:52:16,880
um a wider look at the other potential

1139
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:21,240
elements heavy metals which could be

1140
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,559
contaminated their crops so um you know

1141
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:26,399
I'm not too sure that answers your

1142
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:29,160
question but I think I think potential

1143
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:31,160
um that we're probably you know not

1144
00:52:29,159 --> 00:52:33,558
monitoring enough heavy

1145
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:35,399
metals so what what are potential

1146
00:52:33,559 --> 00:52:38,079
sources of contamination that should be

1147
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:42,160
looked at in a typical indoor

1148
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:45,519
facility um could we could we maybe talk

1149
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,960
about that a little bit in a okay in an

1150
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:50,440
indoor

1151
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:53,880
facility yes okay

1152
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:55,838
um well obviously um there's less

1153
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,079
environmental contamination for

1154
00:52:55,838 --> 00:53:00,159
something that's grown indoors I mean

1155
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:02,839
clearly um but it depends what you're

1156
00:53:00,159 --> 00:53:05,199
growing it in um are you growing it in

1157
00:53:02,838 --> 00:53:06,599
soil are you growing it is it is it

1158
00:53:05,199 --> 00:53:11,639
being grown

1159
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:13,480
hydroponically um what source of of of

1160
00:53:11,639 --> 00:53:16,239
of water you're

1161
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:20,119
using yeah so I I understand that like

1162
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:23,279
your media whether it's you know Pete

1163
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:25,519
Moss rock wool cocoa core water whatever

1164
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,160
that media is is is a is a primary AR

1165
00:53:25,519 --> 00:53:29,920
source of heavy metals and that makes a

1166
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:32,838
lot of sense so I think as a grower the

1167
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:34,680
first thing I'm going to look at is uh

1168
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,358
what are my what is my media and what

1169
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:39,279
are the nutrient sources that I'm using

1170
00:53:36,358 --> 00:53:42,279
to feed this plant yes beyond that I

1171
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:44,400
think I think water is a big source of

1172
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,839
contamination and this this is a

1173
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,280
separate question but let's just dive

1174
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,440
into it um you mentioned in your white

1175
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:52,319
paper that the EPA estimated 30 million

1176
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,000
people live in areas where drinking

1177
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:56,239
water violated safety standards uh which

1178
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,639
is

1179
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:01,159
crazy to me um because I think there's a

1180
00:53:58,639 --> 00:54:02,598
lot of other risks out here beside

1181
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:04,558
Beyond cannabis that people are being

1182
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:07,960
exposed to on a daily basis that our

1183
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,640
government's not regulating but um what

1184
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:12,280
I think what I think about when I hear

1185
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:14,679
that and something I've been learning

1186
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:18,960
with Growers is let's just say that your

1187
00:54:14,679 --> 00:54:21,358
water passes for arsenic um for example

1188
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:23,000
and uh it's but it's got a tiny amount

1189
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:24,480
or maybe that amount is so small it's

1190
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,920
not it's not being picked up by the

1191
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:27,920
water testing facility because they're

1192
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,838
only testing to a certain a certain

1193
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,400
level of concentration y um but if and

1194
00:54:31,838 --> 00:54:36,960
if I drink a gallon of that water a day

1195
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:41,160
I'm totally fine but if I'm putting

1196
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:44,039
40,000 gallons through a room that's got

1197
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:45,679
a cannabis plant in it the amount of

1198
00:54:44,039 --> 00:54:47,639
heavy metal if we look at it from sort

1199
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:49,838
of a mass flow perspective that's going

1200
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:51,519
to be building up in that soil in that

1201
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:53,639
media that's going to be taken up by the

1202
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:55,838
plant over the course of that growth

1203
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:57,879
cycle is actually

1204
00:54:55,838 --> 00:54:59,960
probably my biggest source of

1205
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:01,519
contamination um versus just you know

1206
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,280
adding a little bit of B guano or a

1207
00:55:01,519 --> 00:55:06,519
little bit of softrock phosphate even if

1208
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:09,040
that softrock phosphate is much higher

1209
00:55:06,519 --> 00:55:11,759
say it's you know 20 PPM of arsenic but

1210
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:13,199
I'm using a relatively small amount come

1211
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,960
compared to the amount of water that's

1212
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:16,759
going through my room what are your

1213
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,039
thoughts on

1214
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,400
that

1215
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:27,920
um yeah I I think I think that's a valid

1216
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:29,400
point um I think I think we've I I think

1217
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:35,119
we know

1218
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:39,200
based based on um based on plants that

1219
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:42,559
um are using um are using a a you know a

1220
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:45,399
very clean source of water

1221
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:51,920
and I think I think it's fair to say

1222
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:54,280
that um um that EPA has been has you

1223
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:56,119
know done a good job of regulating our

1224
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:00,599
water supply

1225
00:55:56,119 --> 00:56:02,559
um but I think it's fair to say that um

1226
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:08,400
you you know that many water authorities

1227
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:11,280
don't um don't test their water on a

1228
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:14,519
regular basis so so it might be two

1229
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,880
years before they have to submit data to

1230
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:21,358
the EPA that their that their local

1231
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:25,240
water supply is below the EPA guidelines

1232
00:56:21,358 --> 00:56:29,719
um but you know the question is is is

1233
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:31,759
that um in that in in that two in that

1234
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:35,000
two-year period are there any of those

1235
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:39,039
heavy metals which are falling outside

1236
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:41,719
those EPA limits um because you know

1237
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:43,720
there's no requirement to test it um

1238
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:46,639
sort of more regularly than every couple

1239
00:56:43,719 --> 00:56:50,078
of years so um I'm not too sure that

1240
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:52,879
answers your question but certainly um I

1241
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:55,798
think that most sources of drinking

1242
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,880
water um in the US because they are

1243
00:56:55,798 --> 00:57:03,239
regulated by the EPA are probably clean

1244
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:06,880
enough but uh um as we saw you know in

1245
00:57:03,239 --> 00:57:09,759
Flint back in a few years ago is that uh

1246
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:12,880
is that people were negligent and they

1247
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:15,079
ended up um you know using water which

1248
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,240
was contaminated with a whole bunch of

1249
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:19,559
heavy metals now I don't think that

1250
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:22,239
happens on a regular basis but uh you

1251
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:25,000
know negligence can create a scenario

1252
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:26,719
like that so I guess if I wanted to is

1253
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:29,199
still my question even further though I

1254
00:57:26,719 --> 00:57:33,078
guess what I'm asking is even water that

1255
00:57:29,199 --> 00:57:36,879
may meet EPA standards for drinking for

1256
00:57:33,079 --> 00:57:40,440
human consumption may not meet what

1257
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:42,880
standards we should have for

1258
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:44,159
cultivation because of the massive

1259
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,160
amount of water that's going to go

1260
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:50,920
through a crop during a given growth

1261
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:53,279
cycle

1262
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:56,480
um I don't know if I can answer that

1263
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:58,760
question I mean you know depend what

1264
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:02,760
those volumes are

1265
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,880
um I yeah I mean I I think uh I think

1266
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,359
it's fairly I you know I think

1267
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,559
potentially that could be the case but I

1268
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,000
think it depends on what volumes are

1269
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:16,480
used um sure

1270
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:20,440
sure um um but I I yeah I I think it's

1271
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:24,000
fair to say because um there's been you

1272
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:25,679
know a lot of work done on looking at um

1273
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,798
you know can I mean potential

1274
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:33,199
contamination sources in water that's

1275
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:36,199
used to you know to cultivate um things

1276
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:37,639
like um you know things like cannabis

1277
00:58:36,199 --> 00:58:41,399
that's grown

1278
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:44,000
for you know making FDA approved drugs

1279
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,838
something like epidex which we know is

1280
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,719
grown

1281
00:58:44,838 --> 00:58:50,279
indoors and um it's produced an indoor

1282
00:58:48,719 --> 00:58:54,879
facilities

1283
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:56,960
and um when when GW Pharmaceuticals who

1284
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,280
were the original manufacturer of epid

1285
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:03,400
dialect were going through FDA approval

1286
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:06,280
I mean they had to show a lot of data

1287
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:08,480
about their about their process of

1288
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:11,039
growing you know cannabis indoors

1289
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,719
because it's it's it's

1290
00:59:11,039 --> 00:59:17,640
um you know it's grown indoors but

1291
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:19,919
certainly um they you know they had a um

1292
00:59:17,639 --> 00:59:22,639
obviously when they were going through

1293
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:24,960
that process they would they were

1294
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,078
impacted by United States pharmac appear

1295
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,519
at that time who were monitoring up to

1296
00:59:27,079 --> 00:59:33,720
24 Elemental impurities and um you know

1297
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:36,559
they had to make sure that their that

1298
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:38,879
their growing process was ultra clean

1299
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:42,119
and they were

1300
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:44,760
checking the manufacturing process at

1301
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:47,519
multiple points to making sure that

1302
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:51,000
there were no heavy metals present and

1303
00:59:47,519 --> 00:59:53,920
um you know here's an example of a of a

1304
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:55,960
product which was grown um you know

1305
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,599
specifically for

1306
00:59:55,960 --> 01:00:01,159
producing a CBD pharmaceutical which was

1307
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:06,920
aimed for childhood

1308
01:00:01,159 --> 01:00:08,879
epilepsy um and you know they they they

1309
01:00:06,920 --> 01:00:12,960
just had to make sure that their

1310
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:15,960
manufacturing process was Ultra Clean um

1311
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:19,400
but the question is um is there a

1312
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:22,519
requirement for um you know companies

1313
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:27,318
that are manufacturing or are producing

1314
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:31,038
cannabis indoors or hemp indoors um you

1315
01:00:27,318 --> 01:00:33,920
know are they dictated by um you know

1316
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:36,960
something or what you know do they have

1317
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:39,280
to go through the whole process that a

1318
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:41,838
that a pharmaceutical manufacturer like

1319
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:45,839
GW Pharmaceuticals had to go through to

1320
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:46,838
produce a CBD based drug um called idx I

1321
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:49,279
don't

1322
01:00:46,838 --> 01:00:53,000
know so knowing that water is a

1323
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:55,319
potential source of contamination um

1324
01:00:53,000 --> 01:01:00,000
that would push me towards reverse off

1325
01:00:55,318 --> 01:01:03,239
osmosis water um however as you probably

1326
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:07,318
know R water is very wasteful to produce

1327
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:11,038
it's very expensive and costly and um

1328
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:14,038
what are the risks of using R

1329
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,760
water um you know truly you know fairly

1330
01:01:14,039 --> 01:01:20,920
pure water um how does that raise the

1331
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:24,960
risk associated with its its contact

1332
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:28,039
with different media with uh metal or

1333
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:30,679
other things on its way to the plant um

1334
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:32,839
Plastics glass things like that I know

1335
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:35,440
that deionized water that's that's

1336
01:01:32,838 --> 01:01:38,239
utiliz for laboratory use is really

1337
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,240
expensive to produce I'm not too sure it

1338
01:01:38,239 --> 01:01:44,479
would be cost effective to use something

1339
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:47,919
like deionized or demineralized water um

1340
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:50,798
you know for cannabis plants I mean I

1341
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:53,760
think if if

1342
01:01:50,798 --> 01:01:56,440
a I mean I can answer that question um

1343
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:58,480
because I don't know but certainly um

1344
01:01:56,440 --> 01:02:01,278
you deionized or demineralized water

1345
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:04,679
that's used for laboratory use is

1346
01:02:01,278 --> 01:02:07,159
extremely expensive extremely expensive

1347
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:12,038
um and I'm not too sure it would be cost

1348
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:14,519
effective to use that um you know yeah

1349
01:02:12,039 --> 01:02:17,880
that's that's a whole another level of

1350
01:02:14,519 --> 01:02:20,838
uh Purity but RO water tends to be very

1351
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:24,160
low PPM of impurities by the time it

1352
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:26,759
goes through the filtration process um

1353
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,399
and and the issue with that from a you

1354
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:29,680
know and this is where the chemistry

1355
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:31,798
gets a little bit beyond my knowledge

1356
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:35,358
but I I know that that water wants to be

1357
01:02:31,798 --> 01:02:37,159
bonded with something y um and so that

1358
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:41,679
being the case when it comes into

1359
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:44,838
contact with Metals some some other and

1360
01:02:41,679 --> 01:02:49,519
and other materials it can potentially

1361
01:02:44,838 --> 01:02:52,480
pull uh or or keate with um these heavy

1362
01:02:49,519 --> 01:02:54,400
metals for at a higher rate than water

1363
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:59,199
that's mineralized so we tend to want to

1364
01:02:54,400 --> 01:03:01,639
buffer water PH it prior to uh prior to

1365
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:03,759
prior to watering our crop

1366
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:05,199
um which creates a lot of other

1367
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:06,440
challenges but that was sort of what I

1368
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:09,558
was getting at is like what are the

1369
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,079
risks associated with using RL water in

1370
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:14,000
terms of um its flow into the media

1371
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:18,000
through our plumbing through you know

1372
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:20,599
let's say I I put it into a into a big

1373
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,079
plastic vat and then I use a sump pump

1374
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:25,119
that has metal parts inside to pump it

1375
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:27,119
out what are the higher risks Associated

1376
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:28,480
maybe with corrosion or pulling heavy

1377
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:31,559
metals out of that pump that may have

1378
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:32,760
been made you know in China and contain

1379
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:34,519
various levels of heavy metals that

1380
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:36,799
weren't regulated with the production of

1381
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:39,639
a a sump pump for example does that does

1382
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:43,440
that make sense well yeah yeah

1383
01:03:39,639 --> 01:03:46,318
um well I think if your if your water

1384
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,039
was the um was the only thing you ought

1385
01:03:46,318 --> 01:03:52,519
to be concerned about I think I tend to

1386
01:03:49,039 --> 01:03:55,559
agree with you but you know I

1387
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:58,759
mean I think you got a look at the

1388
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:02,000
entire growing process I mean what else

1389
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:03,799
is involved besides watering the plant

1390
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,838
what kind of nutrients are you using

1391
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:10,480
what kind of fertilizer are you using

1392
01:04:06,838 --> 01:04:14,358
what what what what else what else is

1393
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:17,240
the plant being exposed to um and I

1394
01:04:14,358 --> 01:04:19,278
think I think maybe um you know I don't

1395
01:04:17,239 --> 01:04:21,959
know what kind of fertilizers you use I

1396
01:04:19,278 --> 01:04:25,719
mean um but I think it's fair to say

1397
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:27,599
that uh um you know fertilizers can be a

1398
01:04:25,719 --> 01:04:31,399
source of heavy metal

1399
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:35,680
contamination um certainly

1400
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:38,318
um there is there any kind of um is

1401
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:40,838
there any kind of additional um

1402
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:44,199
environments that are that your plant is

1403
01:04:40,838 --> 01:04:46,920
being exposed to in the growing process

1404
01:04:44,199 --> 01:04:49,358
which you which you're not fully aware

1405
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:53,680
that there might be some kind of

1406
01:04:49,358 --> 01:04:54,960
contamination around um I think I think

1407
01:04:53,679 --> 01:04:57,598
you know I think I think it's fair to

1408
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:00,880
say based

1409
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:04,359
on based on you know an historical

1410
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:08,318
perspective that plants that are grown

1411
01:05:04,358 --> 01:05:09,239
indoors uh in theory going to be are

1412
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:12,239
going to

1413
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:14,879
contain less potential heavy metal

1414
01:05:12,239 --> 01:05:17,719
contamination than plants that are grown

1415
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:21,880
Outdoors um but there's still the

1416
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:24,919
opportunity um to expose your plants to

1417
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:28,960
some kind of heavy metal contamination

1418
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:33,519
um you know it's so sort of um I think I

1419
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:37,079
remember a few years ago that um one one

1420
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:41,639
manufacturer or one grower was using

1421
01:05:37,079 --> 01:05:44,920
some kind of um was using some kind of

1422
01:05:41,639 --> 01:05:47,639
Bud enhancer which contained which

1423
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:50,720
contained nickel and they asked me was

1424
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:53,558
was there some is there is there the

1425
01:05:50,719 --> 01:05:56,919
potential for the nickel in that bird

1426
01:05:53,559 --> 01:06:00,278
enhancer to find its way into the plant

1427
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:03,358
um and I said yeah there is um someone

1428
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:06,358
was using so and I can't remember who it

1429
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:09,719
was so don't quote me someone was using

1430
01:06:06,358 --> 01:06:12,278
a soluble silicate material to increase

1431
01:06:09,719 --> 01:06:14,639
the strength of their shoots and they

1432
01:06:12,278 --> 01:06:17,039
asked me is it possible that they and I

1433
01:06:14,639 --> 01:06:20,838
said yeah if you're using any external

1434
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:23,720
sources of any metal heavy metal

1435
01:06:20,838 --> 01:06:26,599
transision metal anything in the growing

1436
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:29,558
process says potentially it could end up

1437
01:06:26,599 --> 01:06:31,760
in the plant and if it's in the plant

1438
01:06:29,559 --> 01:06:33,559
potentially it can end up in the

1439
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,200
products that you're manufacturing from

1440
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:38,119
that

1441
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:39,759
plant so is silicon a big health risk

1442
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,559
though because it has a lot of different

1443
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:44,278
plant benefits it could be argued to

1444
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:48,680
even be an essential mineral in a lot of

1445
01:06:44,278 --> 01:06:51,079
cases um I think yeah well it depends

1446
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:54,000
what level of course yeah I mean it's

1447
01:06:51,079 --> 01:06:56,798
but there are there you know there are

1448
01:06:54,000 --> 01:07:00,318
environmental controls of these of these

1449
01:06:56,798 --> 01:07:03,679
elements and uh even though silicon is

1450
01:07:00,318 --> 01:07:06,519
is um is a you know it's an element that

1451
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:09,118
you find everywhere um in glass for

1452
01:07:06,519 --> 01:07:11,798
example it's very difficult to you know

1453
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:15,920
eliminate silicon from any material

1454
01:07:11,798 --> 01:07:19,639
that's exposed to Glass um but but but

1455
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:21,960
uh this grower was um adding higher

1456
01:07:19,639 --> 01:07:26,318
concentrations of silicates and I can't

1457
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:28,039
even remember in what form it was um but

1458
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:29,880
yeah I think if you typically it's

1459
01:07:28,039 --> 01:07:32,799
potassium silicate is the most common

1460
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:35,200
for okay all right yeah so I think uh if

1461
01:07:32,798 --> 01:07:37,920
you start exposing your plant to percent

1462
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:40,358
levels of silicates I think there's a

1463
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:42,720
good chance you could have higher than

1464
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:43,880
normal levels you know and ending up in

1465
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,598
your

1466
01:07:43,880 --> 01:07:48,920
product Oh we we do we do tissue testing

1467
01:07:46,599 --> 01:07:52,798
and see higher levels and higher levels

1468
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:56,278
of silicon is associated with uh reduced

1469
01:07:52,798 --> 01:08:00,038
uh or or higher High pest resistance um

1470
01:07:56,278 --> 01:08:02,760
thicker stocks uh it actually mitigates

1471
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:05,400
uh trace minerals it helps uh toxicities

1472
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:09,680
by better spreading those those minerals

1473
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:11,960
throughout the the biomass of the leaf

1474
01:08:09,679 --> 01:08:13,639
um I I guess I haven't heard of a lot of

1475
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,600
things associated with with the risks

1476
01:08:13,639 --> 01:08:19,278
associated with silicon because it is so

1477
01:08:16,600 --> 01:08:21,719
um ubiquitous in our environment and in

1478
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,319
our crops in general yeah I you know I

1479
01:08:21,719 --> 01:08:25,798
think you're right but it it's you know

1480
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:28,440
it's got to get to the point where um

1481
01:08:25,798 --> 01:08:30,759
obviously if you start uh um you know

1482
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:34,158
Finding you know really high levels of

1483
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:35,600
silicon in a product um I think there I

1484
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:38,519
think there could be questions then

1485
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:41,679
that's all I mean it's uh it's you know

1486
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:43,799
it's not as if it's um I think I think

1487
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:46,838
historically uh you know silicon has

1488
01:08:43,798 --> 01:08:50,399
been so uous you know in the environment

1489
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:52,399
um that if you look at the at the um you

1490
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,920
know regulated levels in you know in

1491
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:56,599
anything I mean silicon levels are

1492
01:08:53,920 --> 01:09:00,399
reasonably high so it's very difficult

1493
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:04,600
to um you know not have any silicon in

1494
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:06,639
in you know any kind of water um but um

1495
01:09:04,600 --> 01:09:09,798
you know nickel for example nickel was

1496
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:12,880
was used as a bird enhancer and uh you

1497
01:09:09,798 --> 01:09:15,960
know I mean nickel is a carcinogen at

1498
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,960
you know at high levels so um you you

1499
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:20,798
don't want high levels of you know

1500
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:22,560
Nickel in your product sure sure ni

1501
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:24,640
nickel I could I could totally

1502
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:26,239
understand um and maybe this next

1503
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:29,119
question isn't something that is your

1504
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:31,278
area of expertise but are there best

1505
01:09:29,119 --> 01:09:33,119
practices as a grower we can observe to

1506
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:36,199
reduce heavy metal uptake you know

1507
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:38,439
maintaining a higher media pH um taking

1508
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:41,238
samples from newer plant tissue removing

1509
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:43,759
more stem material uh what are some of

1510
01:09:41,238 --> 01:09:47,479
the things we can do as a

1511
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:50,158
grower from a cultivation yeah um I

1512
01:09:47,479 --> 01:09:51,278
think it's fair to say that um I mean

1513
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:54,679
you know depending on whether you're

1514
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:57,320
growing indoors or Outdoors um you know

1515
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:00,239
certainly plants that are grown Outdoors

1516
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:02,960
potentially there's going to be higher

1517
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:05,678
levels of you know what I call heavy

1518
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,960
metals but Elemental contaminants

1519
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:11,760
because heavy metals um there's no real

1520
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:14,399
definition to heavy medals because uh

1521
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:16,199
it's it could be one group to one one

1522
01:10:14,399 --> 01:10:18,238
you know it could be group metals to one

1523
01:10:16,198 --> 01:10:21,359
person and a different group you know to

1524
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:24,119
another person um but I I think it's

1525
01:10:21,359 --> 01:10:25,880
fair to say that there that there you

1526
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:30,519
know that there are ways to minimize

1527
01:10:25,880 --> 01:10:33,000
heavy metal uptake obviously um um you

1528
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:37,199
know if you're if if you're working with

1529
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:41,359
a um you know higher soil PH there's a

1530
01:10:37,198 --> 01:10:43,119
good chance that um you're going to be

1531
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:45,759
extracting

1532
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:48,119
um yeah you know certain heavy metals

1533
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:51,760
based on you know based on a lower pH

1534
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:54,119
and I I think it's fair to say that uh

1535
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:56,440
um there are you know there are ways to

1536
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:59,319
minimize the uptake of heavy metals I

1537
01:10:56,439 --> 01:11:03,519
mean we know that

1538
01:10:59,319 --> 01:11:06,238
um you know not sols that um you're

1539
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:08,679
naturally high in heavy metals um you

1540
01:11:06,238 --> 01:11:11,599
know you want to try and minimize based

1541
01:11:08,679 --> 01:11:14,480
on the pH of the soil but uh you you

1542
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:19,280
know you also want to make sure that

1543
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:21,639
your um that the soil chemistry is you

1544
01:11:19,279 --> 01:11:24,399
know I mean not just heavy metals but

1545
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:26,320
you're talking about the know phosphorus

1546
01:11:24,399 --> 01:11:29,759
potassium and nitrogen content you're

1547
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:33,079
talking about maybe you know the organic

1548
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:36,280
content um I think some sols are better

1549
01:11:33,079 --> 01:11:38,960
than others um but I think I think you

1550
01:11:36,279 --> 01:11:43,319
can minimize the uptake of heavy metals

1551
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:46,880
um you know by um you know by making

1552
01:11:43,319 --> 01:11:48,799
sure your so chemistry is Optimum um but

1553
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:53,079
at the end of the day I don't think

1554
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:55,119
you're going to you know stop the stop

1555
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:57,359
the extraction of heavy metals from the

1556
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:59,279
soil when you know when you're growing

1557
01:11:57,359 --> 01:12:02,198
anything particularly

1558
01:11:59,279 --> 01:12:06,198
Outdoors um

1559
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:08,759
so I mean you know I just think that you

1560
01:12:06,198 --> 01:12:12,039
that you have to be realistic um I mean

1561
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:13,719
particularly nowadays where um you know

1562
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:17,359
most of the growing of hemp in

1563
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:19,039
particular is outdoors so um there's you

1564
01:12:17,359 --> 01:12:23,639
know there's only so much you can do to

1565
01:12:19,039 --> 01:12:26,439
a soil you can try and um um you know

1566
01:12:23,639 --> 01:12:29,560
increase the pH slightly by maybe adding

1567
01:12:26,439 --> 01:12:31,799
lime to your soil um because you know

1568
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,239
the more acidic the soil is the you know

1569
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:37,000
the more chance you're going to uptake

1570
01:12:33,238 --> 01:12:39,319
heavy metals um but there are you know

1571
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:43,520
there are there there are materials to

1572
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:46,519
add um to reduce heavy metal uptake

1573
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:49,040
things like um organic biochars which

1574
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:51,679
are basically changing the soil

1575
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:55,560
chemistry and uh you know stopping the

1576
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:58,279
stopping the formation um of ions in

1577
01:12:55,560 --> 01:13:00,679
solution uh so I mean there are you know

1578
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:03,559
historically there are ways to minimize

1579
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:06,359
the uptake of heavy metals um you know

1580
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:09,159
for for any plant material but my

1581
01:13:06,359 --> 01:13:12,238
question is is the Cannabis industry

1582
01:13:09,158 --> 01:13:15,238
really looking at those approaches

1583
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:19,198
because they may be increasing the cost

1584
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:23,119
of production we know that there's um a

1585
01:13:19,198 --> 01:13:26,198
lot of work done in the area of biochars

1586
01:13:23,119 --> 01:13:29,719
from natural products from say um nuts

1587
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:33,960
and um you know biomass which is used to

1588
01:13:29,719 --> 01:13:35,679
till into the soil which really um is a

1589
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:38,760
way of capturing the heavy metals and

1590
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:42,079
stops its bioavailability for the plant

1591
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:45,760
so there are ways of doing that um but

1592
01:13:42,079 --> 01:13:47,600
is it cost effective I me I don't know

1593
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:49,039
yeah I mean this is a topic that I've

1594
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:51,280
been researching pretty heavily in the

1595
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:52,279
last couple years and as a as someone

1596
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,559
who works with a lot of different

1597
01:13:52,279 --> 01:13:56,840
cultivators it very states that have a

1598
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:58,840
variety of regulations um yeah there are

1599
01:13:56,840 --> 01:14:02,119
things we're doing like running a higher

1600
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,480
media pH um in our soils and utilizing a

1601
01:14:02,119 --> 01:14:06,479
very clean source of biochar so we're

1602
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:10,319
not adding more heavy metals from the

1603
01:14:06,479 --> 01:14:13,119
way the biochar is produced um you know

1604
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,759
testing all of our inputs so it's

1605
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,519
impossible to have a perfectly clean

1606
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:20,199
organic soil and and nutrient program

1607
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:22,760
because these you know heavy metals are

1608
01:14:20,198 --> 01:14:27,039
sort of ubiquitous in any M product or

1609
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:29,840
any soil or any ocean uh based product

1610
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:31,479
but we are I think we are working to

1611
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:33,360
reduce those and then it's it really

1612
01:14:31,479 --> 01:14:36,119
comes down to management you know

1613
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:39,198
between our our water and our media and

1614
01:14:36,119 --> 01:14:41,039
our nutrients can we keep that level at

1615
01:14:39,198 --> 01:14:42,879
that at a passing threshold where the

1616
01:14:41,039 --> 01:14:45,079
plant is going to take it up but take it

1617
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,440
up at a level that's lower than what

1618
01:14:45,079 --> 01:14:50,639
we're bringing in every cycle to renew

1619
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:52,879
our fertility so it is something that I

1620
01:14:50,639 --> 01:14:55,039
think we're actively looking to manage

1621
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:57,199
but it's it's a struggle

1622
01:14:55,039 --> 01:14:59,479
because we're not getting a lot of great

1623
01:14:57,198 --> 01:15:02,678
information back from the labs um or

1624
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:06,759
from Regulators as we try to to navigate

1625
01:15:02,679 --> 01:15:09,719
all of this yeah and I I I feel like I

1626
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:11,520
think that's where I'm critical of the

1627
01:15:09,719 --> 01:15:15,880
industry is

1628
01:15:11,520 --> 01:15:19,840
that it need and this is um if you like

1629
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:22,560
um my my my I mean my beef I feel the

1630
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:24,960
industry as a whole is not looking at

1631
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,480
this problem and trying to resolve it as

1632
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:30,039
an industry there are individual parts

1633
01:15:27,479 --> 01:15:32,678
of the industry that are trying to do

1634
01:15:30,039 --> 01:15:36,399
their bit but as an industry they're not

1635
01:15:32,679 --> 01:15:39,239
coming together because um I mean

1636
01:15:36,399 --> 01:15:42,198
clearly um we know that hemp and

1637
01:15:39,238 --> 01:15:45,158
cannabis are very strong hyper

1638
01:15:42,198 --> 01:15:47,678
accumulators if if it's in the soil hemp

1639
01:15:45,158 --> 01:15:49,799
or cannabis will find it and suck it up

1640
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:53,600
that's you know that's the type of plant

1641
01:15:49,800 --> 01:15:56,239
it is and um you know how I mean how do

1642
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:59,199
you minimize that and if it's in there

1643
01:15:56,238 --> 01:16:02,279
can you stop it getting into your

1644
01:15:59,198 --> 01:16:05,559
initial product which are basically um

1645
01:16:02,279 --> 01:16:08,279
you know um an extract which is uh which

1646
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:11,199
is going to be used uh for further use

1647
01:16:08,279 --> 01:16:14,158
some dine some some way down the line to

1648
01:16:11,198 --> 01:16:17,439
produce a commercial product but the

1649
01:16:14,158 --> 01:16:20,399
whole process of going from growing

1650
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:23,839
cannabis and hemp to a consumer that's

1651
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:25,319
using something um there's a lot of

1652
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,159
there's a lot of way there's a lot of

1653
01:16:25,319 --> 01:16:30,880
areas in between where the industry

1654
01:16:28,158 --> 01:16:33,559
could be doing more you know I mean in

1655
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:35,880
my opinion I mean having having having

1656
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:38,520
come from Industries which have been

1657
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,480
highly regulated and and knowing how

1658
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:42,560
they've approached you know

1659
01:16:40,479 --> 01:16:46,559
contamination of heavy metals from a

1660
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:49,199
wide um array of sources is that the

1661
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:52,840
industry is not working together it

1662
01:16:49,198 --> 01:16:56,000
seems to be working individual Parts

1663
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:59,600
seem to be working in isolation from the

1664
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:01,719
others and I think it could be doing a

1665
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:04,840
lot more to making sure that there are

1666
01:17:01,719 --> 01:17:06,480
safer products out there now uh you know

1667
01:17:04,840 --> 01:17:09,239
I'm not being critical but in the four

1668
01:17:06,479 --> 01:17:10,959
years that I've been in the the industry

1669
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:13,519
I've looked at individual areas

1670
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,119
individual components and everyone is

1671
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:17,679
doing their little bit but we're not

1672
01:17:16,119 --> 01:17:20,479
getting the industry is not getting

1673
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:21,920
together as a whole and deciding how

1674
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:24,799
they're going to approach this for the

1675
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:26,480
benefit of the user

1676
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:31,039
okay well la last question I have for

1677
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:34,039
you because um my uh my friend and

1678
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:35,399
cooworker uh Brandon Hudson watched uh

1679
01:17:34,039 --> 01:17:38,560
went to that conference that you were

1680
01:17:35,399 --> 01:17:40,359
recently a part of um talking about

1681
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,039
heavy metals more from a laboratory

1682
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:46,519
regulatory perspective y but um after

1683
01:17:44,039 --> 01:17:49,039
after attending he said I'm never going

1684
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:50,719
to vape again uh so let's talk about

1685
01:17:49,039 --> 01:17:52,439
vaping you know and you you published

1686
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:54,000
articles on these I will link to those

1687
01:17:52,439 --> 01:17:57,039
articles

1688
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:58,960
in five minutes can you tell me why it's

1689
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,279
so dangerous compared to other methods

1690
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:04,039
of consumption and why you would say

1691
01:18:01,279 --> 01:18:08,158
it's probably a good idea to not

1692
01:18:04,039 --> 01:18:11,319
Vape um

1693
01:18:08,158 --> 01:18:15,279
well I'm I'm fighting an industry here

1694
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:18,198
which is which is very difficult to uh

1695
01:18:15,279 --> 01:18:20,359
to really get them to fully understand

1696
01:18:18,198 --> 01:18:21,839
what the issues are look I've never

1697
01:18:20,359 --> 01:18:23,639
smoked in my life I've never smoked a

1698
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:27,560
cigarette in my life you can believe

1699
01:18:23,639 --> 01:18:29,319
that but I haven't so I can I can me

1700
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:32,600
either actually I've never had a

1701
01:18:29,319 --> 01:18:36,479
cigarette so so uh I could look at an

1702
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:38,719
industry which is um where vaping has

1703
01:18:36,479 --> 01:18:41,519
become I don't know the percentage but I

1704
01:18:38,719 --> 01:18:44,719
would say probably close to 50% of the

1705
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:46,639
consumption of cannabinoid is done by

1706
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:50,600
some kind of vaping device I don't know

1707
01:18:46,639 --> 01:18:54,199
but that's my guess um and for for an

1708
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:59,320
industry that's developed these vaping

1709
01:18:54,198 --> 01:19:03,359
systems with no real forethought on how

1710
01:18:59,319 --> 01:19:06,479
the liquid or the um the the product

1711
01:19:03,359 --> 01:19:08,880
inside the inside the device is getting

1712
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:12,039
consumed so in other words we have a

1713
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:14,359
liquid it's diluted with something maybe

1714
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:18,679
vitamin E acetate maybe actually it

1715
01:19:14,359 --> 01:19:22,960
isn't anymore but maybe with um um you

1716
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:26,920
know propylene G glycol or maybe um MCA

1717
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:31,679
M MCA oil I mean but you know the number

1718
01:19:26,920 --> 01:19:36,199
of opportunities for that solution to

1719
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:39,199
extract metals from The Vaping device is

1720
01:19:36,198 --> 01:19:42,119
numerous whether it's left um in the

1721
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:44,479
device and it's left to corrode the

1722
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:47,960
internal devices the internal you know

1723
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:49,959
metallic components and it's been shown

1724
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:52,279
that even even when a device has not

1725
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:54,319
been used it's been on a retailer shelf

1726
01:19:52,279 --> 01:19:59,759
for three months mons it's extracted

1727
01:19:54,319 --> 01:20:01,840
metals from the coil from the tank um so

1728
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:04,600
if you start there that even before the

1729
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:07,000
device has been Vaped there are metal

1730
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,800
impurities in the in the extract in the

1731
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:13,039
liquid inside it and then all of a

1732
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:15,960
sudden you ramp it up to sometimes 400°

1733
01:20:13,039 --> 01:20:18,399
celus so you're taking those metal

1734
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:21,480
particles which have which have been

1735
01:20:18,399 --> 01:20:23,439
maybe corroded from inside the device

1736
01:20:21,479 --> 01:20:27,238
and now you're beginning to Elevate the

1737
01:20:23,439 --> 01:20:30,158
temperature to 4 or 500° C you know

1738
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:33,638
together with the cannaboid and someone

1739
01:20:30,158 --> 01:20:35,960
is inhaling that and it's going into

1740
01:20:33,639 --> 01:20:37,679
their airways going into their lungs

1741
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:40,639
they're getting some satisfaction from

1742
01:20:37,679 --> 01:20:43,719
the cannaboid but where are those metal

1743
01:20:40,639 --> 01:20:47,039
particles going they're probably going

1744
01:20:43,719 --> 01:20:52,319
somewhere they're being cated somewhere

1745
01:20:47,039 --> 01:20:54,880
in the personals vaping Airways and um

1746
01:20:52,319 --> 01:20:57,920
there there there's clearly there's very

1747
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:59,239
little done to make sure that those

1748
01:20:57,920 --> 01:21:02,560
vaping

1749
01:20:59,238 --> 01:21:05,000
devices are not are not being

1750
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:06,039
contaminated with metal components that

1751
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:10,158
they made

1752
01:21:06,039 --> 01:21:13,238
from so um you know my beef is that why

1753
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:16,158
why isn't there any effort being made to

1754
01:21:13,238 --> 01:21:18,158
produce a much cleaner device I can

1755
01:21:16,158 --> 01:21:21,879
understand that cost is probably the

1756
01:21:18,158 --> 01:21:24,319
problem but there are metals out there

1757
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:29,359
which are far less corrosive than things

1758
01:21:24,319 --> 01:21:33,158
like stainless steel um okay nichrome

1759
01:21:29,359 --> 01:21:35,158
nicel um cantal which many of these

1760
01:21:33,158 --> 01:21:39,319
devices have in them and they're

1761
01:21:35,158 --> 01:21:42,638
notorious for and uh in a corrosive

1762
01:21:39,319 --> 01:21:44,639
atmosphere um they're notorious for for

1763
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:47,159
actually dissolving into into the liquid

1764
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:49,840
into the solution and where you know

1765
01:21:47,158 --> 01:21:53,039
where does it go it goes into the lungs

1766
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,719
of the of the person who's vaping and I

1767
01:21:53,039 --> 01:21:56,800
think the industry has to do a much

1768
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:59,520
better job of making sure that the

1769
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:02,199
devices themselves are cleaner there's

1770
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:04,120
so much out there that I that that I see

1771
01:22:02,198 --> 01:22:06,638
which is not being published because

1772
01:22:04,119 --> 01:22:08,960
this is something if you like I've I've

1773
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:11,880
kind of taken it upon myself to get a

1774
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:13,960
better understand because um I worked

1775
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:16,359
for Perkin for 25 years and we sold a

1776
01:22:13,960 --> 01:22:18,840
lot of our equipment to the CDC who

1777
01:22:16,359 --> 01:22:21,039
responsible for characterizing nicotine

1778
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:23,400
vaping devices and although they've

1779
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:26,920
published a little bit on their on their

1780
01:22:23,399 --> 01:22:29,279
work um they they have not really been

1781
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:33,279
allowed to look at cannaboid vaping

1782
01:22:29,279 --> 01:22:35,639
devices and my contact the CDC says that

1783
01:22:33,279 --> 01:22:37,719
who knows what's going on with you know

1784
01:22:35,639 --> 01:22:40,159
corrosion of metal components with these

1785
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:43,198
vaping devices because they can be a lot

1786
01:22:40,158 --> 01:22:44,519
more corrosive um you know than nicotine

1787
01:22:43,198 --> 01:22:48,759
um

1788
01:22:44,520 --> 01:22:52,880
Solutions so um it's it's it's an area

1789
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:54,760
which I think is probably going to um

1790
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:58,079
there's going to be a lot more research

1791
01:22:54,760 --> 01:23:00,639
done on it um but I believe it's a tick

1792
01:22:58,079 --> 01:23:04,479
in Time Bomb we've seen the vitamin E

1793
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:08,520
acetate crisis of 2019 Reit ugly head

1794
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:12,839
with 300 cases of hospitalization and 70

1795
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:17,080
deaths um you know I don't like to

1796
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:19,679
appear to be like a like a doomsday here

1797
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:21,800
but I think there I think potentially

1798
01:23:19,679 --> 01:23:25,760
there's another vitamin acidic crisis

1799
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:27,880
waiting to happen with vaping devices um

1800
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:31,400
they're just so widely used and there's

1801
01:23:27,880 --> 01:23:33,639
very little being done to uh you know to

1802
01:23:31,399 --> 01:23:36,359
really put a check on

1803
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:38,239
them thank you I I I really appreciate

1804
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:41,319
you sharing that um and hopefully that

1805
01:23:38,238 --> 01:23:42,799
raises some awareness for for people and

1806
01:23:41,319 --> 01:23:45,439
you know they can make better health

1807
01:23:42,800 --> 01:23:46,920
decisions or or do their own research if

1808
01:23:45,439 --> 01:23:49,759
they're going to continue you know that

1809
01:23:46,920 --> 01:23:52,279
practice so yeah I I you know I think I

1810
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:54,360
think it's fair to say that the industry

1811
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:57,039
is is moving very very rapidly and I

1812
01:23:54,359 --> 01:23:59,759
think because of the industry is moving

1813
01:23:57,039 --> 01:24:02,679
so rapidly you know regulations often

1814
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:04,960
struggle to keep up with it now you know

1815
01:24:02,679 --> 01:24:07,679
you can argue that the FDA will probably

1816
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:10,719
be involved at some point although

1817
01:24:07,679 --> 01:24:14,039
there's no real sign that they that they

1818
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:17,560
really want to at the moment um but

1819
01:24:14,039 --> 01:24:19,158
State Regulators have um have a vested

1820
01:24:17,560 --> 01:24:21,080
interest in seeing Revenue in their

1821
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:24,359
particular s so I don't particularly

1822
01:24:21,079 --> 01:24:26,119
blame them but I think the industry

1823
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:28,079
needs to take a hard look at itself

1824
01:24:26,119 --> 01:24:30,719
because I think there's stuff going on

1825
01:24:28,079 --> 01:24:33,960
which uh under a federally regulated

1826
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:35,639
system you know you might not see well

1827
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:37,719
well I really appreciate you sharing all
