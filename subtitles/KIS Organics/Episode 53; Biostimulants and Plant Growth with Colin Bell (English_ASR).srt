32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,890
plants now on to the podcast

33
00:01:29,810 --> 00:01:32,930
hey Colin thanks for coming on the show

34
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,759
today

35
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:37,920
dad hey how are you doing it's great

36
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,868
talking to you today yeah I'm excited to

37
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,118
have you on here I've known you for a

38
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,879
long time and we've chatted you know

39
00:01:42,118 --> 00:01:47,040
become friends through this process and

40
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:49,739
I wanted to get you on to talk a little

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,049
bit about microbes since that's sort of

42
00:01:49,739 --> 00:01:53,489
what your your background is in and

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:55,618
microbes are my saying I appreciate

44
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:58,140
that's a perfect topic for us to discuss

45
00:01:55,618 --> 00:01:59,909
today well can we start off by giving

46
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:02,519
listeners a little idea of your own

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:05,880
backgrounds you know going back into

48
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:08,579
maybe into college sir absolutely so you

49
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:12,359
know from from an academic and college

50
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,830
perspective I ended up getting a PhD in

51
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,630
soil microbiome micro by

52
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,030
Algie but it was really a speciality in

53
00:02:15,629 --> 00:02:21,599
microbial ecology which is the study of

54
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:23,789
microbes in the environment mostly how

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:26,099
they integrate with plants and if I kind

56
00:02:23,789 --> 00:02:28,590
of interact with climate as well on some

57
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:31,109
level I was a desert microbial ecologist

58
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:32,819
for years and years I did a lot of work

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,770
in the Chihuahuan Desert and I did some

60
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:36,959
work in the Great Basin and different

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,700
parts of the trail one desert and what I

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,610
was looking at we did a lot of climate

63
00:02:38,699 --> 00:02:43,859
change studies in my research as a

64
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:45,300
student and then in professional in my

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,660
professional career I worked for the

66
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,920
USDA department of agriculture

67
00:02:47,659 --> 00:02:52,650
agricultural research services is called

68
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,929
the USDA ARS I worked from the Forest

69
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:56,550
Service and then I worked for Colorado

70
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:59,580
State University the natural resource

71
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,050
ecology lab and almost all the projects

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,730
that I was employed in and those

73
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:05,939
different organizations were relating

74
00:03:02,729 --> 00:03:07,889
not only effects of climate change but

75
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,009
those effects and how plant microbe

76
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:13,319
interactions responded to climate

77
00:03:11,009 --> 00:03:16,340
scenarios and so I have a long-standing

78
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,650
career in understanding how microbes

79
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:21,900
interact with plants not only in in

80
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,430
natural settings but also in agriculture

81
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,390
settings so I've been geeking out on

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:29,099
this holy moly for almost 20 years now

83
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:31,679
that's great you know I want to talk a

84
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:33,780
little bit about how you founded the

85
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,670
company and some of that stuff too but

86
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,919
you've already brought up some really

87
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,589
interesting questions for me one of the

88
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,299
things that I'm curious about is how how

89
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,170
do you microbes differ different in

90
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:48,360
these various regions geographically and

91
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:51,179
then what sort of persistence DC because

92
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,330
I guess when I was I got to go to this

93
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,400
soil science meeting a couple years ago

94
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:58,590
now and one of the things that they

95
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,590
talked about was how microbial

96
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,090
populations will differ just from you

97
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,400
know just from watering or hydrology

98
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:07,140
will change the populations quite a bit

99
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,300
and again over a you know a fairly short

100
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,329
period of time so what were you seeing

101
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:14,340
you know sort of on a macro scale with

102
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:16,859
these microbes yeah there's a lot of

103
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,810
great work on this and we you can look

104
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:22,048
up some of it also I'm talking to the

105
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:25,100
listeners here as a mile microbial

106
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:27,509
biogeography is kind of the the study of

107
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:33,310
microbes and how they're dispersed

108
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:35,620
across a large geography so to speak but

109
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:38,319
but what it really comes down to and

110
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:41,019
this comes back to the very fundamentals

111
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:43,540
of microbiology 101 and that's an

112
00:04:41,019 --> 00:04:46,180
environment selects tab and in all these

113
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,129
microbial biogeography studies what

114
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:52,269
you're going to find is the only way to

115
00:04:48,129 --> 00:04:54,159
look to to correlate why microbial

116
00:04:52,269 --> 00:04:56,589
communities and communities is

117
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:59,710
assemblage of multiple species and so

118
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,989
microbes don't exist as isolates or a

119
00:04:59,709 --> 00:05:04,599
single species in nature they exist as a

120
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,970
community or consortium just to be clear

121
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,760
and so you're looking at have microbes

122
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:12,070
and how their relative abundances form a

123
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,110
broader community or the total microbial

124
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:15,788
biomass within any region that's

125
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,740
typically how these questions are framed

126
00:05:15,788 --> 00:05:20,379
and you're looking at the environmental

127
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:22,269
factors there could be cold there could

128
00:05:20,379 --> 00:05:25,569
be heat there could be moisture there

129
00:05:22,269 --> 00:05:27,099
could be soil textures have a big big

130
00:05:25,569 --> 00:05:28,240
part to do with it you know there's sand

131
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,919
silt clay and they have different

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,650
hydrology properties and there's this

133
00:05:29,918 --> 00:05:35,589
interaction more importantly and then

134
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:38,500
there's pH which as a big II know if the

135
00:05:35,589 --> 00:05:41,049
era is one of my favorite microbial

136
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,389
ecology scientists of all time he's here

137
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:46,120
at Colorado University of Colorado in

138
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:47,590
Boulder he's got a lot of great science

139
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,819
and we could probably make an

140
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:51,909
introduction we should get him on the

141
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,469
show sometime man he's smart but uh he's

142
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:57,870
done a lot of this work and what he

143
00:05:53,470 --> 00:06:01,240
found was more than any one factor pH

144
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:05,050
significantly shifts microbial community

145
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:07,598
assemblage across a wide geographic

146
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:10,418
region and again there's a lot of

147
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:12,969
factors that control environmental

148
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:15,728
factors that interact to actually

149
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,440
control and form these environments you

150
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:19,598
think about biodiversity to add from the

151
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,990
equator from a plant perspective it's

152
00:06:19,598 --> 00:06:26,728
been well studied moving outward towards

153
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:31,660
the poles you get more diversity at the

154
00:06:26,728 --> 00:06:33,610
at the center and then it it narrows as

155
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:36,250
you get to the poles because environment

156
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:39,230
selects plant species and more

157
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,660
hospitable environment allow for more

158
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:45,259
diversity and more biomass and more

159
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:48,650
climate and more and more cohabitation

160
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:51,860
so to speak and then as we go up through

161
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:53,810
North America through Canada etc you get

162
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,730
fewer species because they environment

163
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:58,850
that much harsher you can think about

164
00:06:55,730 --> 00:07:02,569
that from a microbial perspective but

165
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:05,240
it's not on that scale it's on a micro

166
00:07:02,569 --> 00:07:09,170
scale and so these ad aphek which are

167
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:12,110
soil properties are and and temperature

168
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:15,290
and hydrology are the main properties

169
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,699
that influence microbial communities and

170
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:21,250
I want to overlay

171
00:07:16,699 --> 00:07:26,599
one extra interaction and that's plant

172
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:30,199
because microbes in soil around the

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:33,530
world interact and cohabitate very well

174
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:36,139
with plant in the writes us here a root

175
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,619
zone because those are nice food sources

176
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:41,839
and so another layer that controls

177
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,810
biodiversity is actually how plant and

178
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,579
different plant species might be feeding

179
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,379
microbial communities within their

180
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,229
righteous fear when they're with a root

181
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:54,290
zone in the soil well that's a lot to

182
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:56,390
think about so essentially if you were

183
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:59,360
to bring a plant then I'm thinking into

184
00:07:56,389 --> 00:08:03,289
a regional community that would have a

185
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:07,280
pretty a pretty dramatic affect effect

186
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:09,950
on the biology in that rises here so yes

187
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:12,709
so it would have a dramatic effect

188
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:16,610
potentially in the soil so microbes

189
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:18,949
occurrence soil and let me let me layer

190
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:22,400
this one more so I was obsessed for a

191
00:08:18,949 --> 00:08:25,339
while as academically as a research

192
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:28,429
scientist of how plants might be able to

193
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:31,519
engineer unique Rice's here microbial

194
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:35,029
communities which is the microbes in

195
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:38,019
their root zone to support plant success

196
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,610
and some of the examples that I was

197
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,168
hypothesizing were invasive species and

198
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,970
I worked with cheatgrass for a while

199
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:46,069
because I was it was an interesting

200
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:47,779
grass species it's an invasive grass

201
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:50,390
species that's spread across North

202
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:52,579
America it's not that great of a forage

203
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:54,439
for cattle but it was introduced by

204
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,900
humans because it grew quick and it

205
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:00,410
greened up quick in the season so it was

206
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:02,360
it was planted to try and feed cattle

207
00:09:00,409 --> 00:09:04,399
earlier what happened is it dries

208
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,350
earlier it creates a lot of seeds and it

209
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,049
chokes out other later season grasses

210
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:12,139
ultimately and it wasn't a good choice

211
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:14,120
to introduce but it is what it is and

212
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:16,309
it's spread across the country one of

213
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,409
the hypotheses and I published this work

214
00:09:16,309 --> 00:09:20,989
now and I could probably show this paper

215
00:09:18,409 --> 00:09:24,529
with you for sure is a sort of

216
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,539
cheatgrass engineer unique rhizosphere

217
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:29,329
microbes as it spreads through different

218
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:31,579
soil types to nurture its success to

219
00:09:29,330 --> 00:09:34,460
help promote its ability to create seed

220
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:37,490
to create biomass so maybe compete below

221
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:41,420
ground so it even has a stronger

222
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:43,759
competitive advantage from from a

223
00:09:41,419 --> 00:09:46,039
physiological point of view and so I did

224
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:49,039
conduct that study and some native

225
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:50,809
grasslands and not only in the field but

226
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:52,909
also replicated it in greenhouse that

227
00:09:50,809 --> 00:09:54,769
he's going we realize that different

228
00:09:52,909 --> 00:09:59,089
grass species and different

229
00:09:54,769 --> 00:10:01,759
photosynthetic groups c3 c4 some forb

230
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:06,980
species and even some cam species are

231
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:09,139
able to uniquely engineer different

232
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:12,860
microbial community assemblages at some

233
00:10:09,139 --> 00:10:15,830
level with their root exudates and the

234
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,980
root structure so there's a lot to that

235
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:21,530
but the other physical properties of pH

236
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,659
may be a soil texture and temperature

237
00:10:21,529 --> 00:10:28,069
and hydrology I'll fill it will it's

238
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:29,839
that so you know I hear a lot of a lot

239
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:34,370
of talk about like fungal to bacterial

240
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,710
ratios in soils and such but that almost

241
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:39,019
feels too reductionist to me in a lot of

242
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:41,180
ways because what you're essentially

243
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:44,919
saying is that this in your example here

244
00:10:41,179 --> 00:10:47,629
this grass is able to change the

245
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:49,579
microbial you know populations or

246
00:10:47,629 --> 00:10:51,649
communities in the soil around the

247
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:54,830
rhizosphere making it more hospitable

248
00:10:51,649 --> 00:10:58,519
for this one grass and less hospitable

249
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,990
for other grasses so if I'm

250
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:02,360
understanding correctly would you say

251
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,360
then that that if we want to look at

252
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,669
this

253
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,318
from a broader perspective that that

254
00:11:05,669 --> 00:11:11,308
might be challenging to do we really

255
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:13,769
have to identify the actual consortium

256
00:11:11,308 --> 00:11:15,629
in you know with each with each

257
00:11:13,769 --> 00:11:18,659
particular plant species and the impact

258
00:11:15,629 --> 00:11:19,170
it has on soil or am I totally missing

259
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,088
the point here

260
00:11:19,169 --> 00:11:23,099
are you saying are you thinking relative

261
00:11:21,089 --> 00:11:25,619
taking it one step to a higher

262
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,449
resolution than just using growth fun

263
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:28,439
fun little backfill ratios is that what

264
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:29,008
you're trying to make the comparison

265
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,688
fourth

266
00:11:29,009 --> 00:11:34,048
yeah I'm not explaining this very

267
00:11:30,688 --> 00:11:36,480
accurately but essentially you know so

268
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:38,278
so what I'm trying to get at is that we

269
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,420
have a lot of people claiming that if

270
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,278
you get the you know fungal the

271
00:11:39,419 --> 00:11:43,019
bacterial ratio is correct or if you use

272
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:46,278
these specific indigenous microbes you

273
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:49,528
may get certain impacts on plant health

274
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,879
but to me that feels a little a little

275
00:11:49,528 --> 00:11:55,708
squishy like we still don't know exactly

276
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:57,899
what's going on and you know what I'm

277
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:59,188
finding is that there's so there's so

278
00:11:57,899 --> 00:12:01,708
much in the range when we say the word

279
00:11:59,188 --> 00:12:04,318
bacteria or archaea like there's so much

280
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:08,308
we still don't know and there's so much

281
00:12:04,318 --> 00:12:10,878
that falls into those kingdoms that do

282
00:12:08,308 --> 00:12:14,188
we do can we really make those sorts of

283
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:17,850
comparisons at that macro level or macro

284
00:12:14,188 --> 00:12:21,868
scale well you can make them but it's

285
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:24,149
it's about defining the assumptions and

286
00:12:21,869 --> 00:12:25,889
what actually what data you can actually

287
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,749
get from those and I think I think what

288
00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:30,329
you're saying is a really fair statement

289
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:33,269
I used to use fungal bacterial ratios to

290
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:35,039
kind of assess as one measure of

291
00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:37,798
assessing plant health across different

292
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,539
ecosystems and and and sometimes you're

293
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:42,448
like oh this might look interesting but

294
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:44,610
it's very limiting and until you dive in

295
00:12:42,448 --> 00:12:48,238
like you suggested to the actual

296
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:49,949
contributors of those fungal populations

297
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:51,860
and those bacterial populations or

298
00:12:49,948 --> 00:12:53,998
communities more specifically

299
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:55,678
assemblages of different fungal species

300
00:12:53,999 --> 00:12:58,319
assemblages of different microbial

301
00:12:55,678 --> 00:12:59,850
bacterial species you're you're not

302
00:12:58,318 --> 00:13:02,159
you're gonna have limited information

303
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:04,558
and what I mean by that is you know

304
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:06,058
fungi have different functional groups

305
00:13:04,558 --> 00:13:08,399
you know there's some more muscular

306
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:12,958
mycorrhizal groups that perform specific

307
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:15,688
functions as symbiotic plant roots and

308
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:16,679
there is a lot of plant specificity here

309
00:13:15,688 --> 00:13:18,659
we're supposed to

310
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:20,789
big fungal species of our busco

311
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:23,100
mycorrhizae are only really associated

312
00:13:20,789 --> 00:13:24,929
with certain grasses and echo

313
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,580
mycorrhizal another example where

314
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,639
there's some real specificity of those

315
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:31,470
host plants to these fungi and then

316
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,269
other fungi do a very good job of

317
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,139
decomposing and breaking down organic

318
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:38,970
matter and so those functional groups

319
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:40,588
are pretty typical of fungi and there's

320
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:44,899
some nutrient cycling but in the

321
00:13:40,589 --> 00:13:47,520
bacterial world there's a lot more

322
00:13:44,899 --> 00:13:48,629
functional group specificity meaning

323
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,259
that there are certain groups of

324
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:54,750
bacteria that are very specific for you

325
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:57,059
know known for delivering or cycling

326
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,730
nitrogen or or phosphorus or other

327
00:13:57,059 --> 00:14:02,429
nutrients or doing more specific

328
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:06,180
functions and so you really have to know

329
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:09,659
what's there to form again what I was

330
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:12,329
going to say is to form robust

331
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:15,000
hypothesis and any kind of de there any

332
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:18,570
kind of science if it's good it's really

333
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,278
just generating more better questions

334
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:22,890
that you can address the new studies and

335
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:25,649
and that's the iterative process of of

336
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:28,080
science and the scientific method we

337
00:14:25,649 --> 00:14:31,019
have these hypothesis these guesses that

338
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,720
we hope resemble some form of reality we

339
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:38,399
test them and with the answers that we

340
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:40,440
get we're going to we're going to ask

341
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,069
new questions we're going to test those

342
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,959
new questions via hypothesis through new

343
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:48,150
experiments and so it's kind of a

344
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:49,949
never-ending cycle I kind of enjoyed

345
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:52,470
that never-ending cycle I don't do as

346
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:54,950
much experimental science as I used to

347
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:57,870
but that's the idea and that led me down

348
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,778
many really great paths of understanding

349
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:03,240
how microbes are engaging with different

350
00:15:00,778 --> 00:15:05,159
plants and in desert systems or more

351
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:07,889
music grassland systems and it kind of

352
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:12,149
just forms my my perspective of how

353
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:14,399
nature performs and functions at least

354
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:16,559
on some level you know as a scientist

355
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,419
dad I actually think about everything

356
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,708
from a microbial perspective first I

357
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:22,679
don't know if that's healthy or not but

358
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:24,449
I can't help it I just think that's how

359
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:26,429
that's the scale that I think adds

360
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,250
enough get then I kind of extrapolated

361
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:31,129
that from there

362
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:33,860
so so we know that a ratio of fungal to

363
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:37,610
bacterial in soil will influence the

364
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:41,000
soil pH and we typically see certain

365
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:42,529
ratios associated with the types of

366
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,500
plants in terms of like a plant

367
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:46,730
succession table that we see in soils so

368
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,340
we'll see higher levels of fungal

369
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:52,550
activity in forests over grasslands for

370
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,680
example but what I'm wondering is can we

371
00:15:52,549 --> 00:15:58,519
take that data and extrapolate it any

372
00:15:54,679 --> 00:16:01,339
further like it sounds to me and from my

373
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:03,159
own just online research it's it appears

374
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:06,350
to me that the plant really controls

375
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:08,569
that relationship more than its one of

376
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:14,269
the strongest variables and determine

377
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:15,710
microbial populations more so than you

378
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,049
know what a lot of people try to do when

379
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:19,460
they try to add specific microbes we're

380
00:16:18,049 --> 00:16:21,620
trying to make compost teas that are

381
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:25,070
more you know it contain more bacteria

382
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,889
than fungi for example it seems like the

383
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:29,090
plant is really the driver of that

384
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:30,590
microbial community is that would you

385
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,060
agree with that or what do you think I

386
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,790
mean I know there's so many variables

387
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:37,879
like you mentioned and it's really the

388
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:41,029
functional consortium for when we're

389
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:42,649
trying to improve the rhizosphere but

390
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:45,019
what do you see is the real driver there

391
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:47,539
in that system yeah so I think that's

392
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:49,789
that's a great point a little consent

393
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:52,459
conceptually here you know you think

394
00:16:49,789 --> 00:16:55,370
about even even desert systems you know

395
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,670
they're very very much higher fun little

396
00:16:55,370 --> 00:17:02,000
bacterial ratios are all relative to

397
00:16:58,669 --> 00:17:04,399
abundance of fungi versus bacteria and

398
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,680
in natural systems in general and all

399
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,709
terrestrial systems they're typically

400
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:11,449
going to have higher all natural

401
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,459
terrestrial ecosystems you're going to

402
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:15,380
have higher fungal go back jobs you're

403
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:18,199
gonna have higher fungal bacterial

404
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:19,850
ratios then you are obviously in aquatic

405
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,949
systems because fungi don't thrive in

406
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,740
aquatic systems and you are in

407
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:28,310
agriculture systems because agriculture

408
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:31,730
systems are very harsh over time on the

409
00:17:28,309 --> 00:17:33,529
natural microbial flora of the soil for

410
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:36,289
several reasons because of the chemical

411
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:38,660
inputs because of the physical tilling

412
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:42,309
and and other aspects of management

413
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:47,980
human management that really break down

414
00:17:42,309 --> 00:17:50,470
and influence microbial biodiversity and

415
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:52,150
microbial assemblages fungi the way they

416
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,759
grow they hate tilling you know you

417
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:59,050
can't till soils year after year and

418
00:17:54,759 --> 00:18:02,890
maintain significant communities and

419
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:04,930
healthy fungal abundances in those soils

420
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:06,490
that's why in natural systems they

421
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,769
persist from year after year and they

422
00:18:06,490 --> 00:18:12,849
can live off of the roots I want to say

423
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:15,190
that in general you can create different

424
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:17,409
microbial assemblages they're different

425
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,820
food sources I think this is what you're

426
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:23,230
getting at there will relate it to the

427
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:25,480
plant example I can have a soil sample

428
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:27,279
that I take from anywhere you know I'm

429
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,410
great at growing microbes that's what I

430
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:31,750
do I've done it for so long I just know

431
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:35,080
how to do it and I can create 10

432
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:37,150
different food sources just broth which

433
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:39,399
is just like a super sugar soup and

434
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,220
maybe I'll Drive that sugar soup from

435
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,550
beets or carrots and then I'll make

436
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:47,890
another broth or media is what we'd call

437
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:50,379
it in microbiology there's different

438
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:53,800
sugar sources and maybe I'll make

439
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:56,200
another media that has a carbon source

440
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:59,470
and sugar is carbon tour time these kind

441
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:02,559
of words together microbes need carbon

442
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:04,360
nitrogen phosphorus sulfur all the macro

443
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,329
macro nutrients just like plants do for

444
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,799
the most part plants need all those

445
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:10,809
other nutrients as well but they get

446
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,369
their carbon from the air that's the

447
00:19:10,809 --> 00:19:15,220
only difference in how they acquire

448
00:19:12,369 --> 00:19:17,349
those nutrients and so we have a media

449
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,350
that's rich of carbon and all the

450
00:19:17,349 --> 00:19:22,779
nutrients but they're different chemical

451
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:25,389
compositions and if I had the same soil

452
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:28,899
sample and maybe I you know made us a

453
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:31,660
slurry where I mixed a gram of soil with

454
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:34,480
10 mils of water and mix it up and and I

455
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:36,759
Alec wanted a drop of each of that the

456
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,819
same sample under those ten different

457
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:43,650
media dishes what do you think the

458
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:46,980
result would be I'm going to tell you

459
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:50,800
everyone of those media's would nurture

460
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:53,440
different aspects of the microbial

461
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,548
community from that initial sample and

462
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,870
so there

463
00:19:54,548 --> 00:19:59,000
potentially tens of thousands of

464
00:19:56,869 --> 00:20:01,158
different microbes and that one sample

465
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,210
and again we're using one soil sample

466
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:07,730
one scoop of soil one spoonful of soil

467
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:10,340
mix it in some water and drop it on 10

468
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:12,558
different easily accessible food sources

469
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:14,240
and you're gonna get ten different

470
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:18,408
results potentially and I think that's

471
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,950
fascinating food source is a huge

472
00:20:18,409 --> 00:20:26,150
determinate of what microbes are going

473
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:29,210
to be nurture and growth and microbial

474
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:32,000
abundances is at some level a

475
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:35,058
probability game if there's a food

476
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,460
source that a micro blue group likes and

477
00:20:35,058 --> 00:20:40,369
prefers and can take advantage of moreso

478
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:43,400
than another microbes repeat and grow

479
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:46,609
and multiply so quickly that they can

480
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,559
actually physically out-compete their

481
00:20:46,609 --> 00:20:50,359
neighboring microbes because they can

482
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,548
take advantage of a food source quicker

483
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:55,879
the same thing happens with different

484
00:20:52,548 --> 00:20:58,490
food sources and so different plants we

485
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:59,960
know they create different food sources

486
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,700
for microbes meaning they score

487
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,490
different carbons and different organic

488
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:06,679
acids from their roots into the soil all

489
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:08,599
plants have evolved to do this to

490
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:11,720
nurture microbial communities that bring

491
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:13,819
them success success meaning you want a

492
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,409
healthy thriving microbial community in

493
00:21:13,819 --> 00:21:16,869
the root zone because microbes do a lot

494
00:21:15,409 --> 00:21:19,370
of great thing that plants will love

495
00:21:16,869 --> 00:21:21,229
cycle nutrients is one of those if you

496
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:22,989
can create a hotbed of nutrients that

497
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:26,089
plants can take up they will succeed

498
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,069
they'll be able to produce seed or

499
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:30,829
produce or stay healthy to the next

500
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:32,480
generation and biology success and

501
00:21:30,829 --> 00:21:35,389
biology is passing your genome to the

502
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:37,730
subsequent generations and so typically

503
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,100
evolutionarily speaking plants that are

504
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,480
here now have succeeded because I've

505
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:43,639
nurtured a healthy rhizosphere

506
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,759
microbiome that's helped them succeed

507
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:48,320
from one generation to the next just the

508
00:21:46,759 --> 00:21:50,089
very beginning of their existence to

509
00:21:48,319 --> 00:21:52,428
today does that help answer that

510
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:55,119
question was that too long no that's

511
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:56,900
great it reminds me so I think

512
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,729
essentially what your acquaintance is

513
00:21:56,900 --> 00:22:00,500
food source and so whether the in this

514
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:02,150
case the food source is the plant

515
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,500
exudates what the plants putting out

516
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,690
through the roots which thank you is

517
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:08,250
that exactly right but I don't want to I

518
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:10,860
don't want to minimize tad the other

519
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:14,430
sake or physical properties because soil

520
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:16,319
texture pH water sources you know

521
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:20,039
there's different minerals in the soil

522
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:21,720
that significantly affect pH you think

523
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:24,389
about calcareous soils where there's a

524
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:26,130
lot more calcium and crece in the soils

525
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,680
that's going to create a very basic

526
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:30,810
outline tool that the plants are not

527
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:33,810
going to be able to change so there's

528
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:35,399
this layer this parent material layer

529
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:38,509
and soil layer that the plants are

530
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,519
growing in that aren't affecting pH as

531
00:22:38,509 --> 00:22:44,400
much as their their rhizosphere their

532
00:22:41,519 --> 00:22:47,250
hot zone within their root zone yes they

533
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,530
definitely to nurture and create a micro

534
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:50,670
ecosystem within their root zone but

535
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:54,839
they're still in this broader

536
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:57,000
environment of a very calcareous or or

537
00:22:54,839 --> 00:22:58,319
alkaline soil type that they're not

538
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,710
going to be able to influence to a

539
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:04,889
neutral or to an acidic soil and so some

540
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:08,279
microbes that grow better and an

541
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,990
alkaline environment along with the food

542
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:13,019
sources that the plants are feeding them

543
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:15,390
are going to be strongly influenced and

544
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:18,000
succeed better than microbes that do

545
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:19,710
better at neutral or acidic soils with

546
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,779
maybe a different food source or even

547
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,049
the same food source so there's multiple

548
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:28,399
layers of interactions physical and

549
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:32,069
biotic that you have to kind of conceive

550
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:34,320
holistically to understand the life of a

551
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:36,240
microbe I mean it's in this room there's

552
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:37,679
getting food squirted on it and there's

553
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:41,250
all these physical pressures and

554
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,500
temperature and hydrology and pH and do

555
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:46,500
you know why pH is a factor for microbes

556
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:48,059
you can talk about that for a sec yeah

557
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,559
before we do though I just want to I

558
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,819
just want to highlight one of the things

559
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,799
I've found so essentially what you're

560
00:23:50,819 --> 00:23:54,629
saying is we you know taking the same

561
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,369
source and I've done this with compost

562
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:58,800
tea I'll take the same compost source or

563
00:23:56,369 --> 00:24:02,159
earthworm castings and add you know

564
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,769
unsalted molasses or add alfalfa meal or

565
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,690
you know with some other sorts food

566
00:24:04,769 --> 00:24:08,609
source for example and you end up with

567
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:12,090
very different things under the

568
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:14,909
microscope 8 12 24 hours later and if

569
00:24:12,089 --> 00:24:16,289
you go longer than that I found if you

570
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,090
you know people asking about brewing

571
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:20,670
compost tea for a long time or can I

572
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:21,589
leave it perpetually brewing what I find

573
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,940
and this is

574
00:24:21,589 --> 00:24:24,859
best analogy I've come up with to date

575
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:26,538
but it's not perfect to me it's like

576
00:24:24,859 --> 00:24:29,058
this idea that if you opened up all the

577
00:24:26,538 --> 00:24:30,769
gates in the zoo at the end of the day

578
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:32,899
you'd have your apex predator you'd have

579
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,879
your lions and you'd have probably some

580
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:37,070
rats and then so that's all that's

581
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,710
really left at that point cuz you've

582
00:24:37,069 --> 00:24:41,980
lost all that diversity because they're

583
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:44,509
the most efficient microbes at utilizing

584
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,759
whatever food source or what lasts the

585
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:49,038
longest and in the case with compost tea

586
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:50,629
all we're left with is one morphology of

587
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,788
flagellate and one morphology of

588
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,980
bacteria and they just sort of fluctuate

589
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:57,558
as they you know pray and pronate on

590
00:24:54,980 --> 00:25:00,110
each other over the next however long

591
00:24:57,558 --> 00:25:03,168
until the food sources eventually run

592
00:25:00,109 --> 00:25:04,490
out yes I think that's a perfect way to

593
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,740
talk about it I think you're thinking

594
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,839
about it they I might not be saying that

595
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,909
in those words that's exactly what I'm

596
00:25:08,839 --> 00:25:12,829
trying to say you're thinking about it

597
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,720
right and there's there's another level

598
00:25:12,829 --> 00:25:16,579
to I want to say so you have a limited

599
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,288
food source and you're going to nurture

600
00:25:16,579 --> 00:25:23,178
only so many like microbes that grow

601
00:25:21,288 --> 00:25:25,038
great at that food source and that and

602
00:25:23,179 --> 00:25:27,200
then those microbes are going to get

603
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:29,599
more concentrated than them other

604
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:32,360
microbes that that don't grow as well I

605
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:35,389
want to I want to layer in there what

606
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,979
happened you know not as much in T's if

607
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:38,809
you really teased out longer this could

608
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:40,429
happen but also in soils is you have

609
00:25:38,808 --> 00:25:42,829
fast-growing microbes you have

610
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:44,330
moderately fast-growing microbes you

611
00:25:42,829 --> 00:25:47,269
have slow growing microbes and you have

612
00:25:44,329 --> 00:25:48,980
very slow growing microbes etc and so

613
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:50,898
there can be a secession event where

614
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:54,140
those different microbes are also

615
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:56,109
favored different food sources and so

616
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:59,028
you can have for fungi and bacteria

617
00:25:56,109 --> 00:26:00,379
layers of succession and that's why I

618
00:25:59,028 --> 00:26:02,569
like to talk about it you can have this

619
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,919
initial secession community you know

620
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,839
what would happen if you left the T

621
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,809
going for a week or a month which is

622
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:10,879
impractical for for agriculture or for

623
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:13,519
feeding I would do that but for the

624
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,700
purposes of a microbial study you would

625
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:20,869
see turnover in that for a mentor or

626
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:23,990
that that tea vessel from one month to

627
00:26:20,869 --> 00:26:26,479
the next until it finally stabilized

628
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:29,028
that's because the environment and that

629
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,769
food source continues to turn around and

630
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:32,929
you're going to have life and death of

631
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:35,720
certain groups of microbes that ate the

632
00:26:32,929 --> 00:26:38,419
initially yummy easily accessible

633
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,980
carbon in the tea then they would die up

634
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,580
and then you'd have another microbial

635
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,038
group or groups of microbes echod kind

636
00:26:43,579 --> 00:26:49,399
of decompose and take in more easily

637
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:51,109
that next more concentrated or more

638
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:53,960
recalcitrant food source so that's an

639
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:56,899
example of so many layers temporal and

640
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:58,429
spatial and physical that the microbes

641
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,909
are experiencing that might influence

642
00:26:58,429 --> 00:27:04,100
how we're growing microbes and how to

643
00:27:01,909 --> 00:27:05,539
grow them consistently which all of

644
00:27:04,099 --> 00:27:07,250
these things are important so now you

645
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:09,470
know I'm kind of in the microbial

646
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:11,659
manufacturing business you have to

647
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:13,700
understand all those physical and input

648
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,380
properties to understand how to grow

649
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:18,048
microbes with consistency and the T

650
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,580
there's a real tricky thing because you

651
00:27:18,048 --> 00:27:21,859
have to have consistent inputs also

652
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:23,869
don't you because if you don't have that

653
00:27:21,859 --> 00:27:26,029
completely you're not going to get

654
00:27:23,869 --> 00:27:27,319
consistent results every time because

655
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:28,250
it's going to be a slightly different

656
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:30,980
food source

657
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:34,519
well that and that's why most research

658
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:35,929
and most scientists don't like compost D

659
00:27:34,519 --> 00:27:38,058
and I totally understand that it's

660
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:40,250
impossible to get consistency because

661
00:27:38,058 --> 00:27:42,038
even a different teaspoon of compost is

662
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:44,298
going to have slightly different

663
00:27:42,038 --> 00:27:46,509
microbial consortium which is going to

664
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:49,788
lead to slightly different responses to

665
00:27:46,509 --> 00:27:50,990
you know a given food source so I and

666
00:27:49,788 --> 00:27:53,359
you know like you mentioned your

667
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,859
temperature your water source the amount

668
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,109
of area you know the dissolved oxygen

669
00:27:54,859 --> 00:27:59,750
levels in the tea itself there's so many

670
00:27:57,109 --> 00:28:02,168
variables so I understand why compost

671
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:04,579
tea isn't is loved by the science world

672
00:28:02,169 --> 00:28:07,220
though it has caught on a lot more I

673
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:10,720
will say over the last 15-20 years since

674
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:13,548
we first started experimenting with it

675
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:15,500
for sure you know Ted I love compost

676
00:28:13,548 --> 00:28:17,569
teas and I love the idea of it I love

677
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,210
the practice of it I just I think it's

678
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:22,490
important to acknowledge the limitations

679
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:25,220
or to acknowledge what we don't know and

680
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:29,200
it's just hard to know everything in

681
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:31,429
that tea over time also because both the

682
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,650
microbes will actually change I did this

683
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:36,350
in a study looking at different natural

684
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:38,929
systems microbial communities can change

685
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:40,879
significantly seasonally just because of

686
00:28:38,929 --> 00:28:43,400
those environmental shifts in

687
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,380
temperature in hydrology and in plant

688
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,330
structure where the plants die in the

689
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:49,340
winter and so different microbes

690
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:51,470
actually thrive better and other

691
00:28:49,339 --> 00:28:53,990
herbs that thrive well in peak growth

692
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:57,559
season and mid summer will decline and

693
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:59,390
so if you're gathering nutrients or grad

694
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:01,819
gathering inputs from your surroundings

695
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,860
or your tea if you know all that stuff

696
00:29:01,819 --> 00:29:05,509
you're fine and I don't think that

697
00:29:03,859 --> 00:29:07,250
you're at risk because people love that

698
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:10,039
but you have to understand that you're

699
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,079
introducing variability into cultivation

700
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,309
if you're using teas without consistent

701
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:19,909
inputs totally and if you're using

702
00:29:15,309 --> 00:29:22,639
sources of compost or other microbe

703
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:24,650
sources that are not they haven't been

704
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:26,300
thermally composted then you are

705
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:30,259
potentially at risk for bringing in

706
00:29:26,299 --> 00:29:32,690
disease organisms as well so that is

707
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:34,509
that is definitely a concern I that

708
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:37,519
completely ignores that's a good point

709
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:39,319
let's talk a little bit about the fact

710
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,690
that so you're like you mentioned you're

711
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:43,429
in the the business of producing

712
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,410
microbes you've found it

713
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:47,930
you founded mammoth P which is a

714
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,950
consortium of microbes that are

715
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:53,269
shelf-stable

716
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:55,190
and something that can be added in to a

717
00:29:53,269 --> 00:29:56,480
resume or to someone that's watering I

718
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:58,039
have a few specific questions about

719
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,950
mammoth the P but I wanted to share my

720
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,379
mammoth P experience first I was given a

721
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:05,210
sample oh it was years ago now and I

722
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:07,400
just left it sitting next to my

723
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:08,930
microscope for probably about a month

724
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:10,640
month and a half and I don't know how

725
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:13,940
long how old it was when I got that

726
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:16,970
sample I just threw them the microscope

727
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:21,220
one day and I was shocked to see motile

728
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:23,690
bacteria it's the only problem you know

729
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,690
microbial product I've ever seen on the

730
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:27,799
market that actually has active

731
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:31,039
microorganisms which I know is not

732
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,599
necessarily you know not having motile

733
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,559
or you know bacterias not doesn't

734
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:36,139
necessarily mean it doesn't have

735
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,309
nutrient cycling properties but I

736
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,540
thought that was really exciting to

737
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:41,269
actually see something moving around on

738
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:43,129
the microscope which was cool yeah yeah

739
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:44,869
it's really cool to happen you know I

740
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,830
can kind of talk about how we developed

741
00:30:44,869 --> 00:30:50,839
this particular product but these

742
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:52,819
microbes are actually flagellated so

743
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:54,529
they are mobile and so it's very

744
00:30:52,819 --> 00:30:55,939
interesting to think about that extra

745
00:30:54,529 --> 00:31:00,980
functionality a lot of products in the

746
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:03,210
market are bacillus you know species

747
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,529
quite frankly and a lot of them creates

748
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:06,390
endospores and so they're not

749
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,089
necessarily active and you have to

750
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,580
activate them over a period of time and

751
00:31:09,089 --> 00:31:13,139
they might be in a dry or a liquid

752
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:15,960
solution I've seen them carried in both

753
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:20,009
but um and many times they're actually

754
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:23,250
entered or inter formulated or developed

755
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:26,069
on the bore or non vegetative state and

756
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:27,660
so it takes some more food source we're

757
00:31:26,069 --> 00:31:29,309
engaging with plant roots to actually

758
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:31,290
get them going so I think that's why you

759
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:33,349
don't necessarily see active microbes

760
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:35,220
and a lot of those other products

761
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:37,319
haven't spent a lot of time looking

762
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:39,569
under a microscope in a while I loved

763
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,460
early on remember we met and then you

764
00:31:39,569 --> 00:31:43,379
did the study you did the you did some

765
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:44,759
substrate work - is that the same study

766
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,580
you're talking about that's one that's

767
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:49,200
on YouTube I believe what I would say is

768
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,839
yes so what I did was I just experiment

769
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,850
different food sources to see about

770
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:55,459
feeding the microorganisms and how they

771
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:57,799
would respond to different food sources

772
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:00,870
so that was something that interested me

773
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:04,649
what I see from most microbial products

774
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:07,319
on the market like you mentioned is when

775
00:32:04,650 --> 00:32:10,890
I when I add different food sources I'll

776
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:13,769
see a growth in overall like bacterial

777
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:17,820
biomass yep but that's that's really

778
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:21,000
about it which is good it's just not as

779
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:23,569
exciting under a microscope yeah hey I

780
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,549
want to be clear you know mammoth T is

781
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:29,210
bacteria quite clearly but they have

782
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:32,579
these morphology structures called

783
00:32:29,210 --> 00:32:34,740
flagella which are simply tailed little

784
00:32:32,579 --> 00:32:36,569
tails sell out for mobility of the cells

785
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,440
yeah sorry about that sorry about that

786
00:32:36,569 --> 00:32:39,079
yeah okay

787
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,370
definitely bacteria I know you knew that

788
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:43,079
okay that's okay that's what I

789
00:32:41,369 --> 00:32:46,199
originally thought I misheard you

790
00:32:43,079 --> 00:32:48,299
Langella are actually a lot of that's

791
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,549
how bacteria are mobile they have these

792
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,220
little tails that typically span are

793
00:32:50,549 --> 00:32:55,019
they crank as as corkscrews and they

794
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:57,000
allow them to move through the substrate

795
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:58,559
and move through the rhizosphere and the

796
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,490
water columns or moved through the soil

797
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,619
and it's a really interesting level to

798
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:06,539
add whenever a bacteria is highly

799
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:08,549
functional but it can move around and

800
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:10,559
activate through different parts of the

801
00:33:08,549 --> 00:33:12,419
rhizosphere or through the bottle and

802
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,549
even when you're using microbes like

803
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:16,300
this and this is kind of what I

804
00:33:13,549 --> 00:33:18,129
determined over time if

805
00:33:16,299 --> 00:33:21,539
some environmental stress and you're

806
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:23,680
dealing with mobile microbes they can

807
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:26,980
actively get out of the way of that

808
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:30,039
stress an example is like a pH sometimes

809
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:33,279
if you forget the pH your nutrients and

810
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,589
and you add the microbes and it's not

811
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,599
too harsh and then you're trying to pH

812
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,759
your nutrients and you're adding acid or

813
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:42,099
a base into that you know it can

814
00:33:39,759 --> 00:33:46,089
potentially affect a lot of the microbes

815
00:33:42,099 --> 00:33:49,329
where that pH buffer enters into that

816
00:33:46,089 --> 00:33:52,149
mix where your microbes are are mixed

817
00:33:49,329 --> 00:33:54,369
into the tank but if the microbes are

818
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:56,740
mobile they actually get out of the way

819
00:33:54,369 --> 00:33:59,349
until experience that much stress so

820
00:33:56,740 --> 00:34:03,640
it's a cool added feature that is cool

821
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:05,259
so with with mammoths pee what do you

822
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:08,500
what sorts of results are you seeing out

823
00:34:05,259 --> 00:34:10,719
there with people that are using it are

824
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,909
there any environments where it doesn't

825
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:15,549
do quite as well or there others where

826
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:18,428
it really thrives you know that it's

827
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:22,000
probably a never-ending question I know

828
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:23,650
that when we started when we want to cut

829
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,989
me just as the history I left the

830
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:29,559
university about March 2015 to start the

831
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:31,750
company and we've done a solid a really

832
00:34:29,559 --> 00:34:33,460
rigorous year before we actually started

833
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:35,739
the R&amp;D on the technology at the

834
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:36,940
University it'll very late or very early

835
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:39,369
2014

836
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:41,619
in all fairness we were we were getting

837
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:44,409
ramped up to try to do something like

838
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:46,509
this at the very end of 2013 got some

839
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:48,099
funding and started it in 2014 went

840
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:49,900
through the process got some great

841
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,940
validation after we do up the product it

842
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:54,700
was a pretty efficient process that's

843
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:58,750
pretty well funded and then launched the

844
00:34:54,699 --> 00:35:00,879
company in March 2015 into the cannabis

845
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:03,190
industry and so a scaled-up

846
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,349
commercialization and production and got

847
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:07,690
a small team on the ground and I turned

848
00:35:05,349 --> 00:35:09,369
I was kind of still in a lot of ways

849
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,679
wearing all hats not like it was back

850
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:14,199
then where I literally was and getting

851
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:15,879
out and engaging with cultivators and a

852
00:35:14,199 --> 00:35:17,769
lot of the commercial growers in

853
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,990
Colorado releasing cocoa but with our

854
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:22,659
first validation but but I will say that

855
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:24,849
before that the university validation we

856
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:27,009
tested on several different real soil

857
00:35:24,849 --> 00:35:29,500
types meaning we we brought a bunch of

858
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:30,099
soil back from different environments at

859
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,989
least local

860
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,548
around Colorado that that represented

861
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:35,559
different soil textures different soil

862
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:37,088
types we worked with different potting

863
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:38,829
medium we worked with a lot of different

864
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,929
plant types we worked with a lot of

865
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:42,670
cannabis growers outside the University

866
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:44,919
and so we had a pretty good

867
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,229
representative dataset that we thought

868
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:48,700
it worked well across a lot of different

869
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,858
plants and a lot of different substrates

870
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:53,498
because we felt like these microbes are

871
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,940
very robust meaning very efficacious

872
00:35:53,498 --> 00:35:56,498
they could work in a lot of different

873
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,659
moments they had a targeted function

874
00:35:56,498 --> 00:36:00,308
that all plants needed and so if we

875
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:01,778
could just deliver these microbes to the

876
00:36:00,309 --> 00:36:03,789
rhizosphere a root zone they would

877
00:36:01,778 --> 00:36:05,469
engage the plant and deliver the

878
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:07,239
function that you know that they needed

879
00:36:05,469 --> 00:36:09,909
and wanted that would help them succeed

880
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:12,639
their development you know yield and

881
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,379
other properties shinsen you know it's

882
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:16,778
had we've grown and we're selling its

883
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:18,369
technology over the world thousands and

884
00:36:16,778 --> 00:36:20,289
thousands and thousands of girls are

885
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:23,410
using this and we heard great results

886
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:25,960
across the board I don't know if I hear

887
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:28,538
all the bad news if there is bad news

888
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,489
out there quite honestly but we hear a

889
00:36:28,539 --> 00:36:32,470
lot of great news I mean you've probably

890
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:33,909
seen some good results too over time

891
00:36:32,469 --> 00:36:37,419
having you known each other for years

892
00:36:33,909 --> 00:36:39,460
now put me on the spot yeah so actually

893
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:41,710
I've been working with the gold leaf

894
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:43,420
gardens I didn't interview with Ben

895
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:46,449
Higgins he's their research scientist

896
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:48,670
and one of the studies they just

897
00:36:46,449 --> 00:36:51,278
retrials they recently completed was

898
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,259
with mammoth pea and they found they got

899
00:36:51,278 --> 00:36:55,449
about a 12 percent increase in wet

900
00:36:53,259 --> 00:36:57,009
weight relative to the control and so

901
00:36:55,449 --> 00:37:00,368
now they're doing ongoing trials to

902
00:36:57,009 --> 00:37:02,318
replicate that but the initial results

903
00:37:00,369 --> 00:37:05,619
were quite quite positive and this is a

904
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:07,298
this is this is a setup that I think is

905
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:09,700
fairly optimal from a microbial

906
00:37:07,298 --> 00:37:12,460
perspective we're talking about large

907
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:16,808
beds that hold about 1/3 of a yard of

908
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:19,929
soil per bed and that soil is relatively

909
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:21,789
undisturbed for the entire cycle and has

910
00:37:19,929 --> 00:37:23,199
been around for I think they're on five

911
00:37:21,789 --> 00:37:25,349
years now with the same soil that

912
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,409
they've been amending so it's a fairly

913
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:31,239
it's a fairly living entity that they

914
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:32,798
have for a media compared to others so I

915
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:35,289
thought they would actually see less of

916
00:37:32,798 --> 00:37:36,909
a less of a response than that because

917
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:40,719
of the fact that they were doing so much

918
00:37:36,909 --> 00:37:43,028
to already you know help out the

919
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:43,950
microbial communities in the soil yeah

920
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:47,639
you know I think

921
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:48,839
their hypothesis - if there's only so

922
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:51,509
much value

923
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,460
I think microbes will brain wants that

924
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:56,100
to maximize do you know and there are

925
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:58,139
some functional redundancy so that's

926
00:37:56,099 --> 00:38:00,119
actually that's a really good that's

927
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:01,799
really good feedback I love that I want

928
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:04,199
to stay in touch with you on that I'll

929
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:07,080
say that most ignores in Northern

930
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:08,819
California that we work with are trying

931
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,590
to engage in some type of living soil

932
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,550
where they're you know they're they're

933
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,110
minimizing or trying to minimize the

934
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,810
amount of nutrients are adding and

935
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:20,250
they're trying to stay as holistic with

936
00:38:18,809 --> 00:38:23,009
their environment as possible I think

937
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,420
they do add some as needed across the

938
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:26,580
growing season and particularly in

939
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:30,119
flower and they're they're adding

940
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,440
microbes and in nurturing microbe life

941
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:34,500
and a lot of them are plugging in

942
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,150
mammoth pea and seeing good results but

943
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,219
you know what's interesting about that

944
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,619
also is the targeted functionality of

945
00:38:38,219 --> 00:38:45,329
mammoth microbes in particular where

946
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:47,460
there's a lot of nitrogen delivering

947
00:38:45,329 --> 00:38:49,500
microbes the pretty common function and

948
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:51,599
phosphorus is the world Lesko and

949
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,219
phosphorus is really tricky to deliver

950
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,829
to plants and in those particular

951
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:59,489
substrates because phosphorus is sticky

952
00:38:55,829 --> 00:39:01,619
chemically xx and having some catalysts

953
00:38:59,489 --> 00:39:05,789
and microbial catalysts liberate the

954
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:09,509
phosphorus might be why this particular

955
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:11,639
environment this grower facility is a

956
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:14,220
steam that added benefit 12% great

957
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,569
that's a pretty good value at oh yeah

958
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,879
when we're talking about such a high

959
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:21,090
value crop that's that's a big deal so

960
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,820
there what I'm curious about now is over

961
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:26,090
time what sort of persistence are we

962
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:29,670
gonna see I know you recommend

963
00:39:26,090 --> 00:39:33,000
applications over a certain period of

964
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:36,420
time I'm curious to see how that if that

965
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:39,659
yield increase stays the same across

966
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,800
multiple cycles or if it starts to at

967
00:39:39,659 --> 00:39:45,269
some point sort of level out to where

968
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,180
you know they're consistently getting

969
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:50,130
12% with these applications over what

970
00:39:48,179 --> 00:39:51,419
their control was used to be I'm sure

971
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:53,880
they'll eventually switch everything

972
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,950
over if things continue down that path

973
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,559
but yeah I'm just curious how these

974
00:39:55,949 --> 00:39:59,299
microbes do over time I know

975
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,090
spend some research on persistence out

976
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,330
there yeah it's that's a hard question

977
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:07,460
to answer but overall I'm kind of

978
00:40:05,329 --> 00:40:08,900
winding in and that's why I gave some

979
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:12,170
background on some of the research I did

980
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,760
before starting this company cuz I think

981
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,829
about that and I think about persistence

982
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,360
a lot and one of the differences into

983
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:19,239
the work that I was doing in natural

984
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:21,019
systems that was by definition

985
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:23,539
undisturbed until I went out there and

986
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:26,239
disturbed some of it was my research to

987
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:29,179
collect data was the disturbance that's

988
00:40:26,239 --> 00:40:31,669
inherent with management systems with

989
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:34,519
agriculture management systems you know

990
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:36,920
what I do know is that microbes thrive

991
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,210
with a living plant root because plants

992
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:39,260
feed microbes and so if you're

993
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:40,639
delivering the microbes or the

994
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,360
rhizosphere is an example of an

995
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:43,250
inoculate

996
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:45,860
those microbes are more than likely

997
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:47,960
going to love that environment because

998
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,700
it's a nutrient-rich environment and all

999
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,710
those other adaptiq properties that we

1000
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:55,849
kind of prefaced earlier in our talk

1001
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:57,349
here are right for the microbe the

1002
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,239
plants definitely feeding in a food

1003
00:40:57,349 --> 00:41:01,489
source and it's going to be a happy home

1004
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:04,069
but what happens when at the end of the

1005
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:06,439
growth season well typically the plant

1006
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:08,420
gets chopped the exudates quit coming

1007
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:10,309
out because the plants not

1008
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:12,409
photosynthesizing anymore it's harvested

1009
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:14,659
and so that creates a completely

1010
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:17,569
different environment and so what I

1011
00:41:14,659 --> 00:41:21,019
would say is there's probably some

1012
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:22,910
persistence but I don't know enough to

1013
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:25,280
know how much turnover there's going to

1014
00:41:22,909 --> 00:41:26,629
be for mammoth microbes in particular if

1015
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,730
you don't mind just preface it by that

1016
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,200
because you're dealing with a very

1017
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:31,610
different environment and now the roots

1018
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:33,980
are dead and they're decaying it's

1019
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:35,840
probably going to nurture more fungal

1020
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,760
life because fungi like that break down

1021
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,130
those very complex root structures that

1022
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,840
the bacteria then can follow up and take

1023
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:45,079
advantage of them continue to mineralize

1024
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:47,630
and so there's a good chance that the

1025
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:50,299
rien oculi ssin with a new plant cycle

1026
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,650
is going to be critical and I don't know

1027
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,930
I could probably could probably do some

1028
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:57,530
work together to get to the root of this

1029
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:59,539
question maybe through some sampling or

1030
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:03,650
whatnot do some microbial analysis but

1031
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:06,259
Mike my guess is it's most efficient to

1032
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:09,200
add these inoculant with every new plant

1033
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:11,360
cycle because of the effects of a living

1034
00:42:09,199 --> 00:42:13,819
plant and the inter

1035
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:17,230
action to living plant would have on the

1036
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:20,990
microbial community that the soil

1037
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:22,460
without a plant or plant roots that

1038
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:24,829
don't have a plan associated with them

1039
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:27,199
anymore they've been cut off are gonna

1040
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:28,269
have it's just the environment selects

1041
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,559
and it's a very different environment

1042
00:42:28,269 --> 00:42:34,039
there is going to be some persistence

1043
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:36,049
though it's harder to manage because we

1044
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:38,989
can't see that or mayor or measure it

1045
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:41,030
regularly so regular applications for

1046
00:42:38,989 --> 00:42:43,009
sure you can manage that I would

1047
00:42:41,030 --> 00:42:45,860
hypothesize and again this is pure

1048
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:47,930
speculation on my part that after this

1049
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:50,390
one cycle for example in gold leaf where

1050
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:52,369
they got a 12% increase and then they go

1051
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:54,619
to a remand the cycle and they'll

1052
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:56,900
probably do a light till and then

1053
00:42:54,619 --> 00:42:59,779
replant you're right you're gonna see

1054
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,860
some die-off but I wonder if you know

1055
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:02,780
some of those microbes that were

1056
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,180
introduced will persist and stay active

1057
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:07,130
to where they may see a four percent

1058
00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:08,929
increase in wet weight over their

1059
00:43:07,130 --> 00:43:11,150
control next time or something you know

1060
00:43:08,929 --> 00:43:15,579
some level of persistence in that regard

1061
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:18,380
but I wonder if you know the addition of

1062
00:43:15,579 --> 00:43:20,779
you know mammoth pee in this case of you

1063
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,740
know microbes are more active right back

1064
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,970
into the rhizosphere

1065
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:27,829
would speed up that process because one

1066
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:29,359
thing that you know of all people is

1067
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:32,360
that these microbes can survive some

1068
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:35,660
very amazing conditions environmental

1069
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:37,660
conditions you know through dormancy or

1070
00:43:35,659 --> 00:43:40,219
insisting or all these other processes

1071
00:43:37,659 --> 00:43:41,059
but we don't really want to wait for

1072
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,379
that when we're talking about a

1073
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:44,750
high-value crop that we're trying to

1074
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:46,400
cycle out as fast as possible - yeah

1075
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:47,659
that's where my head's going and so we

1076
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,700
think about two things we think about

1077
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:51,469
the targeted functionality and how

1078
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:53,569
microbes are engaging the other level

1079
00:43:51,469 --> 00:43:56,839
you've already said it is he's a bun two

1080
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:58,940
abundances or density at some level that

1081
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:01,430
denser microbial communities or the

1082
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:02,690
biomass in general is going to create

1083
00:44:01,429 --> 00:44:04,460
more function because there's more

1084
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,619
microbes to create more function and

1085
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:10,250
with those applications you're gonna get

1086
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:13,909
to that more that higher density quicker

1087
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:16,250
instead of having to revive maybe latent

1088
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:18,559
or a more dormant microbial community

1089
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:20,869
that overwintered in a natural example

1090
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:23,360
or you know is trying to be brought back

1091
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,980
from last season's crop in this

1092
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:26,750
particular example so

1093
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,059
I think both of the hypotheses that you

1094
00:44:26,750 --> 00:44:29,809
stated are really fair you know I'd be

1095
00:44:29,059 --> 00:44:32,239
interesting

1096
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:34,219
w that'd be a fun study to conduct yeah

1097
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:36,829
there's just so much we don't know about

1098
00:44:34,219 --> 00:44:38,659
the rhizosphere that I think it's really

1099
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:40,489
I think it's really interesting I mean

1100
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:42,319
you've kind of touched on so many things

1101
00:44:40,489 --> 00:44:44,659
just in this podcast that has brought up

1102
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:48,080
a lot of questions are you seeing a lot

1103
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:50,299
of new research coming out on this idea

1104
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:51,799
of microbial inoculants I mean it

1105
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,730
definitely seems to be taking off in

1106
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:57,970
agriculture yeah yeah I think just to be

1107
00:44:55,730 --> 00:45:00,650
fair I think it's the quickest growing

1108
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:04,219
agriculture industry segment across all

1109
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:06,349
crops and the biggest reason for that is

1110
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:10,608
because nutrients are really hard to

1111
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:14,089
deliver in soils and farmers are having

1112
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:17,509
a horrible time managing nutrient

1113
00:45:14,090 --> 00:45:19,608
absorption and uptake for nitrogen and

1114
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:21,380
for phosphorus in particular potassium

1115
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:25,099
is very difficult in rural schools and

1116
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:26,570
in mineral soils as well and so the

1117
00:45:25,099 --> 00:45:27,739
industry is taken out because there's a

1118
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:29,240
real need for it

1119
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:30,919
I've seen a lot of interesting

1120
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:33,289
technology it's focused on a couple

1121
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:34,789
different do you think about effective

1122
00:45:33,289 --> 00:45:38,239
products and there's been a challenge

1123
00:45:34,789 --> 00:45:39,469
for the microbial biostimulant industry

1124
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:41,269
in general that's what you call it an

1125
00:45:39,469 --> 00:45:43,579
agriculture microbial biosimilars we

1126
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:44,750
call it you know beneficial bacteria and

1127
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:46,279
the cannabis industry but their

1128
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:48,260
microbial inoculants and that's fair

1129
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:51,560
across both and it's pretty intuitive

1130
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:52,970
you know does do the microbes what do

1131
00:45:51,559 --> 00:45:55,130
the microbes do to do it consistently

1132
00:45:52,969 --> 00:45:57,409
and do they work in many different

1133
00:45:55,130 --> 00:46:00,920
environments those are the three

1134
00:45:57,409 --> 00:46:02,719
questions you want to bridge if if they

1135
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:05,000
work consistently and they have a

1136
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:08,299
targeted function then you can use them

1137
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:09,349
with confidence for precision because

1138
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:12,109
you know what they're doing and they

1139
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:15,019
continue to do it and that's great for a

1140
00:46:12,108 --> 00:46:16,549
farmer but if there are efficacious mean

1141
00:46:15,019 --> 00:46:18,409
they work across a lot of different

1142
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:20,060
management or environmental conditions

1143
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:21,980
and they can work for a lot of farmers

1144
00:46:20,059 --> 00:46:25,299
and those are the three big hurdles I

1145
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:28,820
think any manufacturer wants wants to

1146
00:46:25,300 --> 00:46:30,619
overcome and that's what we acknowledge

1147
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:32,930
I think that's what we overcame with

1148
00:46:30,619 --> 00:46:34,250
developing a MFT and it's it's just one

1149
00:46:32,929 --> 00:46:37,009
of those things we'll went into it from

1150
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:38,750
a scientific perspective and we engage

1151
00:46:37,010 --> 00:46:40,430
in a site that's we didn't engage

1152
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:43,429
the microbial manufacturing company was

1153
00:46:40,429 --> 00:46:45,379
a science experiment quite frankly in a

1154
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:50,750
scientific fundamental scientific

1155
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:52,430
endeavor and so do I think that there

1156
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:53,840
are a product out there like that yeah

1157
00:46:52,429 --> 00:46:55,639
there's been some products out there our

1158
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,599
busco mycorrhizae is an example it's

1159
00:46:55,639 --> 00:46:58,759
been around forever

1160
00:46:56,599 --> 00:47:00,530
there's nitrogen-fixing bacteria they've

1161
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:02,240
been around for a long time those

1162
00:47:00,530 --> 00:47:04,099
technologies will continue to evolve

1163
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:06,889
some of them are going to get rebranded

1164
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:08,300
and have been in spaces for a long time

1165
00:47:06,889 --> 00:47:11,329
and we'll get rebranded for new markets

1166
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:12,890
or new crops new industries and I think

1167
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:15,230
there's other cool technologies coming

1168
00:47:12,889 --> 00:47:18,170
out now I was at a talk it's been a

1169
00:47:15,230 --> 00:47:21,710
little while now where there's some some

1170
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:24,559
notion of endo fight bacteria and in

1171
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:27,019
some crops it's it's developing quicker

1172
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:29,210
than than others where you can have

1173
00:47:27,019 --> 00:47:32,630
specific bacterial species that will

1174
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:36,070
actually engage intracellularly with

1175
00:47:32,630 --> 00:47:38,960
plant roots to help facilitate plant

1176
00:47:36,070 --> 00:47:41,300
health or trigger specific growth

1177
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,858
through chemical signaling so those are

1178
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,789
pretty interesting technologies because

1179
00:47:42,858 --> 00:47:49,880
they're super specific the trick is if

1180
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:51,619
you have an intracellular or endo

1181
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:54,588
Finnick bacteria that works well across

1182
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:57,019
one crop you really want it to work well

1183
00:47:54,588 --> 00:47:58,759
across a lot of crops or the crops of

1184
00:47:57,019 --> 00:48:01,099
interest at least and so that's a lot of

1185
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,940
pretty deep research there's a lot of

1186
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:05,030
other tips

1187
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,920
he's also that you think about I guess

1188
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:09,170
there's a performance vertical we want

1189
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,200
points to be very healthy and grow and

1190
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:13,639
yield and maximize or quality or flavor

1191
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,449
or bricks or whatever crop you're

1192
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:16,670
talking about

1193
00:48:14,449 --> 00:48:19,719
I think cannabinoid and THC is a good

1194
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:22,490
example in in the cannabis industry and

1195
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:24,799
then there's this bio control space and

1196
00:48:22,489 --> 00:48:26,539
those are the two industry verticals

1197
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,650
that I'm pretty fascinated with we're

1198
00:48:26,539 --> 00:48:30,320
not performance and then you want

1199
00:48:27,650 --> 00:48:33,500
protection and there's a lot of products

1200
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:37,309
in the general agriculture space that

1201
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:40,309
use microbes to mitigate pests I love

1202
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:43,070
that tad I think it's amazing you can

1203
00:48:40,309 --> 00:48:47,509
apply biology with biology but it's

1204
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:50,450
tricky in the cannabis industry because

1205
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:52,460
a lot of these technologies are fully

1206
00:48:50,449 --> 00:48:54,679
early applied

1207
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:57,050
and with regulatory pressures of

1208
00:48:54,679 --> 00:49:01,598
microbial talent sunflower on the

1209
00:48:57,050 --> 00:49:04,010
biomass if you're adding microbes to

1210
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,260
above-ground applications and this can

1211
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:08,780
happen with some teas also you might be

1212
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:11,810
engineering microbial counts you don't

1213
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:14,030
want to engineer for regulatory purposes

1214
00:49:11,809 --> 00:49:16,880
you have to be below a certain city of

1215
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:18,800
to you so it's tricky and I our company

1216
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:20,599
is actually steered away from thinking

1217
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,670
about microbial technologies above

1218
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:23,930
ground right now until we figure out how

1219
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:27,530
to think about this better but maybe

1220
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:30,759
deriving biochemical solutions through

1221
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:35,300
microbial growth that will attack

1222
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:37,940
certain pests or milled or mold or or

1223
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:39,440
mildew we're thinking about this we did

1224
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:41,570
have one product that we just launched

1225
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,970
on the market that's not a microbial

1226
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,400
product for that very reason I explained

1227
00:49:43,969 --> 00:49:49,219
but uh I got pretty sophisticated and

1228
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,250
simple at the same time targeted oil

1229
00:49:49,219 --> 00:49:55,279
product for a different insect pest

1230
00:49:52,250 --> 00:50:00,079
mitigation it works good yeah are you

1231
00:49:55,280 --> 00:50:01,970
are you seeing any issues with using a

1232
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,598
product like mammoth pee or other

1233
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:09,439
microbial products in terms of failing

1234
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:11,300
microbial tests with soil applications

1235
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:14,119
and I'm not asking specific to your

1236
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:15,019
product per se more just this is

1237
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:16,789
something that was brought to my

1238
00:50:15,019 --> 00:50:19,099
attention recently as some of these new

1239
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:22,150
states are coming online in Canada

1240
00:50:19,099 --> 00:50:25,550
they're the restrictions around

1241
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:27,349
microbial testing on flour is really

1242
00:50:25,550 --> 00:50:30,039
really tight and doesn't take into

1243
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:33,289
account a lot of the probiotic and

1244
00:50:30,039 --> 00:50:35,599
prophylactic microbes that exist in

1245
00:50:33,289 --> 00:50:37,039
these growing systems do you think

1246
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,200
you're putting yourself a greater risk

1247
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:40,789
by using microbial products or using

1248
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:43,069
living soils when we're talking about

1249
00:50:40,789 --> 00:50:46,039
passing these tests versus a more

1250
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,838
pharmaceutical approach no I think just

1251
00:50:46,039 --> 00:50:49,969
the opposite but I've validated it was

1252
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:51,799
mammoth because I was interested enough

1253
00:50:49,969 --> 00:50:54,139
to ask that question went to some

1254
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:57,830
resources on our team and what what I

1255
00:50:54,139 --> 00:51:00,650
think is honestly microbes are very

1256
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:03,139
rarely the elusive bacteria willing to

1257
00:51:00,650 --> 00:51:05,358
infiltrate the cells and work their way

1258
00:51:03,139 --> 00:51:06,318
all the way up intracellularly in the

1259
00:51:05,358 --> 00:51:09,798
plant

1260
00:51:06,318 --> 00:51:11,929
and then emerge in the above-ground

1261
00:51:09,798 --> 00:51:14,478
flower tissue it's just such a tall

1262
00:51:11,929 --> 00:51:16,419
order and we haven't seen it it's very

1263
00:51:14,478 --> 00:51:19,308
hard to do that's where some of the

1264
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,108
challenges or hurdles endophyte bacteria

1265
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:23,150
are right now that technology that's

1266
00:51:21,108 --> 00:51:25,548
that's cool from a scientific

1267
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:27,979
perspective but very hard because you

1268
00:51:25,548 --> 00:51:29,958
know plant and just like our skin cells

1269
00:51:27,978 --> 00:51:31,489
you know it's a barrier you know it's

1270
00:51:29,958 --> 00:51:33,528
supposed to keep out microbes and so

1271
00:51:31,489 --> 00:51:35,929
it's actively keeping out microbes and

1272
00:51:33,528 --> 00:51:37,998
so keeping my Cubs in the soil where

1273
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:40,698
soil microbes actually function in their

1274
00:51:37,998 --> 00:51:43,278
active plants is brilliant we conducted

1275
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:45,588
this study and our farm here in Colorado

1276
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:48,880
where we did a greenhouse and an outdoor

1277
00:51:45,588 --> 00:51:51,108
soil study looking at simple very simple

1278
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,670
treated mammoth be treated and

1279
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,920
non-treaty keeping everything else the

1280
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:56,989
same school applications just like we

1281
00:51:54,920 --> 00:52:00,048
would with our technology and we looked

1282
00:51:56,989 --> 00:52:04,068
at a few counts on the flower of the

1283
00:52:00,048 --> 00:52:06,498
outdoor crop and the greenhouse indoor

1284
00:52:04,068 --> 00:52:10,068
crop and in both environments

1285
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:12,879
Tad's the CFU bacterial counts both of

1286
00:52:10,068 --> 00:52:16,338
them we were passing out of all fairness

1287
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:18,548
but the CFU counts on the microbial

1288
00:52:16,338 --> 00:52:21,739
mammoth treated plants were

1289
00:52:18,548 --> 00:52:25,969
significantly looked then the non

1290
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:28,548
treated like wow cool and you know then

1291
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:30,739
you ask well why and why I think is

1292
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:32,599
because if you can engage with a healthy

1293
00:52:30,739 --> 00:52:34,309
right of the sphere microbiome these

1294
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:38,900
points are actually creating their own

1295
00:52:34,309 --> 00:52:40,910
health mechanisms to maximize their

1296
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:45,059
health their development and all these

1297
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:46,509
other properties which could limit the

1298
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:49,548
[Music]

1299
00:52:46,509 --> 00:52:51,528
occupancy of different microbes above

1300
00:52:49,548 --> 00:52:53,358
ground I'll just say it like that that's

1301
00:52:51,528 --> 00:52:56,208
probably not the most wild way of saying

1302
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:58,848
it but the data was what it was that's

1303
00:52:56,208 --> 00:53:00,889
interesting i yeah i'm surprised that

1304
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:03,920
sort of seems counterintuitive to what

1305
00:53:00,889 --> 00:53:05,509
you would expect well they're in the

1306
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:08,568
soil I just don't think they come out of

1307
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:10,579
the soil as a short answer I don't think

1308
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:12,318
the microbes are making it up in the

1309
00:53:10,579 --> 00:53:14,539
soil or making it up to the above-ground

1310
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,130
plant colas where where they're actually

1311
00:53:14,539 --> 00:53:19,249
being tested or the flower is in

1312
00:53:16,130 --> 00:53:19,920
particular but they're engaging with the

1313
00:53:19,248 --> 00:53:22,659
plant

1314
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,249
mechanism to to make sure the plants

1315
00:53:22,659 --> 00:53:26,170
taking up nutrients and that's that's a

1316
00:53:24,248 --> 00:53:28,449
primary function of blow ground soil

1317
00:53:26,170 --> 00:53:31,240
microbes nutrient cycling and these

1318
00:53:28,449 --> 00:53:34,480
nutrients are actually building blocks

1319
00:53:31,239 --> 00:53:36,278
that help build molecules that allow the

1320
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,829
plants to respond to environment

1321
00:53:36,278 --> 00:53:40,778
distress to developing quality metrics

1322
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:43,359
like terpenes and cannabinoids also and

1323
00:53:40,778 --> 00:53:44,739
so if you can maximize naturally

1324
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,528
maximize plant nutrient uptake

1325
00:53:44,739 --> 00:53:50,108
I think the plant can do a lot for

1326
00:53:47,528 --> 00:53:54,068
itself you know in nature this is

1327
00:53:50,108 --> 00:53:58,889
another example I don't see plants being

1328
00:53:54,068 --> 00:54:01,778
devastated by by pests in many cases or

1329
00:53:58,889 --> 00:54:03,699
mildew in mono crops it happens more so

1330
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:05,498
but in nature what did that happen to

1331
00:54:03,699 --> 00:54:07,210
everything you know these plants per

1332
00:54:05,498 --> 00:54:09,909
system to a large degree it's because

1333
00:54:07,210 --> 00:54:13,480
they have an in nature of long standing

1334
00:54:09,909 --> 00:54:16,210
very very healthy soil microbial

1335
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:17,920
register interaction that allows them to

1336
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:19,838
take what they need to survive in their

1337
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:22,028
environment yeah my thought was more

1338
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:24,940
along the line of soils than microbial

1339
00:54:22,028 --> 00:54:25,809
inoculants like the idea that having a

1340
00:54:24,940 --> 00:54:27,489
soul in your room

1341
00:54:25,809 --> 00:54:30,789
things might get disturbed through

1342
00:54:27,489 --> 00:54:32,528
employees and some of that dust may

1343
00:54:30,789 --> 00:54:34,869
contain bacteria they may make its way

1344
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:37,960
up on to the colas and then that may

1345
00:54:34,869 --> 00:54:39,519
slightly raise your CFU account that

1346
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,380
were like a people that are trying to go

1347
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:45,219
vertical with soils I think that's a

1348
00:54:41,380 --> 00:54:46,568
challenge there too fair enough yeah if

1349
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:48,669
you're physically pliant

1350
00:54:46,568 --> 00:54:52,210
got it if you're physically applying

1351
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:53,858
soil to to any above-ground material

1352
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:55,358
there's gonna be markers on soil that's

1353
00:54:53,858 --> 00:54:57,248
one of the problems roll and I was in

1354
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,380
Vegas a couple of years ago during a

1355
00:54:57,248 --> 00:55:01,480
facility that one of the girl in

1356
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,430
greenhouses and I had it shut the

1357
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,929
greenhouse down and the reason was

1358
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:06,639
because it's a desert out there in

1359
00:55:04,929 --> 00:55:09,669
Nevada and they couldn't keep enough

1360
00:55:06,639 --> 00:55:11,679
dust out from blowing over their plants

1361
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,619
and they're failing microbial test

1362
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:15,940
because the dust from outside that they

1363
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:17,230
couldn't keep out of the greenhouse is

1364
00:55:15,940 --> 00:55:19,179
blowing over their plant so there was

1365
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:22,630
nothing wrong with this flower there was

1366
00:55:19,179 --> 00:55:27,629
this natural soil dust if you will

1367
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:30,400
airborne soil that are basically

1368
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:32,769
harboring soil microbes because that's

1369
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,860
where microbes live and so there

1370
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:38,829
you do want to keep soil the soil off of

1371
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:42,610
the above ground because again you could

1372
00:55:38,829 --> 00:55:46,179
be inoculating your above-ground plants

1373
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:48,340
but if it's wet you know it's not going

1374
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:50,919
to fly around as much if it stays in the

1375
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:52,600
pot if it's in trays I think you can

1376
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:54,550
manage that but you definitely want to

1377
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:57,099
take measures to manage that

1378
00:55:54,550 --> 00:55:59,380
it's a good point yeah I mean I think

1379
00:55:57,099 --> 00:56:03,039
the laws are kind of ludicrous right now

1380
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,539
around microbial testing Washington's

1381
00:56:03,039 --> 00:56:09,090
gotten a little bit better in the sense

1382
00:56:04,539 --> 00:56:13,090
and now it it tests for more specific

1383
00:56:09,090 --> 00:56:14,500
strains or diseases which would impact

1384
00:56:13,090 --> 00:56:16,900
human health so I think that is

1385
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:18,820
important I think the testings itself is

1386
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,190
important but I think that just like any

1387
00:56:18,820 --> 00:56:23,890
other crop we should be able to rinse or

1388
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,869
wash it or grow it in a way that it

1389
00:56:23,889 --> 00:56:29,440
contains you know probiotic bacteria and

1390
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:31,420
it's not dangerous then you know I'd it

1391
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,679
just seems silly but the regulations

1392
00:56:31,420 --> 00:56:35,110
being what they are and we have to work

1393
00:56:32,679 --> 00:56:37,719
within them yeah I couldn't agree more

1394
00:56:35,110 --> 00:56:39,039
and it's you know it's hard maybe I

1395
00:56:37,719 --> 00:56:40,599
shouldn't say this when I'm saying like

1396
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:42,880
it's really hard

1397
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:45,730
educating regulators I mean what a

1398
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:48,070
daunting task and you know it's it's

1399
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:49,780
you're right it's not yeah and this is

1400
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:52,180
where this is what you were talking

1401
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,880
about a little bit earlier they're

1402
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:57,399
looking at very very coarse see a few

1403
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:59,619
colony forming unit concentrations of

1404
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:03,190
microbes they're not looking at what

1405
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:05,920
microbes are there and so it's those are

1406
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:08,980
two completely different hazard issues

1407
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:11,349
and there's very very very few much you

1408
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:13,329
know most microbes on earth very 99.999%

1409
00:57:11,349 --> 00:57:16,389
of all microbes on Earth are beneficial

1410
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:18,569
you know that it's a shame that all we

1411
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:20,980
hear about or most the bad ones

1412
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:23,410
personally because we've about the good

1413
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:25,539
one humans have to focus on the bad ones

1414
00:57:23,409 --> 00:57:28,690
because they they're more of our risk

1415
00:57:25,539 --> 00:57:31,719
you know and so categorizing all the

1416
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:35,139
good microbes with with some very very

1417
00:57:31,719 --> 00:57:36,519
few bad players just inherently nothing

1418
00:57:35,139 --> 00:57:40,529
nothing personal it's just how they

1419
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:43,750
evolved is it's not honestly

1420
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:45,010
scientifically accurate so that brought

1421
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:46,539
up a question for me I've been wanting

1422
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:50,950
to ask you which is

1423
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:54,279
Oh globally how much diversity to really

1424
00:57:50,949 --> 00:57:59,619
see in the microbial world as we move

1425
00:57:54,280 --> 00:58:02,620
from Arizona to Colorado to Ethiopia are

1426
00:57:59,619 --> 00:58:06,190
we gonna see the same microbes more or

1427
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:08,400
less but probably in different ratios or

1428
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:10,720
within different functional groups

1429
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:12,369
because I hear a lot of talk about using

1430
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:16,899
indigenous microbes so a lot of people

1431
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:21,039
are culturing or promoting what is

1432
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:22,690
already successful in their area what

1433
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:24,579
are there any dangers with bringing in

1434
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:26,440
these outdoor you know these outside

1435
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:28,360
microbes into a new environment for

1436
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,070
example do you want us to kind of touch

1437
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:32,620
on this subject a little bit yeah you

1438
00:58:30,070 --> 00:58:35,200
know it's a conceptual question and I

1439
00:58:32,619 --> 00:58:36,789
think you know you hear about it's a

1440
00:58:35,199 --> 00:58:38,649
microbiologist one of the terms that

1441
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:42,250
comes up often is ubiquitous Peschel e

1442
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:45,910
environmental microbiologist everything

1443
00:58:42,250 --> 00:58:48,670
is everywhere and the environment

1444
00:58:45,909 --> 00:58:51,369
collects you know and so what you are

1445
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:53,940
going to see in most cases that's more

1446
00:58:51,369 --> 00:58:56,469
or less true that there's going to be

1447
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:59,110
vast differences in their relative

1448
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:01,480
abundances have certain microbial groups

1449
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:04,390
and microbial functional groups in some

1450
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:07,269
environment relative to others because

1451
00:59:04,389 --> 00:59:08,859
again the environment selects and favors

1452
00:59:07,269 --> 00:59:10,239
some over the other based on some of the

1453
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,360
conversations we had earlier in this

1454
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:15,129
talk and so yeah in some cases for sure

1455
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:17,380
in extreme environments for sure you're

1456
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:19,660
going to see very unique species that

1457
00:59:17,380 --> 00:59:23,140
just can't persist other places because

1458
00:59:19,659 --> 00:59:26,679
that environment is not going to nurture

1459
00:59:23,139 --> 00:59:29,710
the vast majority of microbes but I've

1460
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:31,149
seen I've actually experienced companies

1461
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:32,380
and worked with companies who are

1462
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,570
manufacturing micro manufacturing

1463
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:36,940
companies and they're trying to get

1464
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:42,340
their product over to Australia as an

1465
00:59:36,940 --> 00:59:44,650
example and Australia the regular route

1466
00:59:42,340 --> 00:59:46,030
the regulators in Australia were like

1467
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:48,250
whoa we don't want these invasive

1468
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:50,530
microbes and you know I guess I don't

1469
00:59:48,250 --> 00:59:53,380
blame the word invasive is pretty tough

1470
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:56,740
we don't want these invasive microbes in

1471
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:59,500
our country and how this particular

1472
00:59:56,739 --> 01:00:00,098
company got around that is they prove

1473
00:59:59,500 --> 01:00:01,809
that

1474
01:00:00,099 --> 01:00:03,489
the microbes in this particular product

1475
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:08,170
they were making we're in their country

1476
01:00:03,489 --> 01:00:10,028
already and so I think everything more

1477
01:00:08,170 --> 01:00:12,579
than not is everywhere it's how it's

1478
01:00:10,028 --> 01:00:16,498
packaged it's the relative abundances

1479
01:00:12,579 --> 01:00:19,209
and there's some real some real

1480
01:00:16,498 --> 01:00:20,768
variability and how different microbes

1481
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:22,058
are different relative abundances can be

1482
01:00:20,768 --> 01:00:25,238
packaged to perform different functions

1483
01:00:22,059 --> 01:00:28,180
and we've realized that and and there's

1484
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:30,458
this whole third level so that's what's

1485
01:00:28,179 --> 01:00:32,919
so interesting scale my favorite word

1486
01:00:30,458 --> 01:00:34,838
ever and there's this whole other level

1487
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:36,909
of species you know do we even know what

1488
01:00:34,838 --> 01:00:41,489
the species is because I'll tell you

1489
01:00:36,909 --> 01:00:44,288
right now you know there's numerous

1490
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:47,440
species of e.coli and I'm just going to

1491
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:50,769
give this extreme example and very few

1492
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,778
of them or even bad for you we only hear

1493
01:00:50,768 --> 01:00:54,458
about the bad ones and I use that

1494
01:00:52,778 --> 01:00:56,349
example cuz everyone's like well we Cole

1495
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:58,389
I'll kill ya now used to work with

1496
01:00:56,349 --> 01:01:01,479
e.coli all the time there are certain

1497
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:04,389
strains of E coli e---coli the genus and

1498
01:01:01,478 --> 01:01:06,698
species it's a species it's supposed to

1499
01:01:04,389 --> 01:01:09,038
be distinct but that's not true it's

1500
01:01:06,699 --> 01:01:11,798
just like a cultivar implant there's so

1501
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:13,509
many varieties within a cultivar that

1502
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:15,130
have different traits well microbes have

1503
01:01:13,509 --> 01:01:19,829
the same kind of characteristic within

1504
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:25,358
their species and so there's there's a

1505
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:28,089
strain specificity that shifts more so

1506
01:01:25,358 --> 01:01:32,098
than species specificity around

1507
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:34,509
different region around our geography of

1508
01:01:32,099 --> 01:01:37,150
microbiology and it's harder to measure

1509
01:01:34,509 --> 01:01:40,298
tab so that's this other level that is

1510
01:01:37,150 --> 01:01:43,690
microbial ecologists or the the industry

1511
01:01:40,298 --> 01:01:45,728
in general the area of environmental

1512
01:01:43,690 --> 01:01:47,079
microbiology is just now starting to

1513
01:01:45,728 --> 01:01:51,009
wrap its head around how do we measure

1514
01:01:47,079 --> 01:01:55,539
this with confidence within any one

1515
01:01:51,009 --> 01:01:57,608
species it's an ongoing challenge okay

1516
01:01:55,539 --> 01:02:01,329
I don't have a lot to add to that that's

1517
01:01:57,608 --> 01:02:03,998
it no that was good I just it just gives

1518
01:02:01,329 --> 01:02:05,709
me a lot to think about one other

1519
01:02:03,998 --> 01:02:06,818
question or something I did want to

1520
01:02:05,708 --> 01:02:08,498
bring up that I thought was interesting

1521
01:02:06,818 --> 01:02:10,929
from hearing one of your talks though

1522
01:02:08,498 --> 01:02:12,698
was that when you talk you you used the

1523
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:14,000
word consortium white a bit because when

1524
01:02:12,699 --> 01:02:16,519
we talk about these micro

1525
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,619
as being you know generalists or very

1526
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:23,269
targeted you did some research that

1527
01:02:18,619 --> 01:02:25,760
found that any one bacteria in mammoth P

1528
01:02:23,269 --> 01:02:28,280
by itself did not have the same effect

1529
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,690
as all of them together like the the

1530
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:31,250
some is more than the parts

1531
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:33,980
can you just touch on that really

1532
01:02:31,250 --> 01:02:36,769
quickly yeah I was kind of touching on

1533
01:02:33,980 --> 01:02:39,199
that no app and my last little rant

1534
01:02:36,769 --> 01:02:41,000
there where you know there's there is a

1535
01:02:39,199 --> 01:02:42,649
real magic and the interactions of

1536
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:45,349
microbes in those relative abundances

1537
01:02:42,650 --> 01:02:47,990
it's just true and there's no single

1538
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:50,690
species that act in nature alone because

1539
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:53,269
microbes have evolved to interact not

1540
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:57,318
only with other plants and other biotic

1541
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:59,750
and you know counterparts but with other

1542
01:02:57,318 --> 01:03:02,150
bacterial species in particular at the

1543
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:03,050
very beginning of the creation of life

1544
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:07,630
so to speak

1545
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:10,550
and so what we realized knowing that

1546
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:13,309
what we knew is microbial ecologist from

1547
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:15,440
academic training was that we needed to

1548
01:03:13,309 --> 01:03:17,630
create a consortium microbes which is

1549
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:20,450
again the same word for almost the same

1550
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:23,480
word for community its assembly of

1551
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:27,769
different species they come together to

1552
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:32,059
interact to perform a unique function or

1553
01:03:27,769 --> 01:03:34,509
have interacted benefit and so that was

1554
01:03:32,059 --> 01:03:38,239
our goal at the whole time to create

1555
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:40,069
consortium of microbes in any kind of

1556
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:41,750
product that we're going to deploy for

1557
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:43,940
agriculture because we felt like they

1558
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:45,349
would be more efficacious and that they

1559
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:48,380
would have a higher functionality

1560
01:03:45,349 --> 01:03:50,900
because it mimic a natural system and as

1561
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:52,880
an example if we had a highly functional

1562
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:54,950
stable consortium we entered them and we

1563
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:57,650
added them to any one soil they would

1564
01:03:54,949 --> 01:04:00,259
have a lot higher chance of persisting

1565
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:02,000
and engaging with the existing community

1566
01:04:00,260 --> 01:04:04,520
in the soil and plants in that

1567
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:06,739
environment than a single species which

1568
01:04:04,519 --> 01:04:09,108
would be very much out of its element

1569
01:04:06,739 --> 01:04:11,838
and probably have a lot more competitive

1570
01:04:09,108 --> 01:04:14,000
pressures for food and otherwise with

1571
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:16,608
the not only endemic microbes with the

1572
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:21,108
other the other biotic life in that soil

1573
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:26,328
and so we tested the theory or the

1574
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:27,019
hypothesis by not only testing the

1575
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:28,460
contortion

1576
01:04:27,019 --> 01:04:30,469
and nurturing this consortium that we

1577
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:32,750
have in Amethi but then we broke down

1578
01:04:30,469 --> 01:04:35,959
the intial individual species with them

1579
01:04:32,750 --> 01:04:37,730
within this formula and tested their

1580
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:39,949
functionality and then we combined all

1581
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:43,639
twos threes and four combinations to

1582
01:04:39,949 --> 01:04:47,000
realize that in this formula and at that

1583
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:48,679
concentration we had optimal

1584
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:52,400
functionality which couldn't be achieved

1585
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:55,969
by any of the lesser counterparts

1586
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:59,030
meaning the one or two or three species

1587
01:04:55,969 --> 01:05:02,000
combined really fascinating stuff that

1588
01:04:59,030 --> 01:05:03,800
is interesting and you know I wanted to

1589
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,599
touch on some of the Union one of the

1590
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,670
topics we input on here was the myths of

1591
01:05:05,599 --> 01:05:09,739
cannabis cultivation one of the beliefs

1592
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:11,300
growers have held over time around

1593
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:14,029
certain growing practices and are they

1594
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:16,010
legitimate unfortunately though we're

1595
01:05:14,030 --> 01:05:17,560
out of time for today but I would love

1596
01:05:16,010 --> 01:05:20,390
to maybe follow up with you another time

1597
01:05:17,559 --> 01:05:21,739
down the road if that would work yeah

1598
01:05:20,389 --> 01:05:23,690
absolutely we're gonna have a whole

1599
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:26,539
session on this you probably know a

1600
01:05:23,690 --> 01:05:27,950
couple yourself I've got a few ideas but

1601
01:05:26,539 --> 01:05:30,980
I would love to hear what you have to

1602
01:05:27,949 --> 01:05:33,159
say with your background but before we

1603
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:35,929
sign off I want to put you on the spot

1604
01:05:33,159 --> 01:05:38,420
could you maybe give listeners one

1605
01:05:35,929 --> 01:05:41,210
actionable thing that they could do in

1606
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:44,780
their gardens to promote microbial

1607
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:47,599
health besides using mammoth B what else

1608
01:05:44,780 --> 01:05:50,210
can you recommend growers consider just

1609
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:53,809
as a good good practice here's here's a

1610
01:05:50,210 --> 01:05:56,119
little this is an easy one just remember

1611
01:05:53,809 --> 01:05:57,920
that carbon is the currency of all life

1612
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,619
on Earth you know that's what

1613
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:03,889
distinguishes healthy soils and high

1614
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:06,739
cation exchange from lower cation

1615
01:06:03,889 --> 01:06:08,989
exchange or not so fertile soils that's

1616
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:10,579
what distinguishes natural systems from

1617
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:13,429
agriculture systems that were heavily

1618
01:06:10,579 --> 01:06:16,309
farmed it's total organic matter or

1619
01:06:13,429 --> 01:06:18,529
carbon content in the soil and if you

1620
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:20,929
can nurture and maximize your carbon

1621
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:22,430
content at some level you're going to

1622
01:06:20,929 --> 01:06:24,619
naturally certain you're going to

1623
01:06:22,429 --> 01:06:25,940
nurture the soil health and you're going

1624
01:06:24,619 --> 01:06:27,769
to nourish the soil health not only in

1625
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:29,570
the ability of the soil to hold on in

1626
01:06:27,769 --> 01:06:31,820
nutrients but you're going to harbour

1627
01:06:29,570 --> 01:06:34,280
the microbial life that can help cycle

1628
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:36,680
that nutrients so the carbon is the key

1629
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:39,410
for all of us on earth and it's no

1630
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:40,879
different for the soil awesome thanks I

1631
01:06:39,409 --> 01:06:42,469
really appreciate your time today

1632
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,289
calling and look forward to talking

1633
01:06:42,469 --> 01:06:46,789
again soon thanks for coming on the show

1634
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:48,880
yeah thank you so much that it was a

1635
01:06:46,789 --> 01:06:52,070
pleasure

1636
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:53,090
that was Colin bell of Mammoth Pete if

1637
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:57,380
you would like to learn more about

1638
01:06:53,090 --> 01:06:58,190
