1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:05,548
hi this is Todd Husky with kiss organics

2
00:00:03,448 --> 00:00:07,979
and I'm here today to take a look under

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:09,570
the microscope at mammoth pee and see if

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,339
there are ways that we might be able to

5
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:13,830
extract and replicate some of these

6
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:18,359
microorganisms just to make the mammoth

7
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:20,579
Beagle a little bit further okay this

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,439
week we're here with mammoth P this is

9
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:25,349
directly out of the sample bottle that I

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:26,849
received this bottle I've had for at

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,760
least a few months now it's just been

12
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:31,768
sitting in my lab this is at 400 times

13
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,770
magnification using a phase contrast

14
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:38,100
microscope you can see there's actually

15
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:41,340
a fair bit of active motile bacteria

16
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,929
running around and what I'm guessing is

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,050
a little piece of alfalfa since I know

18
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:48,299
they use alfalfa and they're in their

19
00:00:46,049 --> 00:00:49,949
process up in the upper right hand

20
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:51,149
corner of the screen

21
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,870
so what we're going to attempt to do

22
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:56,189
today is in distilled water mix and

23
00:00:54,869 --> 00:00:57,890
micro pee with a few different

24
00:00:56,189 --> 00:01:00,179
ingredients and see if we can't

25
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,530
replicate some of these organisms to

26
00:01:00,179 --> 00:01:08,430
make our mammoth pee just go a little

27
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:11,579
bit further okay we're back this is

28
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:14,250
about 12 hours later this is the mammoth

29
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:16,890
pee again with nothing but distilled

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:19,650
water so after 12 hours you can see we

31
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:25,829
have what appears to be more active

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:27,000
microbes even without a food source now

33
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:28,618
we're go on to check and see how

34
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,340
different food sources affected these

35
00:01:28,618 --> 00:01:31,340
different microbes

36
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:39,130
okay here's the mammoth P again this

37
00:01:36,579 --> 00:01:42,370
time I've added a small amount of on

38
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:46,509
sulfur blackstrap molasses as you can

39
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:49,228
see quite a bit more activity with the

40
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:49,228
added food source

41
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:04,459
pretty much the whole slide looks about

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:08,618
like this okay we're back this was the

43
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:14,780
microbe catalyst added to the mammoth P

44
00:02:08,618 --> 00:02:18,020
and around 16 hours in and you'll notice

45
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:21,110
here on quite the same levels of

46
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,210
bacterial growth as we had using the

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:28,570
molasses but what you do see is a much

48
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:30,830
greater diversity of microorganisms

49
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:32,719
which is really what we want we can't

50
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,570
guarantee that that molasses is growing

51
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:38,689
out all of the of the P solubilizing

52
00:02:35,569 --> 00:02:41,870
bacteria that mammoth P is adding into

53
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:44,180
the mix and while we can't do the same

54
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,879
with the microbe catalyst at least not

55
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:49,069
with the we just direct microscopy we

56
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,169
are able to at least determine that the

57
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:56,239
there is a much greater diversity in

58
00:02:51,169 --> 00:03:00,919
morphology looking at this sample which

59
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:05,120
I find encouraging okay here's the

60
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:10,488
alfalfa at 16 hours with the mammoth P

61
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,189
in distilled water and that's as you can

62
00:03:10,489 --> 00:03:16,909
see there's pretty good bacterial growth

63
00:03:13,189 --> 00:03:20,150
again more than the control in the piece

64
00:03:16,909 --> 00:03:22,189
to be a little bit more morphological

65
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:26,300
diversity than we saw with the molasses

66
00:03:22,189 --> 00:03:27,650
but not quite as much growth so I'm

67
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:29,600
wondering if all self is a little better

68
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:34,099
food source especially considering they

69
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:36,169
use alfalfa as part of their there's

70
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:41,659
part of their process if lecturing

71
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:43,488
process or I'm wondering if I can up the

72
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:45,349
amount of microbe catalyst that I used

73
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:47,299
as a way of getting a little bit more

74
00:03:45,349 --> 00:03:52,639
bacterial growth while still maintaining

75
00:03:47,299 --> 00:03:54,849
that diversity of microorganisms so keep

76
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:57,679
in mind too that this test is not

77
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:59,900
completely conclusive we can't determine

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,959
exactly which microorganisms from the

79
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,049
micro-p are being being replicated and

80
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,209
if we're losing any in the process so

81
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:09,460
the next step would be to do some plant

82
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,729
trials

83
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,939
to determine what sorts of plant

84
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:19,800
response we get from a mixture like this

85
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:19,800
that's been that's been brewed

86
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:29,698
okay so this is just mammoth tea and

87
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:33,149
distilled water at 28 hours no food

88
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:39,000
sources whatsoever as you can see we're

89
00:04:33,149 --> 00:04:41,929
getting quite a bit of motile bacteria

90
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,120
not as much biomass as the other slides

91
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,709
but possibly a little better

92
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,879
morphological diversity which makes

93
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:51,120
sense assuming that all of these

94
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:55,430
microorganisms are these different

95
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,478
bacterial species are in mammoth pee I

96
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:59,370
think it speaks to the quality of the

97
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:02,459
product in regards to there being a lot

98
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:06,090
of good biological activity this

99
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:07,649
particular sample that I pulled was from

100
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:08,908
a sample bottle that I've had for at

101
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:14,158
least four months just sitting on a

102
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:19,949
shelf in you know normal room

103
00:05:14,158 --> 00:05:22,079
temperatures by comparison here's the

104
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:25,050
mammoth pee with the molasses and

105
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:28,560
distilled water in 28 hours and as you

106
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:31,319
can see there's quite a bit of bacterial

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,560
biomass but it appears that we don't

108
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,509
have the same level of diversity that we

109
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,218
were getting by feeding in a more

110
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:43,590
diversified soup food source like the

111
00:05:38,218 --> 00:05:45,149
microbe catalyst but we do appear to be

112
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:50,189
feeding at least one species of bacteria

113
00:05:45,149 --> 00:05:52,019
that seems pretty happy so this is

114
00:05:50,189 --> 00:05:54,839
pretty much what most of the slides look

115
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:58,079
like they'll have just a few pockets of

116
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:01,968
that really high high density that we

117
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:05,550
saw right at the beginning of this slide

118
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:08,038
okay here's the mammoth P in distilled

119
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:14,370
water with organic alfalfa meal at 28

120
00:06:08,038 --> 00:06:17,218
hours as you can see we do have good

121
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:19,860
bacterial growth and maybe a little bit

122
00:06:17,218 --> 00:06:22,529
more diversity than we're seeing

123
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:27,060
compared to the molasses not as much as

124
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:28,709
with the microbe catalyst but a little

125
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,990
bit more motile bacteria and not as much

126
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:35,459
biomass as the molasses was creating but

127
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:37,519
maybe a little bit better morphological

128
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:37,519
diversity

129
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,360
okay we're back with the mammoth P and

130
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,729
distilled water with the microbe

131
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:51,840
catalyst at around 28 hours we're seeing

132
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:53,909
a lot more bacterial biomass and a lot

133
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,538
of it is as you can see starting to

134
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:58,620
cluster around certain parts of the

135
00:06:56,538 --> 00:07:01,740
microbe catalyst some of the organic

136
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:04,110
matter in there disappears so this

137
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:08,538
appears to be a pretty good food source

138
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,560
option for at least some of the bacteria

139
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:15,538
bacterial species that are in the

140
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,250
mammoth P I'm seeing some morphological

141
00:07:15,538 --> 00:07:20,310
diversity but maybe not quite as much as

142
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:23,509
we had in the original sample which may

143
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:26,038
lead me to believe that not all of the

144
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:32,098
various pieces all utilizing species of

145
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:38,399
bacteria are being are being multiplied

146
00:07:32,098 --> 00:07:40,769
but I think it definitely is worth a

147
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:44,038
shot and I think this is a great way to

148
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:46,728
possibly extend your mammoth pee a

149
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:46,728
little bit further

150
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,530
you
