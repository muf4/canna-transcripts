welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

17
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,599
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

18
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:58,038
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

19
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,079
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:01,840
growing from a science-based perspective

21
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,239
and drawn top experts from around the

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,640
industry to share their wisdom and

23
00:01:03,238 --> 00:01:07,519
knowledge before starting the podcast I

24
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,960
did want to address one major change to

25
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,959
the show I know I mentioned in the past

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,359
about adding sponsorships or ads to the

27
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:16,158
podcast I've avoided it to date but with

28
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:18,319
Rising costs and changes to the economy

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,960
it's now something I've had to revisit

30
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:21,559
basically moving forward there'll be one

31
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:23,679
to two short ads now at the beginning of

32
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,519
the podcast we will also be adding the

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,400
patreon again with a subscription based

Jeff lowenfels I wanted to get Jeff our

42
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,559
very first podcast guest and old friend

43
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,519
back on the show Jeff is the author of

44
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,759
the popular teaming series teaming with

45
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:52,039
microbes teaming with nutrients teaming

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,359
with fungi and now his new book teaming

47
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:57,039
with bacteria which he joins us today to

48
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:58,680
discuss he also has a book called DIY

49
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:00,799
Autoflower and cannabis which we

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,520
discussed in an earlier interview

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,520
Jeff is an extremely well-respected and

love talking to you I think this is your

65
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,319
third time now on the podcast you're one

66
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:40,239
of my most uh frequented guests I think

67
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:42,759
it is and uh I'm I'm really excited to

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:45,719
talk about uh your new book and some of

69
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:48,840
the new research you've come across um

70
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:51,479
yeah why don't you take it away yeah

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,800
sure well you know uh you and I were

72
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:56,280
steeped in in the soil food web uh and I

73
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,439
and I wrote a book about that called

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,479
teaming with microbes and that book came

75
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,519
out in 2006

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:04,479
and and essentially it was a

77
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:07,120
codification of what we all learned from

78
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:09,598
Dr Elaine inam who's of course the guru

79
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,719
of the soil food web and and basically

80
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:14,919
the system as everybody probably knows

81
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:17,039
operates off of the exudates that are

82
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:19,000
produced with photosynthetic energy by

83
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:20,798
the plant the plant designs those

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
exudates drips them out into the

85
00:03:20,799 --> 00:03:26,400
rizosphere uh and they attract bacteria

86
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,080
and fungi that need the carbon that are

87
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,920
in those exudates remember Elaine called

88
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:34,120
them a cake cake and cookies uh you know

89
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:36,119
sugars and uh but there a lot of carbon

90
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,920
in them and that's that's what these non

91
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,640
photosynthe

92
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:42,119
photosynthesizing organisms need and so

93
00:03:40,639 --> 00:03:45,119
they they they're very happy there in

94
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:48,200
the rizosphere uh but they are uh

95
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,959
attracted to their own prey or things

96
00:03:48,199 --> 00:03:53,199
that eat them uh and those are nematodes

97
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:56,400
and protozoa and so the nematodes and

98
00:03:53,199 --> 00:04:00,158
protozoa eat the uh bacteria and eat the

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,480
fungi and as a result there are uh they

100
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:04,239
also need carbon you and I need carbon

101
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:06,039
of course you know everybody operates

102
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,000
off of carbon but they don't need

103
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:12,199
everything that's in the in the bacteria

104
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,438
or in the fungi and so uh that excess uh

105
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:17,918
is is plant nutrient and it's imp plant

106
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:20,319
usable form it has a charge on it the

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,279
microbes essentially put a charge on

108
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:25,159
these excess nutrient uh nutrients I

109
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:28,359
guess we'll call it that uh and they're

110
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:29,720
able to move from the soil into the

111
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,639
plant and of course teaming with

112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
nutrients is a book I wrote that talks

113
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:36,079
about how that happens and and how they

114
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:40,159
get in the plant and what happens inside

115
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:42,279
the plant uh you know kind of a fit

116
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,680
together uh and so that that that was a

117
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:48,079
soil food web I think at that time in

118
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:52,800
2006 I had a paragraph on micro Rizal

119
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:54,198
fungi um and and it wasn't until 2000 I

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,759
revised the book in

121
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:00,280
2011 to add a chapter about micro risel

122
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,240
fungi which are these specialized fungi

123
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:05,599
that are attracted to the plant by the

124
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,120
plant exudates the plant signals the

125
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,720
mical fungi that it's okay to enter the

126
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:14,478
plant and it does enter the plant in in

127
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,680
the root system in the meristem area and

128
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:20,719
and and they the the fungi enters in

129
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,439
between the the the root cells and and

130
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,680
there's a transfer of exudates and

131
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:28,800
goodies uh from from the soil by the

132
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,360
fungi and so this was a very important

133
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,560
addition to the soil food we well it

134
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,199
turns out that in

135
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,000
2016 no let me go back

136
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,840
2010 uh a group in Australia and

137
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,279
unfortunately and I really just got to

138
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:44,799
learn how to pronounce This Woman's name

139
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,239
uh a wonderful woman who has a

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,319
hyphenated name

141
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:55,280
Shadow lhe him uh and her and her team

142
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:58,319
uh uh in Australia discovered that some

143
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,559
of these bacteria that are attracted by

144
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:04,680
those exad dates to to that to that

145
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,240
rizosphere area actually enter into the

146
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,400
meristem cells now this had never really

147
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,879
been seen before or if it had been seen

148
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:16,318
before the implications of what it was

149
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:18,519
uh was not fully understood and so so

150
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,120
this group studied this and they they

151
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:24,719
termed it uh I'm going to give it the

152
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:27,800
American pronunciation Riso fagi RH i z

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,199
o Riso of course meaning root and fagi

154
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:32,639
meaning eating so root e

155
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,598
and it appeared uh they weren't quite

156
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,478
positive what was going on that the

157
00:06:34,598 --> 00:06:39,719
perhaps the cell was opening up

158
00:06:36,478 --> 00:06:42,959
engulfing uh bacteria and then closing

159
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,280
up again um and and and so that was

160
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:48,239
where they were inside there they didn't

161
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:49,839
really study about what was going on uh

162
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,519
and apparently their grand funding must

163
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:54,198
have run out uh and so it languished now

164
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:57,318
I remember getting a note from one of my

165
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:59,038
friends who read about this uh and and

166
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:02,319
and I read the note and it just said

167
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:05,000
rise of I had no idea what it was until

168
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:09,080
I ran into a gentleman who's a professor

169
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:11,598
at ruter University named Dr James White

170
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:15,399
and what Dr James White and his uh

171
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:18,478
students are have were able to do they

172
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:20,439
could trace what was going on with those

173
00:07:18,478 --> 00:07:22,478
bacteria how they got in what was

174
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,959
happening with them and what they

175
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:29,079
discovered was beyond astounding and

176
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,598
changes the picture of the soil food web

177
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:34,318
uh so that that so that if you don't

178
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:36,439
understand rise of fagi you you're not

179
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:40,360
going to have a full picture of how to

180
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:41,839
operate uh in a soil food web situation

181
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,919
in other words how to grow your plants

182
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:45,560
properly so that you are teaming with

183
00:07:43,918 --> 00:07:47,120
the microbes and the soil food web is

184
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,800
helping you and

185
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,079
so I think what I probably should do

186
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,840
with your permission is describe the

187
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:56,758
riseof fasy

188
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:58,799
cycle does that make sense yeah that

189
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,639
sounds great why don't we uh why don't

190
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,639
we start there oh okay we will do so uh

191
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,158
I I wish we were doing this uh you know

192
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:09,519
with a super uh screen in front of us

193
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:12,000
because the photographs of this cycle

194
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:14,158
are absolutely phenomenal and in in the

195
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,759
book I've got a lot of them uh you

196
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:19,240
should be able to find some of these on

197
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,598
the web uh before I begin I I think I I

198
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:24,319
I want to point out that bacteria are

199
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,519
something that we don't study uh they're

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,479
too small to really see they're they're

201
00:08:26,519 --> 00:08:33,598
you know 90 time 90 times smaller than a

202
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:35,838
hair uh they're just tiny but they're

203
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,479
everywhere and so as a consequence we

204
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,959
really you know when I say the word

205
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:43,479
bacteria people think of you know like a

206
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:45,958
like a car in a driveway uh but when I

207
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:48,160
said that's a bacterium when I say

208
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:51,559
bacteria you should be thinking of a you

209
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:55,159
know the New York City's biggest airport

210
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:57,799
parking lot and all of those cars are

211
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:59,879
bacterium to that form bacteria and

212
00:08:57,799 --> 00:09:01,519
they're everywhere and and you should

213
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:06,320
immediately after listening to this

214
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,879
podcast Google uh bacteria head of a pin

215
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,000
and you'll see some unbelievable

216
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:12,159
pictures a and just last week there was

217
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,879
an award given to a picture of a and you

218
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:19,919
can Google this too a single tongue cell

219
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:23,679
surrounded by bacteria and you'll get a

220
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:26,319
feeling for the tininess and the

221
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:30,039
multitude of these organisms that

222
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,079
multiply every 20 minutes on a

223
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:33,679
they are just phenomenal and and a part

224
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,439
of the book deals with bacteria

225
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:37,039
obviously and describes them and how

226
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
they operate and all that kind of good

227
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:42,439
stuff all right anyway so now we've got

228
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,120
these these exudate attracted fungi and

229
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,360
bacteria that are up there uh in the

230
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,000
rizosphere area and some of these

231
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:56,600
bacteria instead of being eaten they

232
00:09:52,000 --> 00:10:00,399
smell a popcorn smell a buttered popcorn

233
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:02,000
smell it's butyric acid it's the same

234
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
stuff that's in your stomach and if you

235
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,240
get too much butc acid together it

236
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,360
smells rancid and if you get a

237
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,360
tremendous amount of butc acid together

238
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,200
it smells like vomit but at this stage

239
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,159
down at the Rises Fiel level they Mellon

240
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,040
butter popcorn in my imagination and it

241
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:22,120
causes them because they're living in a

242
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:25,159
little bacterial slime to think that

243
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,278
there's an area outside of their home

244
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:29,799
slime that they can move

245
00:10:27,278 --> 00:10:32,200
to where they'll have a better

246
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:34,519
opportunities to survive to eat to

247
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,320
multiply without having to deal with all

248
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:39,078
the other people in the Slime or other

249
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,959
bacteria in the Slime so they they push

250
00:10:39,078 --> 00:10:45,919
against the smell and it turns out that

251
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:51,000
what they're doing is moving through the

252
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:54,759
meristem root marem cell walls the root

253
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,120
marem cells are very they're brand new

254
00:10:54,759 --> 00:11:01,000
they have very thin cell walls they're

255
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,600
very immature cells and they uh are

256
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:08,519
invaded by these bacteria who enter into

257
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:11,519
a space between the cell wall and the

258
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:13,839
membrane that holds the cytoplasm in the

259
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,720
cell the cytoplasm the place where the

260
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,639
all the organel are held the nucleus

261
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:24,040
chloroplast blah blah blah uh the way I

262
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:27,759
liken this is to a tofu container so you

263
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:30,799
have a white tofu container that's the

264
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,000
cell wall of the of the plant the mar

265
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:34,958
stem cell wall Very Thin and the

266
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,879
bacteria go through there they're very

267
00:11:34,958 --> 00:11:39,919
small so they go through there and they

268
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:42,240
end up in that watery area that's in a

269
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:44,759
tofu packet that's called the

270
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,440
periplasmic space and then you've got

271
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:49,519
the tofu uh some of them actually enter

272
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,079
into the tofu that's the cytoplasm

273
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:56,440
membrane representation so they're in

274
00:11:52,078 --> 00:11:58,638
this perlas space and the plant goes oh

275
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,360
uh I just got invaded by bacteria even

276
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:03,000
though I inv invited them in I I need to

277
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:06,839
make sure that they're not going to harm

278
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:10,720
me and so the plant sprays the bacteria

279
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,880
with a super oxide which is very strong

280
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:16,759
and has the result of stripping off the

281
00:12:13,879 --> 00:12:19,639
cell walls of the bacteria so these are

282
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:23,519
now what we call L forms they have no

283
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:26,480
cell walls and the material that was in

284
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,639
their cell walls is absorbed by the

285
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,879
plant contains micronutrients Metals

286
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:34,799
some really neat things and the plant

287
00:12:31,879 --> 00:12:36,600
uses them as plant nutrients internally

288
00:12:34,799 --> 00:12:38,198
they're internal and they're absorbed

289
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:41,240
internally and they and they're used

290
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:43,399
internally obviously then the bacteria

291
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:47,198
goes whoa wait a minute we don't like

292
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,120
this and so the bacteria uses produces

293
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:51,599
an

294
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:55,560
antioxidant to reduce the super oxide's

295
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:59,600
ability to destroy the cell walls of the

296
00:12:55,559 --> 00:13:02,838
of the bacteria and this turns out to be

297
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:05,720
nitrite nitrite is then converted as a

298
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,639
result of a series of chemical reactions

299
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:10,600
uh in the par plasmic space some of

300
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:14,120
which involve the plant into

301
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:16,560
nitrate and the nitrate is plant usable

302
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,679
and it's absorbed by the plant as well

303
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:23,879
up to 30% of the nitr of nitrogen that a

304
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:27,638
plant can receive can be through this

305
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,679
cycle now if that wasn't enough it turns

306
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:32,159
out that these little guys they're

307
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:36,198
breeding and they're multiplying

308
00:13:32,159 --> 00:13:37,639
every 20 minutes and as they multiply

309
00:13:36,198 --> 00:13:40,559
they're also doing something else

310
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:44,159
they're producing a phyto hormone a

311
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:47,479
plant hormone that we call ethylene and

312
00:13:44,159 --> 00:13:50,078
ethylene causes the marison cell to grow

313
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,680
so here you have these invading bacteria

314
00:13:50,078 --> 00:13:55,359
they no longer have a cell wall they're

315
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:58,359
multiplying and as they multiply they

316
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,800
form these funny little balls they look

317
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,639
like beach balls volleyballs soccer

318
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:07,439
balls maybe uh they have four maybe six

319
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,000
uh uh walless bacteria stuck together

320
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,560
and they're circulated around this

321
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,039
perlas space producing ethylene which is

322
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:20,879
also circulated causing the Maris C to

323
00:14:17,039 --> 00:14:23,159
grow then they get so plentiful that

324
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:26,320
they end up getting trapped against the

325
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:30,559
cell wall of the plant the meristem cell

326
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,800
wall where the ethylene is produced in a

327
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:37,439
concentrated area because it it doesn't

328
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:42,758
get cycled and that ethylene causes the

329
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:46,040
merism cell wall to form a tube you and

330
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,120
I know this tube to be a hair a root

331
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:53,078
hair but this tube actually begins to

332
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,560
fill up with these bacteria and as they

333
00:14:53,078 --> 00:14:57,120
get more and more in the root grows

334
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,559
you're getting more ethylene production

335
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,639
and the root hair grows uh and it grows

336
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:08,799
longer the bacteria are literally

337
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:12,278
expelled by a periplasmic liquid tidal

338
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:17,399
wave out of the root hair tip into the

339
00:15:12,278 --> 00:15:20,919
soil where they go back and they regrow

340
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:24,399
their cell walls and eventually two

341
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:27,679
three days later go back into a new mer

342
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:30,278
stem cell and repeat the trip and

343
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:33,039
they're not just blown out once those as

344
00:15:30,278 --> 00:15:37,159
that root hair grows there can be four

345
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:39,759
or five of these explosions of bacteria

346
00:15:37,159 --> 00:15:41,879
that end up back into the soil some of

347
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,720
which obviously end up getting eaten and

348
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:46,799
they're they're part of what I I like to

349
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,278
call the you know the the soil mediated

350
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:51,519
system where they travel into the but

351
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:53,958
some of them go back and do the trip

352
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
again it's just simply incredible so

353
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,958
what we've got essentially and I'm going

354
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,759
to refine this just a little bit more in

355
00:15:57,958 --> 00:16:03,439
a minute or two uh what we've got is the

356
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:06,399
Dr Elaine model that you and I you know

357
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,680
breastfed on if I can use that term uh

358
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
you know that model is a farming model

359
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,799
uh the plant's a farmer it's throwing

360
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:18,159
out the exudates it's it's helping the

361
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:20,318
the fertilizing the the the bacteria the

362
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:22,759
the Proto protoo and everything it's all

363
00:16:20,318 --> 00:16:25,679
and then they end up you know taking in

364
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:29,600
the resultant crop what we've got in

365
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:32,758
this razazi cycle is a

366
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,480
ranching situation where the the Sheep

367
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:38,240
are brought into the barn they're

368
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,680
sheared we use the wool we eat a couple

369
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,519
of lamb chops because what the heck

370
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:43,198
they're there uh and then we put them

371
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,639
out in the pasture again to regrow their

372
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,240
wool and then they then the following

373
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:49,519
season we take them back in again and we

374
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,759
take the W off the off the Sheep again

375
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:54,519
it's just a it's so we've got a ranching

376
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,919
situation and we've got a farming

377
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,078
situation both of which are part of the

378
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:03,240
soil food web and and so now we've got a

379
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:05,879
much more complete picture of of how

380
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,400
that plant gets its nutrients if it's

381
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:13,679
getting 30 or or 40% of its nutrients uh

382
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:16,600
from these endic bacteria endites

383
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,160
meaning uh that they live inside the

384
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:23,399
plant for part of their lives then this

385
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:26,480
is a major major new discovery and I say

386
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:29,280
it makes teaming with bacteria equally

387
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,360
as important as the original book with

388
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:33,359
microbes because this is such an

389
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,519
important thing that's going on and the

390
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:40,000
implications of it both in the future

391
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:43,038
and and for right now are stunning and

392
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,798
usable so we'll certainly I'm sure be

393
00:17:43,038 --> 00:17:49,319
talking about that any questions about

394
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:52,400
me so far my stuff so far well so i'

395
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:53,918
I've read the book um yeah listening to

396
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,880
your explanation right now is actually

397
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:59,000
really helpful so if you're

398
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,440
someone that uh has has read the the

399
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,519
book and then listens to this I think

400
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,200
that's actually not a bad direction to

401
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:07,079
go because you break it down um really

402
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,360
well your explanation I love that

403
00:18:07,079 --> 00:18:11,599
analogy um so I'm going to try and put

404
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,119
into my own words to simplify it even

405
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:15,558
further and please correct me where I

406
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:18,199
screw it up because I'm still learning

407
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:20,960
and processing all of this uh myself so

408
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,200
basically we have a a cycle uh where

409
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,038
these bacteria specific bacteria are

410
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,480
going into the the meristematic tissue

411
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:31,480
or the meristem which is the all the new

412
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,240
undifferentiated tissue that most people

413
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,240
are familiar with the apical marem where

414
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,120
you have you know we're grow all of our

415
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,640
new growth is is based around mer

416
00:18:38,119 --> 00:18:41,639
meristematic tissue so it's like really

417
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,038
the exciting place on Plants new root

418
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,720
tips new leaves and very thin wall very

419
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:48,480
thin wall because they're brand new

420
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,720
they're brand new cells so yeah so they

421
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,960
become more

422
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,600
specialized uh as as the plant needs

423
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,880
them um but they just start as really

424
00:18:54,599 --> 00:18:58,639
like a blank canvas of a cell is how

425
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,240
I've always thought of them so it's kind

426
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,600
of all the actions happening and now

427
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,159
you're adding in this thing we didn't

428
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:06,240
even know about which is that there's

429
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:09,440
all these bacteria that that work their

430
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:12,359
way in lose their their their cell wall

431
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,798
or their wall what what you referred to

432
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:18,199
there um while they're inside cell they

433
00:19:15,798 --> 00:19:22,558
do have a cell wall okay they lose that

434
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:25,360
wall which is pretty amazing um and I I

435
00:19:22,558 --> 00:19:27,839
have trouble visualizing this but then

436
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:29,439
as they complete that cycle then they're

437
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,319
going back out

438
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:36,759
regaining that wall and then starting

439
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:39,319
the process over again yep Y

440
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:42,079
and well I just want to ask so then you

441
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:44,480
mentioned nitrogen sorry uh you

442
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:46,158
mentioned nitrogen as being the primary

443
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,200
nutrient in this it's specifically

444
00:19:46,159 --> 00:19:51,200
nitrite converting to nitrates are there

445
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,480
other nutrients that we know about that

446
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,319
are happening in this absolutely

447
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:57,679
absolutely I mean depending whether it's

448
00:19:55,319 --> 00:20:00,319
a gram positive or a gram negative cell

449
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:03,159
wall material that makes those cell

450
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:04,759
walls is absorbed and and so I don't

451
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:07,000
have the list in front of me but but

452
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:10,079
it's a it's a interesting list of things

453
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,038
Med you know there are there are they

454
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:14,918
are amino acids and other things and and

455
00:20:13,038 --> 00:20:19,200
and so there's quite a few nutrients

456
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:21,520
that are available uh by the rif fzy

457
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,759
cycle which means you know I guess

458
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:26,679
there's really sort of two qu questions

459
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:30,400
I'll let you continue but you know why

460
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,600
would a bacteria do this and why would a

461
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,640
plant let the bacteria do this I mean

462
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,038
you know the

463
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:38,880
bacteria is an enemy of the plant in

464
00:20:36,038 --> 00:20:41,240
many instances and the plant knows that

465
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,679
and and has defensive mechanisms to to

466
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:45,120
keep bacteria out that Ro in particular

467
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:47,640
can be can be strengthen and

468
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,319
incidentally when it sprays that Ro it

469
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:53,320
has the capability of removing its own

470
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:56,599
cell wall which is very thin and so it

471
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:59,558
has to strengthen itself in order to be

472
00:20:56,599 --> 00:21:00,439
able to handle the risler fasy C and

473
00:20:59,558 --> 00:21:03,279
that

474
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:05,640
strengthening lasts throughout the life

475
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,480
of the plant so again the implications

476
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,320
are

477
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,599
just mindboggling but yeah there's there

478
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:13,759
there are a series I don't know six

479
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:16,038
seven eight of eight nutrients that

480
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:18,640
actually get get get can get into the

481
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:22,038
plant as a result of the rise ofy cycle

482
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,320
and there's a bunch of different strains

483
00:21:22,038 --> 00:21:28,720
of endic bacteria this isn't just one

484
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:31,240
particular one quite a few

485
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,480
yeah and that's a very uh important

486
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,919
point to

487
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:38,120
make if I if I can just spend 30 seconds

488
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,480
and explain that there are other kinds

489
00:21:38,119 --> 00:21:43,399
of endophilic bacteria that enter the

490
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,960
plant uh through branching in this in

491
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:47,679
the in the root system as it branches

492
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,960
there little cracks in there and they

493
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:52,278
sneak in they come in through stomata uh

494
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,640
you know they they sneak in through

495
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:57,519
wounds and and and and things like

496
00:21:54,640 --> 00:22:00,278
growth holes and things like that and so

497
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:03,000
so they they're in the plant now with

498
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:06,038
regard to cannabis this is just too

499
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,278
stunning and too amazing what some of

500
00:22:06,038 --> 00:22:13,519
the Studies have shown is that the mix

501
00:22:10,278 --> 00:22:16,640
in the soil of bacteria that become

502
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:18,759
endophytic in or are capable of becoming

503
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,960
endopin bacteria either going through

504
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:23,440
the razif fzy cycle or going into the

505
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,240
plant to do other

506
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:30,200
stuff it's always basically the same but

507
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:32,519
once you get inside the plant and cize

508
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:37,960
the endophilic bacteria that are in that

509
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:42,000
plant they differ from strain to strain

510
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:45,159
holy crow this is the quote teror that

511
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:49,319
we have been looking for uh it's the

512
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,679
bacteria there's you know the the the uh

513
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,839
let's pick a strin you know Girl Scout

514
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,278
cookies has has one kind of endopin

515
00:22:54,839 --> 00:23:00,038
bacteria that's different

516
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:03,119
from uh you know may me another another

517
00:23:00,038 --> 00:23:04,798
string you know it's just incredible so

518
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:07,359
so now we're going to be able to start

519
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,158
doing some research uh and and develop

520
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:12,158
streams in different different kinds of

521
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:15,080
ways this is really big news for

522
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:16,720
cannabis Growers um and and these

523
00:23:15,079 --> 00:23:19,720
studies will become more and more

524
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:23,759
plentiful as President Biden's

525
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,880
initiative seeks a home we're almost

526
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:27,839
there we legalized cannabis where we can

527
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:31,080
do the research that we need to be doing

528
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:33,158
in order to get the very best of best so

529
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:35,558
uh phew it's just incredible now these

530
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:38,080
endophytes when they go in the plant

531
00:23:35,558 --> 00:23:40,759
produce phyto hormones so they've got

532
00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,480
the capability of producing oxin and

533
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:45,440
doing everything that an oxin does

534
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:50,038
because they're real oxin or gibc acid

535
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,960
ethylene is a uh uh um phyto hormone

536
00:23:50,038 --> 00:23:53,640
you've got you've got about six or seven

537
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,919
phyto hormones that are produced by

538
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,600
these bacteria and they they help the

539
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:01,640
plant do all sorts of things and so the

540
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,399
other reason why a plant might let an

541
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:07,038
endophytic bacteria survive inside

542
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,880
itself is because the plant is getting

543
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:13,240
helped by that endophytic bacteria uh

544
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:17,400
that they're using those phyto hormones

545
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,679
again a simply a stunning implication

546
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,960
when you consider that all of what I

547
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:26,600
call uh let's just call them the big bad

548
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:29,120
aggro guys what are they studying right

549
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:32,759
now they're studying the capability of

550
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:36,038
bacteria idic bacteria and and and some

551
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:37,359
fungi to produce nitrogen in the plant

552
00:24:36,038 --> 00:24:40,720
that's what that's what we have in the

553
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:42,439
risas cycle that's nitrogen fixation

554
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:44,600
just like in ryia although it's not

555
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:47,600
quite the same system but it's internal

556
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:49,879
nitrogen fixation holy cow isn't this

557
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:53,759
what we need a wheat plant that's

558
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:57,240
capable of producing its own nitrogen by

559
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:59,158
hosting the right kinds of bacteria yes

560
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,120
and that's what every that's the Holy

561
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,240
Grail of Agriculture these days and

562
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:05,879
we're getting there and part of it is

563
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:09,200
because of The Rao RIS ofas cycle and

564
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:12,120
part of it is because of uh this this

565
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,558
endopin uh phenomena that we that we

566
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:17,000
we're stumbling on and we're beginning

567
00:25:13,558 --> 00:25:20,038
to figure out how to use so where is the

568
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:22,960
bacteria getting the the

569
00:25:20,038 --> 00:25:24,398
nitrogen in the first place uh the it's

570
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,079
pulling it out of the

571
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:31,678
air so but not all of these are at are

572
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:34,158
are are necessarily um Riso bacteria

573
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,360
correct that's that's correct that's

574
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:38,159
absolutely correct uh and that's the

575
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,439
that's one of the stunning things about

576
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,399
this uh so in a rise oia situation what

577
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,880
you've got is a bacteria that's

578
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:48,759
attracted literally to a root hair how

579
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:52,840
interesting the root hair curls around

580
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:54,398
the bacteria uh these bacteria convert

581
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:56,480
themselves into

582
00:25:54,398 --> 00:25:58,519
bacteroids it's a little bit of

583
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,240
similarity doesn't it you know it's sort

584
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:04,200
interesting so finds itself inside the

585
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:08,120
plant in a different format and if

586
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:09,600
there's a system whereby the oxygen

587
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:12,839
level can be

588
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:16,240
reduced they are capable of producing

589
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:18,959
nitrogen from the air and they use that

590
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,000
nitrogen to live it it resides in that

591
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,038
nodule a little bit of it leaks out into

592
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,359
the soil when the plant dies that

593
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:29,319
nitrogen is released back into the soil

594
00:26:26,359 --> 00:26:31,558
so in this situation you know we've got

595
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:35,079
these endophytic bacteria inside the

596
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:38,519
plant producing nitrogen

597
00:26:35,079 --> 00:26:41,519
just from the air now with regard to

598
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:43,798
cannabis it becomes even more

599
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,359
interesting uh that paper I sent you

600
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:51,038
this morning by Dr James White blew my

601
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:54,158
socks off because it it proposes a

602
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:57,240
system whereby there's an explanation

603
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,080
for what's going on inside glandular

604
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:03,240
tricomes and if there's anything that a

605
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:07,158
cannabis grower is interested in it's

606
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:10,000
glandular tricomes and so what what the

607
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:13,120
theory is now and incidentally uh in the

608
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,398
book uh I I I I alluded to a lot of this

609
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:16,479
stuff but the book was written three

610
00:27:14,398 --> 00:27:18,038
years ago believe it or not you know it

611
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,159
goes through the editing process and

612
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:22,240
then the printing proc blah blah blah so

613
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,520
it takes a while to get a book out so at

614
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,519
the time these papers had not been

615
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:31,918
completed and so I was theorizing what

616
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:33,319
they would show but now Dr uh you know

617
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,038
Dr White and his students have

618
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:38,439
demonstrated enough to come up with a

619
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:41,759
pretty solid theory that that the the

620
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,440
there is bacteria in these tricomes

621
00:27:41,759 --> 00:27:45,519
because originally people were beginning

622
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,558
to think that these tricomes look like

623
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,399
root hairs why isn't you know is there

624
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,200
the same kind of nitrogen fixation

625
00:27:50,398 --> 00:27:55,000
activity in them that there is in root

626
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,600
hairs it turns out there's not quite as

627
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,240
much but there is nitrogen fixation

628
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,439
going on

629
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:05,159
the the bacteria that are in these

630
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:08,120
tricomes uh turn out to have to be in a

631
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,799
situation where there is a oxygen

632
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:13,518
deprived situation in order to fix the

633
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:17,119
nitrogen and what deprives them of

634
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:19,839
oxygen is being bombarded by are you

635
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:23,359
ready for this

636
00:28:19,839 --> 00:28:27,119
cannaboids holy crow in the being

637
00:28:23,359 --> 00:28:29,599
bombarded onto these bacteria so that

638
00:28:27,119 --> 00:28:31,079
they end up produc producing nitrogen in

639
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:33,959
the in the

640
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:36,918
tricomes but what gets produced as a

641
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:41,278
byproduct is what people grow cannabis

642
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:44,440
for wow so when I say this is an

643
00:28:41,278 --> 00:28:48,240
important book in terms of its amendment

644
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:51,558
to Dr Elaine soil food web uh uh you

645
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,399
know this is also an amendment to

646
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:55,720
anything you've been thinking about with

647
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:57,319
regard to cannabis and and and it goes

648
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,839
even further because the way these

649
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:03,240
bacteria uh uh survive from generation

650
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:06,079
of plant to generation of plant is

651
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:08,240
through the Le uh through the seeds they

652
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:10,960
get into the seed uh situation they get

653
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:13,759
into the flour uh they get caught up

654
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,240
when this when the flower forms uh the

655
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:19,599
the turg around the the the embryo

656
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,278
situation and and they're inside some of

657
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:24,759
them uh right up by the embryo some of

658
00:29:22,278 --> 00:29:27,278
them uh probably in the embryo Dr White

659
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:29,599
points out uh Bunches of them in the

660
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:32,519
seed coated s and a Bunches of them just

661
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:35,398
inside the seat coat and these are the

662
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:38,720
bacteria that jump out into the soil

663
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:41,599
once you germinate the plant or the seed

664
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:43,720
and start the process of providing the

665
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:48,158
right riseof fasy and endophytic

666
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:51,440
bacteria for the plant holy crow all

667
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,919
these years all so many cannabis Growers

668
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,080
have been sterilizing their seeds

669
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,840
who you know they haven't been

670
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:01,319
fortunately able to fully sterilize

671
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,918
their seeds because it's not that easy

672
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:06,240
to do uh but they've been taking some of

673
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,278
the important bacteria out of the system

674
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,440
and then you know probably wondering why

675
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:13,519
they're getting powdery mildew etc etc

676
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,679
because these bacteria do all the things

677
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,278
that Dr reain explained you know they

678
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,919
produce antibiotics they have you know

679
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:24,640
all sorts of things they they go out and

680
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:26,720
Cate iron and minerals in the soil and

681
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,600
metals and bring them into the

682
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,440
plant and we plant things in paper

683
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:34,199
towels how about that paper towel

684
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,519
germination process it's in my cannabis

685
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,159
book The autoflowering cannabis yeah

686
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:41,079
well you know what you better be

687
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:43,360
planting that paper towel piece in the

688
00:30:41,079 --> 00:30:45,359
soil as well because you got bacteria

689
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:48,278
that jump off the seed onto the paper

690
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:50,079
towel you want that in the soil uh you

691
00:30:48,278 --> 00:30:52,798
know all the advice that you've gotten

692
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:55,278
over the years about not throwing from

693
00:30:52,798 --> 00:30:57,599
me uh you know as a result of what I'm

694
00:30:55,278 --> 00:30:59,480
gleaning from Dr El you know not

695
00:30:57,599 --> 00:31:01,359
throwing away soil unless you've got a

696
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:03,798
terrible root problem because that soil

697
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,599
contains exudates well it also contains

698
00:31:03,798 --> 00:31:08,879
the bacteria that the Cannabis needs and

699
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:12,558
it contains probably the right bacteria

700
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,278
from previous grows uh that are that are

701
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:16,879
either dormant or in there waiting for

702
00:31:14,278 --> 00:31:18,720
you to give them exate so that they can

703
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,519
help that plant become the best cannabis

704
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:25,038
plet possibly can this is important

705
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:26,960
stuff and it's and it's goes one step

706
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:29,319
further and then I'll then I'll I'll

707
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,038
stop her a second to take a deep breath

708
00:31:29,319 --> 00:31:34,599
in there are chemicals not chemicals

709
00:31:32,038 --> 00:31:36,839
bacteria that people are now capable of

710
00:31:34,599 --> 00:31:40,959
buying uh and then some of the grow

711
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:42,879
stores are beginning to carry ASO ASO so

712
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,558
terrible the pronouncing means aop

713
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,639
spilium for example um there are a

714
00:31:45,558 --> 00:31:49,398
couple of billas that people are using

715
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:52,240
you know we already use cover crops it's

716
00:31:49,398 --> 00:31:54,000
kind of interesting uh um and the reason

717
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,558
we do that is because they they fix

718
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:59,159
nitrogen and put the nitrogen in the

719
00:31:55,558 --> 00:32:01,839
soil uh so so all of this type together

720
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:05,880
uh you know God bless Dr elen and God

721
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:09,038
bless uh uh you know uh Dr White because

722
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:11,519
they really they really are geniuses for

723
00:32:09,038 --> 00:32:13,960
for codifying all of this stuff none of

724
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:14,759
this stuff is stuff I invented all I do

725
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,679
is

726
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:19,679
reported

727
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,360
so that that's a lot I have a lot of

728
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,278
questions I don't know where to

729
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,199
start um the the first thing that comes

730
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,278
to mind for me and it's a little bit um

731
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,759
it goes back a little bit to what you

732
00:32:28,278 --> 00:32:34,119
were talking about earlier though is so

733
00:32:30,759 --> 00:32:36,480
inside of the plant we have all these

734
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:39,278
endophytes and like you mentioned it's a

735
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,360
right an endites and endos Symbian I

736
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:42,798
guess something that lives within the

737
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:44,479
plant that's beneficial they're both

738
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:48,000
they're both benefiting from the

739
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,000
relationship um and that could be a

740
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,759
bacteria it could be

741
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,679
fungi uh it could also be

742
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:58,919
archa um could be a virus virus virus

743
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:00,600
yeah micro ukar there's all these things

744
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:02,759
inside that are going

745
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:03,918
on you know we're not existing in a

746
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:06,839
vacuum is essentially what you're

747
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,679
getting at um right how much of what

748
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:11,439
you're talking about applies to ARA as

749
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,798
well as bacteria are you differentiating

750
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,558
between the two or do they just have

751
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:17,158
very similar functions um to where it's

752
00:33:15,558 --> 00:33:20,000
you know that's an excellent ex

753
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:21,919
excellent question I don't know uh and I

754
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:24,839
will try to find out I've never seen any

755
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:26,240
references to ARA in this regard but you

756
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:29,119
know how do you separate the two you

757
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,638
know it's I I don't know I don't know

758
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:33,678
it's a very interesting question it it

759
00:33:31,638 --> 00:33:35,158
seems to me that they clearly have a

760
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,798
cell wall even though it's a little

761
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:39,240
different than the cell wall of a

762
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,879
bacteria uh that would contain nutrients

763
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:44,759
that would be useful to the plant I'm

764
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,960
not I'm not I don't think they produce

765
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,599
nitrogen fixation I don't think they're

766
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,120
capable of nitrogen fixing they are part

767
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:57,199
of the process of nitrogen fixation uh

768
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,359
in in in in soils uh elsewhere so ask an

769
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,639
interesting question I'm going to have

770
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:03,319
to take a look at it and we'll have to

771
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:06,678
do a whole another show on it it might

772
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:09,319
be another book huh yeah God I get

773
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:10,838
another book you say that every time and

774
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,280
then you always end up getting excited

775
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:15,039
in writing another book so I feel like

776
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,599
it's only when there's something

777
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,320
something that comes forward that you

778
00:34:16,599 --> 00:34:21,320
know that adds to this thing that Dr

779
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:23,359
Lane infected us with you know I mean I

780
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,838
if you once you become a s of food Webby

781
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,559
you're stuck because you can't go back

782
00:34:25,838 --> 00:34:29,320
you know you can't deny the science that

783
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:31,039
the exists out there you can only

784
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:33,399
improve on it and that's what happens

785
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:37,199
and and so we become better and better

786
00:34:33,398 --> 00:34:40,598
at this it's really something really

787
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,519
something yeah I mean I I started I

788
00:34:40,599 --> 00:34:44,280
started with you and Dr Ingam in this

789
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:47,079
sort of this journey through meeting you

790
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,359
both through my father um as you know

791
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:54,200
decades ago and uh that's really where I

792
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,679
began and this this whole idea you know

793
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,199
these were your words like the the

794
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,599
plants putting out all these exudates

795
00:34:57,199 --> 00:35:00,879
the plant controls it you had a

796
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,559
wonderful uh graphic that went with it

797
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:04,920
and you'd have a picture of a bush and

798
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:07,559
you're like if the plant wants Japanese

799
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:09,400
food it would select you know for the

800
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,599
xat for that and then you picture some

801
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,320
Japanese people would show up in the

802
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:15,680
photo it it was very entertaining but it

803
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,240
really like drove that idea home and so

804
00:35:15,679 --> 00:35:19,159
it's like it's more what you're saying

805
00:35:17,239 --> 00:35:20,598
now is we still have that process going

806
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:23,000
on we still have that the nutrient

807
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:25,240
cycling that microbial Loop um

808
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,880
absolutely going on but on top of it we

809
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:31,118
also have these Endo fites the the the

810
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,960
fungi the bacteria the archa circling

811
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:36,200
inside the plant infecting into the

812
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,920
plant in in also a Sy symbiotic

813
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:41,199
way right yeah I mean I think the way I

814
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:43,159
I I look at it is that there's three

815
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:46,960
basic ways that a plant takes its

816
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:49,879
nutrient in via the soil food web system

817
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,720
uh and the the first way is this soil

818
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:54,599
mediated uh movement you know the stuff

819
00:35:52,719 --> 00:35:57,679
is dumped into the soil and it finds its

820
00:35:54,599 --> 00:36:00,920
way into the plant uh the second way is

821
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:03,199
the micro risal uh situation where the

822
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:05,720
micro risal fungi takes the nutrients

823
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:08,039
that are in the soil sometimes actually

824
00:36:05,719 --> 00:36:10,480
converts and then brings them into the

825
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:13,318
plant and then the Third Way is this

826
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,519
risasi cycle uh there may be fourth and

827
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:19,039
fifth and six ways I don't know uh but

828
00:36:15,519 --> 00:36:24,519
so far there are these three ways um

829
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:26,639
they are all based on the 2006 model

830
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:28,679
which is you've got this pool of

831
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:30,118
bacteria and fun that are attracted to

832
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:32,960
the plant by the

833
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,760
exudates and and so they they just they

834
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,920
they fit

835
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,280
um there could be other stuff I don't

836
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:41,440
know what they would what it would be

837
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,319
well there's also just straight osmosis

838
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,599
where the plant will just take in well

839
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:48,480
that's yeah and that's the plant that's

840
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,000
the plant mediated system yeah okay that

841
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,838
makes sense I mean the the soil mediated

842
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,519
system I'm sorry yeah yeah and I don't

843
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:56,039
even know if that's the right word I you

844
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,800
know you got to come up with these

845
00:36:56,039 --> 00:37:00,159
things

846
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,599
figure figure it all out it's it's it's

847
00:37:00,159 --> 00:37:04,799
such new stuff but but again this is

848
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:06,640
really important stuff for people to

849
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,039
understand it's and and it and it

850
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:11,679
doesn't it doesn't change the soil you

851
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:13,639
still don't Roto till you know now the

852
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:15,719
when I used to say the bacteria end up

853
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:17,879
you know uh that are in the root Zone

854
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:20,000
end up at the top or in the bottom and

855
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,000
you know they're all displaced well you

856
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,880
know that same thing whether they're

857
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,920
rise fzy bacteria or whether they're

858
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,280
just Riso sphere bacteria so you don't

859
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,280
Roto till

860
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:37,119
uh you know compost te might have a more

861
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:40,240
a more uh effable you know more uh

862
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:44,000
understandable reason for working uh in

863
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:48,559
some instances and perhaps not in others

864
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:50,800
um the addition of uh the right kind of

865
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:54,199
mulch in order to make sure that you're

866
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,000
fostering good bacteria uh is is still

867
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,838
in play so nothing nothing really

868
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,440
changed es in the soil food web other

869
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:05,000
than the

870
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,679
potential of a future where we can tweak

871
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,079
the soil food web in ways that we're not

872
00:38:07,679 --> 00:38:12,519
capable of doing now and certainly we're

873
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,599
not capable of doing in 2006 when we

874
00:38:12,519 --> 00:38:17,440
barely even I don't think in 2006 there

875
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:20,160
were commercial micro risal fungi now

876
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:22,559
there are uh you know that's that's a

877
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:25,598
heck of a

878
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:29,599
change yeah I mean I think we have a lot

879
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,920
still to learn um yeah oh God I think

880
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,480
there's so much we don't understand

881
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,280
about what's going on directly under our

882
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:40,318
feet in that plant soil plant microb

883
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,920
interaction uh is is I heard a a soil

884
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,279
scientist years ago mentioned that you

885
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,599
know he goes you knows we know more

886
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:49,000
about what's going on at the bottom of

887
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,519
the ocean and on the moon than we do you

888
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:53,480
know directly under our feet and yeah

889
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,838
inch under our feet it's just so it's so

890
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:58,119
complex um and that's so this is where I

891
00:38:56,838 --> 00:39:00,599
may

892
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:02,440
differ a little bit in this because sure

893
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:04,119
we we have we have some camps here

894
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:06,679
around you know soul food web and you

895
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,559
have people that believe that um it's

896
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:13,759
all about the microbes and so as long as

897
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:15,838
we're testing the microbes and um taking

898
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:19,000
care of the microbes we're not going to

899
00:39:15,838 --> 00:39:20,400
have to deal with disease or fertility

900
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:23,159
or any of those issues all of those

901
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,720
things are symptoms of microbial

902
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:27,799
problems um and that's kind of where I

903
00:39:25,719 --> 00:39:29,118
would put the Soul Food Web Camp now on

904
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,640
the other end you have sort of the

905
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,640
mineral guys the alre Solomon um yeah

906
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:36,679
yeah folks where they're like you know

907
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:38,318
let's focus on minerals get the minerals

908
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:42,199
balanced into a form that the plants are

909
00:39:38,318 --> 00:39:44,079
going to uh have optimal fertility and

910
00:39:42,199 --> 00:39:47,639
then all those microbes are just going

911
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:48,920
to show up um I'm kind of like right in

912
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:51,279
the middle there I don't I don't think

913
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,000
either of them totally

914
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:56,160
agree I want to add the minerals but

915
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,838
then you know all my behaviors are

916
00:39:56,159 --> 00:40:00,039
really towards

917
00:39:57,838 --> 00:40:02,239
taking care of these these microbes in

918
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:06,239
this process like you mentioned you know

919
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:09,000
limiting tilling um reusing soils where

920
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:11,078
we can adding organic matter in the form

921
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,239
of compost um all all of these things

922
00:40:11,079 --> 00:40:16,839
right right yeah well and I think I mean

923
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:18,799
Al makes tremendous sense and and

924
00:40:16,838 --> 00:40:22,279
obviously it's tied to the microbes I

925
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,880
mean because plants plants uh need those

926
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:26,480
microbes uh to grow and we know what

927
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,519
happens when you take the microbes for

928
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:31,800
example in the book I I discussed this

929
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:34,318
uh and Dr White's shown this a number of

930
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,920
times if you don't have the bacteria you

931
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:40,880
don't get root hairs whoa and The Roots

932
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:43,720
don't grow properly whoa and then if you

933
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,240
put the if you having taken the bacteria

934
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:49,879
out if you put the bacteria back you

935
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:52,199
grow you grow hairs oh you know that's

936
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:55,838
pretty interesting but what is a mineral

937
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:58,118
you know a minerals are micro food sure

938
00:40:55,838 --> 00:41:00,279
uh in the in in the right sitation now

939
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:01,920
you know when Al BR breaks down is when

940
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,839
people don't do it properly and the

941
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:06,880
ratios aren't proper you know that's

942
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:10,159
sort of like applying too much chemical

943
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,480
fertilizer uh it it it it it screws up

944
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:15,399
the system the microbes can't operate

945
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:17,400
it's not that they aren't any microbes

946
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,800
the microbes that like the fertilizer

947
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,639
are not necessarily the microbes that

948
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:25,079
like you the plant likes and so you know

949
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:27,318
I'm with you I'm right in the middle I'm

950
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:28,720
right in the middle I think I think I I

951
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:30,559
there was a big fight at one point in

952
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:33,399
time because people were yelling at Dr

953
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,880
elain Ingam because she apparently or

954
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,760
supposedly and I'm not trying to put

955
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:38,440
words in her mouth said that if you've

956
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:40,520
got a good soil food web system you

957
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,720
don't need to add any

958
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:46,440
nutrients well is sense that I think the

959
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:49,879
quote was that all soils contain

960
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:51,760
adequate minerals for growing healthy

961
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:54,440
plants or it was something along those

962
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,760
lines yeah

963
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,960
yeah yeah I'm not sure I'm not sure

964
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,720
whether I

965
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,639
I can I'm not sure I can fully

966
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:06,159
comprehend that if that's the right way

967
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:10,078
to put it but there's no question that

968
00:42:06,159 --> 00:42:12,759
if you use uh uh things that replace

969
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:17,560
these bacteria the what they call the

970
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:20,240
nitrogen efficiency ratio goes down uh

971
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:23,519
so so the natural system seems to be the

972
00:42:20,239 --> 00:42:25,519
most efficient system uh are minerals

973
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,159
part of the natural system yes whether

974
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:30,199
whether you go with that quote or don't

975
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:32,039
the minerals that are in the soil are

976
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:35,519
helpful and if you don't have those

977
00:42:32,039 --> 00:42:37,679
minerals it doesn't hurt to put them in

978
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:41,280
just makes sense to me but that doesn't

979
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:42,318
mean you you don't need the microbes

980
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:46,559
because you

981
00:42:42,318 --> 00:42:49,639
do absolutely I um I I just wanted to

982
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,400
say like we know that bio stimulants and

983
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:55,719
that's just sort of the industry term

984
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,200
that I hear for yeah adding microbes um

985
00:42:55,719 --> 00:42:58,358
right so any of these any of these

986
00:42:57,199 --> 00:43:00,960
products that you mentioned that have

987
00:42:58,358 --> 00:43:03,159
billus or AOS spum all of these things

988
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:05,800
micro isal funga these all be called bio

989
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:09,519
stimulants um yes is is one of the

990
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:12,599
fastest growing areas of sales and

991
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:14,119
research in agriculture not not even

992
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:16,280
just specifically canabas just

993
00:43:14,119 --> 00:43:18,480
agriculture which is huge like how we

994
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,920
grow our food that's what right that's

995
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,318
why I say the big I call them the big

996
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:22,800
evil chemical companies you know they're

997
00:43:21,318 --> 00:43:25,599
all studying this stuff this is going to

998
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,039
be this stuff replaces chemicals uh

999
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:29,480
because it's natural works and you don't

1000
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,358
have to continue to apply you know I

1001
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,358
mean it's it's it's phenomenal and we'll

1002
00:43:32,358 --> 00:43:38,639
get there because it just makes so much

1003
00:43:34,358 --> 00:43:41,159
sense we we forget no we don't forget

1004
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:43,000
but a lot of people don't understand

1005
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:45,759
that in order to grow the food the way

1006
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,519
we grow it now with combines and

1007
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:51,280
chemicals etc etc we're destroying our

1008
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:54,559
soil system to the point where where

1009
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,760
it's the experts say we got 61 I don't

1010
00:43:54,559 --> 00:44:02,319
know why they don't say 60 but 61 years

1011
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,800
of of harvesting left of soil whoa

1012
00:44:02,318 --> 00:44:06,838
really uh well that's because we're not

1013
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,119
using bacteria that give the soil

1014
00:44:06,838 --> 00:44:11,920
structure and fungi that tie those

1015
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,000
little aggregate of slime stuck together

1016
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,240
particles together etc etc etc so yeah

1017
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,280
everybody's moving this way and it's and

1018
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:21,759
it's a good thing I

1019
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:24,680
think yeah so one of the things that we

1020
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,200
see is by the by adding you know

1021
00:44:24,679 --> 00:44:31,159
specific bacteria even with so much that

1022
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:34,159
we we don't know for example um we see

1023
00:44:31,159 --> 00:44:36,759
increased growth or disease resistance

1024
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:38,159
or whatever the is associated with and

1025
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:41,359
and some of these things are symbiotic

1026
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:44,399
it's not even uh the sum of the parts

1027
00:44:41,358 --> 00:44:47,279
equal equal themselves um sometimes no

1028
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,079
there's a lot of 3 plus 3 equal 9 we're

1029
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,519
finding with the way these microbes work

1030
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:53,119
together

1031
00:44:50,519 --> 00:44:57,358
um all that being

1032
00:44:53,119 --> 00:45:00,920
said are are all of these microbes

1033
00:44:57,358 --> 00:45:03,480
in the in most soils or media like would

1034
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:06,519
compost contain all of these for the

1035
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:08,679
most part yeah this is an interesting

1036
00:45:06,519 --> 00:45:10,920
yeah very interesting question great

1037
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:12,239
question because you you know there you

1038
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:16,240
see these studies that say there are

1039
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:18,719
about 650 kinds of bacteria that are in

1040
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:21,000
all soils around the world etc etc

1041
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:25,799
course that's a teen te he te little

1042
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:28,838
number um uh the the uh

1043
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:31,160
bacteria uh

1044
00:45:28,838 --> 00:45:34,199
I don't know how to put

1045
00:45:31,159 --> 00:45:36,558
this ask the question again so I can

1046
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:37,799
kind of so essentially what what I'm

1047
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:40,319
getting at

1048
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,720
is because I I'd heard a statistic that

1049
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:45,838
like

1050
00:45:41,719 --> 00:45:49,279
99.98% of the of world soil

1051
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:50,960
contain the same bacteria more or less

1052
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:54,559
like they're they're pretty much

1053
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,480
everywhere now yeah if that's the case

1054
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:59,040
why is it so we're essentially just

1055
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,679
giving a booster shot when we add these

1056
00:45:59,039 --> 00:46:04,880
nutrients to give that particular uh

1057
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:06,838
strain or species a a jump start or or

1058
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:09,000
an advantage over other bacteria in the

1059
00:46:06,838 --> 00:46:11,838
C that may be innocuous or

1060
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:14,920
disease-causing or less beneficial is

1061
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:17,239
that the way to approach it if yeah if

1062
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,240
you if you believe that all soils have

1063
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:22,078
the same bacteria I'm not sure I believe

1064
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:26,199
that because because it's obvious to me

1065
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,559
that there are there are bacteria that

1066
00:46:26,199 --> 00:46:30,759
we you know in the experimentation and

1067
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,079
in some of these studies they're putting

1068
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:35,520
specialized bacteria into different

1069
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:38,960
kinds of plants why do they have to do

1070
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:41,440
that I mean isn't it in the soil

1071
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:43,280
already see where I'm coming from I mean

1072
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,679
they're they're putting in they're

1073
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:49,359
looking not not all bacteria will do the

1074
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:51,759
same thing in each in every plant it's

1075
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:54,279
not quite the same as micro fungi which

1076
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,000
for lack of a better term tend to sleep

1077
00:46:54,280 --> 00:47:00,319
around one one you know we only can make

1078
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,280
about 8 to 12 micral fungi out of how

1079
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:05,480
many 350 that there

1080
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:07,240
are but they but they're able to infect

1081
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:09,838
lots of different kinds of plants one

1082
00:47:07,239 --> 00:47:12,358
fungi can affect many different kinds of

1083
00:47:09,838 --> 00:47:14,599
plants not necessarily so with the

1084
00:47:12,358 --> 00:47:17,039
bacteria uh that you've got to have the

1085
00:47:14,599 --> 00:47:18,440
right bacteria so what what might help a

1086
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:20,318
strawberry plant grow better

1087
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,920
strawberries a

1088
00:47:20,318 --> 00:47:27,279
bacteria might not do the same thing for

1089
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:29,760
a wheat plant or a apple tree and so

1090
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:31,640
you've got to find the right bacteria uh

1091
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:34,640
and it's probably more than one

1092
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:37,480
obviously uh to to feed the the plant

1093
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:39,838
and so that tends that tends to point to

1094
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:41,358
me that there are different bacteria

1095
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,599
around the world or in different kinds

1096
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,558
of soils and then I think again about

1097
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,880
about what I my understanding of how Dr

1098
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:50,319
elen Ingam sort of Came Upon a lot of

1099
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:52,559
this stuff you know she collected soils

1100
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,679
from plants that did Fabulous around the

1101
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:58,400
world so if you had a banana plant that

1102
00:47:54,679 --> 00:48:00,239
did Fabulous this soil from The Fabulous

1103
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:02,800
this is the ideal kind of soil you want

1104
00:48:00,239 --> 00:48:04,279
to have for a banana plant well not all

1105
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,240
banana plants grow the same around the

1106
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,599
world do they I mean so so I don't I

1107
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,598
don't know whether I beli that

1108
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:13,720
original uh statement I guess that's my

1109
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,000
problem that's fair I you know I read it

1110
00:48:13,719 --> 00:48:19,519
a long time ago it could be a

1111
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:21,639
now no it's it's it's wor it's worth

1112
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,639
looking into because I hear it all the

1113
00:48:21,639 --> 00:48:25,159
time uh and I just haven't I just

1114
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:27,480
haven't done so and I think it it just

1115
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:30,159
makes sense to do so

1116
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:33,599
I I almost look at it like we're we're

1117
00:48:30,159 --> 00:48:35,879
replacing or adding in sort of like the

1118
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:39,480
pro-athletes of the microbial world when

1119
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,920
we add these basilla species um and they

1120
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,920
may be

1121
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,920
out well I think we have to be to a

1122
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:49,519
certain extent because we can we can do

1123
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:53,318
research that shows when we when we work

1124
00:48:49,519 --> 00:48:56,199
in you know sterile media and then you

1125
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:57,239
add in these specific strains of

1126
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:59,639
bacteria

1127
00:48:57,239 --> 00:49:01,838
we get this level of increased plant

1128
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,519
growth that we would may not see in a

1129
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:06,679
control which could just be you know e

1130
00:49:04,519 --> 00:49:09,920
either a stero environment or yeah you

1131
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:11,199
know a variety of different soils right

1132
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:13,480
right which certainly which certainly

1133
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:16,439
goes against again the original Sav that

1134
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,798
you know the 99% they're all the same

1135
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,519
you know that doesn't make any sense to

1136
00:49:17,798 --> 00:49:21,318
me unless we're talking about

1137
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,599
concentrations I mean for example the

1138
00:49:21,318 --> 00:49:26,440
Alaska humus that we used to sell I mean

1139
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:27,760
you know that that stuff was loaded with

1140
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:30,318
things

1141
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:32,359
uh but you know of course it also had

1142
00:49:30,318 --> 00:49:36,079
different minerals too and and and

1143
00:49:32,358 --> 00:49:37,719
frankly I tend to be a more interested

1144
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,680
in the soil food web side than the

1145
00:49:37,719 --> 00:49:41,838
mineral side I probably should spend a

1146
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:45,440
lot more time you know I am familiar

1147
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:47,519
with alrick and uh but but you know we

1148
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,960
we tend to be more soil food web and

1149
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,440
might have a lot to do with a noodle

1150
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:53,039
that supports a soil food web I don't

1151
00:49:50,440 --> 00:49:55,400
know but I do know that individual

1152
00:49:53,039 --> 00:49:58,920
bacteria are required for individual

1153
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,798
plants they don't know work on the same

1154
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:04,318
one this is why I kind of feel though

1155
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:06,759
like they must be everywhere because we

1156
00:50:04,318 --> 00:50:08,318
can get plants in a variety of different

1157
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,200
conditions in a variety of different

1158
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:14,358
soil or soilless media and still have a

1159
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:16,558
thriving plant um without trying to

1160
00:50:14,358 --> 00:50:18,000
select for a particular bacteria so I I

1161
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:21,079
think it's more about like like I think

1162
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,559
of viral load like a bacterial load in

1163
00:50:21,079 --> 00:50:26,200
the same S I go I go back to that 650

1164
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,319
you know I think there's probably a base

1165
00:50:26,199 --> 00:50:30,598
that all plants have you know that all

1166
00:50:28,318 --> 00:50:34,079
soils have and then the other stuff is

1167
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:37,000
extra or different uh you know just give

1168
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,079
a little bit of diversity has to be it

1169
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:41,838
has to be and just I just want to throw

1170
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,359
this out there so people will get the

1171
00:50:41,838 --> 00:50:47,239
wrong idea I'm not a I'm not a huge

1172
00:50:43,358 --> 00:50:50,039
alreck guy um yeah I think I think he

1173
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:53,399
his his stuff is really interesting but

1174
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:55,039
I um I'm not a fast and true on the

1175
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:56,318
mineral bound side either so I don't I

1176
00:50:55,039 --> 00:50:57,838
don't want people to walk away from this

1177
00:50:56,318 --> 00:51:00,000
thinking it would have been interesting

1178
00:50:57,838 --> 00:51:02,558
had he had he had some of these

1179
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:04,880
microscopes that that elain had and that

1180
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,640
Dr White had you know it's be

1181
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:09,760
interesting to see I I found a guy

1182
00:51:07,639 --> 00:51:12,159
incidentally around the corner for from

1183
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,760
where I stay when I'm in Portland who

1184
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:18,480
has the only storefront electrical

1185
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:20,680
microscope you can go in and get things

1186
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:24,480
done right there off the street holy

1187
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:26,199
crow and I think he has a conop focal uh

1188
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,199
uh microscope as well so maybe we can

1189
00:51:26,199 --> 00:51:31,598
see some these rasic bacteria that' be

1190
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,439
fun I'd come meet you in Portland to

1191
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,280
Tool around wouldn't that be incredible

1192
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:39,200
yeah yeah let's arrange that that would

1193
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,720
be phenomenal absolutely phenomenal well

1194
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:45,039
again this book is uh you know I think

1195
00:51:41,719 --> 00:51:47,719
people need to understand that it it it

1196
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:51,679
changes the picture of the soil food web

1197
00:51:47,719 --> 00:51:55,358
uh but it is not in any way to degrade

1198
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:58,159
you know our our our pre- Riso fasy

1199
00:51:55,358 --> 00:52:01,199
cycle understanding so food web it just

1200
00:51:58,159 --> 00:52:04,639
adds to it uh I don't see any detraction

1201
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:07,000
from it uh in fact as as I as I was

1202
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:09,078
doing the research I mean all the stuff

1203
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:11,440
I call them cedap fores I never know how

1204
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:14,920
to pronounce the word uh these these

1205
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,318
wonderful uh bacteria that are able to

1206
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,680
go to to put put out into the soil the

1207
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:22,639
ability to Cate different metals and

1208
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,919
either bring them into the plant or or

1209
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:27,318
tie them up so that they can't get into

1210
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:30,119
the plant and poison the plant uh the

1211
00:52:27,318 --> 00:52:36,199
the ability of some of these bacteria uh

1212
00:52:30,119 --> 00:52:38,960
to work with uh uh fungi and and and and

1213
00:52:36,199 --> 00:52:41,519
change nitrogen into a usable form and

1214
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:44,039
oh my goodness gracious and then just

1215
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:47,280
the bacteria themselves I'll never

1216
00:52:44,039 --> 00:52:49,759
believe the 5-second r

1217
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,720
again I mean that's that's been proven

1218
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,440
wrong unfortunately I wish it was a

1219
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:57,078
thing yeah I know and the pictures of

1220
00:52:54,440 --> 00:53:00,079
them they are the most in incredibly

1221
00:52:57,079 --> 00:53:02,359
beautiful organisms and and because of

1222
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:05,440
the of the ability now to use these

1223
00:53:02,358 --> 00:53:07,719
various microscopy photography you know

1224
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:10,079
systems holy C so when you look at a

1225
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:12,838
fella under you know some of these

1226
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:15,240
microscopic pictures I mean you would

1227
00:53:12,838 --> 00:53:17,599
swear you're looking at a you know the

1228
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:19,519
internal parts of an outboard motor it's

1229
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,119
not you know you see the diagrams of

1230
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:25,480
them and oh wow that's really cool when

1231
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:26,920
you see it and working or when you ah

1232
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:29,440
some of this stuff is just inredible

1233
00:53:26,920 --> 00:53:32,200
there's a in the back of the book in the

1234
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:34,200
appendix I I list a website which most

1235
00:53:32,199 --> 00:53:35,919
books never do and I had to really

1236
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:40,439
sortly get the publisher to allow me to

1237
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:43,639
do it that that shows this root hair

1238
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:46,960
growth uh and the root hair oscillating

1239
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:49,279
and you can almost see the new molecules

1240
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,920
being put into the wall the root hair as

1241
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,119
it grows I mean it's just the the stuff

1242
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,079
that's out there you can see individual

1243
00:53:54,119 --> 00:54:01,160
at DNA uh oh my God this stuff out there

1244
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:03,160
so yeah we live in a terrific world it's

1245
00:54:01,159 --> 00:54:06,279
completely different than it was and I

1246
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:09,358
can only imagine uh you know what's

1247
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:11,839
coming up next only

1248
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,039
imagine well you had mentioned now that

1249
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:17,558
you have a new order that you would

1250
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,759
suggest that folks read read your series

1251
00:54:17,559 --> 00:54:22,359
um why don't you can you touch on what

1252
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:24,119
each book is just give a brief synopsis

1253
00:54:22,358 --> 00:54:26,440
and then also in the order that you

1254
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:28,680
would suggest reader new readers might

1255
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:30,358
tackle them right right yeah well I

1256
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:32,199
would obviously start with soil not

1257
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:36,039
obviously I would start with soil uh uh

1258
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:39,399
teaming with microbes uh uh it explains

1259
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:42,000
the soil food web it gives soil food web

1260
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:44,680
rules uh but it doesn't include the rise

1261
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:47,838
ofas cycle and it doesn't

1262
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:50,239
include more than a paragraph on uh

1263
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:52,119
fungi so the next book I would read

1264
00:54:50,239 --> 00:54:55,159
would be teeming with bacteria this one

1265
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:58,640
that I just wrote uh and it describes

1266
00:54:55,159 --> 00:55:01,639
the riseof fasis cycle and it describes

1267
00:54:58,639 --> 00:55:04,759
the role of endophytic bacteria the pho

1268
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:08,199
hormones uh what they do to plants uh

1269
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:10,480
and and uh doesn't have rules but it

1270
00:55:08,199 --> 00:55:13,000
does point out some bacteria that work

1271
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:17,559
better with different plants uh and then

1272
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:21,480
of course there's uh teaming with fungi

1273
00:55:17,559 --> 00:55:24,440
which is about the micral fungi uh and

1274
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:26,599
how they operate and then I would read

1275
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,519
the last one teaming with nutrients

1276
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:33,280
which explains uh how these nutrients

1277
00:55:29,519 --> 00:55:35,679
get through the plant membrane and what

1278
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:37,680
happens to them once they're inside the

1279
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:42,078
plant and so those are those are the

1280
00:55:37,679 --> 00:55:44,440
four books um they're all available on

1281
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:46,720
Amazon uh I think Timber's thinking

1282
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:50,519
about putting a a set together I hope

1283
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:53,399
they are um and I always tell people

1284
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:56,400
again this is not stuff I invented I

1285
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:58,880
didn't write it I'm not the genius don't

1286
00:55:56,400 --> 00:56:01,720
give me the credit this is stuff that Dr

1287
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,559
Elaine Ingam Dr James White and other

1288
00:56:01,719 --> 00:56:06,038
really terrific scientists have put

1289
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:08,400
together all I do is try to dumb it down

1290
00:56:06,039 --> 00:56:11,240
so that I can understand it and it turns

1291
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,200
out that some of you are a little bit

1292
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:17,358
more intelligent to me so my dumb down

1293
00:56:13,199 --> 00:56:17,358
version works well for you

1294
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:22,920
H and again there's the there's

1295
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:25,159
different things in each book about you

1296
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:28,280
know that that you want to experiment

1297
00:56:25,159 --> 00:56:30,719
and try and to find the right answer for

1298
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:33,200
so so for example you asked me about

1299
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:36,598
compost the difference between the

1300
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:39,598
bacteria that are in vermac compost is

1301
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,680
quite Sim is quite different than

1302
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:45,720
thermal compost and so we need to be

1303
00:56:42,679 --> 00:56:47,879
doing experiments on cannabis plants

1304
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:51,000
since this is a cannabis show which

1305
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:53,880
one's better which bacteria or is it a

1306
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:56,480
mix of the two because you want to get

1307
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:58,720
the right bacteria for your plant so

1308
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,119
there's a great research project it's I

1309
00:56:58,719 --> 00:57:02,118
feel like it's way too complicated

1310
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:05,000
because when you mentioned just vermac

1311
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:07,119
compost my immediate thought is how long

1312
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:09,719
did the worms process the material what

1313
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:12,160
species of worms did you use um what

1314
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:14,519
were the temperatures at what was the

1315
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:17,000
worm like it could go on and

1316
00:57:14,519 --> 00:57:18,920
on it could go on and on but but but

1317
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,519
when it ends up at the you know when

1318
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,960
it's going through the worm five times

1319
00:57:21,519 --> 00:57:26,880
generally it has one set of bacteria in

1320
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:28,798
it no matter what you start with uh and

1321
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,519
and same thing with compost not same

1322
00:57:28,798 --> 00:57:32,119
thing but I mean the compost the base

1323
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:35,679
again we I guess we ought to always go

1324
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:37,720
back to the the base is the same uh for

1325
00:57:35,679 --> 00:57:40,879
vermac compost but different than the

1326
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:43,159
base for regular thermal

1327
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:46,318
compost yeah and I'd say the variability

1328
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:48,759
we see in com in compost commercially is

1329
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:52,558
well most of it's not even compost but

1330
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:54,799
um much higher than ver compost so oh

1331
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:58,160
yeah but but again it's very different

1332
00:57:54,798 --> 00:58:00,199
families of bacteria very different uh

1333
00:57:58,159 --> 00:58:01,598
and and so as a result you get different

1334
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:04,439
and that you know that's an interesting

1335
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:06,599
thing that I had trouble with I you know

1336
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,960
we don't study bacteria we study

1337
00:58:06,599 --> 00:58:10,760
dinosaurs and so if I was to write a

1338
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,400
book on dinosaurs I could put in

1339
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,319
scientific names for a lot of different

1340
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:16,599
dinosaurs and because a lot of the

1341
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:18,838
readers have been learning about

1342
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:21,559
dinosaurs from the time they were teing

1343
00:58:18,838 --> 00:58:24,679
with their plush toys you know all the

1344
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:26,480
way through you know Elementary School

1345
00:58:24,679 --> 00:58:30,239
uh they know dinosaurs but we don't no

1346
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:33,559
bacteria and the names are not easy you

1347
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:35,558
know we don't have a a you know a common

1348
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:38,160
name for every bacteria we have it for

1349
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:41,039
some but not for everyone and so you

1350
00:58:38,159 --> 00:58:44,038
know people shouldn't freak out by the

1351
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,839
fact that I list the names uh you don't

1352
00:58:44,039 --> 00:58:47,799
even have to pronounce them or try to

1353
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:50,078
pronounce them by the end of the book

1354
00:58:47,798 --> 00:58:52,559
you'll know some of them but I wanted

1355
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:56,359
there to be a you know a place where

1356
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:59,920
they were listed because we already have

1357
00:58:56,358 --> 00:59:03,679
the database of bacteria what we don't

1358
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:06,000
have is a home instrument that tells us

1359
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:08,598
what the RNA or DNA is for that

1360
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:10,639
particular bacteria that we can match

1361
00:59:08,599 --> 00:59:13,920
with that database to tell us what that

1362
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:15,519
bacteria is but we're getting there and

1363
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:17,440
I think in the next five or 10 years

1364
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:20,559
we're going to have that we're going to

1365
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,960
be able to point the phone at a water

1366
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:25,480
down sample of soil and it's going to

1367
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:28,880
tell us all of the bacteria that are in

1368
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,960
that soil I think it's coming uh it's

1369
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,358
you know I know we've got the

1370
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:35,838
microbiometer where we can where we can

1371
00:59:32,358 --> 00:59:37,480
tell biomass changes uh using our cell

1372
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:40,078
phone it just makes so much sense for

1373
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:42,400
this to happen as well uh and and you

1374
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:45,280
can see a need for it in a in a in a

1375
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,838
really important way so it's

1376
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:50,119
coming that I would be excited for where

1377
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,719
we get a little more differentiation I I

1378
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,640
I could see that being a very useful

1379
00:59:51,719 --> 00:59:56,759
tool um yeah well I'm you know I'm not

1380
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:58,639
we we already have it we could tell Gram

1381
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:01,079
positive and gram

1382
00:59:58,639 --> 01:00:02,480
negative but we don't you know as

1383
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:05,280
gardeners we don't understand what the

1384
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:07,039
difference is uh but again all of these

1385
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,720
things are going to become clear and

1386
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:12,240
important as more and more people study

1387
01:00:09,719 --> 01:00:14,838
this stuff and you know as it becomes

1388
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:18,679
clear that using chemicals is creating a

1389
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:20,838
you know a bad thing for the global

1390
01:00:18,679 --> 01:00:24,639
warming and you know I mean there just

1391
01:00:20,838 --> 01:00:27,838
so many reasons for studying this stuff

1392
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,400
uh you know just were there and they and

1393
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:33,078
they weren't they were there but we

1394
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:33,079
didn't realize they were there back in

1395
01:00:33,318 --> 01:00:38,400
2006 yeah and I you know I just want to

1396
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:41,200
mention as I'm looking through your your

1397
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,200
book here um there's a lot more in there

1398
01:00:41,199 --> 01:00:45,798
in regards to bacteria than just the RIS

1399
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:48,118
of fgy cycle like you talk about how do

1400
01:00:45,798 --> 01:00:50,679
bacteria communicate how do they move

1401
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:53,480
how you know how do they eat and so you

1402
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:56,879
get to learn some of those things as

1403
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:58,440
well um how fast they reproduce

1404
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:00,440
right I do the same thing with the fungi

1405
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:02,440
book you know because you've gota you've

1406
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,358
got to understand what a fungi is or

1407
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:06,440
what a bacteria is before you can

1408
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:10,078
understand what a Risa or an endophilic

1409
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:13,838
bacteria is and and and what I try to do

1410
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:16,680
is give just the the amount of stuff you

1411
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:17,960
need to put the story together at the

1412
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:21,000
right you know it should have it should

1413
01:01:17,960 --> 01:01:24,960
have been section one bacteria section

1414
01:01:21,000 --> 01:01:26,838
two okay ropy endites now that you know

1415
01:01:24,960 --> 01:01:28,159
bacteria is what it is because because

1416
01:01:26,838 --> 01:01:30,960
that's what it is but you have to know a

1417
01:01:28,159 --> 01:01:33,000
little chemistry here as well uh you

1418
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:34,960
know how do bacteria talk to themselves

1419
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:37,798
how do they you know it's just that they

1420
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:40,400
are fascinating creatures and we need to

1421
01:01:37,798 --> 01:01:43,159
stop studying dinosaurus we need to

1422
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:46,119
start studying microbes and I say it all

1423
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:48,038
the time I ought to start a foundation I

1424
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,920
you know I ought to have a a group

1425
01:01:48,039 --> 01:01:52,440
that's anti-

1426
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:54,200
dinosaur uh you know so that we stop

1427
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:55,960
wasting our time on something that's

1428
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:59,759
useless and get into something that's

1429
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:01,679
useful well they do have uh micro plush

1430
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:02,960
stuff animals I don't know if you've

1431
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:05,399
seen those yeah they do they're

1432
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:07,599
beginning to get them but but but

1433
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:09,559
they're not they're beginning to get a

1434
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:12,400
couple of books too there's a couple of

1435
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:14,680
even soil food web books uh so so we're

1436
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,519
getting there uh but we're not quite

1437
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:18,719
there yet it's not it's not taught I

1438
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:21,239
don't think in schools the way

1439
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:24,358
dinosaurs now one thing I want to touch

1440
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:26,798
on because you you bring up these

1441
01:02:24,358 --> 01:02:28,400
commercial applications and commercially

1442
01:02:26,798 --> 01:02:30,719
available products and I think people

1443
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:35,400
get excited for that as rightly they

1444
01:02:30,719 --> 01:02:37,358
should um i' I've seen research showing

1445
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:39,039
the viability of some of these product

1446
01:02:37,358 --> 01:02:40,838
there's the regulation I would say on

1447
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:42,599
these sorts of things is all over the

1448
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:44,558
map so it's not very well regulated

1449
01:02:42,599 --> 01:02:46,680
because it's a new industry so you could

1450
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:49,160
be buying something that's not what the

1451
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:52,399
label says and I I unfortunately see

1452
01:02:49,159 --> 01:02:54,679
this all the time um yeah that's right

1453
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:57,599
so I just want to warn folks on the on

1454
01:02:54,679 --> 01:02:59,239
the flip side of that though I I see

1455
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:02,440
cannabis Growers especially experiment

1456
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:04,558
with nutrients all the time um right and

1457
01:03:02,440 --> 01:03:06,159
I don't know why we don't consider doing

1458
01:03:04,559 --> 01:03:08,839
the same with microbes you know set up

1459
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:11,558
an experiment in your environment with a

1460
01:03:08,838 --> 01:03:14,920
control and see how your plants respond

1461
01:03:11,559 --> 01:03:17,278
to adding one thing in this case a

1462
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:20,119
particular microb inoc microbial

1463
01:03:17,278 --> 01:03:21,798
inoculant and I I think that's a good

1464
01:03:20,119 --> 01:03:23,599
way to approach it because there is so

1465
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:26,079
much we don't know and there are so many

1466
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:28,318
interactions going on um I think we

1467
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,079
really have to look at it in a case-by

1468
01:03:28,318 --> 01:03:31,599
case

1469
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:33,760
basis oh absolutely I mean I think there

1470
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:35,640
there's a base that you that you want

1471
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:37,799
you know I tell my clients there a base

1472
01:03:35,639 --> 01:03:40,920
for living soil you want to have a good

1473
01:03:37,798 --> 01:03:42,838
living soil uh but then then you want to

1474
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:44,240
tweak it and and this is one of the ways

1475
01:03:42,838 --> 01:03:46,880
you can do it there you know and there

1476
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:49,239
are some products that we know are

1477
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,960
inherently unreliable I don't mean

1478
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:52,358
they're bad they're just unreliable and

1479
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,880
you've got to experiment yourself to

1480
01:03:52,358 --> 01:03:55,480
make sure you get the right one I mean

1481
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,358
you know micro risal fungi is one of

1482
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:58,480
them

1483
01:03:56,358 --> 01:04:00,798
uh some some of them don't work some of

1484
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,079
them do work you gota you gotta figure

1485
01:04:00,798 --> 01:04:03,559
it out you got to figure out how to

1486
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:06,318
store them and how to take care of them

1487
01:04:03,559 --> 01:04:08,720
etc etc uh it gets it gets a little bit

1488
01:04:06,318 --> 01:04:11,239
more difficult with bacteria because

1489
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:15,078
there's one kind basilis they they form

1490
01:04:11,239 --> 01:04:17,838
a you know a a a dormant state that you

1491
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:20,760
you can has a long shelf life but most

1492
01:04:17,838 --> 01:04:23,159
bacteria don't and so how do you how do

1493
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:25,039
you know whether you're buying alive

1494
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:26,480
it's you know so you've got to be very

1495
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:29,960
very careful

1496
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,880
uh and and you got to make sure that

1497
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:34,000
you're experimenting yourself you can't

1498
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:37,039
take someone else's word for it unless

1499
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,920
you're awfully good friends with that

1500
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:42,200
person yeah I I've unfortunately tried a

1501
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:44,960
lot of these sorts of pro products over

1502
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:46,519
the years right right um not seeing

1503
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,920
quite the results I want but others I've

1504
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:50,480
seen amazing results so well that's

1505
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:53,639
right and then and that's why I like

1506
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:56,559
that microbiome I know coming back to it

1507
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:58,480
is because it you you can C yourself you

1508
01:04:56,559 --> 01:05:01,119
can see whether it's working are you

1509
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:03,119
increasing your biomass in your soil you

1510
01:05:01,119 --> 01:05:05,920
know that's almost as good as does the

1511
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,400
plant look better you know you want to

1512
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,358
know you take a before you take a couple

1513
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:15,559
Afters or during and you and you track

1514
01:05:12,358 --> 01:05:15,558
you know information's

1515
01:05:15,798 --> 01:05:19,880
power yeah I I I struggle with that one

1516
01:05:18,519 --> 01:05:21,639
a little bit just because I would think

1517
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:23,440
if you had a plant disease it would

1518
01:05:21,639 --> 01:05:26,159
increase your biomass as well and that's

1519
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:28,200
where I'd love to know like IND but you

1520
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:29,798
would know that you you I mean yeah I

1521
01:05:28,199 --> 01:05:31,719
mean I I I've been asked that before

1522
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:34,318
yeah but you would know that you would

1523
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:37,278
see the plant being sick but but you

1524
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:39,318
know if you add uh I don't I I won't

1525
01:05:37,278 --> 01:05:42,039
mention a product but if you add a

1526
01:05:39,318 --> 01:05:44,038
well-known uh product that contains

1527
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:47,760
phosphorus uh and

1528
01:05:44,039 --> 01:05:49,839
bacteria uh you can take a test and know

1529
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:51,119
whether it's working or not you know

1530
01:05:49,838 --> 01:05:52,400
obviously if your plant's sick it

1531
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:55,278
doesn't you can take all the test you

1532
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,200
want it's still sick plant but so I I I

1533
01:05:55,278 --> 01:05:58,719
mean I don't don't buy that argument

1534
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:00,118
that's fair I it's an interesting angle

1535
01:05:58,719 --> 01:06:03,399
on I hadn't really approached it from

1536
01:06:00,119 --> 01:06:05,559
because for me um testing

1537
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:09,559
biology is you know whether that's

1538
01:06:05,559 --> 01:06:10,359
sending it into a lab or um you know the

1539
01:06:09,559 --> 01:06:12,720
the

1540
01:06:10,358 --> 01:06:14,038
biometer I I'm I guess I'm a little less

1541
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:16,000
interested in it than getting a mineral

1542
01:06:14,039 --> 01:06:19,039
test because a mineral test allows me to

1543
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:21,679
make like quantifiable decisions

1544
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,920
actionable decisions about my garden

1545
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:25,639
whereas I feel like on the microb side

1546
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:28,039
I'm going to do all those things already

1547
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:31,759
CU like you I'm I'm an organic guy I

1548
01:06:28,039 --> 01:06:34,359
want to take care of my soil um yeah I

1549
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:35,920
know it's a little minor point of

1550
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:38,239
difference that we've we've had for a

1551
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,760
while we' talked about this before but

1552
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:43,598
um yeah yeah but but but but but it but

1553
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,640
you know if people say to me does this

1554
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:48,000
product team with microbes I can tell

1555
01:06:45,639 --> 01:06:50,000
them I couldn't do it before I had the

1556
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,838
ability to measure and I think you know

1557
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,239
you want that mineral test as well

1558
01:06:51,838 --> 01:06:55,199
obviously you got to have it but you

1559
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:56,159
don't need to take that mineral test

1560
01:06:55,199 --> 01:06:58,879
every

1561
01:06:56,159 --> 01:07:00,159
three weeks you can take a biometer test

1562
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,519
every three you know what I mean I mean

1563
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:04,519
so it's it's all information you want

1564
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:06,639
all the information you can possibly get

1565
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,278
and if you want you want to know the pH

1566
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:10,639
which is why it's been added to the you

1567
01:07:08,278 --> 01:07:12,039
know you want to know fungal bacterial

1568
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:14,118
you know there's lots of things you want

1569
01:07:12,039 --> 01:07:16,520
to know and so you you try to find it

1570
01:07:14,119 --> 01:07:21,160
out the best way you can but but if your

1571
01:07:16,519 --> 01:07:23,119
plant isn't doing well it doesn't

1572
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:26,519
matter H how do you account for the

1573
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:29,599
changes in uh microbial growth just

1574
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:31,480
based around hydrology you know the the

1575
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:34,920
water the moisture levels in the

1576
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:36,278
so well you know if your plant's not

1577
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:38,200
getting proper water it's not going to

1578
01:07:36,278 --> 01:07:40,760
grow well but it's it's difficult you

1579
01:07:38,199 --> 01:07:43,000
can't but but by the same token you know

1580
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:45,799
you've you've got to just be aware you

1581
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,199
have to be aware of seasonal so biomass

1582
01:07:45,798 --> 01:07:51,880
in fall is not the same as biomass in

1583
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:53,159
Spring very different the changes uh and

1584
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:56,519
so if you're applying something in the

1585
01:07:53,159 --> 01:07:58,798
spring to a plant versus uh all you know

1586
01:07:56,519 --> 01:08:01,559
the biomass difference is going to be or

1587
01:07:58,798 --> 01:08:03,358
change or measurement number is going to

1588
01:08:01,559 --> 01:08:05,880
be different uh you just have to be

1589
01:08:03,358 --> 01:08:07,318
aware of it nothing's perfect no for

1590
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:09,039
sure I I would just I was just thinking

1591
01:08:07,318 --> 01:08:11,278
I'd want to control for that variable as

1592
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,760
much as possible like maybe I test the

1593
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:16,838
day after watering every time so that I

1594
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:18,359
know that because I've seen that your

1595
01:08:16,838 --> 01:08:19,679
microbial communities will change

1596
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:22,120
dramatically I mean we know that

1597
01:08:19,679 --> 01:08:23,520
bacteria can reproduce in 20 minutes so

1598
01:08:22,119 --> 01:08:26,640
you can have

1599
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:30,640
explosions right quite quickly so as

1600
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:33,000
ways to sort of right level that I don't

1601
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,798
know just think of a comp compost te you

1602
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:37,798
know I mean my God the bacteria Bloom

1603
01:08:35,798 --> 01:08:41,039
you get you know could

1604
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:43,119
be yeah yeah and again I mean what a

1605
01:08:41,039 --> 01:08:45,439
wonderful opportunity to try to be able

1606
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:49,000
to identify the kinds of bacteria in

1607
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:52,838
various tees uh and there and and what

1608
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:57,000
they might do to you know to a plant not

1609
01:08:52,838 --> 01:08:58,519
as opposed to you know fer ier type uh

1610
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:00,439
you know in other words not not as

1611
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:03,799
opposed to

1612
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:05,358
creating the mediated soil mediated

1613
01:09:03,798 --> 01:09:08,319
bacteria but to see whether there are

1614
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:11,480
any endic that end up you know there's

1615
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:13,279
some implications here uh and and and

1616
01:09:11,479 --> 01:09:16,358
research that can be done I'm

1617
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:18,560
sure so you brought up compost tea you

1618
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:22,239
know that's where I started that's kind

1619
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:23,880
of where you started um yeah you know we

1620
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,798
all started we all started with Dr

1621
01:09:23,880 --> 01:09:29,199
Elaine you know she's the

1622
01:09:26,798 --> 01:09:31,439
guru so I wna I want to ask you a

1623
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:34,079
question hear your thoughts on this so

1624
01:09:31,439 --> 01:09:36,158
yeah uh I had a recent discussion with

1625
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:41,640
someone who posted an article on compost

1626
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:47,158
te that showed um basically overall good

1627
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:50,199
disease suppression in in a study and my

1628
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:52,358
sort of initial take is like hey that's

1629
01:09:50,198 --> 01:09:55,559
great but I don't think we can draw any

1630
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:57,000
real conclusions because every B of

1631
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:59,640
compost tea is going to be different the

1632
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:01,158
batch I make today the batch you make

1633
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:03,000
the batch I make 5 minutes after the

1634
01:10:01,158 --> 01:10:06,319
first batch I make is going to be

1635
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:10,279
different so because of that

1636
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:13,039
variability I don't feel like I can

1637
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:15,000
really I I can really draw any major

1638
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,238
conclusions around other other than the

1639
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,520
fact that we know that we're adding

1640
01:10:16,238 --> 01:10:22,319
aerobic bacteria if we're making it

1641
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:24,840
correctly um and some hum and some humix

1642
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:29,599
and and maybe and fix and some nitrogen

1643
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:32,960
yeah but yeah we have um you know uh

1644
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:36,440
Linda chaker Scott who's very anti-

1645
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,960
composte um yeah I'm not saying anything

1646
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:40,158
that she would disagree with right there

1647
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:42,158
um she's kind of built a lot of her

1648
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:43,799
career around it and and part of the

1649
01:10:42,158 --> 01:10:47,039
thing is because she cites a lot of

1650
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:49,719
research showing that composte doesn't

1651
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:51,640
work essentially and you know we could

1652
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:53,359
poke holes in that research just as

1653
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:55,600
easily as we could I feel like poke

1654
01:10:53,359 --> 01:10:57,719
holes around the research this gentleman

1655
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:59,679
was showing with disease suppression but

1656
01:10:57,719 --> 01:11:02,679
that being said to me the issue is not

1657
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:05,679
so much the research itself but it's the

1658
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:08,158
inherent variability of these microbes

1659
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:10,880
because it's happening on a scale that's

1660
01:11:08,158 --> 01:11:12,158
so small that we don't understand that

1661
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:15,079
we can't

1662
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:16,599
control just because we're at such a

1663
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:20,319
such a macro

1664
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:23,360
level um I I I think it's one of those

1665
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:25,960
things that we really can't study what

1666
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:27,119
do you think about that yeah I mean

1667
01:11:25,960 --> 01:11:30,039
that's always been the problem with

1668
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:33,000
compost tea is the variability of the

1669
01:11:30,039 --> 01:11:34,840
compost uh and and and not just

1670
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,960
variability of the compost but the way

1671
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:38,679
the tea was made because they're all

1672
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:41,000
made differently people put in different

1673
01:11:38,679 --> 01:11:42,600
amounts different Brewers different you

1674
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:45,079
know you've got different temperatures

1675
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,639
blah you know it's all there uh and it's

1676
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:50,158
always been a been a problem I think the

1677
01:11:47,639 --> 01:11:51,880
reason why uh certainly from my

1678
01:11:50,158 --> 01:11:53,679
perspective I was initially excited

1679
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:55,679
about compost tea and I'm still excited

1680
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:57,760
about compost tea I you know I don't use

1681
01:11:55,679 --> 01:12:00,560
it very much anymore because I I I've

1682
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:02,440
gotten the benefits that I think I got I

1683
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:04,159
think they came from the compost te you

1684
01:12:02,439 --> 01:12:07,519
know again like you it's very hard to

1685
01:12:04,158 --> 01:12:10,719
prove um but I I you know I had a

1686
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:12,560
backyard that was so hard pan and I

1687
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:15,399
never saw a bird there there wasn't a

1688
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:17,760
worm anywhere and today as a result of

1689
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:19,799
applying compost tea holy crow I mean

1690
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:23,039
the difference is literally night and

1691
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:26,760
day uh and and and I attribute it to the

1692
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:29,560
application of compost tea uh

1693
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:31,400
I've grown cilantro with and without

1694
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:33,840
compost tea in the same in the same

1695
01:12:31,399 --> 01:12:38,679
soils and I've gotten or and in in B in

1696
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:42,440
B you know in in uh uh nons soil soils

1697
01:12:38,679 --> 01:12:45,440
uh FY type stuff or or or vermiculite

1698
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:47,439
and and I've gotten differences better

1699
01:12:45,439 --> 01:12:51,799
with the compost tea than not compost

1700
01:12:47,439 --> 01:12:55,319
tea can I fully explain it no I can't I

1701
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:58,320
can't uh and there is a dir of of there

1702
01:12:55,319 --> 01:12:59,840
are a dir of or is a dirth of studies

1703
01:12:58,319 --> 01:13:02,359
that say this is the greatest substance

1704
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,159
sliced bread but again as you say a lot

1705
01:13:02,359 --> 01:13:05,519
of it's got a do with the variability

1706
01:13:04,158 --> 01:13:07,039
and a lot of it you could pick holes

1707
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:11,440
through the through the studies I mean

1708
01:13:07,039 --> 01:13:14,198
you know com comparing compost te uh in

1709
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:15,960
Plants where you're using compost uh you

1710
01:13:14,198 --> 01:13:18,238
know that's that's that's giving the

1711
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:21,399
plant what the compost te you know I

1712
01:13:18,238 --> 01:13:23,879
mean why is that a good study so yeah I

1713
01:13:21,399 --> 01:13:26,599
got I've got the same questions you've

1714
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:28,679
got yeah think what I what I'm looking

1715
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:30,480
for in compost te is I'm applying a

1716
01:13:28,679 --> 01:13:33,279
Consortium I'm trying to increase my

1717
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:34,919
nutrient cycling that farmer model that

1718
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,840
you talk about and maybe I'm getting

1719
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:40,600
some more of these Endo fyes in there

1720
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:43,400
too um but I'm I'm certainly getting you

1721
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:46,360
know an increase in bacterian fungal

1722
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:47,759
biomass we know that and yeah you know

1723
01:13:46,359 --> 01:13:49,639
we you can you can throw it under a

1724
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:53,159
microscope and literally see the

1725
01:13:49,639 --> 01:13:55,359
nutrient cycling um happen with the you

1726
01:13:53,158 --> 01:13:58,559
know protozoa running around in the

1727
01:13:55,359 --> 01:14:00,399
ciliates eating the bacteria um and you

1728
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:02,920
and you can change the dominance of all

1729
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:06,599
of that I know people talk about this um

1730
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:09,359
by just brewing longer or um adding

1731
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:11,520
certain food sources so it it can change

1732
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,238
dramatically a tea at 12 hours is very

1733
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:15,560
different than the tea at 24 hours even

1734
01:14:13,238 --> 01:14:17,718
with all other variables the same so

1735
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:19,920
this idea of trying to study it to me is

1736
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:22,079
just it it's it almost feels like a

1737
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,079
Fool's Aaron to a certain extent well

1738
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:27,719
it's yeah I think sometimes it's an

1739
01:14:24,079 --> 01:14:30,198
attempt to to Dr Elaine frankly you know

1740
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:33,399
uh but and and I wish people would stop

1741
01:14:30,198 --> 01:14:37,399
doing that but but but again uh you know

1742
01:14:33,399 --> 01:14:40,839
it's the variability is is there uh many

1743
01:14:37,399 --> 01:14:45,198
of us have had some very interesting uh

1744
01:14:40,840 --> 01:14:48,079
uh results using compost tea um but but

1745
01:14:45,198 --> 01:14:50,759
but some of us maybe didn't appreciate

1746
01:14:48,079 --> 01:14:53,559
back then you know dumping compost tea

1747
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:56,119
onto a plant you know depending on how

1748
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:58,199
you do it uh

1749
01:14:56,119 --> 01:15:00,279
can can apply tremendous numbers of

1750
01:14:58,198 --> 01:15:03,198
microbes or can be like putting a you

1751
01:15:00,279 --> 01:15:05,880
know a dropper full of of of composed

1752
01:15:03,198 --> 01:15:09,359
tea in the one ocean uh what impact does

1753
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:13,440
it have so it also depends on the

1754
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:17,039
receiving area as well as the the compy

1755
01:15:13,439 --> 01:15:19,919
itself yeah it's it's FR with bristling

1756
01:15:17,039 --> 01:15:22,000
conundrums yeah I I I agree I think um

1757
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,359
at the end of the day to me everyone

1758
01:15:22,000 --> 01:15:25,560
needs to just try their own um try it

1759
01:15:24,359 --> 01:15:27,279
themselves see how it works in their

1760
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:28,560
environment and I think it it for the

1761
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,519
majority of people it's going to if

1762
01:15:28,560 --> 01:15:32,320
you're making it correctly you know

1763
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:34,800
using good inputs you're going to see a

1764
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:36,158
positive benefit but I don't I don't

1765
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,520
ever lead with that assumption or I

1766
01:15:36,158 --> 01:15:39,839
would never say it's going to cure your

1767
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,520
ferium or keep you from getting powdery

1768
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:44,679
mil to or some of the other things that

1769
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:47,639
I've heard around it so

1770
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:49,600
um I agree I agree you and I are not

1771
01:15:47,639 --> 01:15:52,520
that far off I it's funny how we all

1772
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:54,320
kind of fall into our little spots as we

1773
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:55,920
as we grow and it changes and I think

1774
01:15:54,319 --> 01:15:59,439
that that's what's exciting about it and

1775
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,359
adding this this book team with bacteria

1776
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:03,479
just brings a whole another layer into

1777
01:16:01,359 --> 01:16:06,359
this that's uh I think really exciting

1778
01:16:03,479 --> 01:16:08,238
so I I appreciate you for for writing

1779
01:16:06,359 --> 01:16:10,119
this book right right and you know it

1780
01:16:08,238 --> 01:16:12,238
also it also explains some of the

1781
01:16:10,119 --> 01:16:15,439
reasons why things don't work you know I

1782
01:16:12,238 --> 01:16:17,919
mean so uh who who knew that you had to

1783
01:16:15,439 --> 01:16:20,119
have the right kind of bacteria to get

1784
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,880
the the fixation that you want you know

1785
01:16:20,119 --> 01:16:24,279
I mean who knew it's now now we're

1786
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:25,679
getting a little better understanding so

1787
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:29,039
there'll be many other books on this

1788
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:31,319
subject coming I'm sure uh and and and

1789
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:32,880
we'll know we're successful uh we we

1790
01:16:31,319 --> 01:16:34,920
know we're successful with regard to

1791
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:37,159
soil food web stuff because it's what

1792
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,880
people study now when they go to college

1793
01:16:37,158 --> 01:16:41,079
they study the soil food web when they

1794
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,719
study soil science you know and we'll

1795
01:16:41,079 --> 01:16:45,760
know we're successful when the rise of

1796
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:48,319
FY cycle is part of that study uh and

1797
01:16:45,760 --> 01:16:49,719
when when we see it in articles etc etc

1798
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:51,519
I mean it's

1799
01:16:49,719 --> 01:16:54,359
fascinating I don't know how much time

1800
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,199
you want to waste on this stuff but this

1801
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:59,479
year there's been a

1802
01:16:56,198 --> 01:17:02,638
proliferation of articles about you you

1803
01:16:59,479 --> 01:17:07,519
don't need to rake your leaves in the

1804
01:17:02,639 --> 01:17:10,039
fall now to me that's soil food web

1805
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:12,800
science in practical application in

1806
01:17:10,039 --> 01:17:14,479
everyday life you don't need to rake

1807
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,199
your leaves because the microbes will

1808
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:19,158
break them down because they're valuable

1809
01:17:16,198 --> 01:17:22,439
to feed your Lawns to feed your Gardens

1810
01:17:19,158 --> 01:17:25,479
uh and and and and you don't need to

1811
01:17:22,439 --> 01:17:29,960
even better you don't need to use that

1812
01:17:25,479 --> 01:17:32,000
polluting uh blower etc etc uh this is

1813
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:34,840
practical application with soil food rib

1814
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:37,679
stuff uh and and and I love it I love

1815
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:39,639
seeing it if you if you haven't seen

1816
01:17:37,679 --> 01:17:41,199
those articles you'll now be aware of

1817
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:42,800
them and I guarantee you in the next

1818
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,279
week or so you'll see an Associated

1819
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,279
Press article or something as you know

1820
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:49,639
some clickbait article about don't rake

1821
01:17:47,279 --> 01:17:52,759
your leaves here's why and it's it's

1822
01:17:49,639 --> 01:17:54,880
soil food whip ah wow I love it I love

1823
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:57,840
it a couple years ago pre pandemic when

1824
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:59,679
when when Apple came out with the uh uh

1825
01:17:57,840 --> 01:18:03,840
I think it was the pencil the apple

1826
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:09,480
pencil uh the iPad that they were using

1827
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:12,400
had a soil food web diagram on it wow

1828
01:18:09,479 --> 01:18:15,559
you know so so this is really kind of

1829
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:19,198
fun it's just fun watch it all become

1830
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:21,440
real uh we know it's real uh you know

1831
01:18:19,198 --> 01:18:24,519
we've been thanking Dr elain and and now

1832
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:26,000
Dr James White uh uh you know but now

1833
01:18:24,520 --> 01:18:28,560
every every body gets to do it it's

1834
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,960
really it's it's very cool yeah I mean

1835
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:32,000
the leaf things make sense to me you're

1836
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:33,359
creating a natural layer of mulch you

1837
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,920
know every time the plant drops that

1838
01:18:33,359 --> 01:18:38,238
leaves and you remove it you're removing

1839
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:40,079
nutrients and organic matter from the

1840
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:43,319
environment that unless you're replacing

1841
01:18:40,079 --> 01:18:45,719
it it's it's not a closed loop system

1842
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:47,359
that being said right it's a law of

1843
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:49,279
return you're you're violating the law

1844
01:18:47,359 --> 01:18:51,119
of return the one place I wouldn't want

1845
01:18:49,279 --> 01:18:52,319
to do that is in controlled environment

1846
01:18:51,119 --> 01:18:54,279
agriculture so if we're talking to

1847
01:18:52,319 --> 01:18:56,679
cannabis Growers indoors I would still

1848
01:18:54,279 --> 01:18:58,920
suggest removing your leaves um from the

1849
01:18:56,679 --> 01:19:02,440
environment from just from a disease

1850
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:04,480
perspective um but again very different

1851
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:05,919
but I would use them but I but but I

1852
01:19:04,479 --> 01:19:09,319
would use yeah it is very different but

1853
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:12,239
I would use them in the compost uh pile

1854
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:13,759
uh and then use that compost in growing

1855
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:15,799
that cannabis sure you could you could

1856
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:17,360
absolutely compost it thermally compost

1857
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,520
it absolutely yeah I don't have a

1858
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:20,559
problem with that yeah that's that's

1859
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:22,480
that's what I would do and I and I think

1860
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:24,280
you could you could also vermac compost

1861
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,959
it as well if it turns out that vermac

1862
01:19:24,279 --> 01:19:29,000
compost is is better for your particular

1863
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:30,840
strain of cannabis and it maybe the

1864
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:32,119
Verma compost is better for all cannabis

1865
01:19:30,840 --> 01:19:35,960
I don't know we need to that wouldn't

1866
01:19:32,119 --> 01:19:37,719
remove the disease though risk right oh

1867
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:40,039
wait a minute you don't oh yeah I think

1868
01:19:37,719 --> 01:19:43,960
it does the what doesn't remove the

1869
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:46,119
disease risk to me is anobi you know a

1870
01:19:43,960 --> 01:19:48,480
lot of the anerobic mixtures can

1871
01:19:46,119 --> 01:19:49,920
potentially have the diseases in but but

1872
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,479
yeah you put it through a worm I'm

1873
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:52,719
pretty sure it doesn't have the diseases

1874
01:19:51,479 --> 01:19:55,479
anymore I haven't heard that I'll have

1875
01:19:52,719 --> 01:19:57,880
to do some more research on that one

1876
01:19:55,479 --> 01:19:59,959
yeah we're got you know folks look it up

1877
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:01,679
before you take my word for anything but

1878
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:03,880
but

1879
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:05,960
but you know I've been using Verma

1880
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:07,639
compost on on on food products in

1881
01:20:05,960 --> 01:20:09,520
cannabis for years and years yeah you

1882
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:12,199
probably had good starting inputs though

1883
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:14,920
I feel like I I would be nervous that's

1884
01:20:12,198 --> 01:20:16,719
all well you some of the poisons that I

1885
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:20,440
cook with are you kidding

1886
01:20:16,719 --> 01:20:22,439
me well yeah I just want to say Jeff

1887
01:20:20,439 --> 01:20:25,119
it's it's always a pleasure uh I look

1888
01:20:22,439 --> 01:20:26,678
forward to hopefully seeing you um face

1889
01:20:25,119 --> 01:20:30,279
to face here in the not too distant

1890
01:20:26,679 --> 01:20:33,079
future um yeah we should definitely

1891
01:20:30,279 --> 01:20:35,559
definitely you know this postco stuff we

1892
01:20:33,079 --> 01:20:37,880
need to start having these uh you know

1893
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:39,440
these confabs again where we can get

1894
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:41,760
together and of course the Cannabis

1895
01:20:39,439 --> 01:20:44,279
science is available and you know this

1896
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:46,039
every year uh those are good conferences

1897
01:20:44,279 --> 01:20:49,238
and where we can kick some of this stuff

1898
01:20:46,039 --> 01:20:52,560
around and and stimulate other people uh

1899
01:20:49,238 --> 01:20:55,479
to do more research to improve upon

1900
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:58,080
what's already been discovered totally

1901
