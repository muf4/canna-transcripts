00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,289
important to anyone making a living off

18
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,969
of farming or cannabis cultivation too

19
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:56,100
many people today using the words

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:58,829
factory and farm in the same sentence is

21
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,050
nothing short of sacrilege in many cases

22
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:03,509
though the same sound business practices

23
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:06,179
apply whether you're producing cars or

24
00:01:03,509 --> 00:01:07,920
cannabis benef Department has found that

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,659
incorporating the best new ideas from

26
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,460
business in newest farming can

27
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:13,500
drastically cut out waste and increase

28
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,609
profits making the farms more

29
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,909
environmentally and economically

30
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:20,400
sustainable working smarter not harder

31
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:22,109
also prevents the kind of burnout that

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,210
startup farmers or growers often

33
00:01:22,109 --> 00:01:27,420
encounter in the face of long hard

34
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:29,639
back-breaking labor Ben and his wife

35
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,799
Rachel own and operate clay bottom farm

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,420
in Goshen Indiana where they make their

37
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,729
living growing and selling specialty

38
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:37,259
crops on less than one acre their food

39
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,539
is sold locally to restaurants and

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:43,319
cafeterias at a farmers market and

41
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,030
through a CSA program in 2017 Ben was

42
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,129
named one of the 50 emerging green

43
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:49,590
leaders in the United States by Grist I

44
00:01:47,129 --> 00:01:51,509
took a long shot reaching out to Ben I

45
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:53,340
know that cannabis cultivation can be

46
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,049
off-putting to many traditional farmers

47
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,490
I was honored that he was willing to

48
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:59,159
come on the show to talk about his book

49
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,899
in the concept of lean farming I cannot

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,460
stress enough how important this book

51
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:04,259
can be in changing your business for the

52
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,429
better I've been telling all my friends

53
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,950
and growers about it and made some

54
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,319
massive changes on our farm based on the

55
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:12,150
principles outlined in his books without

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,229
further ado though here's this week's

57
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,670
interview

58
00:02:13,229 --> 00:02:17,049
well thanks Ben I really appreciate you

59
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19,119
taking the time to come on the show

60
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,650
today hey you're welcome thanks for

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,900
happening thanks for having me

62
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:24,789
yeah so for my listeners I heard been at

63
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,830
the focus on farming conference that was

64
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:29,349
local to me this winter and heard about

65
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,290
his book and the concepts have already

66
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:33,939
had a huge impact on my farm and I don't

67
00:02:32,289 --> 00:02:35,530
want to get into all the details of the

68
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,419
changes we've made because of your book

69
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:39,370
but we made some pretty major financial

70
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:42,250
and philosophical commitment to these

71
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:45,340
concepts okay and I think every farmer

72
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:46,930
needs to read your book so I want to

73
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,340
start off by giving listeners though a

74
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,599
little bit of information about your own

75
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:55,239
personal history yeah sure I grew up on

76
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:58,359
a northern Indiana 500 acre corn soybean

77
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,599
farm and our farm was just down the road

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:04,720
from Earl Butz who is Richard him

79
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:07,959
Nixon's secretary of agriculture and he

80
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:10,270
was made famous for saying get big or

81
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:12,340
get get out that's how you're gonna make

82
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,060
it in agriculture and so that is the

83
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:18,159
mindset with which I entered farming and

84
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,370
so we might when I got married we

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,989
purchased a five acre property and it

86
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,450
was my thinking that is a stepping stone

87
00:03:22,989 --> 00:03:27,909
property and we eventually you know

88
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:31,000
whose expanded ten acres and 20 acres

89
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:31,359
and then and then work her way up from

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,919
there

91
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,799
because when I was growing up the

92
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:38,439
metrics for success that you're a

93
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:40,170
successful farmer in northern Indiana if

94
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:42,609
every year you got a bigger tractor

95
00:03:40,169 --> 00:03:45,009
every year you rented or grew on more

96
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,040
land every year you put up another grain

97
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:50,739
bin and if you didn't then something was

98
00:03:48,039 --> 00:03:52,419
wrong with your farm and so that's the

99
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:56,319
mindset with which I entered farming and

100
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,849
to my detriment because we had we what

101
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:01,840
the type of firing I want to do was

102
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:05,500
small skill and local vegetables we were

103
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,469
selling direct to customers and it was

104
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,449
labor intense and it didn't take us long

105
00:04:08,469 --> 00:04:12,819
before I realized I just constantly

106
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:15,280
expand being just wasn't going to work

107
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:17,319
on a number of number of levels first it

108
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,819
meant that we were having to find more

109
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,339
accounts further away from home and

110
00:04:18,819 --> 00:04:23,769
drive to Chicago drive to Detroit or

111
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,659
Indianapolis to find accounts for food

112
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,399
and so is stretching the definition of

113
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:31,000
being a local farm

114
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:33,279
and then also just from a psychological

115
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,579
standpoint it was just constant stress

116
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:39,369
and it kind of hit home

117
00:04:36,579 --> 00:04:41,680
I hit home one afternoon and actually

118
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:43,389
only I tell you a story here of how I

119
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,240
tell you how I greenhouse ended up on

120
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,918
the roof of our barn is every year we

121
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,250
used to have what we call pizza and we'd

122
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:52,959
party and it was a name that we cleverly

123
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:56,680
chose to lure college students how to

124
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:59,019
our farm and weed our we did greenhouse

125
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,379
or two and then we'd feed him pizza

126
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:04,209
afterwards and so one app so this one

127
00:05:02,379 --> 00:05:06,610
about ten years ago we're getting ready

128
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:09,219
for a pizza and we'd party and we'd set

129
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:12,580
out all the tools and we rich and I

130
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,560
wanted a house for a break and then it

131
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,449
was a light breeze in the morning Howard

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,139
by mid afternoon the winds starting to

133
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:23,410
pick up and eventually the slow wind

134
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:26,259
turned into a gale force wind and we

135
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:27,490
heard Rachel heard a thunk and she ran

136
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,530
to the window and she said Ben you

137
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:32,470
better come see what's going on here and

138
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:35,319
so I ran in oh and saw the green our

139
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,660
greenhouse had landed on a roof and had

140
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:39,038
it the bed the ball or not block the

141
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,750
greenhouse it would have ended up in

142
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:44,589
northern Michigan or Canada I don't know

143
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:46,569
but and it was because we had in felt

144
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:48,899
part of the lean system you're supposed

145
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:51,310
to ask the question what I five times

146
00:05:48,899 --> 00:05:52,569
whenever something goes wrong to get at

147
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,740
the you know you want to get at the root

148
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:58,379
of every problem and so what is the

149
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,110
reason I greenhouse ended up on the roof

150
00:05:58,379 --> 00:06:04,538
first we when we the first time we asked

151
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:06,400
that question well I we say well is

152
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:09,399
because there's a high power wind how do

153
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:11,348
we ask that question enough times it so

154
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:13,629
you ask it again the second reason is I

155
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:15,219
thought it was under engineered and he

156
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:16,800
asked well what's the reason and what

157
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,909
then well it was it under engineered

158
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,889
because I was in a hurry bill in the

159
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:22,689
greenhouse anyhow by the time he asked

160
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:24,129
why five times the root cause of the

161
00:06:22,689 --> 00:06:27,189
greenhouse being on the roof of our barn

162
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:29,348
I was was simply that I was overworked

163
00:06:27,189 --> 00:06:32,469
and working too fast trying to expand

164
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:33,969
the farm too quickly and after that

165
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:36,070
happened we realized hey we need to

166
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:37,990
maybe think about our business model and

167
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:40,389
maybe there's a different way of running

168
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,168
and growing a business and and that's

169
00:06:40,389 --> 00:06:43,269
where the lean says

170
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:45,609
and our thinking can you talk a little

171
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:47,829
bit about what it lean manufacturing is

172
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:49,629
so people kind of have a foundation of

173
00:06:47,829 --> 00:06:52,778
what where you started this idea of lean

174
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:55,509
farming uh-huh and just I want to back

175
00:06:52,778 --> 00:06:57,999
up just a minute just that clarify kind

176
00:06:55,509 --> 00:07:01,090
of who we are at this point we us how we

177
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:03,490
raise organic vegetables and we do it on

178
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:04,839
in less than an acre of land and all of

179
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,908
our accounts are within a mile and a

180
00:07:04,839 --> 00:07:09,668
half of our farm so we're kind of an

181
00:07:06,908 --> 00:07:10,810
uber local micro farm and we're make a

182
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:13,990
comfortable living over a hundred

183
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:16,300
thousand dollars a year doing that um so

184
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:19,509
lean what lean manufacturing essentially

185
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,418
amounts to is putting on a set of

186
00:07:19,509 --> 00:07:24,310
eyeglasses and notice then you read a

187
00:07:22,418 --> 00:07:26,109
lot about seeing and vision in the lean

188
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:28,478
literature but essentially you're

189
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,370
noticing when am i adding value for the

190
00:07:28,478 --> 00:07:32,109
customer in other words when am i

191
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:35,110
touching my product and causing the

192
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:37,509
value of my product to go up and then

193
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:40,169
when am i contributing to muda which is

194
00:07:37,509 --> 00:07:42,788
a term we roughly translate as waste

195
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:45,098
however it's essentially any activity

196
00:07:42,788 --> 00:07:46,658
that's that is happening on your farm

197
00:07:45,098 --> 00:07:50,319
that's not directly adding value for

198
00:07:46,658 --> 00:07:52,478
your customer and the Japanese very

199
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,210
precise culture and they identified

200
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:57,098
seven specific types of mutas and now

201
00:07:55,209 --> 00:07:59,769
they've added three or four new types of

202
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:01,088
mutas um and we just have one forward

203
00:07:59,769 --> 00:08:01,918
for muda in English we just call it

204
00:08:01,088 --> 00:08:06,278
waste

205
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:08,500
however it's like how some cultures they

206
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:10,778
have 600 or more words reindeer or

207
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,749
whatever the Japanese have thought more

208
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:16,389
carefully about non value-adding process

209
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:17,830
than we have and so essentially what you

210
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:19,449
want to do is maximize the amount of

211
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:21,699
time and effort going into value-adding

212
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:24,310
activities and minimize or better yet

213
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:27,990
eliminate all the waste activities yes

214
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:30,908
so before hearing you speak in reading

215
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:33,269
reading your book I had I had heard of

216
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:36,009
lean manufacturing in fact one of our

217
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:37,299
main people at our farm was telling me

218
00:08:36,009 --> 00:08:39,610
about how we should incorporate this

219
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,889
into the farm and I was familiar with

220
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,719
Toyota and all you know some of what

221
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:46,419
they had done and to me there was a huge

222
00:08:43,719 --> 00:08:48,610
disconnect I wasn't able to in my brain

223
00:08:46,419 --> 00:08:50,740
go from what Toyota does in the

224
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,659
manufacturing facility to all the

225
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,399
different aspects and things going on in

226
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:55,089
my farm it felt like there were too many

227
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,100
variables

228
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:59,320
uh-huh so what your book really does is

229
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,970
connects the thought between that lean

230
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,770
manufacturing and then this thing this

231
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:04,330
concept of lean farming which is that

232
00:09:02,769 --> 00:09:08,230
something that you coined is this your

233
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:11,680
term and actually no because it farms in

234
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:13,720
Asia Asia in in Scandinavia have been

235
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,179
using lean systems thinking for several

236
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,170
decades it's just new to North America

237
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:21,639
here um and I to clarify - they say lean

238
00:09:20,169 --> 00:09:25,329
came from manufacturing how are the

239
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:28,449
first workers at Toyota in the 1930s

240
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,800
were rice farmers and it's these rice

241
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:32,020
farmers who brought this lean way of

242
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:33,459
thinking to the factory floor and I

243
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:34,750
think that's part of the reason that the

244
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:36,879
seven types of weights that they

245
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:39,009
originally identified at Toyota these

246
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:42,669
are ways they're ubiquitous on farms and

247
00:09:39,009 --> 00:09:45,309
one has to wonder if agricultural

248
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:46,899
thinking then influenced Toyota and and

249
00:09:45,309 --> 00:09:48,189
wasn't one of the reasons why Tod

250
00:09:46,899 --> 00:09:50,470
eventually became eight point times

251
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:55,210
eight times more profitable you know

252
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:58,420
than GM and Ford and and I think farmers

253
00:09:55,210 --> 00:10:00,639
especially in 17th and 18th century

254
00:09:58,419 --> 00:10:03,399
Japanese farmers they just had to be

255
00:10:00,639 --> 00:10:05,169
shrewd and they had a they had to farm

256
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:06,669
farm you know or else they weren't going

257
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:09,429
to make it there are a lot of historical

258
00:10:06,669 --> 00:10:11,019
sociological reasons for that but anyhow

259
00:10:09,429 --> 00:10:13,209
so that's a stay it's actually

260
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:14,949
originally at as much an agricultural

261
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:16,420
system as it is manufacturing system I

262
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,610
didn't know that that's really

263
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:21,069
interesting can we dive in a little bit

264
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,100
to the five basic principles of lean

265
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,240
before we talk too much about muda and

266
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:29,350
you have some great examples here in

267
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:32,019
your book starting with is it ciri uh uh

268
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:33,909
yeah you mean it for the five s process

269
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,699
yes yes okay

270
00:10:33,909 --> 00:10:39,939
and so lean is can roughly be thought of

271
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:42,339
as a series of there are four basic lean

272
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:45,040
concepts that fit most appropriately in

273
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,430
agriculture and the first is to apply

274
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:50,829
this 5 s organization system and the

275
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:52,389
second is by is identifying value from

276
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,610
your customer and then getting rid of

277
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:58,000
the loop is then the fourth step would

278
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:59,589
be continuous improvement and so we can

279
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,149
begin by talking about that first step

280
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,150
which is which I think is the place to

281
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:06,879
begin for most farms is to use this five

282
00:11:04,149 --> 00:11:08,799
s process and essentially there's five

283
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:12,159
steps to getting a

284
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:14,019
workplace or organized according to the

285
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:15,579
lean system and it all goes back to when

286
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,950
am i adding value when am i contributing

287
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:21,360
to a waste and so the first step of that

288
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,740
5s process is called Siri or sort in

289
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,800
essentially that means as you go around

290
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,870
your property and every object on that

291
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:31,389
on in your work environment you ask a

292
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:33,700
simple question which is did you add

293
00:11:31,389 --> 00:11:35,559
value for a customer in the past and for

294
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,278
cannabis say in the past and growing

295
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,889
season

296
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:41,828
did you add value for a customer whether

297
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:44,740
it's a fork or a hoe or you know planter

298
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:46,629
container or whatever and if you stir if

299
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,039
you struggle to come up with an answer

300
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:49,929
if you have to think it over then it's

301
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,838
probably time to get rid of that item

302
00:11:49,929 --> 00:11:55,149
okay and so I tell you they're very

303
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:56,680
ruthless about the only items in the

304
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,720
workplace where those that are being

305
00:11:56,679 --> 00:12:01,958
used on a daily basis for adding value

306
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,389
and we do this twice a year on our farm

307
00:12:01,958 --> 00:12:05,889
we go around every object and some say

308
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:07,328
you should actually physically touch the

309
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:09,278
object we don't physically touch

310
00:12:07,328 --> 00:12:11,078
everybody we salute we at least come

311
00:12:09,278 --> 00:12:13,328
close to it physically close to it and

312
00:12:11,078 --> 00:12:15,549
we ask that question dude did this row

313
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:17,649
cover to this hoe did this tractor

314
00:12:15,549 --> 00:12:20,740
implement add value in the past six

315
00:12:17,649 --> 00:12:22,149
months and if the answer is no then we

316
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,680
get it off the property and we've been

317
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:25,809
pretty ruthless about this I don't like

318
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,549
to have stuff on our property and we

319
00:12:25,809 --> 00:12:31,088
farm with enough tools that would

320
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:32,139
fitness a small sized pickup and EXO as

321
00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:34,120
you're doing this you want to choose

322
00:12:32,139 --> 00:12:37,240
tools that you want to farm with a few

323
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:40,209
tools that add that add a lot of value

324
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:43,329
that perform many functions and so we

325
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:46,479
love for instance a hoe that can be a

326
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:48,399
grubbing hoe that's a strong hoe for you

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,639
know flipping soil if you need to and

328
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,778
yet it has a fine point so we can use it

329
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:58,299
for finer cultivating or the Beast BCS

330
00:12:55,778 --> 00:12:59,860
working swap out multiple implements and

331
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,778
can perform a lot of functions more

332
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:03,699
we're always on the lookout for how can

333
00:13:01,778 --> 00:13:05,860
we farm with fewer tools and get more

334
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:08,559
work accomplished now that kind of leads

335
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,959
essentially the next the next one which

336
00:13:08,559 --> 00:13:13,149
is set in order because when you say

337
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:15,009
fewer tools you are removing tools but

338
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:17,259
you're also putting the tools where

339
00:13:15,009 --> 00:13:18,939
they're most useful and even duplicating

340
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:21,610
tools can you touch on that a little bit

341
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,750
uh-huh yeah so we used to hit for

342
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:25,000
instance we used to have a

343
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:27,549
nice tool storage areas toolshed like a

344
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,230
lot of farms would have and the first

345
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:30,639
thing we did at lien consultant came out

346
00:13:29,230 --> 00:13:32,379
and said you really need to take a stick

347
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,610
of dynamite to that toolshed because

348
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:36,309
it's adding a lot of muda to your

349
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:38,320
process and the reason is for every

350
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,969
process we had to do say prune tomatoes

351
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,770
we'd have to walk two hundred three

352
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,480
hundred paces to the tool shed grab the

353
00:13:41,769 --> 00:13:45,129
pruners then walk back to the greenhouse

354
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:48,399
and prune the tomatoes then return the

355
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:50,139
pruners we put in as much work going to

356
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,389
get the pruners and returning him as we

357
00:13:50,139 --> 00:13:54,159
did actually pruning the tomatoes and so

358
00:13:52,389 --> 00:13:55,360
what we started to do in the lean

359
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,919
systems has to do is you want to hang

360
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,139
your tools at eye low high level

361
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:02,639
locations as close as possible to their

362
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:04,870
points of use and so now we have magnets

363
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:06,879
spread out across the property that hold

364
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,860
knives and rumors that we use on a

365
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:10,539
regular basis and every green how

366
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:12,970
they're for greenhouses everyone has a

367
00:14:10,539 --> 00:14:14,589
tool set up and the tools we need in

368
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:17,050
that greenhouse are attached to the

369
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:19,210
greenhouse somewhere I got to say that's

370
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:21,549
a huge one for me a little light bulb

371
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:23,470
went off because I know for a fact like

372
00:14:21,549 --> 00:14:25,359
some projects I would I would spend

373
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:26,889
15-20 minutes just looking for a tool

374
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,839
because it wasn't replaced it would be

375
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:31,779
on the entire other side of the property

376
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:34,150
from where it needs to be and the idea

377
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,980
of having an extra set of pruners or

378
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:38,679
extra sets of shovels or whatever

379
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,269
implement tool I'm implementing in the

380
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,549
location where I'm going to use it can

381
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,588
save not just my time but my employees

382
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:47,319
time which I'm paying labor on and yeah

383
00:14:44,589 --> 00:14:49,270
that was a big one so we're working on

384
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,860
on getting all of the right tools in the

385
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,870
right places and I know that's going to

386
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,409
save us a ton of time awesome

387
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:58,870
and I think it's okay to duplicate tools

388
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:00,370
we say if a tool costs $50 or less we're

389
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:04,060
going to probably duplicate that tool

390
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:07,299
and so for instance every greenhouse we

391
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:09,159
on probably 15 or so knives that we'd

392
00:15:07,299 --> 00:15:11,259
harvest with even though we only going

393
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:12,789
to use three or four nine seven time but

394
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:15,970
every greenhouse has a couple of them

395
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:16,990
attached to the greenhouse so that for

396
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,600
the reason that they're physically

397
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:21,190
closer to where we're using them and

398
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,170
that small investment is paid off now we

399
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:24,370
don't buy a tractor a separate tractor

400
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,979
for every greenhouse you know there's a

401
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,509
limit to tool duplicating but the point

402
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:30,460
is the keep your tools close to their

403
00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:32,289
workstations yeah I'll put up some

404
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:33,759
pictures you also have some mobile

405
00:15:32,289 --> 00:15:36,429
workstation examples in your book that

406
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:38,080
are really interesting to the

407
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:39,579
show that you can you can move the tools

408
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:42,610
around with the worker so that they're

409
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,290
easily accessible and easy to see when

410
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:47,440
you're getting low on supplies as well

411
00:15:44,289 --> 00:15:49,659
uh-huh yeah and Darrin Darrin volt

412
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,870
Vollmer an excellent farmer up in

413
00:15:49,659 --> 00:15:54,659
Wisconsin he would have more workers and

414
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:57,700
we have several dozen workers during

415
00:15:54,659 --> 00:16:00,730
peak harvest season and what he does is

416
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:03,610
he would have a five gon bucket with an

417
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,990
organizing basket attached to it and so

418
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:06,789
every worker gets a bucket with

419
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,990
precisely the tools they need and they

420
00:16:06,789 --> 00:16:09,370
carry that bucket around with them and

421
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:12,370
they're responsible for those tools in

422
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:15,399
the bucket but the the point is that to

423
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:17,169
not it said to make sure tools are where

424
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,759
they belong or in your hands they're

425
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:21,610
either in their place or in your hands

426
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:23,588
there's no third option that's great and

427
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:27,629
that leads us to our next concept which

428
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:30,700
is shine uh-huh yeah so like I said

429
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:32,500
there's a lot of language about you read

430
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,528
a lot about vision and seeing in the

431
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:37,120
lean literature and idea behind the

432
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,278
shine concept you want to clean your

433
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:42,009
tool your your work spaces with the

434
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:44,588
tooth tooth brush and make sure they're

435
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:47,819
well lit your most used tools workspace

436
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:50,110
should be very clean and the reason

437
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,350
behind that is you want to see when

438
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:55,959
waste is creeping in and so with with

439
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:57,670
cannabis production you want to think

440
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:01,389
about when are the steps in my process

441
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:03,659
when there's the most defect happening

442
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:05,558
the only near cleaning or we may be

443
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,299
submitting or whatever you want to make

444
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,000
sure those spaces are very clean and

445
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:14,740
very well-lit to seeing so you can see

446
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,799
your work and the a principle here too

447
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:22,179
is you want to perform site so in short

448
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:24,399
high frequencies birds and instead of

449
00:17:22,179 --> 00:17:26,709
long low-frequency let me explain the

450
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,390
difference short high-frequency means

451
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:30,009
that every time we're done you know

452
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:31,990
watching a hundred pounds of lettuce in

453
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:34,539
the processing area or hosing a hundred

454
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:36,279
pounds hundred bunches of carrots we're

455
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,250
going to restore that processing

456
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:40,329
processing area to zero well that means

457
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,690
we're going to take it all the way back

458
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:47,259
to clean so it's clean condition and we

459
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:49,299
hang pictures up in our processing area

460
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:50,349
so that there's no ambiguity about what

461
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:52,869
zero look

462
00:17:50,349 --> 00:17:54,308
like in that processing area and so

463
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:56,500
every time we're done working in there

464
00:17:54,308 --> 00:17:57,819
you know every every hour 90 minute

465
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,888
chunk at I know we're done working we're

466
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:02,888
going to take it back to zero is the

467
00:17:59,888 --> 00:18:04,928
language we use and will used to do the

468
00:18:02,888 --> 00:18:07,359
long low frequency method would be to we

469
00:18:04,929 --> 00:18:09,580
just junk up the farm from say March

470
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,319
until Thanksgiving and then we thought

471
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:13,960
hey we'll have the entire energy all

472
00:18:11,319 --> 00:18:16,148
winter to clean it but we never did it

473
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,630
it always just every year just got more

474
00:18:16,148 --> 00:18:22,058
cluttered and what you which which

475
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,950
happens so when it comes to these first

476
00:18:22,058 --> 00:18:25,808
three steps sorting saying in order and

477
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:27,669
cleaning the thing I tell people is that

478
00:18:25,808 --> 00:18:30,460
you don't have to do it all in one week

479
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,679
and we did actually about a week we just

480
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,750
we got several wagon loads off of our

481
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:36,730
property several tons of John literally

482
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:39,849
off our properties we didn't one big

483
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:41,409
push however you don't have to what you

484
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,490
can do is just make sure that you're

485
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:45,490
headed in the right direction because

486
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:47,138
the trajectory that your your euro land

487
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:49,839
is ultimately the most important thing

488
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:51,878
because trajectory is a very powerful

489
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:54,369
psychological force is the most powerful

490
00:18:51,878 --> 00:18:57,128
force in the world I think because if

491
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:58,778
you think about ear your farm is headed

492
00:18:57,128 --> 00:19:00,189
in one of two directions you're either

493
00:18:58,778 --> 00:19:02,128
getting more cluttered every growing

494
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:04,808
season or you're getting more

495
00:19:02,128 --> 00:19:06,519
decluttered you're only headed in one of

496
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:08,528
two directions and you just want to know

497
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:10,058
you're headed the right direction yeah I

498
00:19:08,528 --> 00:19:12,398
think this is a really important step

499
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:14,048
and it's one that we are taking baby

500
00:19:12,398 --> 00:19:15,699
steps on ourselves

501
00:19:14,048 --> 00:19:17,589
you know I mentioned to you before we

502
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:19,899
start the podcast I've actually brought

503
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:22,689
in some really large dumpsters that we

504
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:24,819
filled we got rid of a whole bunch of

505
00:19:22,690 --> 00:19:27,038
plastic pots that we were been storing a

506
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:28,960
whole bunch of other other just

507
00:19:27,038 --> 00:19:30,398
literally just junk that we need to

508
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,460
remove off the property or things we

509
00:19:30,398 --> 00:19:35,408
weren't using and the psychological

510
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:38,769
effects of this has been really big the

511
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:41,019
staff is has a cleaner space to work in

512
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:43,450
they have take more pride in their work

513
00:19:41,019 --> 00:19:45,128
it's not there's a there's a

514
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:47,769
psychological impact and that was

515
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:50,439
something that I learned from you was

516
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:52,750
that I didn't realize the psychological

517
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:55,450
impact of having a pile of junk the

518
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:56,829
amount of stress they created in the

519
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:58,210
fact I had to keep thinking about it

520
00:19:56,829 --> 00:20:01,119
over and over again but once it's off

521
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:04,059
the property I can let it go emotionally

522
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:05,469
and that was a big deal absolutely

523
00:20:04,059 --> 00:20:08,379
I'm reading a book right now called deep

524
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:10,089
work and I'd highly recommend it for any

525
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,690
wants to delve deeper in these concepts

526
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:16,179
but that idea is that we're actually

527
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:18,309
happiest and we're the most productive

528
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,830
when we have just what we need in front

529
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:23,679
of us and no more an especially in

530
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:25,949
itself uh in the smartphone right they

531
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,120
say the average office worker I

532
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,910
experienced some sort of disruption

533
00:20:28,119 --> 00:20:33,339
every 15 minutes it's an on the farm

534
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:35,110
that what that happens to and whether it

535
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:37,240
be your disruptive because you can't

536
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:38,679
find the tool you're looking for or your

537
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,990
shrub because your cell phone goes off

538
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:43,690
or just constant interruption constant

539
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:45,910
disruption and we need to get into what

540
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:48,070
lean language lean would use is we call

541
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:50,170
a flow we need to get enter into a

542
00:20:48,069 --> 00:20:52,389
workflow in order to achieve maximum

543
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:54,070
productivity this means we're working

544
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,830
for about an hour to 90 minutes without

545
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:59,470
interruption and once you get to that

546
00:20:56,829 --> 00:21:02,439
point you can repeat a process of

547
00:20:59,470 --> 00:21:03,970
getting into a deep flow it's a fun it's

548
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:07,090
been phenomenal on our farm how much

549
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:07,660
more productive we are yeah that's a

550
00:21:07,089 --> 00:21:09,339
great point

551
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,990
you know I've always being interrupted

552
00:21:09,339 --> 00:21:12,339
and it is hard to maintain your train of

553
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,200
thought and there's good studies out

554
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:16,629
there that show that we're not able to

555
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,410
multitask as effectively as we actually

556
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,780
think we are uh no or not so that's that

557
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:25,870
is a big deal and as we continue to

558
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:28,240
disrupt our work it actually changes the

559
00:21:25,869 --> 00:21:32,199
neural pathways in our brain we actually

560
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,029
change how we think it becomes i we can

561
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,340
do long-term damage to our brain and

562
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:38,529
make it long-term more difficult to

563
00:21:36,339 --> 00:21:39,909
enter that state of deep flow so I think

564
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:42,720
it's very important and something that's

565
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:45,100
overlooked often we think that

566
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:47,470
multitasking is often hair is often

567
00:21:45,099 --> 00:21:49,509
Harold it is a something you want to

568
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:53,259
work towards like the open office

569
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:55,660
concept that I googled new offices are

570
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:58,000
just totally open and Facebook too would

571
00:21:55,660 --> 00:22:00,220
have open offices and all right but the

572
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,470
reality is that you you open yourself up

573
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:05,230
to a lot of dis rack distraction in

574
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,630
which is definite all ultimately to the

575
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:09,460
bottom line yeah I think that's a really

576
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:11,290
good point and the other thing you

577
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:13,930
mentioned that I wanted to touch on was

578
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:16,389
the idea of how using photos and this is

579
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:18,250
a brilliant idea because the amount of

580
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:19,870
time it takes to explain and train

581
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:21,849
employee on what a space should look

582
00:22:19,869 --> 00:22:24,969
like or the amount of time for them to

583
00:22:21,849 --> 00:22:26,529
read all the every step if you want to

584
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:28,299
write things out is is pretty

585
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,190
detrimental compared to them being able

586
00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,869
to just look at a photo and say this is

587
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,980
what it looks like now this is what it

588
00:22:31,869 --> 00:22:34,419
needs to look like and make those

589
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:37,870
changes uh-huh

590
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:40,480
and that's a good segue in I psych way

591
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:43,209
into the forced up of the 5s process

592
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,490
which is standardization and so when you

593
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:47,950
perform those first three steps sorting

594
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:49,720
sliding an order in shining you want to

595
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:52,450
do it the same you want to repeat the

596
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:54,039
same steps especially with signing and

597
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,319
so photos really do communicate a

598
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:59,170
thousand words much much more efficient

599
00:22:56,319 --> 00:23:01,450
so like I said we hang photos of what

600
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:03,370
our clean hosing station should look

601
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:05,590
like and then I don't have to tell

602
00:23:03,369 --> 00:23:08,139
workers every time they set these crates

603
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:10,179
over here and I set these boxes over

604
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:12,280
here mop the floor we just say hey make

605
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,910
it look like what the picture is yeah

606
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,440
that's great

607
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,490
and then let's touch on the last one

608
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:21,070
there sustained uh yeah so it sent what

609
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,220
Toyota used system means you want to

610
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:26,349
make sure that these this 5s process is

611
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:28,779
part of deep is deeply ingrained into

612
00:23:26,349 --> 00:23:30,459
your workplace culture and there are a

613
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:32,139
couple ways of doing this what Toyota

614
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:34,269
used to do is literally send someone

615
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:36,910
around each workstation and give a

616
00:23:34,269 --> 00:23:38,650
numerical rating based on how close to

617
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:41,500
the workers were using the 5s system and

618
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:43,660
then give them bonuses I think one of

619
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:46,599
the best ways to sustain the practice on

620
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:49,420
a small farm is through hanging lots of

621
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:51,369
pictures up around the farm and asking

622
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,640
people keep the farm looking like what

623
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:56,709
those pictures look like and it's also

624
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,930
sometimes helpful to have a third person

625
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:01,269
say not you as the farm manager owner

626
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:03,570
but have a worker give inaud it give an

627
00:24:01,269 --> 00:24:05,500
occasional audit maybe once a month or

628
00:24:03,569 --> 00:24:07,299
something you could do once a week even

629
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:09,789
I just do a quick walk around and give a

630
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:11,619
numerical rating - how close to your

631
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,480
using the 5s system so your discipline

632
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:14,979
yourself to make it happen that's great

633
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,569
let's jump into the next section which

634
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:19,480
talks a little bit about what value

635
00:24:16,569 --> 00:24:21,579
means and how you identify that for your

636
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,500
for your customers and I love that story

637
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:27,549
that you you told at the conference

638
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:32,140
regarding the toyota employee uh-huh so

639
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:35,009
we have this thinking in the u.s. anyhow

640
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:38,980
that we know more than our customers and

641
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:40,660
Steve Steve Jobs use this it was famous

642
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:43,299
for not listening to customers and users

643
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,940
say I know what my customers want more

644
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:48,159
than they know what they want and that

645
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:50,230
might be true and specially tech

646
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:51,970
industry there might be some exceptions

647
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:55,299
however for most businesses especially

648
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:57,250
agriculture though but the best phrasing

649
00:24:55,299 --> 00:24:58,539
I've heard is from Jim Womack you wrote

650
00:24:57,250 --> 00:25:00,730
the book lean thing it says you want to

651
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:03,519
start with the customer customer and

652
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,019
work backwards from there just so begin

653
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:08,609
with the customer work backwards from

654
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:11,710
there and so the customer is the only

655
00:25:08,609 --> 00:25:14,500
force that is allowed to identify about

656
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:16,240
you in the lean system and so you want

657
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:18,099
to be very precise about identifying

658
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,079
value which means you want to listen

659
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:21,849
very very closely to your customers and

660
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:24,039
the Japanese have this tradition called

661
00:25:21,849 --> 00:25:26,199
gun cheek and boots boot which means up

662
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:29,319
close and personal observation to

663
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:33,309
thoroughly understand a situation so can

664
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:34,960
she can boots and so was one of my

665
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:39,119
favorite stories of gun chicken boots

666
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:41,529
sue in practice is in 2004 it was there

667
00:25:39,119 --> 00:25:45,069
Toyota said it's time to redesign this

668
00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:47,109
sienna and Toyota was not they were not

669
00:25:45,069 --> 00:25:49,990
the first in in the minivan market they

670
00:25:47,109 --> 00:25:51,819
were kind of trailing behind however

671
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:53,620
they quickly took over the in a minivan

672
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:56,859
market because of what this one engineer

673
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:59,199
did and so they sent him over to North

674
00:25:56,859 --> 00:26:01,000
America their primary market he told him

675
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:04,059
to drive him van in all parts of Mexico

676
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,710
Canada in the US and he spent better

677
00:26:04,059 --> 00:26:07,659
part of a year doing this closely

678
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:09,700
observing how we're using the vans over

679
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,259
our vans over here and so he noticed

680
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:14,230
that in Santa Fe New Mexico for instance

681
00:26:11,259 --> 00:26:15,879
he had trouble turning they needed a

682
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:18,339
tighter turning radius than those

683
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,650
current Sienna had and so he called home

684
00:26:18,339 --> 00:26:22,720
and said we need to tighten the turning

685
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,720
radius by 15 degrees to get up and down

686
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,980
the alleyways in Santa Fe New Mexico and

687
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:29,680
so they did it they tighten up that

688
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:31,089
turning radius and then he noticed in

689
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,029
western part of the u.s. that we drove

690
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:37,149
long distances and we were eating like

691
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:39,879
four-course meals in our vans and this

692
00:26:37,150 --> 00:26:42,400
wasn't a cultural tradition in Japan and

693
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,620
so he invented this beautiful flip up

694
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,119
console that this current Sienna has and

695
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:47,828
he put something like five

696
00:26:46,118 --> 00:26:50,769
our cupholders in there there's no

697
00:26:47,828 --> 00:26:53,108
excuse not to have I not to be drinking

698
00:26:50,769 --> 00:26:54,338
while you're driving and then my

699
00:26:53,108 --> 00:26:56,408
favorite example is he went to Ann Arbor

700
00:26:54,338 --> 00:26:59,739
Michigan a couple hours north of our 4

701
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:03,459
and he went to the parking lot of a Home

702
00:26:59,739 --> 00:27:05,739
Depot and he didn't go in he just stood

703
00:27:03,459 --> 00:27:07,509
in the parking lot and observed and what

704
00:27:05,739 --> 00:27:09,639
he noticed was that people were trying

705
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:11,618
to stuff for bait sheets of drywall or

706
00:27:09,638 --> 00:27:13,388
plywood or whatever into the van and

707
00:27:11,618 --> 00:27:16,058
they just couldn't quite get it in and

708
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:17,769
so they bunted the back hatch or try to

709
00:27:16,058 --> 00:27:20,588
strap it to the roof and they became

710
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:22,929
very frustrated and so he called home at

711
00:27:20,588 --> 00:27:24,249
that point and said hey from that

712
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,959
parking line he said we need to get a

713
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:28,858
four by eight sheet of whatever in the

714
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:31,479
van the next plan that we produce and

715
00:27:28,858 --> 00:27:33,968
sure enough if you own a minivan

716
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:36,009
produced after that point in his history

717
00:27:33,969 --> 00:27:37,838
then the odds are very high that you can

718
00:27:36,009 --> 00:27:40,509
get a 4x8 sheet of plywood in it and

719
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:43,058
then Mather wise to it or hunter or gene

720
00:27:40,509 --> 00:27:45,729
or Ford everyone followed suit but my

721
00:27:43,058 --> 00:27:47,888
point is that notice how closely they're

722
00:27:45,729 --> 00:27:50,199
observing their customers this is close

723
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:52,568
personal observation and then acting on

724
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:55,329
those observations and their level of

725
00:27:52,568 --> 00:27:57,578
observation very my new very precise and

726
00:27:55,328 --> 00:27:59,858
in Raich and I had to admit we heard

727
00:27:57,578 --> 00:28:02,229
stories like this when we start looking

728
00:27:59,858 --> 00:28:04,658
into the lean system Budi I'd admit we'd

729
00:28:02,229 --> 00:28:07,838
never come close to taking our customers

730
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:09,549
that seriously and so one of the first

731
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:13,118
things we did after we'd clean up the

732
00:28:09,548 --> 00:28:14,979
farm using up 5s system was to perform

733
00:28:13,118 --> 00:28:16,778
this against you can boot due process

734
00:28:14,979 --> 00:28:18,459
with our customers and really get to

735
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:20,769
know what they wanted so here's the

736
00:28:18,459 --> 00:28:21,899
three questions this I'll summarize the

737
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:24,159
whole process with three questions

738
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:27,398
essentially you ask number one what do

739
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:30,099
they want what specific products are

740
00:28:27,398 --> 00:28:33,518
they asking for number two is when do

741
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:36,338
they want it and the third is how much

742
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:38,439
and what amounts do they want it so with

743
00:28:36,338 --> 00:28:41,108
very simple questions what do they want

744
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:44,139
what do you want how much and yet most

745
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:47,198
people in in most cannabis producers

746
00:28:44,138 --> 00:28:49,898
most vegetable growers corn soybean

747
00:28:47,199 --> 00:28:52,239
farmers certainly are not taking the

748
00:28:49,898 --> 00:28:54,458
baby step it would take to get good

749
00:28:52,239 --> 00:28:57,608
precise answers to those questions and

750
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:59,340
it really hinders your business yes so

751
00:28:57,608 --> 00:29:02,250
basically what you're

752
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:04,559
hanging out there is what ad how do you

753
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:07,079
how do you identify value and then what

754
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:08,789
adds value and then what does not add

755
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:13,259
value and then you're essentially trying

756
00:29:08,789 --> 00:29:15,629
to focus on ways to raise raise the

757
00:29:13,259 --> 00:29:17,579
value or do more activities that add

758
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,490
value and less activities that don't add

759
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:22,079
value can you give a concrete example of

760
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:24,390
something you did on your farm that was

761
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,119
a change based on customer response or

762
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:29,910
customer feedback uh uh waiting for a

763
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:33,239
number of years ran a CSA which means

764
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,009
Community Supported Agriculture and what

765
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,109
this means is customers paid us the

766
00:29:35,009 --> 00:29:40,200
beginning of the growing season and then

767
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:42,119
we gave him a box of food every week and

768
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:44,400
at first we said you had to come out to

769
00:29:42,119 --> 00:29:48,389
the farm pick it up and we gave a couple

770
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,340
hours on Friday afternoons and we began

771
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:52,290
as prices we asked those three questions

772
00:29:50,339 --> 00:29:53,730
to our customers and and those questions

773
00:29:52,289 --> 00:29:55,409
obviously helped us determine what to

774
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:57,120
put in the CSA boxes how big to make

775
00:29:55,410 --> 00:30:00,810
those CSA boxes and we altered the

776
00:29:57,119 --> 00:30:03,479
amounts and me items that went into

777
00:30:00,809 --> 00:30:05,429
those boxes however that we heard most

778
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,620
feedback was that we loved actually what

779
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:10,590
you're giving us however is inconvenient

780
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:13,829
to come pick up Friday afternoons at

781
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:16,799
your farm and so we started using pickup

782
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:19,319
locations around town and so they won't

783
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,909
have to make that ten mile trip and so

784
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,169
at the end of the next growing season we

785
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:24,140
asked those questions again and they

786
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,820
said we love the pickup locations

787
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:29,460
however it's hard to get there just on

788
00:30:26,819 --> 00:30:30,990
Friday afternoons and so the following

789
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,910
growing season the third growing season

790
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,069
we installed coolers at those pickup

791
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:37,019
locations and so they could pick up

792
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:38,279
whenever during the week we told we're

793
00:30:37,019 --> 00:30:40,650
going to deliver Friday afternoon you

794
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:42,269
come get it winters can be and then at

795
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:44,130
the end of that season we asked the same

796
00:30:42,269 --> 00:30:46,410
questions and they said we love the

797
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:49,920
coolers that makes pickup much easy or

798
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:52,710
however it's just actually still kind of

799
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,240
hard to go to the groceries to grocery

800
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:55,710
store and then go to your pickup

801
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,410
locations like we're doing our groceries

802
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:59,940
in two places and so what we did is we

803
00:30:58,410 --> 00:31:01,140
asked our customers where do you most

804
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,779
lower to most you do your grocery

805
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:06,360
shopping and then we partnered with that

806
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:08,069
grocery store to use them as a CSA

807
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:11,189
pickup location is their local food

808
00:31:08,069 --> 00:31:12,539
co-op and so that our customers could do

809
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,350
their grocery shopping get their CSA

810
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:15,659
boxes in one

811
00:31:13,349 --> 00:31:18,990
trip save a trip and then we ask those

812
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:21,660
questions again and we and and and now

813
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:23,370
what we're hearing is we love that being

814
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:26,580
able to pick up that this at the

815
00:31:23,369 --> 00:31:28,558
supermarket saves our trip you're giving

816
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:30,808
us the right amount we love the

817
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:33,599
ingredients that are in in there however

818
00:31:30,808 --> 00:31:35,428
we want more i we need some help with

819
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,889
cooking in the home we just don't have

820
00:31:35,429 --> 00:31:39,538
time to cook everything and so now we're

821
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:42,960
partnering with the deli department of

822
00:31:39,538 --> 00:31:44,609
our coke of our co coop to create a sort

823
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,769
of local blue apron option in which

824
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:48,058
we're going to put a whole meal package

825
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:49,650
together it won't be mostly our

826
00:31:48,058 --> 00:31:52,619
vegetables how are the deli would maybe

827
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:54,990
bake a loaf of bread or add some

828
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,879
condiments and put a whole recipe whole

829
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:59,308
several recipes to put a whole meal

830
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,490
together and it'll be a blue apron model

831
00:31:59,308 --> 00:32:05,369
form anyhow so the point is that's how

832
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:06,690
we retain CSA customers mo CSA's lose

833
00:32:05,369 --> 00:32:09,689
more than half their customers on an

834
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:12,210
annual basis and there are a lot of

835
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:13,919
external reasons for this a lot more

836
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,480
competition a lot of more places to get

837
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:17,730
organic food than there was 20 years ago

838
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:19,140
and CSA is the beginning however there's

839
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:20,940
a lot of there are internal practices a

840
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,100
farm can do to keep your customers not

841
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,450
that's that's one of them you know I

842
00:32:23,099 --> 00:32:26,250
learned this lesson the hard way

843
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:28,830
literally tens of thousands of dollars

844
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:30,329
I've wasted in I started off with an

845
00:32:28,829 --> 00:32:31,889
edible nursery with all these

846
00:32:30,329 --> 00:32:33,199
permaculture plants that are really

847
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:35,070
really awesome plants

848
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,259
unfortunately no one in my community

849
00:32:35,069 --> 00:32:39,058
really cared they didn't care that I had

850
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:41,190
all these really cool plants that I

851
00:32:39,058 --> 00:32:42,538
thought was really fascinating or some

852
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:44,759
of my friends thought was fascinating so

853
00:32:42,538 --> 00:32:47,250
they sat on the farm I had to water them

854
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,750
I had to care for them people came in

855
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:50,460
and bought the same things blueberries

856
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,319
apples you know stuff they knew and

857
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,360
occasionally I would sell some of these

858
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:56,519
other plants but I had to lean down my

859
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:58,109
nursery to what was actually selling and

860
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:59,250
I didn't even really know this concept

861
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,949
at the time it was just something I

862
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:04,200
discovered in addition we were growing a

863
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,750
lot of these really cool rare vegetables

864
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,460
and heirloom plants but again no one was

865
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:11,460
buying them they were they were going to

866
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:13,288
waste because uh-huh I wasn't looking at

867
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:15,120
what the custom was valuing I was taking

868
00:33:13,288 --> 00:33:18,480
my values and trying to impose them on

869
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:20,609
the community and so you know having

870
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,769
thousand pounds of organic habanero

871
00:33:20,609 --> 00:33:24,058
peppers doesn't do any good if there's

872
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:26,210
no one in the area that wants to eat

873
00:33:24,058 --> 00:33:30,379
habanero peppers so

874
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:32,539
uh-huh absolutely.i I've made this

875
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:34,960
mistake year after year and so I'm

876
00:33:32,539 --> 00:33:37,970
really excited that we've kind of been

877
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,569
forced into this process as we've

878
00:33:37,970 --> 00:33:43,220
learned the hard way what not to do and

879
00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm hoping other people can avoid making

880
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,309
this mistake so don't don't necessarily

881
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,009
grow the planet that you want to grow

882
00:33:46,309 --> 00:33:50,839
grow the plant that your customers are

883
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:53,509
going to value and want want you to grow

884
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:55,369
so now we're growing some Tulsi Basil's

885
00:33:53,509 --> 00:33:58,069
that are holy Basil's for the local

886
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:59,389
Indian community as well as some some

887
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:02,329
certain eggplants that they've requested

888
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,910
so we're going on asking them okay what

889
00:34:02,329 --> 00:34:06,559
we can do to support them rather than

890
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:08,148
what week what they can do to support us

891
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,389
there we have it

892
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:12,980
yeah another way to say that is to that

893
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,549
the customer is the only one who defines

894
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:19,340
up you and I they call that owner

895
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,899
Distortion owner of a distortion via the

896
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:23,149
technical term for what happens in a lot

897
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:25,519
of businesses were your own fascinations

898
00:34:23,148 --> 00:34:27,049
get in the way of profits because the

899
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,840
customer should be out ahead pulling you

900
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,250
along one thing we try to do is get all

901
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,980
our orders before we even purchase our

902
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:37,070
seeds at the beginning of the year sit

903
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:38,960
down with all our chefs and and map out

904
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:41,179
who's going to purchase who's going to

905
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,918
eat every single you know crop that we

906
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,960
produce and then we'll get our seeds

907
00:34:42,918 --> 00:34:47,148
ordered and go from there that's great

908
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,480
and I'd like to use that as a transition

909
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:52,489
into our next our next topic which would

910
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,599
be muda which i think is the most

911
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:59,209
fascinating aspect of lean and you list

912
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:02,269
10 tools for minimizing waste which is

913
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:03,740
essentially what what muda means can we

914
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:05,360
talk about each of those just touch on

915
00:35:03,739 --> 00:35:08,959
them briefly starting with the idea of

916
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:10,849
minimizing your movement yeah so one of

917
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:13,159
so like I said the Japanese identify

918
00:35:10,849 --> 00:35:15,619
these types of waste in a production

919
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:18,549
environment and motion waste is the

920
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:21,650
sixth type it's not first on the list

921
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:26,090
however it's prevalent on every farm and

922
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:27,590
the idea behind motion waste is you want

923
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,930
to actually count the number of times

924
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,280
you touch your product and like I said

925
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:34,190
you want to achieve what they call

926
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:35,960
smooth flow and so you want to touch

927
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:38,179
your product as few times as possible in

928
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,800
the grocery industry they say you're

929
00:35:38,179 --> 00:35:42,250
allowed three touches

930
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,710
for instance selling a box of kicks I

931
00:35:42,250 --> 00:35:48,769
you unload the kicks from the wholesale

932
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:51,320
distributor put it on the shelf customer

933
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:53,599
picks it up you check check out so you

934
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:55,130
in the customer checks out so they say

935
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,860
it's a grocer or you're allowed three

936
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:59,750
touches and if you touch it if you can

937
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:02,300
get by with just one touch then you're

938
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:04,039
making money if you touch it two times

939
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,019
then you're probably breaking even if

940
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:08,809
you get to three touches you're probably

941
00:36:06,019 --> 00:36:10,489
losing money I think on farms we're

942
00:36:08,809 --> 00:36:13,190
allowed probably five or six touches a

943
00:36:10,489 --> 00:36:15,679
few more however not many more touches

944
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:19,039
than that so the first tip I would have

945
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:21,230
is to just count and you know map out

946
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:22,820
your process you know what steps are

947
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:24,199
involved in production and then how many

948
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,700
times did you touch your product before

949
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:27,199
it got into the hand of the customer and

950
00:36:25,699 --> 00:36:28,909
try to get it down to four or five

951
00:36:27,199 --> 00:36:31,849
touches yeah can you take me through

952
00:36:28,909 --> 00:36:34,069
that process like with a carrots or or a

953
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:35,420
tomato or maybe lettuce to kind of

954
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:39,769
describe what that looks like

955
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:43,070
uh-huh and so yeah I'll use an example

956
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:44,539
of head lettuce what we used to do we

957
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,490
say we have two hundred heads of lettuce

958
00:36:44,539 --> 00:36:48,349
that need to be picked and processed and

959
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:50,569
sent off your customer I'll tell you our

960
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:52,730
old process as we would harvest those

961
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,350
200 heads of lettuce someone would

962
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:57,170
harvest and then take them up to the

963
00:36:54,349 --> 00:36:58,579
processing area so there's a touch not

964
00:36:57,170 --> 00:37:01,010
someone else to pick up the each head of

965
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:02,809
lettuce and clean each at a lettuce it

966
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,250
strip off the bad leaves there's a touch

967
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:06,019
and someone else would pick it up again

968
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:08,960
and dunk each other lettuce and wash it

969
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:11,179
so we're up to three touches and then

970
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,130
someone would pick it up again and in

971
00:37:11,179 --> 00:37:16,069
wrap plastic around it or tie a band

972
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,780
around it and then someone would package

973
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,059
it put in the final packaging for the

974
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:21,530
customer and then put it into the

975
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,690
walk-in cooler so we're up to five

976
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,850
touches and then someone would take it

977
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:28,820
out of the walk-in cooler and put it in

978
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:31,339
our delivery vehicle and drive to town

979
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,470
six touches and then unload it from the

980
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,170
vehicle deliver to the customer seven

981
00:37:33,469 --> 00:37:37,699
touches okay I'm being ultra being very

982
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:40,159
specific here because it's really

983
00:37:37,699 --> 00:37:41,480
incredible how much more profitable we

984
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,940
are after we wrapped your mind around

985
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:45,409
this concept so lien would suggest using

986
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:48,050
what they call a single piece flow

987
00:37:45,409 --> 00:37:49,849
process in other words could we so we

988
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:51,769
had seven touches that added value to

989
00:37:49,849 --> 00:37:52,980
lettuce every time we touch that and

990
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:56,969
it's a gained

991
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:58,800
in value and what lien says to do is add

992
00:37:56,969 --> 00:38:01,049
as much value as possible to the product

993
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,390
in your hand before you set it down and

994
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:06,269
one way I like to word it is to harvest

995
00:38:03,389 --> 00:38:08,940
as market ready as possible and so on

996
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:12,210
the example of our lettuce our current

997
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:14,250
process is someone cuts the head and one

998
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:16,199
as the in while the lettuce is in their

999
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,329
hands they strip the bad leaves off the

1000
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:19,829
lettuce and then they dunk it in a

1001
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:22,259
bucket of water that they've taken out

1002
00:38:19,829 --> 00:38:24,360
to the field with them it's still in

1003
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:26,100
their hand and then they give it a

1004
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,110
little shake and they'll tie a twisty or

1005
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:30,179
wrapping plastic out in the field and

1006
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:32,610
then they put it in the final container

1007
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:35,879
going to the customer out in the field

1008
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:37,320
we have I we have what I can set up so

1009
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:39,329
that final containers aren't you know

1010
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,640
touching the ground in their harvesting

1011
00:38:39,329 --> 00:38:43,019
and placing it in the container and so

1012
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:45,000
we've got we're just down to we're just

1013
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,259
still on our first touch we haven't set

1014
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,300
down the head of lettuce and yet we've

1015
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:51,510
added volume for different process these

1016
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:54,060
and then the person we've stopped

1017
00:38:51,510 --> 00:38:57,060
actually using a walk-in cooler instead

1018
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:59,340
we back up a refrigerated delivery

1019
00:38:57,059 --> 00:39:01,139
vehicle to the location the item is

1020
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,670
harvested and we're going to load it

1021
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:04,710
directly in a refrigerated delivery

1022
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:07,530
vehicle and within an hour it's off to

1023
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,820
our customers okay and so one of the

1024
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:10,320
reasons we want to get rid of the

1025
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,390
walk-in cooler was motion waste because

1026
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,680
there's a there's the extra motion of

1027
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:16,230
putting it in the cooler and taking it

1028
00:39:13,679 --> 00:39:17,759
out of the cooler it's two touches so

1029
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,349
for most of our crops we're getting away

1030
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,320
with three or four touches instead of

1031
00:39:19,349 --> 00:39:24,239
seven or eight touches and it actually

1032
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,920
has increased your profits by almost

1033
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,079
twice as much because we're spending

1034
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,930
half the amount of effort it doesn't

1035
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,449
sound like a big change when you when

1036
00:39:30,929 --> 00:39:36,750
you list it out it sounds so stupidly

1037
00:39:33,449 --> 00:39:38,849
simple stupidly simple and yet it does

1038
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,510
small changes like that make us such a

1039
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,739
big difference

1040
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,720
yeah and over the course of the year

1041
00:39:40,739 --> 00:39:45,839
we're talking hours and hours of savings

1042
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:48,509
in time uh-huh you use the example I

1043
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,789
believe in your talk of putting a letter

1044
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:53,610
together a folding ceiling an envelope

1045
00:39:50,789 --> 00:39:55,139
and in my mind when you mentioned it my

1046
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:56,700
first thought was well you'd have three

1047
00:39:55,139 --> 00:39:58,139
people and the first person would put

1048
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:59,549
the letter in and hand it to the next

1049
00:39:58,139 --> 00:40:02,670
put it down the next person would pick

1050
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,370
it up and seal the envelope with with

1051
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,809
water or lick the lick the adhesive and

1052
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,190
then put it down the last person would

1053
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:08,630
put the

1054
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,059
stamp on and that would be the fastest

1055
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:12,920
way but it's actually way more efficient

1056
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:15,670
for one person to do all three of those

1057
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:17,838
steps without sending the letter down

1058
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,420
absolutely and I've done that when I

1059
00:40:17,838 --> 00:40:22,429
have when I have enough time with groups

1060
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,170
I'll have a I have one person come out

1061
00:40:22,429 --> 00:40:26,358
front and do the single piece flow

1062
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:28,099
process with the letter and then I'll

1063
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:30,259
have someone come up and do a batch of Q

1064
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:31,760
system which would be that where you you

1065
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,050
know fold a hundred letters and then you

1066
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:36,200
stuff a hundred letters and then you

1067
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:38,539
stamp 100 letters and it's amazing how I

1068
00:40:36,199 --> 00:40:41,299
have never that the single piece flow

1069
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:42,949
people are consistently at least twice

1070
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,039
as quick as the batching queue people

1071
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:47,210
and yet it's counterintuitive we think

1072
00:40:46,039 --> 00:40:49,190
that it's more efficient to work in

1073
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:51,199
large batches but it's actually it

1074
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,700
actually isn't yeah and I think it's

1075
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:54,500
better for the employee because it's

1076
00:40:52,699 --> 00:40:56,779
more interesting to do multiple steps

1077
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:59,449
and I think it also reduces the amount

1078
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,490
of fatigue or risk of injury because you

1079
00:40:59,449 --> 00:41:03,618
are moving around more and you're not

1080
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:05,389
doing just the same repetitive motion at

1081
00:41:03,619 --> 00:41:07,338
least as a repetitive so there's a ton

1082
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:10,159
of benefits to it and I love that idea

1083
00:41:07,338 --> 00:41:12,500
you also under minimize moves you talked

1084
00:41:10,159 --> 00:41:14,299
about spaghetti diagrams and drawing up

1085
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:17,329
a picture of everywhere that you walk in

1086
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:18,099
a given space doing a task can you touch

1087
00:41:17,329 --> 00:41:20,450
on that real quick

1088
00:41:18,099 --> 00:41:22,550
yeah so this is another very simple

1089
00:41:20,449 --> 00:41:24,500
technique that farm can use to quickly

1090
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:28,068
shave a bunch of muda off your process

1091
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:29,568
and and so what you do is pick that one

1092
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,639
or two hours when you're the busiest

1093
00:41:29,568 --> 00:41:33,920
when there's most motion happening and

1094
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:36,259
then have someone stand in a corner of

1095
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,659
the room or you know on a balcony where

1096
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:40,460
they can oversee the whole farm and just

1097
00:41:38,659 --> 00:41:42,858
have a blank sheet of paper and just

1098
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:44,690
trace motion when did people move and

1099
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:47,088
wind it a product move when was there

1100
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:48,800
motion on the farm and after about 45

1101
00:41:47,088 --> 00:41:51,588
minutes or an hour its kind of look like

1102
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,300
a plate of spaghetti noodles and then

1103
00:41:51,588 --> 00:41:56,568
what you can do is have everyone huddle

1104
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:59,329
around and ask three questions of that

1105
00:41:56,568 --> 00:42:02,710
plate of spaghetti noodles number one is

1106
00:41:59,329 --> 00:42:05,480
how could we have shortened some noodles

1107
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,970
number two how could we have

1108
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:11,088
straightened some noodles if you see

1109
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:13,578
curves and the third is how could we

1110
00:42:11,088 --> 00:42:15,108
have eliminated some noodles and ideally

1111
00:42:13,579 --> 00:42:17,240
you eliminate a bunch of noodles and we

1112
00:42:15,108 --> 00:42:19,670
use this process we're actually setting

1113
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:20,969
up a new farm right now and we use

1114
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:23,608
spaghetti diagrams to

1115
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:26,879
I'll define where buildings should be it

1116
00:42:23,608 --> 00:42:28,889
helps set up our processing area so we

1117
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,700
did several rounds of pretend to

1118
00:42:28,889 --> 00:42:33,809
harvesting head lettuce for instance and

1119
00:42:31,699 --> 00:42:35,819
determine the shortest routes for the

1120
00:42:33,809 --> 00:42:38,489
head lettuce the straightest lines and

1121
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,910
what actually ultimately led us to is to

1122
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:43,858
build one large building a home in which

1123
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:47,848
we have our house or processing area

1124
00:42:43,858 --> 00:42:50,929
garages storing your storage area a

1125
00:42:47,849 --> 00:42:53,609
potting shed we got a bunch of functions

1126
00:42:50,929 --> 00:42:55,858
that are in one building to eliminate a

1127
00:42:53,608 --> 00:42:57,420
bunch of noodles and then that we kept

1128
00:42:55,858 --> 00:42:59,069
our growing areas very close to the

1129
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,720
processing area so there's there's

1130
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:03,090
there's we've eliminated as many lines

1131
00:43:00,719 --> 00:43:06,239
as work as possible now there's more

1132
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:07,470
types of muda and tools for reducing

1133
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:08,549
them I don't want to give away

1134
00:43:07,469 --> 00:43:10,500
everything in the book because I think

1135
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:13,109
it's important to visualize it and read

1136
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,429
it so I want to keep this moving along

1137
00:43:13,108 --> 00:43:16,549
since I know we have a little bit amount

1138
00:43:14,429 --> 00:43:19,739
of time can we talk a little bit about

1139
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:22,320
the idea of continuous improvement how

1140
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:23,399
this process never really ends for you

1141
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,470
and what that looks like

1142
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:27,990
uh-huh yeah and especially when it comes

1143
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:31,139
this is a little bit heretical with

1144
00:43:27,989 --> 00:43:32,669
farming nearly every farm book you read

1145
00:43:31,139 --> 00:43:35,159
our video course or whatever everyone

1146
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:36,838
thinks they figured it out they figured

1147
00:43:35,159 --> 00:43:38,909
out the best way to make compost or the

1148
00:43:36,838 --> 00:43:40,529
best way to grow tomatoes or whatever

1149
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,348
and they are going to sell you all their

1150
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:45,240
secrets and I actually don't I am my

1151
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:47,910
second book gives you all of our

1152
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,679
production secrets it tells you where

1153
00:43:47,909 --> 00:43:50,909
we're at in the lean process with with

1154
00:43:49,679 --> 00:43:53,969
producing tomatoes and peppers and

1155
00:43:50,909 --> 00:43:55,529
everything else however at the point is

1156
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,539
just to give you inspiration for your

1157
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,970
own lean thinking because there never is

1158
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:01,858
a perfect perfect way to do something

1159
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:03,868
it's always about continuously improving

1160
00:44:01,858 --> 00:44:06,029
your process there's always a better way

1161
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:09,030
to do something though let phrase they

1162
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:11,310
use in lean is no problem is a problem

1163
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:14,550
if you think you have no problems then

1164
00:44:11,309 --> 00:44:17,789
that's that's your problem anyhow so

1165
00:44:14,550 --> 00:44:19,440
essentially what you essentially what

1166
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:22,079
continuous improvement or Kaizen means

1167
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:24,179
is you perform the first three steps the

1168
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,608
lean system with more precision every

1169
00:44:24,179 --> 00:44:28,500
year and so you get more decluttered

1170
00:44:26,608 --> 00:44:30,420
every year so the first step is out 5s

1171
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:32,309
and orgonite so you get more organized

1172
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,108
every year get more junk off the

1173
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,829
property and then number two you get

1174
00:44:34,108 --> 00:44:36,659
more

1175
00:44:34,829 --> 00:44:38,610
I see identify value from your customers

1176
00:44:36,659 --> 00:44:41,579
every year you get to know them deeper

1177
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:45,539
and you deliver more value to them every

1178
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:46,889
year and then third is you with mutas

1179
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:48,960
you'd get rid of even more of the

1180
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:50,190
Buddha's every year there's over

1181
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:52,289
production waste waiting lease

1182
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,079
transportation waste over processing

1183
00:44:52,289 --> 00:44:57,840
inventory waste there's always going to

1184
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:59,699
be muda in your operation and every year

1185
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:02,610
you just [ __ ] a little bit more off of

1186
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:04,469
your farm so I like this sculpture

1187
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:06,840
analogy it's my favorite analogy for

1188
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:09,209
lean is that you're it's like your farm

1189
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:11,730
is a big log and every year you choose a

1190
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:14,159
little more waste off the farm until you

1191
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,929
have a very beautiful sculpture that's

1192
00:45:14,159 --> 00:45:18,779
pure value you've chiseled all the way

1193
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:21,179
stuff but and you just keep keep honing

1194
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,810
it and polishing it yeah I remember you

1195
00:45:21,179 --> 00:45:25,919
mentioning that even at Toyota they had

1196
00:45:23,809 --> 00:45:29,369
they had managers that got in trouble

1197
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:30,960
because they weren't changing and

1198
00:45:29,369 --> 00:45:33,029
updating the standards consistent

1199
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:35,400
constantly they weren't continually

1200
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:36,900
looking with a really fine eye to be

1201
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,720
improving the process so this is a

1202
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:40,769
never-ending process of improvement like

1203
00:45:39,719 --> 00:45:43,199
you mentioned I think that's an

1204
00:45:40,769 --> 00:45:44,579
important factor there yeah or they used

1205
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,339
to mandate that once a month the

1206
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:49,889
processes had to change at some some way

1207
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,470
so they mandated change mandated

1208
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:55,139
continuous improve but yeah I think

1209
00:45:52,469 --> 00:45:57,539
that's great and can we talk a little

1210
00:45:55,139 --> 00:45:59,480
bit about how this lean process affects

1211
00:45:57,539 --> 00:46:04,050
your staff in the morale around the farm

1212
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:06,300
uh-huh sure I what the thing with a

1213
00:46:04,050 --> 00:46:08,280
Kaizen or continuous improvement is it's

1214
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:11,310
often you want it to be an all staff

1215
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:13,080
project and the reason is your workers

1216
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:15,989
are as close to the waste or sometimes

1217
00:46:13,079 --> 00:46:17,400
closer to the waste as you are and so

1218
00:46:15,989 --> 00:46:19,409
there's no reason-- about that to not

1219
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,440
let them help you root out the waste and

1220
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:24,449
what TG Ono at Toyota helped design lean

1221
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:26,369
systems Yoda uses he used to say that

1222
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:29,429
workers come to Toyota to think not to

1223
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:32,190
build cars okay just think about that

1224
00:46:29,429 --> 00:46:33,989
they're in a manufacturing plant you're

1225
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:35,579
often repeating tasks over and over

1226
00:46:33,989 --> 00:46:39,299
again but he said ultimately people come

1227
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:40,739
here to think not to build cars and so

1228
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:42,930
what it means is that you have engaged

1229
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:46,429
staff people who are not just picking

1230
00:46:42,929 --> 00:46:48,719
tomatoes or stuffing envelopes

1231
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:51,029
what they are doing is thinking

1232
00:46:48,719 --> 00:46:54,029
they're working and what we do is we

1233
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:55,920
keep a list of the waste list of the

1234
00:46:54,030 --> 00:46:58,590
mood is in the center of our processing

1235
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,240
area and we instruct our workers we say

1236
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,710
hey we want you if you see one of these

1237
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,319
types of ways we want to be the first

1238
00:47:01,710 --> 00:47:06,000
ones to hear it we encourage them to

1239
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:07,530
kind of ruffle her feathers and to think

1240
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,409
of a better better ways of doing things

1241
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:12,180
which is countercultural and our culture

1242
00:47:10,409 --> 00:47:14,489
workers are trained and specially in

1243
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:17,489
agriculture to just go out and pick and

1244
00:47:14,489 --> 00:47:19,529
there they're not thought of as as

1245
00:47:17,489 --> 00:47:21,509
managers and everyone should take some

1246
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:23,460
management responsibility to make the

1247
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:24,810
process more efficient yeah I think

1248
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,000
that's great and it gives people more

1249
00:47:24,809 --> 00:47:29,219
ownership a feeling of ownership of

1250
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,780
their space and their job and what

1251
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:32,819
they're doing and the importance of it I

1252
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,140
think it for us I'm finding it's

1253
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,760
improving morale because people are

1254
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:37,348
excited to see these changes as we're

1255
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,840
making them around our property ok

1256
00:47:37,349 --> 00:47:42,690
and awesome one thing I wanted to touch

1257
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:44,340
on because most of the people that are

1258
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,950
listening to this that are cultivating

1259
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:49,260
that are doing it commercially so this

1260
00:47:46,949 --> 00:47:51,179
is their business it's much easier to

1261
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:53,220
cut costs than to grow your profit

1262
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:56,669
margin so like you mentioned it's a lot

1263
00:47:53,219 --> 00:47:59,848
easier to reduce a thousand dollars

1264
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:03,059
worth of expenses than it is to sell two

1265
00:47:59,849 --> 00:48:04,890
thousand dollars worth of new product so

1266
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:06,088
you can maintain your sales which i

1267
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:07,588
think is something you said you've done

1268
00:48:06,088 --> 00:48:09,570
over the years is maintain your sales

1269
00:48:07,588 --> 00:48:10,920
level but reduced your expenses and then

1270
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:13,289
that's all money in your pocket

1271
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,269
sure so to grow more up to Bruce more

1272
00:48:13,289 --> 00:48:16,858
product involves muda we're going to

1273
00:48:15,269 --> 00:48:19,409
have the mood of construction of another

1274
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:21,389
greenhouse or mill at creasing that your

1275
00:48:19,409 --> 00:48:24,239
infrastructure for growing system you're

1276
00:48:21,389 --> 00:48:25,799
going to have the muda of training new

1277
00:48:24,239 --> 00:48:29,368
workers there's just a lot of effort

1278
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:31,589
that goes into producing more and you

1279
00:48:29,369 --> 00:48:34,588
can grow your business also by trimming

1280
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:36,239
out costs and wastes and then you don't

1281
00:48:34,588 --> 00:48:39,119
have to deal with all those mutas you

1282
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:42,449
can just save money and add your

1283
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:44,460
bottom-line so at the very simple secret

1284
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:47,699
of our farm is that we've been making

1285
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:52,050
we've been a grossing six figures for a

1286
00:48:47,699 --> 00:48:54,929
while however we haven't always I netted

1287
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:57,630
a whole lot so we had started to do is

1288
00:48:54,929 --> 00:49:00,509
every year we print out an expense

1289
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:02,160
lecture and we say we ask the question

1290
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:04,769
hey where's the five percent

1291
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,929
in others how could we trim 5% off of

1292
00:49:04,768 --> 00:49:09,209
our expense ledger and still produce

1293
00:49:06,929 --> 00:49:11,759
this same or more next year and who

1294
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:15,028
couldn't you know scour the expansion

1295
00:49:11,759 --> 00:49:16,920
ledger and come up with 5% and so if you

1296
00:49:15,028 --> 00:49:18,599
do this over a course of ten years which

1297
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:21,358
we have then you grow your business by

1298
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:23,789
50% which is a very respectable rate of

1299
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:26,818
growth you grow your net profit by that

1300
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:29,609
much and you didn't have to produce more

1301
00:49:26,818 --> 00:49:32,788
in the process and so as pure Girish

1302
00:49:29,608 --> 00:49:34,528
pure profit and I think that at some

1303
00:49:32,789 --> 00:49:36,599
point all businesses need new customer

1304
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:39,599
need more customers need to expand it

1305
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:42,298
just has become it becomes a it becomes

1306
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:43,710
an addiction in our culture and there's

1307
00:49:42,298 --> 00:49:45,480
another way to grow a business which is

1308
00:49:43,710 --> 00:49:49,019
to cut out the Muto's and get more

1309
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:50,969
precise on adding value it is to so

1310
00:49:49,018 --> 00:49:52,618
every year we try to replace low profit

1311
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:55,230
items with higher profit items and and

1312
00:49:52,619 --> 00:49:57,480
give our customers more value so that I

1313
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:59,159
so that our we charge more for our

1314
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:01,079
products and we're getting more from our

1315
00:49:59,159 --> 00:50:02,848
customers for the same amount of effort

1316
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:04,829
yeah that's a great point

1317
00:50:02,849 --> 00:50:06,630
one concrete example for me was also

1318
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:08,430
working with the people that we buy

1319
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,740
things from or that we work with so for

1320
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:12,808
me changing or renegotiating my merchant

1321
00:50:10,739 --> 00:50:14,459
service rate on credit cards made a

1322
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:16,950
difference of almost fifteen thousand

1323
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:18,809
dollars in a year and you know that's

1324
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:21,268
money that I get to put back towards the

1325
00:50:18,809 --> 00:50:24,079
farm towards my employees not into the

1326
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:26,219
pocket of a merchant service provider so

1327
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:28,109
expenses are huge and I think that's one

1328
00:50:26,219 --> 00:50:29,879
place that we need to look at it and I

1329
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:32,400
love how thoughtful you are before you

1330
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:34,099
make a change on your farm because a lot

1331
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,358
of times we're running around so crazy

1332
00:50:34,099 --> 00:50:38,220
we don't we don't take the time to

1333
00:50:36,358 --> 00:50:40,650
really give thought to the process or

1334
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:42,298
even to buying a new tool or a new piece

1335
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:44,250
of equipment we just are constantly

1336
00:50:42,298 --> 00:50:46,768
trying to move forward without

1337
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:49,199
evaluating do we need this is this the

1338
00:50:46,768 --> 00:50:50,639
best tool for the job is this adding the

1339
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,588
value all the questions that you're

1340
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:56,278
asking in your book are just so

1341
00:50:52,588 --> 00:50:57,239
important now one thing you mentioned at

1342
00:50:56,278 --> 00:51:01,409
the end the book that I think is

1343
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:03,778
interesting is that lean is a style of a

1344
00:51:01,409 --> 00:51:06,149
style of cultivation or an attitude

1345
00:51:03,778 --> 00:51:08,400
towards farming but it can be taken too

1346
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,838
far can you can you talk a little about

1347
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,440
what that looks like and what you meant

1348
00:51:09,838 --> 00:51:15,150
in that section well I think in

1349
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,829
particular like let's say you're getting

1350
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:18,470
your

1351
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:23,480
you're an animal you're your protein

1352
00:51:18,469 --> 00:51:25,579
producer you you raise animals and I so

1353
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,059
what one of the core tenets of lean is

1354
00:51:25,579 --> 00:51:30,590
you want to maximize your fixed cost and

1355
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:32,989
so fixed costs for me would be a

1356
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:35,630
greenhouse or processing a fixed cost

1357
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:38,809
for a hog producer B be a hog house and

1358
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,160
and so what lean would suggest is that

1359
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:43,699
you want to stuff as many hogs as

1360
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:46,309
possible and into the hog house and I've

1361
00:51:43,699 --> 00:51:50,449
seen lean use this way in agriculture

1362
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:52,009
and with milk production and you want to

1363
00:51:50,449 --> 00:51:53,929
get as many gallons of milk as that

1364
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:55,310
animal as possible and you're going to

1365
00:51:53,929 --> 00:51:57,500
maximize the investment you have in the

1366
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:59,239
animal and I think there are just some

1367
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,570
ethical considerations you need to use

1368
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:05,599
and in farming if you're going to use

1369
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:08,059
the lean system and I would also suggest

1370
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,730
that farmers who try to stuff as many

1371
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:14,150
hogs as pasta another hog house are not

1372
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:15,889
probably applying a value analysis as

1373
00:52:14,150 --> 00:52:17,150
lean would suggest they should in other

1374
00:52:15,889 --> 00:52:18,949
words how are they act are their

1375
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:20,720
customers actually wanting them to do

1376
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:23,089
that is that the process their customers

1377
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:24,529
want and lean says like I said start

1378
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:28,070
with a customer work backwards from the

1379
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:33,110
customer and so that be one one example

1380
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:35,809
and on with food for with vegetable or

1381
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:38,780
grain crop producers I think there are

1382
00:52:35,809 --> 00:52:40,880
all kinds of ways to I use more fossil

1383
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:42,920
fuels on our farms to increase

1384
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,390
production and again I think we have to

1385
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:46,369
ask is this what our customers are

1386
00:52:44,389 --> 00:52:47,239
wanting this is what our the process our

1387
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:50,089
community wants

1388
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:52,250
anyhow you can't take lean too far on in

1389
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:54,500
an agricultural context I totally agree

1390
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:56,630
in fact an example of this on our end

1391
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:59,059
would be you know choosing where we

1392
00:52:56,630 --> 00:53:00,650
source the ingredients that we put into

1393
00:52:59,059 --> 00:53:03,590
our soils for example because we

1394
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:05,150
manufacture soils and knowing to me I

1395
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:06,800
know our customers value using

1396
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,960
high-quality ingredients so if I were to

1397
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,870
go out and source a cheaper ingredient

1398
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,130
in that mix it wouldn't be providing

1399
00:53:11,869 --> 00:53:15,710
value even though it would be lowering

1400
00:53:13,130 --> 00:53:18,110
my expenses because it might lower the

1401
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:19,429
quality of my actual product so it's

1402
00:53:18,110 --> 00:53:20,930
really important to look at that and

1403
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:22,819
like you mentioned ethics is so

1404
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:24,079
important here we're you know we're

1405
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:25,460
trying to protect the environment we're

1406
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:28,009
trying to come up with sustainable

1407
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:29,630
methods and conventional agriculture

1408
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:31,099
isn't necessarily all that

1409
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:33,230
sustainable and I think that's where it

1410
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:35,900
falls down in relation to lean

1411
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:38,179
manufacturing concepts

1412
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:42,950
uh yeah cost-cutting is not necessarily

1413
00:53:38,179 --> 00:53:44,989
lean cost-cutting can be very unli if

1414
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:46,759
it's not the type of does not if it

1415
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,808
doesn't secure your cut business in the

1416
00:53:46,759 --> 00:53:50,599
direction where your customers are

1417
00:53:47,809 --> 00:53:53,359
winning yeah so the last question I had

1418
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:55,278
for you was as I mentioned to you this

1419
00:53:53,358 --> 00:53:57,469
is a cannabis cultivation show and I

1420
00:53:55,278 --> 00:53:59,000
know you're not able to cultivate

1421
00:53:57,469 --> 00:54:00,828
cannabis but there is anything you'd

1422
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,619
like to add or touch on on the topic

1423
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:05,599
before we sign off for the day I would

1424
00:54:03,619 --> 00:54:07,490
say that it be great if Indiana would

1425
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,740
and actually we've been working on it

1426
00:54:07,489 --> 00:54:11,508
and Indiana is they're talking about

1427
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:14,719
some legislation now that would make

1428
00:54:11,509 --> 00:54:18,579
medical marijuana available but I think

1429
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:20,778
that the process that lean system is a

1430
00:54:18,579 --> 00:54:23,660
universe saying you lean system is a

1431
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:28,699
universal system in that the types of

1432
00:54:23,659 --> 00:54:31,098
wastes are Preval and so there's no

1433
00:54:28,699 --> 00:54:34,159
reason you can't use lean with and even

1434
00:54:31,099 --> 00:54:37,278
if you grow one marijuana plant or if

1435
00:54:34,159 --> 00:54:38,808
you have tens of thousands of plants the

1436
00:54:37,278 --> 00:54:40,548
lean system is applicable no matter what

1437
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:43,009
size business you have how many workers

1438
00:54:40,548 --> 00:54:44,420
you have or who your customer is there's

1439
00:54:43,009 --> 00:54:46,219
something you can gain from and you can

1440
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,389
become more profitable and you can

1441
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:50,179
create a more pleasant work environment

1442
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:52,368
first oh yeah I think it's so important

1443
00:54:50,179 --> 00:54:53,929
because we want to spend our time doing

1444
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:55,730
other things like this allows you more

1445
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:58,429
free time to spend with your family and

1446
00:54:55,730 --> 00:55:00,469
more time to spend doing things that you

1447
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:02,480
want to be doing not that you don't love

1448
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:04,489
your work but finding ways to reduce

1449
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:07,159
your expenses increase your bottom line

1450
00:55:04,489 --> 00:55:09,108
and make yourself make your life more

1451
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:12,710
efficient I think is a win all around so

1452
00:55:09,108 --> 00:55:14,808
I just wanted to say again Ben has two

1453
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:18,259
books out I'll put links to both of them

1454
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:20,750
on the podcast page and as well as some

1455
00:55:18,259 --> 00:55:22,009
photos and other things but I highly

1456
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,929
recommend people check out your books

1457
00:55:22,009 --> 00:55:25,880
and I really appreciate you taking the

1458
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:28,759
time today to come on the podcast and

1459
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:31,960
chat with me about lean farming hey

1460
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:31,960
thanks thanks for having me

1461
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:40,599
that was Ben Hartman author of the lean

1462
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,879
farm and the lean farm guide to growing

1463
00:55:40,599 --> 00:55:44,440
vegetables I can't recommend his books

1464
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,510
enough and I hope listeners will

1465
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:48,460
