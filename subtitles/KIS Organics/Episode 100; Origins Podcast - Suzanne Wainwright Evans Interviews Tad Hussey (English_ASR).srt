where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

7
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,118
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:28,018 --> 00:00:31,618
and drawing top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:33,539
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:31,618 --> 00:00:35,399
knowledge this episode is a bit

11
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:37,679
different I didn't know what to do for

12
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,120
our 100th episode and my friend Suzanne

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,159
who you all know as the bug lady

14
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:42,899
convinced me to let her flip the tables

15
00:00:41,159 --> 00:00:45,419
and interview me to share a bit more

16
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:47,399
about myself how this podcast came to be

17
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,840
and some of what I've learned from my

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:50,939
amazing guests I've had the privilege of

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,039
interviewing over the past four years

20
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:54,359
when I first started the podcast I

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,280
really didn't know if anyone would tune

22
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,558
in to listen as of writing this

23
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,420
introduction we are at almost 2 million

24
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,399
unique downloads of the podcast since we

25
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,840
launched I'm grateful to all the folks

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,579
who have reached out and shared their

27
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,260
success stories or how something they

28
00:01:05,579 --> 00:01:08,938
learned on the podcast has improved

29
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,200
their growing that's really what this is

30
00:01:08,938 --> 00:01:12,179
all about

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,859
since the beginning I've avoided ads and

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,200
sponsors because I wanted to keep the

33
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:18,000

00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:40,740
I'm super excited to be here with you

43
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:43,920
Tad for this hundredth episode because I

44
00:01:40,739 --> 00:01:46,379
absolutely love your podcast and I have

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,219
to say I did nagtat about this a little

46
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:50,039
bit

47
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:52,019
um because he wasn't exactly keen on

48
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,579
doing this at first but I really thought

49
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:57,000
people would be interested in learning

50
00:01:53,578 --> 00:02:01,019
more about you because I think you're a

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,299
super interesting and I I would I would

52
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:05,218
put you in the old souls category of

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:07,920
people that I know

54
00:02:05,218 --> 00:02:10,919
um I feel you're a very genuine kind

55
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,318
human being and I'm thrilled to call you

56
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:15,719
a friend and I just think the world

57
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:17,759
would want to know more about you

58
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,560
well that's a very nice introduction

59
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,500
Suzanne thank you

60
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
um yeah this was your idea and wanted to

61
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,759
do something different for the hundreds

62
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:28,079
so uh yeah let's let's go for it see how

63
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:30,359
it goes all right

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,519
so yes so I'm not going to ask you

65
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,980
anything too crazy

66
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:37,680
um but we all know you is kind of like

67
00:02:34,979 --> 00:02:39,840
the soils guy but uh did you actually go

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,000
to school for this or did you do

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,719
something different first

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,580
so I I did not I grew up with my parents

71
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:49,919
owning a Nursery and Landscaping

72
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,719
business so been around plants my entire

73
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:55,619
life I was not interested in Plants

74
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:57,919
until later in life I got my undergrad

75
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,599
degree at the University of Washington

76
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:03,119
after transferring from Gonzaga with a

77
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:06,000
degree in anthropology and the minor in

78
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,580
English and then I went on and got a

79
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,400
master's degree in at Macquarie

80
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,599
University in Australia in special

81
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,420
education

82
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:17,399
and so I don't really have any degrees

83
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:19,679
related to Horticulture or agriculture

84
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:22,140
it's all been sort of self-taught

85
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,300
through the industry and breeding and

86
00:03:22,139 --> 00:03:26,639
and things like that but I will say that

87
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,260
having a master's degree was really

88
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:30,958
really helpful in learning how to read

89
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:33,840
and understand uh scientific journals

90
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,719
and and the statistics and what research

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,239
is actually saying

92
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:42,840
well I think understanding education and

93
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,878
how to teach also has made you able to

94
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,799
teach people and you know this is what

95
00:03:44,878 --> 00:03:49,219
you're doing through your podcast and

96
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,260
through talks you give and conversations

97
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:54,000
is you are teaching people and being

98
00:03:52,259 --> 00:03:56,219
able to communicate that valuable

99
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,500
information is super important because

100
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,199
people can be super smart but if you

101
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:04,938
can't communicate it it makes it very

102
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,079
challenging to get that information out

103
00:04:04,938 --> 00:04:09,598
you know I just feel lucky that I have

104
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,340
this platform that allows me to get some

105
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:14,158
really great guests that are you know

106
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,840
amazing experts in their field and uh I

107
00:04:14,158 --> 00:04:18,298
just get to ask them the questions that

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,220
I think hopefully every grower is

109
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:21,599
thinking is the person's talking those

110
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:24,300
are the kind of questions that I want to

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,400
try and pull out of them and make this

112
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,360
information more accessible so that's

113
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,359
really the goal of the podcast

114
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:34,019
well okay so you graduate you know

115
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:38,099
you're thinking you're probably going to

116
00:04:34,019 --> 00:04:39,599
be a teacher but when I meet you you're

117
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,419
a soils guy how did you get from

118
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,960
thinking about being an educator into

119
00:04:42,418 --> 00:04:47,219
soils

120
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:49,439
see I haven't heard your questions so

121
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,000
this is all um I didn't know where this

122
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:54,180
interview was going

123
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,939
um yeah so basically I came back with a

124
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:58,379
special ed degree and wasn't able to use

125
00:04:56,939 --> 00:05:01,199
it in the United States without going

126
00:04:58,379 --> 00:05:02,339
back to school and frankly that's a it's

127
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,960
a really tough career I worked in

128
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,758
special education for a while and it's

129
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:07,379
it's really easy to get burned out it's

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,759
it's exhausting

131
00:05:07,379 --> 00:05:10,978
um very important I have a lot of

132
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:13,199
respect for people who do it

133
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:14,819
um but at the time my parents were

134
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,120
shutting down their Nursery their plant

135
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:21,240
nursery and my dad had started a compost

136
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,199
tea business and so at that point

137
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,120
um

138
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:25,680
I was looking for jobs in other fields

139
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,120
and I wasn't having much success finding

140
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,639
something I enjoyed I was actually

141
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,500
working at Red Robin as a server for

142
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:34,199
quite a while

143
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,819
and then I got involved with my dad's

144
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,740
business and I started learning all

145
00:05:35,819 --> 00:05:40,019
about what he was doing with compost tea

146
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:43,918
and the really interesting part for me

147
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:45,659
was the microscopy and the micro the

148
00:05:43,918 --> 00:05:47,279
microbes and that sort of thing and so I

149
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:49,199
started learning more about that and it

150
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:50,939
just kind of kept expanding into soils

151
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,259
and minerals and

152
00:05:50,939 --> 00:05:58,680
you know other aspects of I guess

153
00:05:54,259 --> 00:06:03,900
fertility around around plants

154
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:06,240
so how long have you had uh your company

155
00:06:03,899 --> 00:06:09,659
well I didn't officially own it until

156
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:13,879
about two years ago I've been running it

157
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:17,880
since oh boy

158
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:20,038
2006 I would say uh so quite a while but

159
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:22,560
my parents owned it up until a couple

160
00:06:20,038 --> 00:06:25,259
years ago when um

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,720
they finally sold it to me but the whole

162
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,220
time we had the farm and starting kiss

163
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,139
Organics and everything

164
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,620
um I was running the business but my

165
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:36,360
parents officially owned it

166
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,800
well that's that's a nice transition

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,879
because

168
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,919
um it's always nice to have like a

169
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,719
legacy to pass on to your children

170
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,159
because you see sometimes great

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,440
businesses and the children aren't

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:48,240
interested and the businesses end up

173
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:50,399
folding and you I always feel like we're

174
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,800
losing a piece of History so that makes

175
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:55,978
me very happy that you know it's able to

176
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,199
continue on for another generation and

177
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:59,939
you're doing such a a great job with it

178
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:01,860
so

179
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:04,680
um but like with your customer base

180
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:07,680
who's your furthest customer to you guys

181
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:10,319
ship to or work with

182
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,180
uh you know currently we work with some

183
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,580
people in Maine that seems pretty far

184
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:16,560
away from us here in Washington State uh

185
00:07:14,579 --> 00:07:20,399
one of our largest customers for a while

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,660
was in Puerto Rico until Freight got too

187
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:24,120
ridiculous

188
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,860
um to be able to ship to them but um

189
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,319
yeah we work with people all around all

190
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,598
around the country ideally we try to

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,120
find people more locally to work with

192
00:07:30,598 --> 00:07:35,038
just because of the you know the

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,899
sustainability of shipping material

194
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:39,478
around the country

195
00:07:36,899 --> 00:07:41,638
um but yeah I guess I guess all over

196
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:43,800
really

197
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,720
have you had a customer that the

198
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,379
situation you deal with they're dealing

199
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,740
with

200
00:07:46,379 --> 00:07:52,319
um was exceptionally challenging and it

201
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:54,960
it your guys were able to like finally

202
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,180
come to a resolution to to help them out

203
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:59,219
because I I know I run into some really

204
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:01,079
challenging problems it's always very

205
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,900
satisfying at the end of the day when

206
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:06,240
you can help them

207
00:08:03,899 --> 00:08:07,198
yeah actually you know one of those

208
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,019
people

209
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,220
um so we do we do some Consulting on the

210
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:13,740
side in fact

211
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,139
um and one of them originally was a

212
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,819
Consulting agreement was with Mike over

213
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:19,800
at maincraft cannabis

214
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:22,080
and he was dealing with a lot of these

215
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,579
challenges we finally were able to sort

216
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:24,120
some things out

217
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,219
um

218
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,959
and and come to a resolution to where

219
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,599
now if you go check out his page you can

220
00:08:27,959 --> 00:08:32,598
see he's he's an excellent grower but

221
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:35,338
what he was dealing with was a starting

222
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:37,680
soil material that was excessively high

223
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,479
in nitrates and just very unbalanced and

224
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:42,299
it took us a little while to figure out

225
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:45,480
what was going on before we were able to

226
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:48,359
solve it but once we did he's just been

227
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:50,700
off and running ever since

228
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,159
yeah he's I've been up to his facility

229
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:55,259
and I will obviously I just finished up

230
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:57,299
my bag he brought me a bag of chocolate

231
00:08:55,259 --> 00:08:59,458
covered almonds from L.L bean when I saw

232
00:08:57,299 --> 00:09:00,899
him a couple weeks ago in Ohio and I

233
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:02,338
just finished him up they were tasty

234
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:04,379
thanks Mike because I know Mike's going

235
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:07,560
to listen to this yeah he's a great guy

236
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:10,559
yeah yeah he's a lot of fun

237
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:12,719
um he he really is okay so you're being

238
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:13,559
successful you're doing soils but all of

239
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,420
a sudden

240
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:17,099
how do you end up having this I don't

241
00:09:15,419 --> 00:09:18,778
want to say a media Empire but I feel

242
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,139
like you're on your way to having a

243
00:09:18,778 --> 00:09:24,480
media Empire to having this amazing

244
00:09:22,139 --> 00:09:27,059
podcast that

245
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,459
um Everybody listens to

246
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:30,899
oh man I think you're giving a little a

247
00:09:29,458 --> 00:09:32,639
little too much credit I really feel

248
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:34,139
like we're the smallest guys in the the

249
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,240
smallest fish in the pond

250
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:39,000
um the podcast has been great you know

251
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,259
and uh I'm very grateful for it but you

252
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,720
know we're we're not a large business

253
00:09:40,259 --> 00:09:44,639
there's six of us total like Kiss

254
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,920
Organics uh you know we were larger when

255
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:49,379
I had the farm and feed store and all of

256
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:51,120
that but we've really leaned down to

257
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,379
just a really a core group of awesome

258
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,459
folks

259
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:58,139
um

260
00:09:53,458 --> 00:10:00,299
so yeah we're we're really pretty small

261
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:03,059
remember I'm a company of one so you're

262
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:06,000
a big company to me so

263
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:09,119
yeah I mean we we work with we've

264
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,139
partnered with uh soil mixing facility

265
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,179
about

266
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,439
10 years ago and it's been the best

267
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:15,120
relationship

268
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,740
um they're really close to us they do an

269
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,659
awesome job

270
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:19,980
um and I love working with them but it

271
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:22,740
gives us the infrastructure and

272
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:24,539
capability to be able to mix at scale to

273
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,480
mix you know a thousand yards if we need

274
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:29,458
to uh really quickly and have control

275
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:31,620
over the operations without having all

276
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:33,719
of the info infrastructure cost of

277
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:36,419
setting up an entire facility like that

278
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,459
so they've been wonderful to work with

279
00:10:36,419 --> 00:10:41,699
and it's really allowed us to sort of

280
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:43,859
focus our energies not on the the

281
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,640
day-to-day production side but really on

282
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,139
customer service and helping folks

283
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:51,240
you know on that end of things and

284
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:52,740
really dialing in the fertility side of

285
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,659
the the science Side of Everything which

286
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:57,259
is the fun part for me

287
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:57,259
right

288
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:05,820
so the podcast was because I uh

289
00:11:03,059 --> 00:11:08,699
oh boy this was back in like

290
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,399
2008 2009 I want to say

291
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:13,800
um whenever I first met my my dear

292
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:16,078
friend Jaya Palmer uh

293
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,879
I was learning about all this stuff and

294
00:11:16,078 --> 00:11:18,739
I was having trouble finding good

295
00:11:17,879 --> 00:11:21,720
information

296
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:23,700
having come out of you know sort of that

297
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Nursery side of things and Horticulture

298
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,680
it was just so different than what I was

299
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:32,039
learning in the forums you know reading

300
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:33,719
about cannabis and the two were just so

301
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,778
completely different that I really

302
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,459
wanted to try and like marry the two in

303
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:39,899
some way and so I was like okay I wanna

304
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:42,359
I wanna eventually like write a book

305
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,179
from everything I've learned and

306
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,399
um share that information and then I

307
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:49,379
realized like as I was doing this I was

308
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,440
like I don't really want to write a book

309
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:53,519
no one reads books anymore

310
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,620
podcasts were becoming a thing and

311
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:58,139
frankly like if I did write a book I

312
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,578
didn't no I battle with imposter

313
00:11:58,139 --> 00:12:01,919
syndrome a lot you and I talked about

314
00:11:59,578 --> 00:12:03,679
this and the idea of trying like I would

315
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,059
want to have people come in and write

316
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:07,859
chapters for me because they know a

317
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:10,319
subject so much better than me

318
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,700
and as I was thinking more and more

319
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,440
about it and actually have some chapters

320
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,240
that I've written out that I've turned

321
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,360
into blogs on our uh

322
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:21,899
on our website but I was like I know

323
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,879
people like Jeff lowenfels and

324
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,458
um at the time you know clackam's code

325
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:28,439
or these people that other Growers want

326
00:12:26,458 --> 00:12:29,939
to hear from you know why not create a

327
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,800
platform where I can just interview them

328
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,839
and let them speak to what it is that

329
00:12:31,799 --> 00:12:37,019
you know they do and what people want to

330
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,000
hear about and as the podcast has grown

331
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:40,919
I've it's kind of been a lot of like

332
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,078
Word of Mouth from my

333
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,759
guests and kind of putting me in touch

334
00:12:43,078 --> 00:12:47,479
with more and more people and so it's

335
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:50,159
gotten I think more scientific

336
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,740
as I've gone along

337
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:54,958
and so you know I get Podcast requests

338
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,778
every every week from people wanting to

339
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,539
come on the podcast and I really now

340
00:12:57,778 --> 00:13:02,759
only I only take on new guests from

341
00:13:00,539 --> 00:13:04,740
people that have are like know someone

342
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:06,179
that was already a guest and and like

343
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,620
you've been one of the main people who

344
00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:09,599
have helped me in sourcing a lot of

345
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,560
these guests actually so that's been

346
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,399
great

347
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:12,899
um

348
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,360
but that's that's where it started

349
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:16,740
wanting to like kind of combine and

350
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,720
bridge the gap between you know

351
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,220
Horticulture and

352
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,200
what was going on in the Cannabis

353
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,639
industry and now there's just so much

354
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:28,100
more information out there it's a lot

355
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:28,100
easier to get access to good information

356
00:13:28,259 --> 00:13:31,439
so people ask to be on your podcast I

357
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:33,240
didn't know that was a thing because

358
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,800
I've never gone to somebody said hey I

359
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,240
want to be on your podcast I didn't know

360
00:13:34,799 --> 00:13:37,740
we were supposed to do that I thought we

361
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,680
were supposed to be asked to be on

362
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,120
podcasts well you know a lot of people

363
00:13:40,679 --> 00:13:43,919
work with marketing firms and those

364
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:46,679
marketing firms will reach out and email

365
00:13:43,919 --> 00:13:48,838
you and say hey here's my they're the

366
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,578
CEO of so-and-so and they make you know

367
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,260
rolling papers they have the highest

368
00:13:50,578 --> 00:13:53,399
best technology and rolling papers I'm

369
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,259
like this has nothing to do with

370
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:57,240
cultivation I'm not you know I'm not

371
00:13:55,259 --> 00:13:59,879
really interested but I get I get them

372
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:01,139
all the time yeah oh so I need to hire a

373
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:05,240
marketing firm for me you probably

374
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:05,240
should oh gosh

375
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:10,619
I know

376
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,839
um from hearing your amazing amazing

377
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,659
amazing talk you did a couple years ago

378
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:20,880
at the bio control conference

379
00:14:15,659 --> 00:14:25,019
um that you have worked hard to build a

380
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:27,000
various scientific platform on this and

381
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:30,000
you know I was totally Blown Away by

382
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,600
your presentation and you talking about

383
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,360
um

384
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,740
your transition on I don't want to say

385
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,659
learning science because I mean I think

386
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:39,839
you know science

387
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:42,299
um but just on becoming more of a

388
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,779
critical thinker about science

389
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:49,219
and you know with doing that are there

390
00:14:45,778 --> 00:14:52,139
things that you are doing today to help

391
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,040
improve and I mean like how do you make

392
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:55,039
yourself smarter

393
00:14:55,458 --> 00:15:00,599
well we we try to be science based we

394
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,599
try we're not perfect

395
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:05,940
um but we we really try and it I feel

396
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,920
like science is such a

397
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,660
polarizing word these days some people

398
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,519
think it's it's good some people think

399
00:15:09,659 --> 00:15:13,679
it's bad at the end of the day it's it's

400
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:15,839
agnostic like it's just this idea of

401
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:16,859
applying a way of thinking

402
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,100
um

403
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:21,959
to come to a conclusion and

404
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:24,899
um you know the thing that kills me

405
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,759
about the Cannabis industry is there's

406
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:29,159
just such a

407
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,720
there's such a mix between marketing

408
00:15:29,159 --> 00:15:33,120
hype and

409
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:36,240
science and it gets it gets very very

410
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,639
murky and it's hard to determine

411
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,000
um as a as a grower or as an end user

412
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:44,399
like what what I'm really need to grow a

413
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
healthy plant and then

414
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,100
um

415
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,559
how to go about finding those things and

416
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,540
so we we try to do that but I'll be

417
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:53,698
honest like it I mean my talk was

418
00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:55,139
basically like how to try and see

419
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:57,479
through some of the marketing hype but

420
00:15:55,139 --> 00:16:00,419
it drives me it drives me crazy when I

421
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,100
go online and see the ads or what people

422
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:04,078
are saying and the claims around some of

423
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,180
these products that I that I know are

424
00:16:04,078 --> 00:16:07,679
not accurate and yet

425
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,539
you know they're

426
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,078
they're selling millions of dollars of

427
00:16:09,539 --> 00:16:15,480
these products and it is what it is

428
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:17,519
that's probably why we get along so well

429
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,139
Tad because I feel your pain every day

430
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:22,799
on that

431
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:25,860
um now same same kind of challenges

432
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,439
um but with your podcast

433
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:30,600
um what has been like what are your

434
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:32,759
favorite episodes and favorite topics

435
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,740
that you've done

436
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:37,379
yeah well

437
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,419
there's been a lot of great ones

438
00:16:37,379 --> 00:16:41,578
um I enjoyed my interviews with you

439
00:16:39,419 --> 00:16:43,979
obviously

440
00:16:41,578 --> 00:16:45,719
um I I think learning about something

441
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,399
that I don't know a lot about which is

442
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,320
bugs I mean I'm learning I'm definitely

443
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,740
learned a lot more about insects from

444
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:54,660
talking to you uh over the years

445
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,459
and now working with biobee I'm learning

446
00:16:54,659 --> 00:16:58,319
even more I have to because

447
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,578
um now that we're you know offering bugs

448
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,800
to customers so that's been something

449
00:16:59,578 --> 00:17:03,179
and I'm not the main person on that like

450
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,859
we have Brandon who's really been

451
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:07,318
spearheading that for us and he's been

452
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:09,538
great but I'm learning more as as

453
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,798
customers are asking questions I'm

454
00:17:09,538 --> 00:17:13,019
listening in on the answers and so

455
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:15,599
that's been really great my other

456
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:17,759
favorite podcasts I I really like the

457
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:19,500
one with Dr yorum kapolenick on

458
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:23,519
mycorrhizal fungus I thought that was

459
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:25,919
fascinating my recent one with Dr Wendy

460
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:28,199
Zellner on Silicon

461
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:31,380
I've been looking for someone to explain

462
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:33,058
silicon for years and she was fabulous

463
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:35,940
um I would recommend that podcast to

464
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:39,660
everyone uh the one with like my mentor

465
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:41,700
on the Horticulture side uh Don Marshall

466
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,798
I really enjoy

467
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,919
um and just the way he looks at plants

468
00:17:43,798 --> 00:17:49,980
and then uh I did one with my good

469
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,240
friend Justin McGill Dr Ben Higgins you

470
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,759
know talking to like growers in

471
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,519
facilities those were really popular and

472
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:58,740
then lastly I just went back about two

473
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:02,819
weeks ago and re-listened to my podcast

474
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,079
with uh Jaya Palmer he passed away last

475
00:18:02,819 --> 00:18:06,538
year and

476
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:07,918
that was really hard but um being able

477
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:10,679
to hear his voice again was really

478
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,880
really special for me and so knowing

479
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:14,160
that that's preserved and people can

480
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,500
hear him that that meant a lot to me too

481
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,660
so those are my favorites

482
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:22,259
well I'm very sorry about losing your

483
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:25,140
friend I I you know it's tough sometimes

484
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:28,259
you know life's just not fair you know

485
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,820
but it's great that on that note I just

486
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:31,319
want to say you know if you have someone

487
00:18:29,819 --> 00:18:32,460
out there that's struggling with

488
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:35,519
addiction

489
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:38,700
like uh please reach out to them and and

490
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,619
and be a resource for them and realize

491
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:43,200
too that when you see people that are

492
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:45,418
you know struggling or down and out like

493
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,538
know that they're they're they're human

494
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:52,559
and they're passionate and intelligent

495
00:18:48,538 --> 00:18:54,359
and creative and loved like uh sometimes

496
00:18:52,558 --> 00:18:55,200
it's easy to just walk by and see it you

497
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:58,019
know because you see addiction

498
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,779
everywhere unfortunately these days and

499
00:18:58,019 --> 00:19:02,160
uh it's it's hard to have compassion for

500
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:04,139
that and I just

501
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,000
I just want to mention that because uh

502
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,860
Jaya was a really special guy but he was

503
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,819
very like neurodivergent and I don't

504
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,418
think

505
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:10,980
um

506
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:14,580
I don't think the world is really the

507
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,779
kindest place to him and so uh yeah I

508
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:17,279
know it's off topic but I just want to

509
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:19,740
throw that out there

510
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:22,259
well but I mean it's a good message in

511
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:24,179
today's day and age and you know what a

512
00:19:22,259 --> 00:19:26,700
great gift you have given the World by

513
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:28,980
preserving that interview with him

514
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,319
because it's preserved forever now and

515
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,759
it will be available forever out there

516
00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:35,339
so

517
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,099
this is why I like you

518
00:19:35,339 --> 00:19:40,558
he's the big reason that we have kiss

519
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:43,798
Organics in terms of the soil like heat

520
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:46,798
he came over when I was working out of

521
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:49,019
my dad's garage literally mixing soil on

522
00:19:46,798 --> 00:19:51,779
a tarp because he wanted to grab some

523
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:53,460
compost tea supplies and uh I was like

524
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:55,440
here you know take some soil back

525
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:57,360
because he was running a bottled

526
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,000
nutrient program at the time and I was

527
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:01,859
like just try it out and he came back

528
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,079
you know a couple months later telling

529
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:06,058
me how wonderful it was and from there I

530
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:09,359
was we kind of like worked together to

531
00:20:06,058 --> 00:20:10,740
try and like formulate this soil mix and

532
00:20:09,359 --> 00:20:13,918
you know try it in different size

533
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,538
containers and different methods and he

534
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,919
was the one that really pushed this all

535
00:20:15,538 --> 00:20:18,720
forward

536
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,919
um so I'm eternally grateful for him

537
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,500
like Kiss Organics probably wouldn't

538
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:27,780
exist if it weren't for Jaya

539
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,460
wow so well on a more interesting let's

540
00:20:27,779 --> 00:20:33,538
move forward

541
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:36,419
um if you could have anybody alive

542
00:20:33,538 --> 00:20:38,158
or gone you know if you wanted Thomas

543
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,259
Jefferson who would be the one person

544
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,480
your dream guest of all time to have on

545
00:20:40,259 --> 00:20:44,460
the show

546
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,220
well I've thought about this not from

547
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:48,659
that perspective but the people that I

548
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:51,058
would love to get eventually on the

549
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,740
podcast uh Paul stamets I would love to

550
00:20:51,058 --> 00:20:55,079
have him come on and talk about fungus

551
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,640
just in general I think he's so

552
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,079
fascinating

553
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,700
um I also think Michael Paulin would be

554
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:01,798
really interesting because I've read all

555
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,840
of his books and some of his things

556
00:21:01,798 --> 00:21:06,359
around plants I think is really great

557
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,519
too so those will probably be the first

558
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,199
two that come to mind

559
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,700
for me in terms of like famous people

560
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,919
that I don't have access to that I would

561
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:16,860
love to get on the podcast someday

562
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,919
yeah no both of those would be amazing

563
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,538
because I've read Michael's books too

564
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,580
which you know with all the plant

565
00:21:21,538 --> 00:21:25,980
history and everything but also Paul

566
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:27,658
salmon you know I'm you know being a

567
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,880
Star Trek fan and they have you know

568
00:21:27,659 --> 00:21:32,580
Paul Simons is now on Star Trek you know

569
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:35,760
doing the Mycelia web and how they tied

570
00:21:32,579 --> 00:21:37,079
that all in you know yeah I'm I'm a

571
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:39,298
bigger fan because of the Star Trek

572
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:41,819
tie-in now but um yeah those would be

573
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:44,639
two very interesting people to hear yeah

574
00:21:41,819 --> 00:21:47,939
so but um you know with the podcast

575
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,140
being part of social media

576
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:52,500
um because it kind of all I don't want

577
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:54,900
to say it all ties in together but you

578
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,759
know going to social media for advice on

579
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,960
growing Tad

580
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,960
um how do you feel about that

581
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,538
I mean you know it's it's interesting

582
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,759
because

583
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,440
nowadays we don't have as much

584
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,240
connection and social media really is

585
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,140
that tool for Connection in a lot of

586
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,940
ways

587
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:14,400
um so in in some ways I think it's great

588
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:16,200
in other ways I think it's awful in

589
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,059
terms of advice for plants I don't think

590
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,220
that's the best tool you know

591
00:22:18,058 --> 00:22:22,019
interestingly enough we've been posting

592
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:26,100
um every Tuesday a weekly plant trivia

593
00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:28,079
photo or video and folks are you know

594
00:22:26,099 --> 00:22:30,119
able to kind of guess at what they think

595
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:31,980
is going on and it's all in good fun but

596
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:34,019
when you look at the answers you can see

597
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,360
how much it varies you know and if it's

598
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:38,879
an insect it can be in anywhere from

599
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:42,240
spider mites to thrips to aphids you

600
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,220
know people are all over the place or if

601
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,720
you post a you know a photo of a leaf

602
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,759
people are like oh that's a phosphorus

603
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,319
deficiency or magnesium or calcium or

604
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:51,359
you know pretty much anything you can

605
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:54,359
imagine and it just shows how hard it is

606
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,839
to one even diagnose something from a

607
00:22:54,359 --> 00:23:01,019
photo but two get like consistent advice

608
00:22:56,839 --> 00:23:03,000
usually it's not enough information

609
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:04,980
you can't put enough information in your

610
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:08,038
post for someone to give you a very good

611
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,720
answer and a lot of times like even

612
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:11,759
you know trying to diagnose something

613
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,860
remotely as a consultant I think is

614
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,599
really challenging because you almost

615
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,798
have to walk into the room and see

616
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,058
everything that's going on because you

617
00:23:16,798 --> 00:23:20,099
may spot something out of the corner of

618
00:23:18,058 --> 00:23:22,259
your eye and be like oh well this is

619
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:25,980
this isn't right and this might be

620
00:23:22,259 --> 00:23:29,400
what's causing this problem over here so

621
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,700
it's I think it's very tough

622
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:35,640
I back you up 100 on that as being a

623
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:38,038
consultant and I mean I am not a miracle

624
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:40,440
worker when it comes to diagnosing

625
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:44,158
problems from bad pictures I try to be

626
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:46,019
but I'm not but uh yeah it's a challenge

627
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,880
out there and I I mean I think

628
00:23:46,019 --> 00:23:49,619
everything you're doing to try to put

629
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,980
good information out

630
00:23:49,619 --> 00:23:55,918
um is is super helpful because it it's

631
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:58,220
it's very challenging though because you

632
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,500
know you have a daily business to run

633
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,120
and you know doing the podcast and then

634
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,500
trying to keep up with all the Social

635
00:24:03,119 --> 00:24:05,399
Media stuff

636
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,200
um

637
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:12,480
can be very time consuming but I do give

638
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:14,400
you you credit for actually doing a good

639
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,500
job for keeping up with it because you

640
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,640
know I'm a little challenged sometimes

641
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:22,859
with that on that well you know you you

642
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,380
and I have the same problem like we have

643
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:27,538
to be the marketing department and the

644
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,580
social media department and the

645
00:24:27,538 --> 00:24:31,379
technical department and you know all

646
00:24:29,579 --> 00:24:33,839
these different things and granted I

647
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,240
have more help than you do but I will

648
00:24:33,839 --> 00:24:38,220
spend as much time with a person with

649
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,960
two plants as I do with a person with a

650
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:42,659
thousand plants so we really do try and

651
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,120
answer everyone if you send me a message

652
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,000
uh you know through social media I will

653
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,678
answer it it may not always be like a

654
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,359
super in-depth answer but I always get

655
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:55,400
back to everybody and really try my

656
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:55,399
hardest to help as many people as we can

657
00:24:55,859 --> 00:25:01,439
well again uh you guys do a great job

658
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,880
um but with that

659
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,400
um you know thinking about the business

660
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,960
and there's a lot of stuff you know that

661
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,659
is out of our control with our

662
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,000
businesses that are affecting us

663
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:13,500
for the soil company what what do you

664
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,759
see as some of the biggest challenges

665
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,759
coming up for you guys

666
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:21,600
oh you know it's been all over the board

667
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:23,339
lately I mean over the last two years

668
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:25,079
with everything with covet and supply

669
00:25:23,339 --> 00:25:28,859
chain shortages

670
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:30,720
um it's been getting things material uh

671
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:32,158
and then cost increases with inflation

672
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,058
and then

673
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:36,360
um

674
00:25:33,058 --> 00:25:38,158
Freight Freight's been the killer uh

675
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,319
it's been so hard to ship things because

676
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:43,380
of the cost of freight lately so

677
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:46,439
that's probably our biggest challenge

678
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:50,039
so we've been trying to uh work on

679
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:51,600
helping people Source things locally you

680
00:25:50,038 --> 00:25:54,058
know and making recommendations that

681
00:25:51,599 --> 00:25:55,379
allow them to do that but even that's a

682
00:25:54,058 --> 00:25:56,940
little bit challenging because when we

683
00:25:55,380 --> 00:26:00,299
go to make a soil we want to build it

684
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:02,340
around the compost and so if I don't

685
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,019
know what your starting compost is or if

686
00:26:02,339 --> 00:26:06,959
it's not high quality it makes it really

687
00:26:04,019 --> 00:26:08,579
challenging to build a soil and and also

688
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,278
build a safe product because we have to

689
00:26:08,579 --> 00:26:12,720
know the heavy metal levels now that we

690
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:15,119
have heavy metal testing in a lot of

691
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:18,000
States and it's just it's more

692
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:20,219
complicated I think Than People realize

693
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,900
and it takes a while and and I've been

694
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,220
looking into other options because we

695
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,400
have people reach out and are like hey

696
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:28,798
you know I don't want to use anything

697
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,620
um that comes from the industrial

698
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:33,720
you know AG or slaughterhouses I I want

699
00:26:31,619 --> 00:26:35,579
to or anything from the ocean you know I

700
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,159
want to be use vegan inputs or I want

701
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:40,678
things that are more sustainable and

702
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,799
I want those things too it's a matter of

703
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:47,340
figuring out how to maintain our

704
00:26:43,798 --> 00:26:48,839
fertility and our plant health because I

705
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:51,538
don't want to sacrifice those things

706
00:26:48,839 --> 00:26:53,119
either so it's it's a balance because as

707
00:26:51,538 --> 00:26:55,798
we move for example

708
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:59,038
phosphorus the the easiest sources of

709
00:26:55,798 --> 00:27:01,859
phosphorus are are bone meal fishbone

710
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:06,119
meal things like that they're they're

711
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,740
cheap they're you know relatively low

712
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:09,119
and heavy metals but they're not maybe

713
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,259
not sourced from an industry they're a

714
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:11,939
waste product from an industry that

715
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:14,819
maybe you don't want to support so now

716
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:17,278
we start looking into other things where

717
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:20,579
you can get them like for example insect

718
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:23,579
frass or some some uh plant-based

719
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:26,579
products that are higher in P or even

720
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:28,558
mined materials like

721
00:27:26,579 --> 00:27:30,359
soft rock phosphate but now we're

722
00:27:28,558 --> 00:27:31,918
looking at heavy metal levels that may

723
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:34,859
be higher than we want in order to get

724
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
our phosphorus so it I guess it can be

725
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,479
challenging like I've been trying to

726
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,099
find replacements for peat but I haven't

727
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,079
found anything yet that I can

728
00:27:41,099 --> 00:27:47,099
effectively

729
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:48,538
you know I can put my kiss Organics seal

730
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:50,459
of approval or whatever on and say you

731
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:52,140
know I can get the same level of growth

732
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,460
or get near the same level of growth as

733
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:58,080
I can using uh peat moss in my mix so

734
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,179
it's a it's a constant thing we've been

735
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:03,839
working on this for years and I hope we

736
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:06,380
get there but it's been tough

737
00:28:03,839 --> 00:28:09,959
yeah I've seen it with a lot of Growers

738
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:12,059
trialing all kinds of inputs who are

739
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,519
just even conventional Growers not even

740
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,619
to have the special Niche and the

741
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:18,658
standards you guys have

742
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:21,000
um just trying to find a replacement for

743
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:22,740
Pete and and trying to learn to grow in

744
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,319
it um and it's it's been very

745
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:26,880
challenging for the whole Horticultural

746
00:28:25,319 --> 00:28:30,058
industry

747
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,799
um to find these Replacements but you

748
00:28:30,058 --> 00:28:33,658
know over time you know we'll get it

749
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:37,259
worked out but finding something that's

750
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:38,159
sustainable is is a big challenge that's

751
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:40,200
uh

752
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,600
you know that's that's a hard one there

753
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:45,778
but it's it's good to see that you guys

754
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:47,759
are working to try to find Solutions

755
00:28:45,778 --> 00:28:50,398
um and not just

756
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:52,619
sitting back and

757
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,000
um not trying to affect change you know

758
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:55,558
you are trying to make a difference and

759
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,599
try to do the right thing by the

760
00:28:55,558 --> 00:29:01,019
environment and your customers which is

761
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:02,398
which is very good but go ahead no I'm

762
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:05,220
just gonna say like we are we are trying

763
00:29:02,398 --> 00:29:08,038
our pet is sourced you know pretty local

764
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:11,100
to where we mix it so that helps quite a

765
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,140
bit and the sustainability thing you

766
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:14,339
know it's tough because it depends on

767
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,380
where you

768
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:18,480
where you're reading the the science is

769
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:21,299
it appears to be pretty mixed on how

770
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,860
sustainable Pete is as a product I put

771
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:24,839
together a blog post

772
00:29:22,859 --> 00:29:26,939
um if you type in Pete versus Coco I bet

773
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,500
it'll just pop up in Google pretty high

774
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,558
on the list or go to our blog page and

775
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:33,240
type that in and you can see a more

776
00:29:31,558 --> 00:29:34,918
in-depth discussion that I have on it

777
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,319
because there's really pros and cons to

778
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,679
to both yeah

779
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,678
um yes

780
00:29:40,038 --> 00:29:45,000
that's like a whole nother podcast yeah

781
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:46,019
it's uh it's an interesting topic I

782
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,000
guess

783
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:50,038
um but the idea is like too like if we

784
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,819
can get people to reuse that soil and

785
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,339
not

786
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:55,500
be adding more peat to it you know by

787
00:29:53,339 --> 00:29:57,418
managing it correctly

788
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,038
you know we have some guys like gold

789
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,559
leaf now I think they're like seven or

790
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:03,898
eight years using the same soil that

791
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,720
they they got originally that to me

792
00:30:03,898 --> 00:30:08,398
feels pretty darn sustainable uh

793
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,980
compared to even people that are in

794
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:12,418
other media types that are you know

795
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:15,298
having to throw out their soil every

796
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:18,000
cycle and bring in new material

797
00:30:15,298 --> 00:30:20,038
um I feel good about that

798
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,778
yeah no that's great but unfortunately

799
00:30:20,038 --> 00:30:23,879
you know for the Horticulture industry

800
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:25,619
the plants have to get sold and go to

801
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,440
somebody's house so they don't even have

802
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:32,339
those options they constantly have to be

803
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:33,778
buying media so it's it's a challenge

804
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,459
um for sure

805
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:37,679
um but it's interesting to hear

806
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,640
everything that is happening

807
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,740
um in that area and see how things are

808
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,659
going to end up

809
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,339
um but you know as you mentioned you

810
00:30:45,659 --> 00:30:49,140
know as compost basically being the

811
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:51,359
start of your soil

812
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,520
um and I know a lot of people that

813
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:57,479
listen to your podcast are obviously

814
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:59,099
very soil Savvy but

815
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,940
you know there are people that are

816
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:05,038
newbies and if somebody wanted to just

817
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,778
understand what compost is understand

818
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:08,460
about it do what do you have a

819
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:10,500
recommended resource for learning about

820
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:15,798
compost

821
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:18,359
no I know it's unfortunately oh man uh

822
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:20,099
that's tough it kind of depends on what

823
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:23,459
type of composting you want to do to

824
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:26,579
whether it's thermal or static or worm

825
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,100
or some combination of the three

826
00:31:26,579 --> 00:31:32,898
um yeah I mean it's such a compliment

827
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,898
even the book that explains that

828
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:41,579
there was a book I had that went through

829
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:43,679
all the different kinds of composting I

830
00:31:41,579 --> 00:31:46,259
mean I'm sorry it was not one of my

831
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,298
favorite classes I ha I needed one

832
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,460
elective and I like that was the

833
00:31:48,298 --> 00:31:53,579
elective I got it was interesting

834
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:56,399
because I did discover a new species of

835
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:58,379
uh insect in my compost pile that made

836
00:31:56,398 --> 00:32:00,000
it exciting for me

837
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:03,778
um but

838
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,339
um but yeah because I mean I I do think

839
00:32:03,778 --> 00:32:06,839
um and I think we're all guilty of this

840
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:08,398
sometimes we're in conversations and

841
00:32:06,839 --> 00:32:09,959
people are talking about a subject we

842
00:32:08,398 --> 00:32:12,599
may know some about but we just sit

843
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:14,340
there and Nod and Shake our head going

844
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:16,379
along with we understand what they're

845
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:18,658
saying um because they're embarrassed to

846
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,120
say hey I don't know about this and I

847
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:23,760
think some people still

848
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:26,339
um want some of that background basic

849
00:32:23,759 --> 00:32:27,778
information about soils and compost and

850
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:29,879
again just you're talking about the

851
00:32:27,778 --> 00:32:31,619
different types of composting you know

852
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,019
people probably don't know there are

853
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,959
multiple types of composting

854
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:39,000
yeah I'm we're working on a some course

855
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,840
materials to put together something for

856
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,679
people

857
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:42,720
um

858
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:44,460
that may eventually and there are

859
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,500
there's books out there for sure I just

860
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:48,058
none popped to mine right off top of my

861
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,740
head I've read a lot of chapters and

862
00:32:48,058 --> 00:32:51,079
books that are quite good on compost and

863
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,159
there's a lot of good information online

864
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:54,839
already I just don't have a ready

865
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:56,039
resource it's been a long time since

866
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:57,959
I've

867
00:32:56,038 --> 00:33:00,119
done a lot of reading around compost but

868
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,880
I am working on putting together a

869
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:05,099
botany course with Don Marshall

870
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:07,500
for people who

871
00:33:05,099 --> 00:33:10,139
you know like myself that didn't go to

872
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,019
school for this but I actually went back

873
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:14,038
to school just to take his botany course

874
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,319
but I want to put together an online

875
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:19,259
course where people like myself could

876
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:21,240
learn you know basic botany without

877
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:23,700
having to go back to school you know go

878
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,960
back to college and and take all the

879
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,298
classes where it could be broken down

880
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:29,819
into a more

881
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:31,980
Hands-On practical online course that

882
00:33:29,819 --> 00:33:34,200
people could take in you know chunks as

883
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,339
as they see fit so we're working on that

884
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:36,899
right now together and I'm really

885
00:33:35,339 --> 00:33:39,119
excited for that

886
00:33:36,898 --> 00:33:41,518
and then also a cultivation course too

887
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:43,439
hopefully down the road that's also the

888
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,798
same sort of thing like easy tidbits of

889
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,840
good information all science based um in

890
00:33:46,798 --> 00:33:50,759
sort of an online format so

891
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:52,980
hopefully we would have a section on

892
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:53,819
compost I think it's important

893
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,159
um

894
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:59,759
but just my big highlights on compost

895
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,320
it's not all created equal it really is

896
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,019
important if you're talking about making

897
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,759
an organic soil mix as you're to

898
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:07,919
incorporate that as your base to really

899
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,659
know what you're adding because that's

900
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,940
going to affect your pH it's going to

901
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:14,280
affect the microbial communities of that

902
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,878
mix it's going to

903
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,919
um

904
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:19,259
it's going to affect the nutrient load

905
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:22,019
and content it just it plays such an

906
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,460
important role and you know when I go to

907
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,099
the grocery store and I see these like

908
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,418
six dollar bags of compost and I look at

909
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:29,338
the ingredients or even just work

910
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:30,898
backward on the price I'm like okay well

911
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:32,338
the grocery store wouldn't have paid

912
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:34,799
more than like three or four dollars for

913
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:36,179
that so that means the company that made

914
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,019
it is if they're getting four bucks a

915
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:38,820
bag

916
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:40,858
they have to be making a profit on it

917
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:42,300
you know how much did the bag cost and

918
00:34:40,858 --> 00:34:43,679
how much did the transportation cost by

919
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:45,300
the time you get down it that material

920
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,980
had to have been free or like pretty

921
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:49,079
worthless like what you're getting is

922
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:51,179
not high quality and

923
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:52,919
frankly I wouldn't use any of that stuff

924
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:55,260
in my garden

925
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:57,000
but um yeah it's just it's just another

926
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:59,820
way of looking at it like people think

927
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,820
all compost is good and it's it varies

928
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:05,039
it varies quite a bit so

929
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:07,079
yeah Source material

930
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:10,920
um because I lived in the land of

931
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:12,480
mushroom compost so it's it's yeah it's

932
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,680
very different than other compost for

933
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,300
sure

934
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:18,419
um out there but that's exciting about

935
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,859
the the botany class but botany was that

936
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,019
was a tough one in college for me

937
00:35:19,858 --> 00:35:23,759
Horticulture Zips through that the

938
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:27,480
botany

939
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,820
yeah all the the Latin and anatomy of

940
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,199
all the plants and flowers so I'd

941
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,760
probably be interested in going back and

942
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:38,098
take a refresher on that because I took

943
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:40,020
botany in 1989. so well I know would you

944
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:42,838
probably weren't even born yet Tad were

945
00:35:40,019 --> 00:35:44,400
you I was born 77. I'm I'm turning 45

946
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:46,739
next week

947
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,619
okay for folks

948
00:35:46,739 --> 00:35:52,019
um yeah well you know also as a resource

949
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:53,640
in that regard uh Jeff lowenfell's books

950
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:55,199
like teaming with nutrients is a good

951
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:58,799
sort of like

952
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,759
basic botany book to give people an idea

953
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,560
of how

954
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,760
plant cells work and everything like

955
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:06,659
that so I'll shout that one out to Jeff

956
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:09,000
and he's got a new book coming out

957
00:36:06,659 --> 00:36:10,920
teaming with bacteria which I'm I'm

958
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,358
going to be interviewing him soon on on

959
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,579
that topic so I'm looking forward to

960
00:36:12,358 --> 00:36:16,380
that too so

961
00:36:14,579 --> 00:36:19,940
well that's something

962
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,940
I'm looking forward to hearing those

963
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,358
um so again back back to the company and

964
00:36:23,219 --> 00:36:27,000
you

965
00:36:24,358 --> 00:36:29,519
um what does the future hold do you guys

966
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:31,559
have any big visions of projects coming

967
00:36:29,519 --> 00:36:34,039
up you know where do you see yourself in

968
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:34,039
10 years

969
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:39,059
oh good question this is something so we

970
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:41,280
have a really good team right now

971
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:43,320
um it really feels like a family we all

972
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,839
work together really well

973
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:47,579
um very grateful for for who we have and

974
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:49,559
I really think

975
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:50,940
um everyone's in it for the long term

976
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:53,460
and

977
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:55,740
you know we talk about this and none of

978
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,059
us really have the ambition to be like

979
00:36:55,739 --> 00:37:00,239
take over the world like we're not

980
00:36:57,059 --> 00:37:01,559
looking to be a huge company because the

981
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:03,479
thing that we're most passionate about

982
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,159
is working with Growers and customer

983
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,800
service and right now we have a very

984
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:09,179
good handle on that I can confidently

985
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:12,000
say that you know everyone's going to

986
00:37:09,179 --> 00:37:14,940
get a reply and a very good technical

987
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,579
reply to their questions and I think as

988
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,079
people get too big too fast you lose

989
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:20,940
that or even with a large corporation

990
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,820
you lose that so

991
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,720
I think uh you know we just want to stay

992
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,480
relevant and continue to do what we do

993
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,219
on the scale that we're at which

994
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,139
requires Innovation you know you can't

995
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:37,559
you can't expect to just keep doing the

996
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:39,960
same thing and and maintain your your

997
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:43,500
revenue and your your leads things come

998
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:44,760
and go and so we've tried to innovate a

999
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,159
little bit you know like we just added

1000
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,859
the beneficial insects from biobee

1001
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:52,259
um through your your advice and I'm

1002
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:54,179
pretty excited about that we're always

1003
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:57,000
looking for new

1004
00:37:54,179 --> 00:38:00,960
products that fit with sort of our

1005
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,119
ethos and that we you know we would be

1006
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,159
willing to use in our garden and so

1007
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,660
that's I think that's where we're at

1008
00:38:05,159 --> 00:38:10,739
um we're potentially looking at

1009
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:14,759
expanding to an East uh

1010
00:38:10,739 --> 00:38:16,078
sorry East Coast soil distributor that

1011
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:18,960
could mix our soil out there but that's

1012
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,760
going to be that's a longer process like

1013
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:22,858
I said formulating a soil takes a year

1014
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,500
or two you can't uh you can't rush that

1015
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:27,480
process if you want to do it right it's

1016
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,880
a lot of testing a lot of plant trials

1017
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,858
and I want to make sure that if we do

1018
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,180
put something out it's of the same

1019
00:38:31,858 --> 00:38:35,299
quality of what we're putting out right

1020
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,299
now

1021
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:40,739
that sounds great yeah I you know being

1022
00:38:38,699 --> 00:38:43,139
the biggest is not always the best I

1023
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:45,479
think customer service and working with

1024
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:47,879
Growers is I love working with Growers

1025
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,960
just directly I I'm right there with you

1026
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,838
on that

1027
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:58,079
so so Tad if you didn't do soils and you

1028
00:38:54,838 --> 00:39:01,338
could have any job on the planet what

1029
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,339
would be your backup career

1030
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:07,200
oh boy

1031
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,440
I don't know I mean it varies sometimes

1032
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:12,838
I just wish I had a job where I didn't

1033
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,460
have to be in charge where I could just

1034
00:39:12,838 --> 00:39:18,179
like go to work

1035
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:20,940
do like a very like discreet activity

1036
00:39:18,179 --> 00:39:22,559
for eight hours and then go home and

1037
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,940
just you know put it on a shelf and not

1038
00:39:22,559 --> 00:39:26,219
have to think about it and then go back

1039
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:28,619
to work the next day uh as a business

1040
00:39:26,219 --> 00:39:31,078
owner you never stop working

1041
00:39:28,619 --> 00:39:33,599
um it it never your brain never gets to

1042
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:35,519
shut off and it's it's challenging

1043
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,480
sometimes

1044
00:39:35,519 --> 00:39:37,739
um

1045
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,599
you know if I probably did anything

1046
00:39:37,739 --> 00:39:42,539
again it'd probably be back into special

1047
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:44,220
education just because I really enjoyed

1048
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,900
working with children and now that I

1049
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:48,500
have a daughter of my own I I really

1050
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:50,880
like watching her grow and

1051
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:53,760
that I think the education teaching

1052
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,740
thing is just it's really fun it's uh

1053
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,619
it's it's very exhausting in a very

1054
00:39:55,739 --> 00:40:01,199
different way but it's so rewarding so I

1055
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:03,480
I truly enjoy it

1056
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:05,939
you know my mom was a special ed teacher

1057
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:08,219
for many years probably didn't know that

1058
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:10,079
yeah my sister was was a teacher too

1059
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:13,799
until recently

1060
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,160
um so yes I I watched my mom go through

1061
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:19,500
the the the joys of what she was able to

1062
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:22,500
do but also it's a very mentally

1063
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:24,539
challenging uh profession to be in

1064
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,818
um and it can be very hard

1065
00:40:24,539 --> 00:40:29,338
but well I'm happy you're on the soil

1066
00:40:26,818 --> 00:40:32,759
side of things so that we can be friends

1067
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:35,400
and hang out and talk about bug stuff

1068
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:39,240
um so I'm grateful to have you in the

1069
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:41,460
industry so but with that

1070
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:43,439
um if you had

1071
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:44,880
um some advice to give people about the

1072
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,358
industry

1073
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:50,818
um what would you say to them

1074
00:40:48,358 --> 00:40:52,559
yeah so I thought about this as I was

1075
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:54,779
like okay what questions might she ask

1076
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:56,400
me and I thought about like what

1077
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:58,079
from from all the years of doing the

1078
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,880
podcast and everything I've been doing

1079
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,200
like what are the pieces of advice that

1080
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:03,358
I think would be most helpful for

1081
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,739
Growers so I wrote down a few things

1082
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:07,679
um so I'll just share that here if that

1083
00:41:04,739 --> 00:41:08,519
works um the number one thing that I

1084
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:10,379
learned

1085
00:41:08,519 --> 00:41:12,659
and this was probably from Don Marshall

1086
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,180
was figure out what your limiting factor

1087
00:41:12,659 --> 00:41:17,519
of growth is always start there you're a

1088
00:41:15,179 --> 00:41:19,739
detective when you walk into a when you

1089
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:22,259
walk into a grow room or into a

1090
00:41:19,739 --> 00:41:24,179
greenhouse or whatever that scenario and

1091
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,859
you know in maybe soil it may be your

1092
00:41:24,179 --> 00:41:27,480
watering it may be your light it may be

1093
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:29,159
your environment but you really have to

1094
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,960
figure that out first it's kind of like

1095
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:33,440
you're you're a big push on you need to

1096
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,420
identify that bug before you do anything

1097
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,500
it's the same sort of mentality like you

1098
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,880
gotta you've really got to be a

1099
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,800
detective and figure that out first and

1100
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,900
I think if people can start thinking

1101
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,780
like that

1102
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:47,400
it goes a long way to making like good

1103
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,960
decisions in your garden and really just

1104
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,700
paying attention you know some people

1105
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,519
really have an eye for it I have to

1106
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:55,799
really stop myself and slow down and

1107
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:57,659
take a look around whereas I have other

1108
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,339
Growers that I work with that like they

1109
00:41:57,659 --> 00:42:01,920
can walk into a room and instantly spot

1110
00:41:59,338 --> 00:42:04,739
it I just don't have that skill I really

1111
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:07,800
have to like pause myself so that's

1112
00:42:04,739 --> 00:42:09,299
probably my biggest piece of advice

1113
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,220
some other things that I thought about

1114
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:13,920
is like try not to fall for marketing

1115
00:42:11,219 --> 00:42:15,539
hype you know I see these feeding

1116
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,880
schedules and Organics that require

1117
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:19,500
people to use like multiple products and

1118
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,940
these are like popular companies with

1119
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,858
popular products and people are all

1120
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,539
excited about it but the end of the day

1121
00:42:22,858 --> 00:42:25,920
like to me that's no better than feeding

1122
00:42:24,539 --> 00:42:27,838
a bottle of nutrient line and you're

1123
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:30,358
just you're throwing away money you

1124
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:32,578
don't need all these products with these

1125
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:34,019
enzymes and ferments and teas and all of

1126
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,079
these things at the end of the day like

1127
00:42:34,019 --> 00:42:38,639
if that's it's all about that limiting

1128
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:40,260
factor of growth and it's probably not

1129
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,118
these things and so if you do get a

1130
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:43,380
response from whatever you're adding

1131
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:45,780
then you need to go back and figure out

1132
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:47,519
why and figure out what it is that

1133
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:48,720
you're that's lacking in your garden and

1134
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,900
at the end of the day it's not a it's

1135
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:53,338
not a product it's a mineral it's uh

1136
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:55,940
something with your watering it's it's

1137
00:42:53,338 --> 00:42:55,940
something else

1138
00:42:56,699 --> 00:43:00,838
some other things is like you know read

1139
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,338
the labels like know what's going on

1140
00:43:00,838 --> 00:43:03,719
with the product and realize that when

1141
00:43:02,338 --> 00:43:05,519
you read a label you're not getting all

1142
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,358
the information you're probably not even

1143
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:07,980
getting

1144
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,539
half the information that you need on

1145
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,858
that product and that's why it's

1146
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:16,858
important to do your own sort of testing

1147
00:43:13,858 --> 00:43:18,659
don't trust manufacturers on things that

1148
00:43:16,858 --> 00:43:21,179
you know could ruin your livelihood like

1149
00:43:18,659 --> 00:43:23,699
heavy metals for example I've seen

1150
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:25,559
I've seen heavy metal tests on reports

1151
00:43:23,699 --> 00:43:28,559
that people put out on social media on

1152
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:29,699
their products and then I've had Growers

1153
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:31,799
send me

1154
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,858
heavy metal tests on that same product

1155
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:36,180
that were vastly different and they they

1156
00:43:34,858 --> 00:43:37,920
sent it to me because they're like hey

1157
00:43:36,179 --> 00:43:39,419
we were you we failed for heavy metals

1158
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,099
and so we tested everything and this

1159
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,139
thing was nowhere near what we thought

1160
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,420
it was and it's really really sad

1161
00:43:43,139 --> 00:43:47,279
because they lose they lose their crop

1162
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:50,338
on it and

1163
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,079
so I think as a grower like you you have

1164
00:43:50,338 --> 00:43:54,119
to do your due diligence

1165
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,740
um you know don't don't trust anyone

1166
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,500
when it comes to something that could

1167
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:00,959
ruin your livelihood

1168
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,000
um let's see what else oh soil tests so

1169
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,579
I'm a big fan of soil testing I think

1170
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,559
it's very important but I don't think

1171
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:10,019
that it tells the whole picture so I

1172
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,059
don't like to rely on Strictly on

1173
00:44:10,019 --> 00:44:13,318
calculators I think they're interesting

1174
00:44:12,059 --> 00:44:15,059
and they can point you in the right

1175
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,800
direction but I still think you need to

1176
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:18,900
talk to an actual agronomist or a person

1177
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,300
who understands a soil test and can put

1178
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:23,960
that into a context that makes sense

1179
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:26,460
within the grow itself because

1180
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:28,019
just looking at the mineral balancing of

1181
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:30,300
a soil does not tell the whole picture

1182
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:31,559
you need to look at the environment the

1183
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:33,560
watering all these other things that I

1184
00:44:31,559 --> 00:44:36,179
mentioned before it's a complex

1185
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:38,159
ecosystem and so this just gives you

1186
00:44:36,179 --> 00:44:40,318
another tool but it's not the full

1187
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:42,899
picture especially if you're a

1188
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:44,519
commercial grower I think you need to do

1189
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:46,559
more than just a soil test you need to

1190
00:44:44,519 --> 00:44:48,119
have someone looking at the soil test in

1191
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,920
relation to your plant Health in

1192
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:51,660
relation to your bug pressure in

1193
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:54,838
relation to your environment and

1194
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:56,759
lighting and CO2 levels and then make a

1195
00:44:54,838 --> 00:44:58,259
fertility recommendation around all of

1196
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,119
those things

1197
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:02,220
um so it is complex

1198
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:04,619
uh and then the last thing would be

1199
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:07,439
don't fall for simplistic models of

1200
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:09,480
thinking um there are so many different

1201
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,858
camps right now just on the organic side

1202
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:12,659
like not even talking about people who

1203
00:45:10,858 --> 00:45:14,098
are using salts but like on the organic

1204
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:16,139
side there's

1205
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:18,359
you know regenerative guys there's k f

1206
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:21,059
guys there's soul food web guys there's

1207
00:45:18,358 --> 00:45:22,440
oh boy I could go biodynamics you know

1208
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:24,779
there's there's this huge list there's

1209
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:29,400
people who are using the you know so and

1210
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:31,319
so's grow method it's everywhere and

1211
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,039
some of them you know they're fine and

1212
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:34,739
and

1213
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:37,259
you can grow plants but I just want to

1214
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:39,598
caution folks that there you know if

1215
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,460
someone it's never just microbes or

1216
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:43,318
enzymes or fermentations or nutrient

1217
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:46,019
lines or lighting Brands none of those

1218
00:45:43,318 --> 00:45:48,139
things are keys to a good grow the keto

1219
00:45:46,019 --> 00:45:51,719
good grow is getting all of these things

1220
00:45:48,139 --> 00:45:54,539
correct within the context of you know

1221
00:45:51,719 --> 00:45:55,980
the all the variables so when people say

1222
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:57,420
you know you just need the right these

1223
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,579
microbes

1224
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:01,139
um that's not the whole picture that

1225
00:45:59,579 --> 00:46:04,500
they're not taking into account your

1226
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:07,078
temperature humidity your you know your

1227
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:08,400
lighting all of these other things so I

1228
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,720
I would just say at the end of the day

1229
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,760
like just be careful and it's

1230
00:46:09,719 --> 00:46:13,739
unfortunate that I think that all of

1231
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:15,720
these camps they almost feel a little

1232
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,759
cultish to a certain extent where like

1233
00:46:15,719 --> 00:46:21,358
if you're growing in a different method

1234
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,280
it's wrong and it just at the end of the

1235
00:46:21,358 --> 00:46:24,480
day especially on the organic side man I

1236
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,040
feel like we should all be on the same

1237
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,599
side like we're all trying to do right

1238
00:46:26,039 --> 00:46:28,318
by the environment we're all trying to

1239
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:32,700
grow

1240
00:46:28,318 --> 00:46:34,858
safe cannabis healthy medicine and it's

1241
00:46:32,699 --> 00:46:37,919
it's crazy how much infighting that we

1242
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:40,980
have going on because everyone wants to

1243
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,500
be an expert and you and I we talk about

1244
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:46,858
this a fair bit off air it it's it's

1245
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:48,599
really unfortunate so those would be the

1246
00:46:46,858 --> 00:46:50,519
pieces of advice that I've learned over

1247
00:46:48,599 --> 00:46:53,359
the last I don't know how many years of

1248
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:53,358
doing this I think

1249
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:58,619
well I think that's super helpful

1250
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,599
information because again I think all of

1251
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,579
us are like you said are heading for the

1252
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:06,119
same goal and

1253
00:47:02,579 --> 00:47:06,839
um you know it's it's challenging

1254
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:09,059
um

1255
00:47:06,838 --> 00:47:11,699
when you feel like everybody's not

1256
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:13,259
moving together it's it's it's for some

1257
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:15,419
reason people have to go against each

1258
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:18,119
other and and that's something I

1259
00:47:15,420 --> 00:47:21,059
appreciate about you because you are a a

1260
00:47:18,119 --> 00:47:24,000
very calm reasoning voice for me when

1261
00:47:21,059 --> 00:47:27,119
I'm having some challenges I'll call you

1262
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,699
my you know industry therapists to help

1263
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:32,160
me get through things

1264
00:47:29,699 --> 00:47:33,659
um and you know you've been a again not

1265
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:35,159
only you know super great for the

1266
00:47:33,659 --> 00:47:37,379
industry but as a personal friend I

1267
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:39,899
really enjoy being friends with you and

1268
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:41,700
learning from you and looking forward

1269
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:44,280
um to being friends for many more years

1270
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:46,379
and hopefully working together in the

1271
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,420
industry and you know again move all in

1272
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,400
the same direction so we can take care

1273
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:53,760
of this planet and

1274
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:55,858
um leave uh behind a great place for

1275
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:59,579
your daughter

1276
00:47:55,858 --> 00:48:01,799
I I appreciate that yeah it's uh I feel

1277
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:03,720
very lucky to have this this opportunity

1278
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,839
with the podcast and with the with the

1279
00:48:03,719 --> 00:48:09,118
business to do what we do like 99 of the

1280
00:48:06,838 --> 00:48:11,099
people we work with are awesome but

1281
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,559
there is that one percent that sometimes

1282
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,700
just uh makes you just throw your hands

1283
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:15,900
up and wonder why you're doing what

1284
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:18,838
you're doing

1285
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:19,800
but I think that's any any industry

1286
00:48:18,838 --> 00:48:21,239
um

1287
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,980
hey are we allowed to talk about your

1288
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:24,479
new poster that's coming out is that

1289
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:25,920
something we could I can mention or do I

1290
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:27,920
know

1291
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,920
um

1292
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:32,460
so yeah speaking of things that I'm

1293
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:34,980
excited about uh in terms of

1294
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:36,900
collaboration with you is this poster

1295
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:38,818
that you're working on um I can't wait

1296
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:40,559
to get my hands on it and to be able to

1297
00:48:38,818 --> 00:48:43,079
get it out to Growers through catch

1298
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,980
Masters I've been talking to them do you

1299
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:45,980
want to talk a little bit about that

1300
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,559
um

1301
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:58,259
branding but

1302
00:48:55,199 --> 00:49:01,379
um cashmaster people just such nice guys

1303
00:48:58,260 --> 00:49:03,599
they really are I really enjoy them and

1304
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:04,740
they wanted to do a collaboration of

1305
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,380
making

1306
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:10,338
um the first poster we're doing is for

1307
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:13,440
what insects look like on sticky cards

1308
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:15,480
and are they a pest are they a

1309
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,639
beneficial or is it something you don't

1310
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,818
have to worry about because looking at

1311
00:49:17,639 --> 00:49:22,259
pests or insects well has been officials

1312
00:49:20,818 --> 00:49:24,058
on leave sometimes can look a little

1313
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:26,700
different on sticky cards because they

1314
00:49:24,059 --> 00:49:28,859
can change colors and the reflections

1315
00:49:26,699 --> 00:49:30,838
and so will be a poster Growers can hang

1316
00:49:28,858 --> 00:49:33,239
up at the facility to help them with

1317
00:49:30,838 --> 00:49:34,920
identification so I'm super excited for

1318
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:38,159
that too

1319
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:40,139

1320
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:43,338

um I have to check back with them

1323
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,119
because I

1324
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:52,500
had graphic design I provided them all

1325
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:55,740

1326
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:58,858
um have it at the MJ bizcon in Las Vegas

1327
