1
00:00:04,879 --> 00:00:08,719
all right hi i'm chad hussey with kiss

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,280
organics and i'm here today with

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
suzanne wade wright evans of bug lady

4
00:00:11,279 --> 00:00:15,759
consulting

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,480
and we are here to uh talk a little bit

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
about

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,719
different tools for scouting and

8
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,480
bug identification so things you might

9
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:27,358
want to consider when looking

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,080
at bugs suzanne you want to start off

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
and talk about

12
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:31,598
some of the tools you use when you're in

13
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:33,119
the field well the first

14
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,920
most important thing and i always tell

15
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:37,839
everybody to have

16
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
is a nerd bag that you can put all your

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,600
tools in i'm a huge fan of

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,280
the fanny pack because you can snap it

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,480
on and it leaves your hands free

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,160
to do things because sure enough if you

21
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:49,199
don't have the tool with you you're

22
00:00:48,159 --> 00:00:51,359
going to need it and this way you can

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
carry everything with you

24
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:55,840
rei does not make this bag anymore but

25
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,238
you can find it on ebay occasionally and

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,719
i think this is about the perfect size

27
00:00:58,238 --> 00:01:03,919
for carrying almost everything you need

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,879
i've i've had this probably 20 years

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,640
and has all kinds of stuff in it which

30
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:10,079
the different tools

31
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,159
i think first and foremost the number

32
00:01:10,079 --> 00:01:13,679
one most basic scouting tool you can

33
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,159
have

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,360
is a 10x hand lens this one here

35
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,960
which i really like has

36
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:25,680
a built-in led light it's especially

37
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:29,438
helpful

38
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,520
for if you're in a darker situation um

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:33,118
for either like if you're looking at

40
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:34,078
plants in the interior scene or if

41
00:01:33,118 --> 00:01:36,560
you're in a

42
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:37,279
darker grow room but also as you get

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,359
older

44
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,879
um having more light for your eyes is

45
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:44,640
really super helpful

46
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:46,158
and these are really inexpensive to buy

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
everyone on your team should probably

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,000
carry one always put them

49
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,759
on a lanyard because if not they're

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,719
really easy to get lost but this can

51
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,359
give you that quick

52
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:57,280
first initial look at something to make

53
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:58,159
the decision on do i need to collect a

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,799
sample

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,200
then to use with my microscope or your

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,320
other

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,520
usb microscopes or your other tools so i

58
00:02:04,319 --> 00:02:08,719
have a question about this so

59
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:11,919
you have the 10x there i know they come

60
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:13,840
in variety of different magnifications

61
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:15,439
is there any advantage to having other

62
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,360
magnifications or do you just find

63
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:18,719
yourself using the 10x are there any

64
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,000
insects you're not going to be able to

65
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:21,439
see

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,159
let's say with a cannabis crop for

67
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,199
example uh with a 10x lens that where

68
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:27,520
you need something better

69
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:29,839
so i also have a 20x and i have a 30x

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,439
and i always come back to the 10x

71
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,878
when you get to the 20 and 30 the lenses

72
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,800
are a bit smaller

73
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,479
and you don't have the biggest field and

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,840
you also have to make sure you have

75
00:02:38,479 --> 00:02:42,560
enough light but

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,519
even though my eyes are pretty bad at

77
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,318
this point

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,680
um i can see hemp russet mites with this

79
00:02:46,318 --> 00:02:49,919
10x hand lens

80
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
um on the leaf and that's about as small

81
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:54,719
as you're going to need to see

82
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,158
from an insect or a mite standpoint okay

83
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:59,598
so um i have another thing here that a

84
00:02:58,158 --> 00:03:00,239
grower recommended that i thought i'd

85
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,679
get

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,599
it's like it's from carson um

87
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,959
it's just another tool for looking at

88
00:03:05,598 --> 00:03:08,799
them do you want to talk about the pros

89
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,319
and cons of something like this i know

90
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
you've never used this one i just showed

91
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,039
it to you five minutes ago

92
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:18,719
yeah um i think if you

93
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:20,239
had a stationary leaf

94
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,919
maybe if you were looking you know at

95
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,680
powdery mildew or something

96
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:25,439
and you wanted to come down over top of

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,439
it um that would work

98
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:29,199
well to look down i mean it's good that

99
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:32,318
it you know has a built-in

100
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:35,039
led light and you can focus and you can

101
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,878
zoom but if you're trying to hold leaf

102
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:37,598
samples out of the greenhouse i think

103
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,719
it's going to be

104
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:44,000
a little more challenging um

105
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,759
to work with from that standpoint i mean

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360
i know it does have significantly higher

107
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,239
magnification

108
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,760
but i this would be something you'd more

109
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,438
use at a desk

110
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:55,759
with samples and also what's challenging

111
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:57,519
too

112
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,959
is if you have small leaves and you try

113
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,400
to get these

114
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
over top of them because sometimes it

115
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,680
can be challenging with the dynalite

116
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,920
to do that um and the field of view in

117
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,560
here wasn't super big i mean

118
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:12,798
would i buy one probably because i

119
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,920
collect all this kind of stuff

120
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,680
but i don't know how much i would use it

121
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,039
from an insect and might standpoint

122
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,478
yeah so one thing i want to talk about

123
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,000
when it comes to stuff like this you

124
00:04:22,478 --> 00:04:26,639
know this was under 20

125
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,399
it was on amazon when you're talking

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
about buying something

127
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:32,159
for magnification a lot of it comes down

128
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
to the quality of the objective and

129
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,639
correct me if you disagree with anything

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,160
i say here

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,240
so it's the amount of light that you

132
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,000
need relative so as you go to higher

133
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,600
magnifications you need more light so

134
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
that's something to keep in mind too

135
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,520
when we talk a little more about

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,120
microscopes but um the quality objective

137
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:47,758
on something like this with it with a

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
cheap

139
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,720
20 tool is not going to be that great um

140
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:55,119
so you're not you're not this is not

141
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,040
going to replace a higher quality option

142
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,639
if we want to really look closely at an

143
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
insect or even take a picture this isn't

144
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,879
going to function for that

145
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,478
and you know like like you said suzanne

146
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,319
you've been using these loops

147
00:05:04,478 --> 00:05:07,599
those are your go-to things you know

148
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,599
having

149
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,919
like you said a graveyard of these back

150
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,960
home and ending up still using the loop

151
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,680
every day uh that's something to

152
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:16,879
consider

153
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,560
you don't need all of these gadgets but

154
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:20,959
they're kind of fun to play around with

155
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:24,639
too so let's move on to

156
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:26,000
uh the the next let's talk about what's

157
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,639
in your bag besides just

158
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,759
these microscope related scouting tools

159
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,319
because you had a few other things that

160
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,520
you pulled out

161
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:33,519
let's talk about that before we talk

162
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,959
about the dyno lights okay

163
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:37,519
so this is definitely a critical part of

164
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:41,359
my

165
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:44,560
tool bag is i get these

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,439
vials um you can order these from

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,759
bioquip

168
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:50,079
which is an insect supply company it's

169
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
it's

170
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,800
it's if anybody ever wants to send me a

171
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,599
gift card to bio cliff i'd love you

172
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,240
forever

173
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
i love shopping because they've got all

174
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
the

175
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,720
entomology tools you need but i just

176
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,240
order these vials i pre-load them with

177
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,000
alcohol

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:08,400
and then these cards i absolutely love

179
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,680
um what what alcohol are you using in

180
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:12,079
these and where do you get it

181
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,879
how much of these these things cost oh

182
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,439
the vials

183
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:16,478
yeah pennies they're super cheap okay

184
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,918
and then

185
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:20,478
what type of alcohol do you like right

186
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:22,478
now with covid any alcohol i can get

187
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:23,839
okay because it's been a real issue

188
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:26,959
trying to get alcohol

189
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,119
if your alcohol is way too high um it

190
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:32,239
can evaporate really quickly because

191
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,399
if you don't get nalgene caps

192
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,519
the alcohol does evaporate but generally

193
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,719
for what i'm doing where i'm just

194
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,639
collecting samples

195
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
ferrying them back home i'm going to put

196
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,560
them under the microscope i'm not

197
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
storing these for years for museum

198
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,720
specimens if you need to store them for

199
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:48,399
a long time

200
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,400
you need the nalgene caps from

201
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:52,159
um to to do that to keep it from

202
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:54,719
evaporating

203
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
but this kind of in a way kind of goes

204
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,960
with this

205
00:06:55,279 --> 00:07:00,399
so these are actually white balance

206
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:02,079
cards from amazon

207
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:03,439
they're actually up to nine dollars now

208
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:05,839
a package i think

209
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,719
okay they used to be like five and in

210
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:08,318
this you get

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,840
three of these cards and really what

212
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,960
these are used for

213
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:14,879
is um white balancing your camera

214
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:17,120
and you know if anybody's ever taken

215
00:07:14,879 --> 00:07:19,279
pictures under led lights you know what

216
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
happens and that's why you white balance

217
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:23,038
your camera so that your colors are

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,439
normal but what i found

219
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:29,279
is these make a great tool for

220
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:30,959
sampling and scouting for insects so i

221
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,719
hold this under a plant and then i just

222
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:36,638
bang the plant

223
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,440
and then aphids uh thrips

224
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,560
mites things like that can fall on here

225
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:43,598
now

226
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
in the pack you do get gray black and

227
00:07:43,598 --> 00:07:46,560
white

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
cards i used to use white all the time

229
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,399
but now i use black i find it just it

230
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,639
works better for my eyes to see them

231
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,878
but if i get if it falls on here you can

232
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,319
take a paintbrush and again i buy these

233
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,720
by the 50 pack on amazon and you just

234
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,160
dip the the paint brush and alcohol and

235
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,680
then you can go on this plastic board

236
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,280
and you can pick up the insect and then

237
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,120
dip it back on the alcohol

238
00:08:05,279 --> 00:08:08,799
and now you've got your thrips your

239
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,280
mites your aphids and the alcohol and

240
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
you don't

241
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:15,758
damage them so you can collect

242
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,279
the insects off the board and put them

243
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,240
in the alcohol and then you have your

244
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:21,439
samples

245
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:23,120
that then you can either put under your

246
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:26,399
microscope for identification or

247
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,918
send off to extension or someone to do

248
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:32,000
your identification

249
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,639
on them this also is a great way just to

250
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
scout

251
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:36,718
even if you're not collecting specimens

252
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:37,599
just walking by and knocking your plants

253
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,800
i actually

254
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,479
have a video on my instagram account

255
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,158
where we were doing this in an

256
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,120
ornamental greenhouse and you could just

257
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:46,879
see the thrips

258
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,639
raining out of the plant even though you

259
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:49,838
looked at the plants they looked good

260
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:51,919
but we didn't know the thrips are there

261
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:52,240
until we knocked the plants and they

262
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:54,319
fell

263
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,680
on here and then we could see them very

264
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,519
clearly this will help

265
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:59,199
speed up your scouting and make you more

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,600
accurate this is one of my

267
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,320
favorite things and i always carry them

268
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,000
with me

269
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,760
i do have to say though i've got tons of

270
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,519
gray cards left because i end up leaving

271
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:08,958
these with growers all the time

272
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,200
and now i have like this more of gray

273
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:14,799
cards because great cards are the worst

274
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,879
out of the pack to um see insects on

275
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:18,879
i also like because people say oh you

276
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:20,399
can just do it on a white sheet of paper

277
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,240
well i like this because you can clean

278
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,799
this with alcohol at the end of the day

279
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,879
so there's no sticky on it

280
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:29,199
this particular size i like too because

281
00:09:26,879 --> 00:09:31,200
it fits in most cargo pants pockets

282
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,120
or your back pocket you can get these

283
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,640
cards in like 8 by 10

284
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,320
too which might be more effective for

285
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:40,080
some people with larger plants to

286
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,120
collect a larger area

287
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,639
but i absolutely love these cards and i

288
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,320
think it's an essential part of your

289
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:48,000
your scouting toolbox that you should

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,800
have

291
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,320
so anything else that you have in there

292
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:53,599
uh that you want to talk about before we

293
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,680
go dive into

294
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,759
you know more microscope related no i

295
00:09:55,679 --> 00:10:01,039
mean i always carry tweezers

296
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:04,720
i always have sharpie markers um

297
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:09,120
chapstick of course but a ziploc baggie

298
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,440
ziploc baggies um binder clips

299
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,078
um i actually have a tiny screwdriver in

300
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,440
here here's the stray gray card

301
00:10:14,078 --> 00:10:19,759
um and you know i also have a notebook

302
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,360
in case i need to write anything down in

303
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:23,120
it um

304
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,600
sometimes i have petri dishes in here

305
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,360
too because if you take leaf samples and

306
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,959
you put them in a ziploc baggie you can

307
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,800
get a lot of condensation build up in

308
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:33,359
there or if you put them back in your

309
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:34,319
pouch they can get smushed so petri

310
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,919
dishes

311
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,399
will not smush your leaf

312
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:42,078
and they're not sealed tight so you get

313
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,320
a little more breathability

314
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:46,159
in there with them but they do take up

315
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,560
more space um

316
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,278
in your bag now if you were working at a

317
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:52,159
facility

318
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:53,360
versus coming in to consult you may also

319
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:56,719
have

320
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,360
um a way of writing stuff down like

321
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,879
charting

322
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,639
where you're see where you are in the

323
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,078
facility and where you're seeing this

324
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,078
plant issue and i know you've talked in

325
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:06,078
the past about using some sort of marker

326
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,599
identification whether that's like a

327
00:11:06,078 --> 00:11:10,078
colored plant steak or some way to note

328
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,360
where

329
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,199
you know the color red means thrips

330
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,639
irrigation flags are the best because

331
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,000
they're cheap you can order them in lots

332
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:20,000
of colors and they're easy to see and

333
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,399
you can just stand them in pots

334
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
um and we use those regularly in

335
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,000
ornamental production and you'll see

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,760
where they'll have pvc holders for each

337
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,639
of the different color flags on a little

338
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,399
cart

339
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:31,759
and you know it could be there's an

340
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,879
insect problem there's a mic problem

341
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:34,159
there's a disease problem there's an

342
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,639
irrigation problem

343
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:37,919
but you have to come up with your own

344
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:40,480
system for that

345
00:11:37,919 --> 00:11:41,039
and as far as record keeping there's

346
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,639
actually

347
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,078
more scouting software and companies

348
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,600
that are becoming available

349
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:52,399
um that really have got my interest

350
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,360
because it's going to give people the

351
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,000
opportunity

352
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,959
to really map out their greenhouse or

353
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,159
map out

354
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:02,719
their grow and then identify and

355
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:04,319
keep good records on population

356
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,040
densities and what they're finding

357
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:10,079
so you know if i'm home in pennsylvania

358
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:12,078
but my growers in colorado i can go in

359
00:12:10,078 --> 00:12:13,599
to their daily scouting information and

360
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:16,239
i can see what's going on

361
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,519
from remote and that's one of the things

362
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,360
because i have been

363
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,639
going through demonstrations with all

364
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,600
these companies that provide scouting

365
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,879
software

366
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
and they said it's important to have

367
00:12:22,879 --> 00:12:26,399
remote access for the consultants to be

368
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,000
able to get in and view things so i can

369
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
see if there's a problem

370
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
they have ways that you can take

371
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,639
pictures and then fold them into the

372
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,039
scouting reports

373
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,039
and this summer at the cultivate show in

374
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,639
columbus ohio i'm actually teaching a

375
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:41,679
full day scouting workshop

376
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,560
we're going to go out into a greenhouse

377
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,958
we're going to use these different

378
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:47,518
scouting tools we're going to have

379
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,879
demos of different software and then

380
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,039
we're actually going to have

381
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:52,480
um a setup where we're going to have

382
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:54,000
lots of pest insects

383
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,600
in a classroom setting to work on

384
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,639
identification

385
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,600
so you could have like a essentially in

386
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,039
the software and picturing something

387
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
where you would have a zone

388
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,799
like zone a for example and you could

389
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,000
you could mark that with mites and then

390
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,958
you could post a photo

391
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,799
of that might and then remotely someone

392
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:12,239
like yourself could go in and confirm

393
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:14,879
the identification and then

394
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,360
work with that scouting team to come up

395
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,480
with

396
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,039
a plan for releases or sprays or

397
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,519
whatever

398
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,360
mode of treatment yeah well it's

399
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,560
interesting too because over time with

400
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,440
these on these programs you can build

401
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:27,759
heat maps

402
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:29,279
and you can be like hey why do we always

403
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,159
end up with spider mites in that back

404
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:32,078
corner and why

405
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:33,679
over there you know after two years do

406
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,519
we always have powdery mildew here and

407
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:37,519
you can start to see trends

408
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,039
in pest management and help you figure

409
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,879
out how to mitigate those problems to

410
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:42,319
prevent them from happening next time

411
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,480
cool all right well we're getting off

412
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:48,560
topic like like we always do so

413
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,000
uh let's talk about um the next

414
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:51,119
series of things so you identify

415
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,799
something with the loop and you want to

416
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
get a closer look at it you want to get

417
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:55,278
identified you need a tool to take a

418
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
photo

419
00:13:55,278 --> 00:13:59,278
some way to capture the image that

420
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,959
allows you to or even just take a closer

421
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:04,000
look yourself so

422
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,159
for that you've recommended dino lights

423
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
and just you know dynalite does not pay

424
00:14:06,159 --> 00:14:10,719
me i

425
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:13,919
just love dynalite yeah i just

426
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,720
i yes i own four of them now

427
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:18,000
so i will say that so this is my dyno

428
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,519
light this is the mid

429
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,320
tier option um this one was around

430
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,839
400 i believe we do carry them on our

431
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,600
website there's a 200

432
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,839
option that also works it's just a

433
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:32,480
slightly lower megapixel account

434
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,680
i don't have one of those here suzanne

435
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,079
has the

436
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:38,879
fancier one and there's even fancier

437
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,479
than this one she was telling me

438
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:44,159
but in terms of scouting

439
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,839
this is more than enough for the average

440
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:48,000
facility even the 200

441
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:50,000
one i think we could safely say would

442
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,078
work for facilities

443
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,919
um you don't need these unless you want

444
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:58,000
to do like real insect photography

445
00:14:53,919 --> 00:15:00,958
um well and i will say this one

446
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,278
this does disconnect and you can make

447
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:04,799
this

448
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:05,919
wireless okay i i love you dyna like but

449
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:08,240
i don't like that

450
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:09,439
on this because anytime something is

451
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,440
wireless there's a little more of a

452
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,600
delay in taking photos

453
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,279
and i want to see instantaneously the

454
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,360
picture i just took

455
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,480
and realistically i mean if if you

456
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,759
needed to if you were going to do

457
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,278
electronics and you're crawling through

458
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:22,399
an air conditioning shaft i could see

459
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,519
where you'd want it

460
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,480
wireless but for what we're doing i

461
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,600
don't think

462
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,639
that extra expense is necessary yeah

463
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,800
these plug into

464
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,480
tablets they plug and you can so mine

465
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,359
this is an adapter so i can run it into

466
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,680
my mac

467
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,800
uh suzanne uses it with her windows

468
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:41,359
laptop we're gonna

469
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:42,000
show you um an over the shoulder look

470
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,240
next

471
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,919
uh connected to this video where we'll

472
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,720
show this and some other microscope

473
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,838
options

474
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,399
but i just want to talk about these

475
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,240
before we really dive into it um

476
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,240
there's other brands that make lights

477
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,560
that look a lot like this

478
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,560
uh but the big the big deal here is the

479
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,198
quality of the objective and the quality

480
00:15:58,559 --> 00:16:00,879
of the

481
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,958
the build itself to know that it's gonna

482
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:06,000
last that they have support for

483
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:09,278
they have good software for capturing um

484
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,278
the image and uh anything else you want

485
00:16:09,278 --> 00:16:13,919
to say about i think they have the best

486
00:16:11,278 --> 00:16:14,958
photo capturing software for this kind

487
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,639
of stuff

488
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:21,198
um on the market and you can put

489
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,159
notes with the images so in the so it's

490
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:23,838
like in the metadata

491
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,679
in there because i think it's really

492
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:27,279
important to make sure you track

493
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,039
when you take an insect image what's the

494
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:30,720
host plant where you took it

495
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,480
and all that kind of information because

496
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,160
when you take macro photos

497
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,600
if you go back and look in the year it's

498
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,439
hard to tell where you were

499
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,360
landscape images yeah you know where you

500
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,040
were macro stuff and you think you're

501
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,680
going to remember the plant cultivar

502
00:16:41,039 --> 00:16:44,559
you're not so i think that's really

503
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:46,719
important and again

504
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:48,719
as you said the tech support i found

505
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,120
extremely helpful

506
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
on these and you can connect these to

507
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,399
your smartphones too

508
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,000
with um an adapter on the end again i

509
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:59,440
actually use this through my laptop

510
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
often and then i even love it more when

511
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,798
i hook it up to my flat screen tv

512
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,318
so you you can see it

513
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:08,639
super big on the screen because i like

514
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,078
seeing big bugs cool

515
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,480
all right well let's pause this and come

516
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,678
back with uh it actually hooked up to a

517
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,798
computer so we can show it

518
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:18,798
all right so see then you have the fancy

519
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:20,480
dyno light there can we talk about the

520
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:22,959
can you want to talk a little about like

521
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,798
what someone who's buying just a

522
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,078
less expensive you know middle of the

523
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:27,759
road well they're

524
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:29,200
not the middle of the road they're still

525
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:31,440
fancy pants road they are

526
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,558
sure um what i like about the dyno

527
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,798
lights is

528
00:17:32,558 --> 00:17:35,599
you have your magnification and focus on

529
00:17:34,798 --> 00:17:37,038
one wheel

530
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:38,798
um and i'll show you that in a second

531
00:17:37,038 --> 00:17:41,679
where you can zoom in

532
00:17:38,798 --> 00:17:43,519
and focus right on this one wheel but

533
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,798
they also have this soft touch button

534
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:46,798
and if you kind of i've learned if i

535
00:17:44,798 --> 00:17:48,079
angle it just right when i'm holding it

536
00:17:46,798 --> 00:17:51,038
if i hit it with my skin

537
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:52,079
just by brushing this it takes the photo

538
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:53,839
in the past

539
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:55,359
you would have to manually take the

540
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,959
photo on

541
00:17:55,359 --> 00:17:58,639
your computer so you'd get it held then

542
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,279
you'd have to go hit and

543
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
it can jerk things so having this soft

544
00:18:01,279 --> 00:18:03,440
touch

545
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:05,120
button was one of the biggest

546
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,240
advancements um

547
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:10,879
i found having this on these units

548
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,079
um and um i don't know maybe tab will

549
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
show you a close-up later but you can

550
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:16,960
see all

551
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:19,600
the led lights inside of there

552
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,160
through the software you can turn the

553
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:23,678
lights

554
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:25,038
off and on and you can control how much

555
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:27,440
light you have

556
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:29,200
and you sometimes can see the leds

557
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,840
reflecting if you have very glossy

558
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,679
insects

559
00:18:29,839 --> 00:18:33,599
but they actually do make diffusers that

560
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,320
pop into there that if you're really

561
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,959
worried about

562
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:39,359
seeing the individual lights which

563
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,120
sometimes i am for photography purposes

564
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:42,798
but not necessarily for identification

565
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,879
purposes um

566
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:45,839
and there's there's two levels of focus

567
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,600
two with them

568
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:48,959
so you can zoom in and then there's a

569
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,038
further zoom too

570
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,240
i find with mine where if i want to

571
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,119
really zoom in where it'll kind of come

572
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:56,400
into focus

573
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:57,678
at two different levels um let me

574
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,038
so you're kind of moving around i'm

575
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,919
going to zoom in on your screen so

576
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:02,480
people can kind of

577
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,520
see what's showing up while we're while

578
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,519
you're talking about it so

579
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,080
that's a boy and that's a girl okay so

580
00:19:08,558 --> 00:19:11,678
right now you have two spotted spider

581
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:12,240
mites on your screen you can see what

582
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,160
they're seeing

583
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,440
and that's a boy two spotted spider

584
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,640
white and that's a female

585
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,880
over there and then you can see there's

586
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,320
an

587
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,679
egg right up there but but that glow

588
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:24,000
you're getting in the egg is actually

589
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,480
the

590
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,519
led lights reflecting back yes here let

591
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,038
me zoom in a bit

592
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:30,639
over here i'm you know i need to look at

593
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:32,960
my screen

594
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,720
no no you're fine yeah so what what

595
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
she's doing right here is just

596
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:39,038
kind of holding it either right on or at

597
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,519
a slight angle and then with her thumb

598
00:19:39,038 --> 00:19:42,798
adjusting the magnification yeah so you

599
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:47,038
can see right there

600
00:19:42,798 --> 00:19:48,639
those spider mite eggs right in there

601
00:19:47,038 --> 00:19:50,319
and again you can see that weird

602
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:52,160
lighting ring in there a diffuser can

603
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:53,918
stop that but again for scouting

604
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,558
purposes now we know there's spider-mite

605
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,440
eggs

606
00:19:54,558 --> 00:19:58,240
and a leaf like this that has several of

607
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,519
these

608
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,319
um mite eggs it's going to be a problem

609
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:04,960
here in a

610
00:20:02,319 --> 00:20:05,439
you know very near future in a day or

611
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,200
two

612
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,960
with an explosion of spider mites on

613
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
this cannabis leaf

614
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:12,640
and again here you can see the spider

615
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,400
mites walking through them so i can get

616
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,038
her

617
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,320
sitting right there and you can see her

618
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:20,240
distinctive

619
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:22,158
you know two spots on her back and

620
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,159
that's how she gets her name's

621
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,640
name they don't always cooperate but as

622
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:28,880
long as you can see them

623
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:30,400
nope now she's running away but you

624
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:32,080
could take one of these and drop it in

625
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,080
alcohol or drop a drop of alcohol in it

626
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:36,158
and then take a look

627
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:38,158
yeah that is closer if you really wanted

628
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
yeah and you were also saying just since

629
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,799
we're talking about too spotted on this

630
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:43,519
that um

631
00:20:40,798 --> 00:20:45,519
they can have different coloration yes

632
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:48,079
and we were talking today about aphids

633
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:50,879
in particular but that you cannot use

634
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:54,079
color as a way of identification

635
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,320
with some of these insects which is

636
00:20:54,079 --> 00:20:58,639
important to note

637
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,359
yeah and you can even see it doesn't

638
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,080
show so much

639
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:05,199
on your screen but how this is way more

640
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:07,199
green and darker than actually this one

641
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,240
you see an adult male sitting right up

642
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,558
here

643
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,919
just sitting the males are skinnier and

644
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:14,879
pointier on the back

645
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,320
side there so that's the the male

646
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
sitting right there the male two spotted

647
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,279
spider mite

648
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,119
and actually the one above it if you

649
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:24,480
count it's a very young spider mite

650
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:26,639
it only has six legs when they're first

651
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,960
born they only have six legs

652
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,799
and then as they grow up then they'll

653
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,480
have eight legs like an adult so that's

654
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:34,240
an immature two-spot spider right back

655
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,720
there with its uh six legs

656
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,279
and that's the molting remains down

657
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,079
below there

658
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:41,038
yeah these are the cast skins off uh two

659
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,798
spot spider mites

660
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:44,240
and almost they almost crack in the

661
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:45,679
middle and then they come

662
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,120
out of the middle of it and then the

663
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,080
front and the back half of their molt

664
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:51,359
left behind

665
00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:54,319
and this one down here um

666
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,439
is getting ready to mold because i was

667
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:57,439
telling you earlier

668
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,279
they get this weird kind of sheen to

669
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,400
them and kind of do this resting things

670
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:05,759
before they shed their skin

671
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,919
okay great and then since we this is on

672
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:09,919
the cannabis leaf by the way

673
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,440
i also have this stand here i just want

674
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:14,080
to mention it as

675
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,919
i bought it suzanne has one neither of

676
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:18,079
us particularly like to use it

677
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,440
i'm missing a part on it i just noticed

678
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,079
just now that it actually comes out a

679
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,400
fork that

680
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:23,599
holds the light like this and then

681
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,200
there's this

682
00:22:23,599 --> 00:22:26,719
lever here that allows you to raise it

683
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,360
up and down but we

684
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,839
we both much much more prefer to just

685
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:32,000
use it

686
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:33,279
in our hand rather than using the stand

687
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,919
so if you do decide to get something

688
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,519
like this

689
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,919
i would hold off on buying the stand

690
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:39,119
until you know for sure it's something

691
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,559
you want to use

692
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:42,399
but today we were looking a little bit

693
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:44,000
at some soil trying to find see if i had

694
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,038
we could find any mites and some soil i

695
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,640
had outside

696
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,798
we pulled a bunch of leaves out of the

697
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,679
yard we found some

698
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:52,639
caterpillars stink bug two spotted

699
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,200
surfer fly

700
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,799
surfing fly which i posted a video of

701
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:59,200
and uh

702
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:00,558
anything else about this particular the

703
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,000
dyno light before we move on to other

704
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:04,000
microscopes um

705
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,440
the one thing about this is it comes in

706
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,759
like a plastic

707
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,120
little sleeve and a bag i always put it

708
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:12,000
back in its plastic

709
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:13,678
sleeve and bag um this one's yours and

710
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,159
you do not have the plastic insert in

711
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,240
there

712
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,240
oh well but it's fine because i just

713
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,960
keep it clean in there because you don't

714
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,079
want to get goo up in your lens i'm i'm

715
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:24,159
captain anal about

716
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:25,119
keeping my lenses clean because that's a

717
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,840
good pointer okay

718
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:28,479
when you know when you're taking macro

719
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:31,199
stuff

720
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,759
a tiny little speck becomes a huge spec

721
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,519
yeah

722
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:34,798
on your screen and so it's very

723
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,798
important to keep all your equipment

724
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:39,599
clean so i always keep it in the little

725
00:23:36,798 --> 00:23:40,400
slip-on sleeve and then keep it in the

726
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:43,038
bag

727
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,080
um and i fly with these well now that

728
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,240
i'm back traveling again

729
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:47,678
every week and i just i have them in my

730
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,440
backpack and it travels with me fine

731
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,960
i've never broken a dynalite with all

732
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:53,200
the flying and throwing in the overhead

733
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,798
bin and everything

734
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,960
well we don't have a dissecting

735
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,400
microscope here uh

736
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
that's back at suzanne's place maybe

737
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
we'll add a video to that here on the

738
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,079
end

739
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,240
possibly when she gets back home but i

740
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:04,720
do want to show you guys uh just the

741
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,839
more

742
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:11,919
traditional compound microscope

743
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:13,918
okay take two let's talk about uh

744
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,600
my microscopes here so this is a phase

745
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,400
contrast microscope this one's made by

746
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:20,240
meiji it's

747
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:22,480
japan this is what i use for looking at

748
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,079
compost tea or soil samples in a lot of

749
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,960
cases

750
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:27,519
not great for looking at insects not

751
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,278
this

752
00:24:27,519 --> 00:24:32,158
design but my meiji dissecting scope i

753
00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:34,240
have meiji too

754
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,760
and i love it that's great for looking

755
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,159
at

756
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,759
anything bigger than an aphid anything

757
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,880
smaller you almost have to slide them

758
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:43,839
out and use

759
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:46,799
a compound microscope like this so this

760
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:48,480
is a phase contrast microscope

761
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:50,240
which allows you to see things that are

762
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,120
similar to fraction than water which is

763
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,319
really nice

764
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:54,158
when we're talking about something like

765
00:24:52,319 --> 00:24:58,240
compost tea because we're it's literally

766
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:58,240
in a liquid liquid water so

767
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,798
you don't need this necessarily though

768
00:25:01,038 --> 00:25:05,278
if we're talking about

769
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,319
uh you know someone who wanted just a

770
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:08,159
hobby

771
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:09,678
grower who wants to look at you know

772
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,679
look at microbes

773
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,120
suzanne you mentioned one from celestron

774
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,038
celestron celestron

775
00:25:13,119 --> 00:25:16,879
that you really liked yeah and i'll put

776
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:18,400
a link to that model up i think she said

777
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,039
he said it's around 350

778
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:22,080
yep so that's a great option for people

779
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:23,839
when we're talking about

780
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:25,119
quality of microscopes the things to

781
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,798
consider uh

782
00:25:25,119 --> 00:25:29,119
first and foremost is the quality of the

783
00:25:26,798 --> 00:25:31,038
objectives that's these things down here

784
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:32,719
these are the lenses essentially that

785
00:25:31,038 --> 00:25:33,839
are that are magnifying

786
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:37,200
what you're going to see through the

787
00:25:33,839 --> 00:25:38,879
image here so um

788
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,558
you're going to take your objective and

789
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,400
multiply it by your eyepiece and that

790
00:25:40,558 --> 00:25:45,200
tells you your total magnification

791
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,640
most eyepieces are 10x you can get

792
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,919
things like a barlow lens here that's

793
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,278
going to give you a smaller field of

794
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,880
view but like this will multiply it

795
00:25:49,278 --> 00:25:53,599
another three times

796
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,600
i rarely use this in here but it can

797
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,959
slide into the eyepiece too

798
00:25:55,599 --> 00:26:00,798
um having a trinocular microscope

799
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,798
is really nice i would not buy a

800
00:26:00,798 --> 00:26:04,960
microscope unless it was triacular

801
00:26:02,798 --> 00:26:06,480
anymore today yeah so this if it didn't

802
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,120
have this it'd just be a binocular or

803
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,599
they have a monocular with one lens

804
00:26:09,119 --> 00:26:12,798
some microscopes have built-in cameras

805
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:15,359
already

806
00:26:12,798 --> 00:26:16,158
this setup that i have here was pretty

807
00:26:15,359 --> 00:26:17,678
expensive

808
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,440
it's probably about six or seven

809
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:20,960
thousand dollars at the time

810
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,000
um you know this little adapter here

811
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,480
allows me to hook up a canon uh

812
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,599
digital camera so i could do photos and

813
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,200
video

814
00:26:27,599 --> 00:26:31,038
um and again that comes down to the

815
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,720
quality of the of the camera cause some

816
00:26:31,038 --> 00:26:33,200
of my built-in cameras and i've seen the

817
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,440
quality

818
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:37,840
really vary sometimes it's not good well

819
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,120
and often times well built-in cameras

820
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:40,720
you're not going to be able to improve

821
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,158
your camera over time i would never get

822
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,880
a built-in one because

823
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:47,039
photography is is greatly improving

824
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,679
fastly you know going mirrorless now and

825
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:50,960
a lot of the

826
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:52,798
the dslrs on that also

827
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,400
when i was researching microscope

828
00:26:52,798 --> 00:26:55,918
cameras um

829
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,240
you kind of have to make your decision

830
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,640
do you want really good video quality

831
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,640
which has a lower frame i'm sorry a

832
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,640
higher frame rate so it's more seamless

833
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,240
but you do that you give up

834
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,440
quality on the still pictures but if you

835
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,120
want better still pictures you're going

836
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,679
to get jerky videos they

837
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:13,038
i really struggle to find a good camera

838
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,840
that does

839
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:17,679
both of them so you kind of make a

840
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:20,240
decision on your camera on what you want

841
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,759
to do

842
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,079
yeah and then some other things this

843
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:25,119
isn't so much on how to use a microscope

844
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:26,879
but some of the other

845
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:28,798
parts that come with the microscope to

846
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,320
consider uh you know there's different

847
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:32,639
filters

848
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,240
filter lenses that may make it easier or

849
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,919
harder to see certain

850
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:37,519
certain things i like to keep this blue

851
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,880
one on here i find it makes it easier

852
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:40,879
for me to see things

853
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,080
um and then i think one thing i hadn't

854
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,679
talked about was the

855
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,759
the light the wattage of the light or

856
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:48,798
intensity of the light is huge

857
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,879
this is a 30 watt light versus a lot of

858
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,679
them are 20 so it just it pushes up more

859
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,880
like because as you go to a higher

860
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:57,679
magnification you need more light at the

861
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,000
same time

862
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:01,360
being able like to dim the light which

863
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,359
is the switch right here

864
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,798
when i'm looking at a compost tea sample

865
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:06,158
and i want to keep things from drying

866
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:07,519
out and keep it alive because i want to

867
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,278
look at it longer i'm going to dim the

868
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,519
light to the lowest level but that still

869
00:28:09,278 --> 00:28:14,079
allows me to see my sample

870
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,359
in this case here i just since we're

871
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:18,079
talking about it

872
00:28:15,359 --> 00:28:18,798
slide cover slip i cheat and do two

873
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,759
purse line

874
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:23,759
i don't know if that's uh a bad thing

875
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:24,558
but it saves me a little time so i also

876
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:27,278
you know you're gonna have you're gonna

877
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:30,480
need cover slips um

878
00:28:27,278 --> 00:28:33,200
pipettes are handy and then this is the

879
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,558
uh immersion oil which allows you to use

880
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,759
the highest magnification

881
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,000
um in this case it's a 100x which

882
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,440
which translates to 1000x by the time

883
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:43,679
you look through here now

884
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,360
for me like you mentioned earlier you

885
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,480
spend most of your time at 10x or the

886
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:49,759
jeweler's loop

887
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:52,880
i spend most of my time at uh 20x

888
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:55,278
and um what's this other one here

889
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,440
oh 10x so 100 and 200 times

890
00:28:55,278 --> 00:28:59,519
magnification is where i spend

891
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,038
90 of my time it's only when i want to

892
00:28:59,519 --> 00:29:02,240
really look at like some bacteria or

893
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,599
something really really close that i

894
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,880
ever even go up to 400 times

895
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:07,839
magnification

896
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,200
um you certainly i never even use the

897
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:12,000
100x

898
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
i've never needed it so what do you what

899
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,798
do you have to say about microscopes

900
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
well i mean when i was researching

901
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,839
because i had my meiji dissecting scope

902
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,679
and then i wanted to get

903
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,798
um a similar setup to this

904
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:27,038
i went and talked to a lot of the

905
00:29:24,798 --> 00:29:28,798
microscope companies because i don't use

906
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:30,960
this setup nearly as much i do my

907
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:33,278
dissecting scope and the one thing that

908
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,159
came back over and over again is eye

909
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:37,278
strain

910
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,120
and that the better quality glass

911
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:41,519
you have in your scope is going to have

912
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:43,278
less eye strain so for researchers who

913
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,879
spend like eight hours a day to scope

914
00:29:43,278 --> 00:29:45,839
that's why they have these you know 50

915
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,240
60 000

916
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:49,278
microscopes because it greatly reduces

917
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,599
eye strain

918
00:29:49,278 --> 00:29:52,880
for me you know if i'm looking at let's

919
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:54,719
say a thrift sample

920
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,480
i may spend 10 minutes looking at it so

921
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:58,240
i wasn't as concerned so that's why i

922
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,480
feel i didn't have to be as

923
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,440
in a high price range but having the

924
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,720
moving stage

925
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,080
was really important for me um

926
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:11,120
because i actually spent i still have my

927
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:14,000
um microscope from when i was a kid

928
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:15,038
oh okay yeah and i look at that thing

929
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,720
and

930
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:18,879
you know that you had just two little

931
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:20,798
clips that you had to slide

932
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,080
the slide around with your hands and it

933
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,918
was a monocular

934
00:30:22,079 --> 00:30:26,398
and my dad actually installed a dimmer

935
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,038
switch on the light so i could adjust my

936
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:29,519
light

937
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:31,519
okay um yeah i found it the other day

938
00:30:29,519 --> 00:30:34,398
wow i've kept it all these years

939
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:36,558
but um the moving stage really makes

940
00:30:34,398 --> 00:30:38,479
your life so much easier to be able to

941
00:30:36,558 --> 00:30:40,480
do the fine adjustments

942
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,558
on there and again that's with that

943
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,640
celestron scope i really liked it had

944
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:46,798
the dimmable lights the adjustable stage

945
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,679
you can go all the way up and do the oil

946
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:51,278
immersion

947
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,240
it comes as a tri-ocular

948
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,519
which you can it comes with a cap on it

949
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,640
you pop it off

950
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:59,759
and then you can attach whether you want

951
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,000
to do

952
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:03,679
you can get microscope cameras that

953
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,119
almost look like dino light it's a tube

954
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:08,080
that just drops in

955
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:10,479
dslr or you're going to use one of the

956
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:12,000
forms of the the digicams

957
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,240
that you can get adapters but you're

958
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,079
right the adapter tubes since they often

959
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,759
have to be custom made

960
00:31:16,079 --> 00:31:19,278
when three to five hundred dollars and

961
00:31:17,759 --> 00:31:21,919
so every time

962
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:23,440
i had to get a new camera because you

963
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,559
know gotta have more megapixels wouldn't

964
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,759
have a better camera

965
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:28,240
it's another three to five hundred

966
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:31,440
dollar investment every time you upgrade

967
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,880
so it does um get expensive

968
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,880
and the quality of the metal is

969
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,080
important and i don't want to knock any

970
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,120
microscope companies

971
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:39,918
and scope but i bought just a stand from

972
00:31:39,119 --> 00:31:41,359
amsco

973
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,440
but then the third time i'm using it i

974
00:31:41,359 --> 00:31:45,119
went to twist one piece of metals and

975
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,960
snapped right in half it's made from

976
00:31:45,119 --> 00:31:50,000
what i'd call chineseium

977
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,360
and it's like that plastic metal hybrid

978
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,798
i don't even know what it is and there's

979
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:54,558
like no fixing it now

980
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:56,000
so you know william's gonna have to

981
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:59,119
drill it out and try to

982
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:02,558
fix it for me um because i have some

983
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,278
very jerry rigged equipment at home

984
00:32:02,558 --> 00:32:07,678
for doing you know the macro insect

985
00:32:05,278 --> 00:32:09,119
photography work i do

986
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,720
the other thing that's really really

987
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,639
important

988
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,480
is to keep your microscope covered and

989
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,200
keep it cleaned if you want to get your

990
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:18,399
microscope

991
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,720
serviced um where you know it's good to

992
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:20,319
do

993
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:22,480
like every 10 years they clean and

994
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:24,480
everything um it's about 300

995
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,759
to get your microscope serviced yeah

996
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,519
this this one's due

997
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:28,720
i'm finding i'm seeing a lot of things

998
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,599
that i shouldn't be seeing yeah i

999
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,038
mentioned that's

1000
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,278
and the other thing i don't have here

1001
00:32:31,038 --> 00:32:33,599
that i left over my actual microscope

1002
00:32:33,278 --> 00:32:36,079
stand

1003
00:32:33,599 --> 00:32:37,519
is kim wipes and those are wonderful

1004
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:40,319
because they allow you to clean

1005
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:42,399
surfaces without damaging the lens um

1006
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:45,599
because you have to have special

1007
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:47,518
cleaner for that too um

1008
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:48,879
i guess the one big takeaway i want for

1009
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,839
people to think about

1010
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,240
is that there's no perfect microscope

1011
00:32:51,839 --> 00:32:56,480
for any scenario so for me

1012
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,278
because my interest was soil-based

1013
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,679
microbes

1014
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,000
and for looking at like bacteria fungal

1015
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,360
hyphae looking at compost teas

1016
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,240
this was the setup that made the most

1017
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:08,959
sense for me now if i was more into

1018
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,440
insects like suzanne then a dissecting

1019
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,519
microscope would be a more useful tool

1020
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,640
beyond you know what you can see in the

1021
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:17,200
dyno light right

1022
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,000
and you know with the dissecting scopes

1023
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:21,120
too

1024
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,679
you can get more magnification

1025
00:33:21,119 --> 00:33:25,518
by you can buy extra magnification that

1026
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:27,679
screws on underneath so you can get

1027
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,440
higher resolution it's basically

1028
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,960
where these microscopes have the oculars

1029
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:33,038
all built and you can rotate you just

1030
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,919
unscrew them and add them on so you

1031
00:33:33,038 --> 00:33:37,919
can improve your magnification and you

1032
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,799
know you can easily see spider mites and

1033
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,440
things like that

1034
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:43,440
with that but with the dissecting scope

1035
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,798
you can put like a branch you can put a

1036
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
leaf you can put three dimensional

1037
00:33:44,798 --> 00:33:48,558
objects

1038
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:52,398
with this you have to slide mount things

1039
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:56,000
and i see a lot of compound microscopes

1040
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:57,678
at facilities but people are trying to

1041
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,398
wedge a leaf under and it doesn't work

1042
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,759
that way

1043
00:33:58,398 --> 00:34:01,439
if you're going to look at leads and

1044
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:04,319
things like that you really need

1045
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,159
the dissecting scope you do because the

1046
00:34:04,319 --> 00:34:07,678
lights coming from below

1047
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,119
so if that light's not getting through

1048
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,440
it's going to be pitch black looking

1049
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,519
down

1050
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,358
now you brought up one thing i have

1051
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:15,039
cheated before when i need to use this

1052
00:34:13,358 --> 00:34:16,078
scope and i didn't have like a dyno

1053
00:34:15,039 --> 00:34:18,079
light at the time

1054
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,399
you can't take a flashlight or even your

1055
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,119
phone light and shine light from above

1056
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:24,239
to allow you to get enough light to see

1057
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,760
what's on there

1058
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,118
what's on the slide if you're using a

1059
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,720
leaf or something like i was trying to

1060
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,559
see a broad mic at the time and i didn't

1061
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,118
have any other tools and so this allowed

1062
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:32,960
me

1063
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,800
to it was really hard and a pain in the

1064
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,358
butt but just a little like

1065
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,560
tip the other thing i will say is if

1066
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:39,918
you're spending

1067
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:42,878
a sizable amount of money on a

1068
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:44,960
microscope talk to the manufacturer

1069
00:34:42,878 --> 00:34:46,319
they let me they let me borrow this

1070
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,960
microscope i mean i

1071
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,480
paid for it um but i had a time period

1072
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,000
where i could try it out and see if it

1073
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,838
worked for my use because

1074
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,119
i wanted to make sure you know that was

1075
00:34:53,838 --> 00:34:56,719
a chunk of money i was going to be

1076
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,480
spending it's a huge investment

1077
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,919
you know in my case this is a lifetime

1078
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,639
investment that i'm going to use

1079
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,599
for a long time i want to know um the

1080
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:05,519
quality of it

1081
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:06,800
the and what it actually looks like when

1082
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:07,759
i'm looking at what i'm going to be

1083
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,320
looking at in this case

1084
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,760
you know compost teas um am i going to

1085
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,920
be able to see everything i want to see

1086
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,280
so that's absolutely an option there's

1087
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:17,280
sales reps out there that will

1088
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:18,640
bring one out and let you use it prior

1089
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,000
to purchasing even

1090
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:23,838
um so i just want to share that tip

1091
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,000
yeah i was fortunate because i go to the

1092
00:35:23,838 --> 00:35:28,400
entomological society of america

1093
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,800
conference each year and then the trade

1094
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,599
they have the microscope vendors there

1095
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,440
and i went around and talked to them um

1096
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,200
because when i was gonna buy a compound

1097
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,400
scope i was expecting to spend several

1098
00:35:37,199 --> 00:35:40,879
thousand dollars

1099
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,519
and the celestron guy is like try if you

1100
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,119
don't like it

1101
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:45,519
you know you can always you know return

1102
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:46,480
it but i i've been i've had it now i

1103
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:49,920
think two years

1104
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,719
and um again i i don't spend hours a day

1105
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,760
at it

1106
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:54,799
but for what it is it's it's it's been

1107
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:56,320
great

1108
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,839
mom i really like it having an

1109
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,200
adjustable eyepiece too

1110
00:35:57,838 --> 00:36:02,719
is really really important um because

1111
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:05,118
you need to be able to adjust these

1112
00:36:02,719 --> 00:36:05,679
until it's almost like looking at those

1113
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,358
old

1114
00:36:05,679 --> 00:36:11,358
3d things where you stare like a image

1115
00:36:09,358 --> 00:36:13,759
and no it's like uh yeah you know those

1116
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,639
popular photos where the image would pop

1117
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,040
out if you like your

1118
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:21,598
eyes like relax oh no no no no the books

1119
00:36:19,039 --> 00:36:23,039
the pictures yeah yeah the um and not

1120
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:24,720
everyone could do it well that's what i

1121
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:26,000
kind of equate to like these eye pieces

1122
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:27,279
like you have to give them you almost

1123
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,719
have to relax your eyes and then get

1124
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:30,240
them to fit perfectly in order to get a

1125
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:31,598
really good image and so having this be

1126
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:35,199
adjustable is important

1127
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,000
and if you're going to buy a microscope

1128
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:39,519
get the tri-ocular and stop holding your

1129
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,760
camera right here

1130
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:43,039
and trying to get those janky pictures

1131
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,560
through your cell phone

1132
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:46,079
if you're gonna do it go ahead and get a

1133
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:48,559
camera that mounts on it so you can get

1134
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,079
better images because it's really hard

1135
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:52,719
to identify those half out of focus in

1136
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,599
focus

1137
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,000
holding my cell phone over the holes

1138
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,599
well

1139
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,519
the dynolite solves all that you

1140
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:00,079
shouldn't be taking insect photos with

1141
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,679
this

1142
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,880
um anyway i mean if you want to look at

1143
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,159
fungal hyphae and you want to look at

1144
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,760
bacteria which you wouldn't be sending

1145
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,000
to suzanne anyway

1146
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,640
um then you would use this type of

1147
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:13,519
microscope yeah but you can save money

1148
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,000
200 for a dyno light and then get a high

1149
00:37:13,519 --> 00:37:15,519
quality

1150
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,280
image where you're not using your cell

1151
00:37:15,519 --> 00:37:18,559
phone um that allows you to actually

1152
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,240
capture an insight right

1153
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:24,320
good enough to identify yeah um

1154
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,279
so do you wanna do a quick summary here

1155
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,720
before we

1156
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,400
sign off sure must have tools

1157
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,598
in the growers 10x hand lens if i show

1158
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,920
up in your facility

1159
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,359
you do not have a 10x hand lens you're

1160
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,800
going to get a very disappointing look

1161
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:43,119
for me

1162
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:46,160
okay 10x hand lens um

1163
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,480
some board or some way to to identify

1164
00:37:46,159 --> 00:37:48,319
and

1165
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
to identify insects and knock them off

1166
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,680
of plants right and collect them with

1167
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:55,440
vials

1168
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:57,279
vials and alcohol alcohol some type of

1169
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,119
marking tape if you need to flag plants

1170
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,160
i think is really important

1171
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,760
um and again the dynalite you can

1172
00:38:02,159 --> 00:38:05,199
hook up and use while you're actually

1173
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,640
scouting i

1174
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:08,319
have challenges with that actually on

1175
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:08,960
the facility sometime with having the

1176
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,880
phone

1177
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,960
having bright light trying to flat

1178
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,320
surface because it's you can't really

1179
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,559
use a dino light

1180
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:18,800
like with loose plant leaves it needs to

1181
00:38:16,559 --> 00:38:20,400
be on a solid surface

1182
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,359
soon then you can use it with your phone

1183
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,880
i think you're better off collecting

1184
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:27,279
your leaf samples and taking them

1185
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,280
back to your little setup

1186
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,799
very rarely would i ever recommend

1187
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:34,239
anyone buy

1188
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:36,640
an actual microscope like this um

1189
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:37,838
or even a dissecting scope unless it's

1190
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,400
something that you're really passionate

1191
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,159
about

1192
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,480
or really interested in i don't think

1193
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:44,239
most facilities need to have a

1194
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,559
microscope for what they're doing

1195
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,838
um i just want to i think there's

1196
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:49,279
there's other things you could spend

1197
00:38:47,838 --> 00:38:52,239
money on within

1198
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:53,680
the ipm world or the scouting world like

1199
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,479
a dyno light that would be much more

1200
00:38:53,679 --> 00:39:00,319
useful than

1201
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:10,000
um something like this so here we go

1202
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:10,000
all right
