1
00:00:02,158 --> 00:00:05,960
hey guys so I probably spent an

2
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:09,080
inordinate amount of time thinking about

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,960
soils and potting soils and soiless

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:14,638
recipes and things like that and I'm

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:16,679
currently in a conversation thread with

6
00:00:14,638 --> 00:00:19,480
some really smart individuals uh Steve

7
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:22,160
dver uh Steve Solomon and some other

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,719
folks talking about some recipes because

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,399
uh one gentleman reached out um wanting

10
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,678
to try a recipe that he saw online and

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:30,038
it just it made me think a little bit

12
00:00:28,678 --> 00:00:32,399
more about this and I wanted to just

13
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,480
share some considerations that people

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,039
should have when creating their own

15
00:00:34,479 --> 00:00:41,000
soils so uh first and foremost um I

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,359
believe that soil should be formulated

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,759
around your compost because most people

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:47,238
you know whether it's cou mix or some

19
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:50,320
other recipes it just says you know Pete

20
00:00:47,238 --> 00:00:53,599
Moss or coca cor uh pmus or some form of

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:56,480
variation and then compost well your

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,600
compost is a huge factor in determining

23
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,038
your overall fertility and it can change

24
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,399
dramatically it could be high in nit

25
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,519
rates the C to n ratio could be off um

26
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:08,759
it could be very high in potassium or

27
00:01:06,519 --> 00:01:11,438
phosphorus or potentially even a trace

28
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:13,840
mineral it could be high in chlorides or

29
00:01:11,438 --> 00:01:16,118
salts um and that could be an issue too

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,000
so the quality of your compost is

31
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:20,280
important but just not the not only just

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,078
the quality but the balance of those

33
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,599
minerals will affect what you want to

34
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,519
add to it because if I take a compost

35
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,280
that's already high in let's say

36
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:30,759
potassium and then I add a whole bunch

37
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:33,680
more potassium to it um I'm going to be

38
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,000
creating um some some nutrient

39
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,118
imbalances um potentially some

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,519
antagonisms and my plants aren't going

41
00:01:38,118 --> 00:01:43,040
to be as healthy as I may want them to

42
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,399
be so first and foremost now when I go

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,920
to formulate a soil it'll take me a year

44
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,599
or two before I'm really comfortable

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,799
releasing a recipe um internally you

46
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:54,438
know in terms of one of our own soil

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:58,719
mixes because I want to mix that soil I

48
00:01:54,438 --> 00:02:00,158
want to test the soil multiple times and

49
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:02,599
then once I feel good about about the

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,640
test results I want to run plant trials

51
00:02:02,599 --> 00:02:08,399
so all of this before I would ever

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,639
release a mix uh to the public so that's

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,318
probably Overkill you know and if you're

54
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,199
uh you know a hom grower and you just

55
00:02:12,318 --> 00:02:16,199
want to mix your own recipe you don't

56
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:18,919
need to go to that extent but a soil

57
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:20,878
test is really the only actionable

58
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,399
information that we data that we can

59
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:26,280
collect to allow us to make improvements

60
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,719
on our soil mix so keep that in mind um

61
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:32,719
so if you if you want to do it um

62
00:02:28,719 --> 00:02:34,800
optimally then plan on budgeting the $60

63
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,199
for a complete test at least once so you

64
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,760
can at least say okay oh wow this

65
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,199
doesn't nearly have the nitrates that I

66
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:43,639
thought I did or ammonium is high I need

67
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,479
to let this cycle for a while uh before

68
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:48,039
I plant into it I'm going to have issues

69
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:49,639
so all considerations and and in some

70
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:51,439
cases we find you may even need to flush

71
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:53,079
because you may have added too much and

72
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:57,120
some of these online recipes that I'm

73
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,640
seeing um wow one of them uh Steve dver

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,480
calculated out the pounds of amendments

75
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:03,399
that that they were recommending in 4

76
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:06,798
cubic feet of soil and it was it was

77
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,480
almost 54 lb that is way too much

78
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:13,439
fertilizer or amendments for essentially

79
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:15,399
30 gallons of soil um we have created a

80
00:03:13,439 --> 00:03:18,519
nutrient pack and I created this years

81
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,560
ago as uh sort of the similar kind of

82
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:22,280
thing like hey what if you know shipping

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,920
soil is expensive what if someone wants

84
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,759
like the nutrient mineral portion of

85
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:28,919
what we put in our soil so ours weighs

86
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,239
about 14 lb for cubic feet I happen to

87
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:33,359
have one here with me so I'll just show

88
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,640
it to you here this is our nutrient pack

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,040
um like I said it's about 14 lbs and

90
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:40,919
again it's just my best guess at what um

91
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:43,560
you would need if you were using a low

92
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:46,359
fertility soil mix initially like a

93
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,759
let's say like Happy Frog or Pro mix

94
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,080
would be good starting points um or if

95
00:03:48,759 --> 00:03:52,479
you're mixing your own using high

96
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,840
quality compost but again I don't know

97
00:03:52,479 --> 00:03:55,798
what that compost fraction is that

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,878
you're using so your results can vary

99
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,400
wide you know very widely and uh as C

100
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,039
would always say like no one's actually

101
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,879
growing a cots mix but him because you

102
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:05,719
don't have his vermac compost I think

103
00:04:03,878 --> 00:04:07,120
that's a really important point when

104
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,639
we're thinking about mixing our own

105
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:13,480
soils is you know that compost fraction

106
00:04:10,639 --> 00:04:16,039
is the most important the most important

107
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,478
fraction from a biological perspective

108
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,720
but also from a nutrient perspective

109
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:20,358
because it's going to either be bringing

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,759
in or not bringing in quite a bit of

111
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:23,039
fertility that you'll want to account

112
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,120
for with the Amendments that you're

113
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,360
adding so I don't want to discourage

114
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,439
anyone from mixing your own soils I i'

115
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,879
say go for it just be aware that you may

116
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:33,918
have have a lot more variability than

117
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:36,360
you realize in your final results and uh

118
00:04:33,918 --> 00:04:38,519
the best advice I was ever given and I'm

119
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,680
going to pass on is less is more you

120
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:42,478
know always undershoot your targets you

121
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,478
can always add more nutrients during the

122
00:04:42,478 --> 00:04:46,758
cycle but it's really really hard to

123
00:04:44,478 --> 00:04:49,319
deal with issues if you have um

124
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:51,720
toxicities or too much of anything um

125
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,599
and then test your EC test your pH those

126
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:55,560
are going to give you some more

127
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,039
actionable data to decide okay I've

128
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,800
added enough fertility I may not know

129
00:04:57,038 --> 00:05:01,038
what that fertility is but I know that

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,639
I've got approxim how much I want and my

131
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:05,159
pH is within the range that I'm aiming

132
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,240
for so those are all good tools and then

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:10,039
just to show you guys I just finished

134
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:12,280
tring this um I turned this off because

135
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:16,959
I didn't want a bunch of noise in the

136
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:19,079
background but I am setting up here uh

137
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:22,359
some under canopy air flow that I'm

138
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,719
pretty excited about so yeah hope

139
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,479
everyone has a great day thanks for

140
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,479
checking out the video
