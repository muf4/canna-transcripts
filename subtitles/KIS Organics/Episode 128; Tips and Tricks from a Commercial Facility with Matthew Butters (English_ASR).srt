welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,480
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,079
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,278
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:30,198
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,719
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,399
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:31,719 --> 00:00:36,039
knowledge before starting the podcast I

10
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,878
wanted to let listeners know that I plan

11
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:40,119
on adding more interviews of Growers

12
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,878
this season while the original intention

13
00:00:40,119 --> 00:00:44,038
of the podcast was to bridge the gap

14
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:46,359
between academic research and real life

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:48,000
cultivation I've done a wide variety of

16
00:00:46,359 --> 00:00:49,558
interviews over the years and I think

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,759
it's important to hear how Growers are

18
00:00:49,558 --> 00:00:54,198
dealing with real day-to-day issues in

19
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:55,960
their cultivation facilities as we don't

20
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:57,358
typically get to grow under perfect

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,518
conditions and control for every

22
00:00:57,359 --> 00:01:01,600
variable so while these interviews might

23
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:03,518
beight slightly less scientific and may

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,799
contain some personal experiences and

25
00:01:03,518 --> 00:01:08,400
anecdotal information my hope is that it

26
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:10,280
will spark new ideas research and help

27
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,520
Growers deal with real life scenarios

28
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,519
that they may be facing as well and grow

29
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:18,000
the community in the spirit of this my

30
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:19,438

just listening to you and your esteemed

57
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:18,598

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:20,840
you uh recently in person at Smokey

59
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,959
Point productions your current facility

60
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,560
that you're working at uh can you just

61
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,000
give us a quick background about uh sort

62
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,000
of who you are and and what what you're

63
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,080
doing in the industry

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,919
yeah absolutely so I started out as a as

65
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,640
a home grower jumped around um from from

66
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:41,199
grow to grow just learning as much as I

67
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,119
could from each one being a sponge

68
00:02:41,199 --> 00:02:45,119
absorbing as much as I can from each and

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:49,039
every you know Mentor or colleague that

70
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,239
I had um and I ended up here at Smoky

71
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:54,079
Point couldn't be more thankful it's an

72
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,319
amazing company to work for and yeah

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,519
excellent

74
00:02:55,318 --> 00:03:00,479
opportunity so I I thought it might be

75
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:03,759
interesting for Growers uh because some

76
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:05,759
of my most popular podcasts are um are

77
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:07,239
ones when we're talking to actual

78
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:09,598
Growers because and that's who people

79
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,759
want to hear from so uh one of the

80
00:03:09,598 --> 00:03:15,679
questions that I had was um as you

81
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:17,878
started your sort of experience in this

82
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,799
industry let's let's kind of go back to

83
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:22,079
where you started and maybe a few things

84
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,439
that you learned kind of each stop along

85
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,200
the way so someone can kind of have an

86
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:28,680
idea of what it takes to become the head

87
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:30,479
grower of a you know a pretty large

88
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,640
facility

89
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:35,598
I would love to yeah so I started just

90
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:37,559
humble beginnings as a homeg grower I

91
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:39,199
always had a very intimate relationship

92
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,840
with the plant it helped me on my

93
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:45,199
personal Journey tremendously and so

94
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:49,158
started growing plants at my house and

95
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:51,679
dove into that um and it was really you

96
00:03:49,158 --> 00:03:54,479
know people putting out information just

97
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,680
like yourself and uh I know one of your

98
00:03:54,479 --> 00:04:00,679
guests Jeff lenells he really sparked my

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,680
interest for organic cultivation

100
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,079
um with teaming with microbes and that

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:09,079
series and so just reading every you

102
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:11,239
know little tidbit or every book that I

103
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,959
could and trying to suck up all the

104
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,079
knowledge that I could and then test it

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:18,439
you know in real time whether it was at

106
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,079
my house or at the grow was just my way

107
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:22,079
of stepping up and using each

108
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,519
opportunity as a learning

109
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,800
experience um taking advantage of every

110
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:30,560
Mentor or consultant that I could and

111
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,120
just you know growing alongside the

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,519
plants no pun

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,000
intended so you said you started off

114
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:41,839
just with hom grows what what did your

115
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,199
first hom grows look like um how what

116
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:47,439
style of growing were you doing yeah so

117
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,800
I actually uh would uh do a whole room

118
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:51,639
so most people would do tents I think is

119
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,439
how how they would do it I would turn

120
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,319
whole rooms into a grow and I loved all

121
00:04:55,439 --> 00:05:00,000
types of plants not just cannabis so I

122
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:02,038
like all plants with ethnobotanic iCal

123
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,360
significance or you know historical

124
00:05:02,038 --> 00:05:06,319
significance with humans I think that

125
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,600
cannabis is an amazing amazing plant but

126
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:11,240
there's a lot of other plants out there

127
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,479
too so um I grow all types of plants

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:17,439
from you know even tobacco Nicon Rustica

129
00:05:15,478 --> 00:05:20,279
um

130
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:22,199
to all all sort cacti all sorts of

131
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,638
plants at my house so I turn entire

132
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:27,160
rooms into into grows use back then it

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:28,720
was HPS that was your only option i'

134
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,880
kind of lined everything in plastic and

135
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,960
have like a little pass through area it

136
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,680
was

137
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:36,599
pretty um kind of state-of-the-art for

138
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,720
back then for being just in a house

139
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:41,160
right and so I had a lot of cleanliness

140
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,560
protocols that I still had and I was

141
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,960
growing in soil at the time and just

142
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,918
learning as much as I could and then

143
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:48,918
testing things real time there a lot of

144
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:54,038
trial and error a lot of killing plants

145
00:05:48,918 --> 00:05:55,359
to be honest um yeah were using like a

146
00:05:54,038 --> 00:05:57,639
nutrient line or were you mixing your

147
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,080
own soil back then how were you how are

148
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,319
you approaching it I was buying uh

149
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:06,598
pre-made soil mixes and then uh testing

150
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,560
different amendments you know just like

151
00:06:06,598 --> 00:06:11,120
the the teaming with microb stuff I i'

152
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,800
used basically worm castings and teas

153
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,840
since the beginning of my cultivation

154
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,918
career I was using uh fish ulion and

155
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:20,000
humic acid so I I started off on the

156
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,240
right foot honestly um and I got this

157
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,759
information from other Growers who Who

158
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:28,680
provided me with that um little secret I

159
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:30,840
guess um it's kind of the secret sauce I

160
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,519
think um that I've been using almost my

161
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:37,758
whole career is is a combination of uh

162
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:40,719
fish hydrolysate and humic acids and and

163
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:42,439
kelp right on uh and just to highlight

164
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,319
for folks fish Emulsion is very

165
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,959
different than fish hydrate so um you

166
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:48,360
want to make sure one is going to be

167
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:51,959
high in nitrogen the other is going to

168
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:54,639
be high in phosphorus so just be aware

169
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:56,959
that they're two very different products

170
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,560
um when you when you talk about uh

171
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,560
starting off with a hom grow then and

172
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,079
then getting into to you know more of

173
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,319
the commercial side of the industry

174
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:04,478
where did you where did you kind of go

175
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,039
from there and how did you get your

176
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:09,399
first

177
00:07:06,038 --> 00:07:10,918
starts it was just uh friendships and

178
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,560
relationships that I had with people

179
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:14,240
which are really everything back in the

180
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,079
day before before the industry was

181
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
really solidified it was who you knew

182
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:19,839
and and the relationships that you had

183
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,839
we only worked with people that we could

184
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:25,799
trust and I ended up giving one of my

185
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:27,878
dear friends uh I would save all my

186
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,478
colas like my best colas for my best

187
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:32,240
rounds I would keep in jars and just

188
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:34,359
have them like on a shelf kind of like a

189
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
display and I'd crack into them every

190
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,800
now and then if I wanted a little

191
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:41,719
special treat but um I gave a a nice big

192
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,400
Cola to a dear friend of mine who was

193
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:47,759
well connected in the industry and he

194
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,719
referred me to uh one of his connections

195
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,038
by uh Newman Lake which is on the border

196
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:55,280
of Washington and Idaho and so I got to

197
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:58,199
step in there as kind of like a

198
00:07:55,279 --> 00:08:00,119
consultant and just a a labor hand

199
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:02,240
honestly I helped with everything um

200
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:04,519
whether it was pruning and defoliating

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,158
or watering and I learned as much as I

202
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,799
could from the other guys there and also

203
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:11,038
just provided the knowledge that I had

204
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,478
and it ended up working out pretty

205
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:15,360
well so you kind of

206
00:08:13,478 --> 00:08:18,639
started sounds like kind of right at the

207
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,158
bottom of the industry um just as a as a

208
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:25,759
laborer and uh kind of worked your way

209
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,918
up uh so you went from growing you know

210
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,639
relatively small in these rooms to to

211
00:08:27,918 --> 00:08:32,240
seeing you know a pretty good level of

212
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,959
scale it sounds like on the commercial

213
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,759
side what was what was that like what

214
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,918
were the big differences between you

215
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:40,879
know growing in your house versus

216
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:43,079
growing you know on scale

217
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:46,000
commercially it's a totally different

218
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:48,920
Beast just to be forthcoming about it

219
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,120
it's a totally different Beast um when

220
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:52,079
you're at your house you can do

221
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,600
everything yourself which is awesome

222
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
because you could take all the care that

223
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
you want on you know just a small

224
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,800
handful of plants and make them perfect

225
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,800
whereas on scale you have to think about

226
00:08:59,799 --> 00:09:06,039
costs you have to think about Labor

227
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:08,000
inputs um like what's what's the true

228
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:10,240
value added from this action or this

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,600
input and and really analyze those types

230
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,680
of things also any problems that you

231
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:19,360
have or imbalances or pests or anything

232
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:21,078
like that go zero to 60 like really

233
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,680
really fast where it's much more

234
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:26,519
controlled in a smaller

235
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:29,879
scale So based off that I would think

236
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:31,440
the keys to growing you know

237
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:35,480
commercially like what you're describing

238
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:37,720
there um you really want to have a a

239
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,360
robust IPM program where you're really

240
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:42,759
scouting because you do have so many

241
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:45,399
plants and then you also can't um you

242
00:09:42,759 --> 00:09:49,519
can't afford to use a lot of these

243
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,759
marketed hype products um just

244
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,720
because just because of the cost on

245
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:59,200
scale they're just not practical is that

246
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,879
kind of the main thing s you got it you

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:03,399
got it and like early identification of

248
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:06,159
any of those things is going to save you

249
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:07,958
a ton of money down the road um and also

250
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,559
just being preventative out the gate is

251
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,599
going to save you a ton of money so

252
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:13,639
whether it's beneficial insect programs

253
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,920
or or your crop nutrition whether you

254
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:18,519
can do soil tests to to be able to

255
00:10:15,919 --> 00:10:22,278
anticipate things that are coming versus

256
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:24,240
you know waiting until those um

257
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:26,759
deficiencies or disease or anything like

258
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,159
that is you know at a later stage and

259
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,200
identified on your plant um if you can

260
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:33,120
catch those things before they manifest

261
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,440
into something pretty bad is going to

262
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,440
save you a ton down the

263
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:42,599
road yeah that Mak that makes a lot of

264
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:44,479
sense um and

265
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,040
so I mean I kind of want to get into

266
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,720
that but I also just want to move on a

267
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:49,719
little bit too to where you kind of went

268
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:51,120
from there uh keeping this a little bit

269
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:53,200
more chronological and then we can come

270
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,399
back to some of the uh pointers and tips

271
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,519
so like

272
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:59,799
after after being in Eastern Washington

273
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,399
um if I remember correctly I think you

274
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:07,078
moved on to Europe is that

275
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,200
right uh yeah well from there I went to

276
00:11:07,078 --> 00:11:11,000
a big row and Airway Heights Spokan area

277
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,600
uh we did awesome there outdoor race

278
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,958
beds uh and then some some big hoop

279
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,159
houses as well uh we did we did really

280
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:20,000
awesome it was a tightnit group of

281
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:21,919
friends kind of living the dream

282
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,078
honestly from a cultivator perspective

283
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:26,039
when you could just manage a grow with a

284
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,799
few guys looking back on it now it's

285
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:31,078
really just like this dreamlike almost

286
00:11:27,799 --> 00:11:33,838
romantic situation it's like just ideal

287
00:11:31,078 --> 00:11:35,638
um and we crushed it just like honestly

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,320
if you have a group of guys who are

289
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,600
mission driven and everybody's bought in

290
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,480
like and just willing to do what it

291
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,480
takes you're going to succeed in that

292
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,399
situation so we did really really well

293
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,720
from there I went to

294
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:49,799
Okanogan um a little bit and these are

295
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,278
pretty harsh harsh climates Okanagan is

296
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,359
a little bit even more extreme where you

297
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:56,720
have uh you know really hot temperatures

298
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:58,720
dry dry Summers and then at night

299
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,879
especially towards the fall they can get

300
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,600
really really cold and those cold spells

301
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:04,720
can really you know Spike the humidity

302
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:06,600
and cause some issues there uh we did

303
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,600
really really great though got to learn

304
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,560
to Stage my outdoor crops based off of

305
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,759
flowering time uh put in some

306
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,078
autoflowers for an early season spring

307
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,600
Harvest that's going to be able to

308
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:18,919
maximize your outdoor season basically

309
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,600
as many chunks as you can split that

310
00:12:18,919 --> 00:12:22,479
harvest season into is really going to

311
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,920
maximize your dry space which is always

312
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,360
a a massive limiting factor for outdoor

313
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:31,198
grows and so from there I got the

314
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,959
opportunity to uh get my foot in the

315
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:36,240
door into Europe yeah well well let's

316
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:38,439
talk real briefly about that Okanagan

317
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,278
experience in the sense of drying and

318
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:45,320
curing so like you mentioned everyone is

319
00:12:42,278 --> 00:12:48,278
running outdoor crops there uh because

320
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:51,399
of the climate and you have a very clear

321
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:55,519
end date in sight where the weather

322
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,399
changes um how were people effectively

323
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,799
drying and curing such massive Harvest

324
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,000
and you already touched on one thing

325
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:03,679
which is you know breaking it up into

326
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,559
more Harvest by doing an Autoflower

327
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,519
season first um that would reduce you

328
00:13:06,559 --> 00:13:09,000
know that would give you an early

329
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,078
Harvest when not everyone else is

330
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,519
harvesting um but then also um shrink

331
00:13:13,078 --> 00:13:17,239
your Harvest a little bit I would assume

332
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:20,639
for the for the second round over the

333
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:23,240
summer what what were your pointers

334
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,120
there yeah so um with those early

335
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:27,079
Autoflower harvests they're they're

336
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,078
super crucial so not only can you bring

337
00:13:27,078 --> 00:13:30,439
down that Harvest but you also can uh

338
00:13:29,078 --> 00:13:32,879
House of product for sale at the

339
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:35,079
beginning of the year which is really

340
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:37,679
you know a revenue driver for a lot of

341
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:40,559
outdoor Farms where typically they don't

342
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:43,679
have and um most of the Farms out there

343
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:47,159
are probably doing large larger scale

344
00:13:43,679 --> 00:13:49,198
garage pole barn setups without a lot of

345
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:53,000
equipment or infrastructure to help

346
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:54,719
regulate the internal environment um

347
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,559
it's kind of typical with an outdoor

348
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,278
grow we were fortunate enough though to

349
00:13:56,559 --> 00:14:01,399
have two uh completely indoor

350
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,519
dry rooms where it it was totally

351
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:07,159
climatized it worked really really well

352
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:09,399
when I dry I try to really remove 50% or

353
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:12,600
so of the total moisture content of that

354
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,839
flour within about the first 48 Hours 24

355
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:17,519
to 48 hours to really reduce any chances

356
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,240
of pathogen growth or anything like that

357
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,720
that may occur during that drying stage

358
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,440
and then for the rest of the phase

359
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,879
ideally the rest of that two weeks um

360
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:28,320
you're going to go low and slow you're

361
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:31,278
going to drop your temps increase your

362
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:33,600
humidity and just try to slowly slowly

363
00:14:31,278 --> 00:14:35,919
uh kind of balance out and homogenize

364
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,800
out flour because at the beginning the

365
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:39,759
outside of the flow May dry out quicker

366
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:42,319
and you may have some moisture that's

367
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:44,360
trapped in the inside so going kind of

368
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,600
low and slow as I like to say it's

369
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,560
really going to help balance that out

370
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,920
and pull it out um so we would work with

371
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,119
two week intervals and have that for

372
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:53,879
kind of these Harvest blocks and work

373
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,879
with

374
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:58,958
early uh short photo periodic varieties

375
00:14:56,879 --> 00:15:02,720
to bring down after that Autoflower

376
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:04,638
Harvest um in in earlyer mid September

377
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,440
and then have a late September block and

378
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:11,240
an early October block by that time you

379
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:14,680
usually have a a cold snap that is

380
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:17,360
either snow or it's Frost or whatever

381
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:19,159
and so you only the most hearty

382
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
varieties are going to survive past that

383
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:23,439
point so that you could get maybe a

384
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:26,719
later October Harvest as

385
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,839
well okay so yeah so you're harvesting

386
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,199
you start harvesting pretty early but

387
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:32,959
because of the massive amount of plants

388
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:35,078
that you have you're kind of breaking it

389
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:37,479
up based on how the cultivars finish so

390
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:40,000
you want like a wide range of finishing

391
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:44,920
times it sounds like so you can you can

392
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:48,480
do that um how how did your product then

393
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:50,958
compare to all the pole barn folks that

394
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,720
were you know having at the mercy of the

395
00:15:50,958 --> 00:15:55,039
environment and in their curing rooms

396
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,839
you know what what were the big

397
00:15:55,039 --> 00:16:00,278
differences I may be a bit biased in

398
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,160
this regard because it's my product but

399
00:16:00,278 --> 00:16:04,799
um to be totally honest I thought we

400
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:07,439
grew some really really amazing product

401
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:08,838
um you know it's going to typically in

402
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,560
those pole barn setups you're not going

403
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:12,600
to have the tarpine preservation it's

404
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:15,198
not going to carry through it may smell

405
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,399
a little bit still like like chlorophyll

406
00:16:15,198 --> 00:16:19,758
like some grass or some hay some of

407
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:21,879
those off flavors and Aromas may still

408
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:24,480
be present in there whereas if you have

409
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:26,318
an optimal dry and curing time you're

410
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,800
going to preserve more of those volatile

411
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:30,559
tur beans you're going to have a a

412
00:16:27,799 --> 00:16:32,318
better flavor a smoother smoke and just

413
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:33,518
a a better overall experience in the

414
00:16:32,318 --> 00:16:35,879
final

415
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,039
flower and you probably have less risk

416
00:16:35,879 --> 00:16:40,799
of pathogens too I would say as well

417
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,799
those are all good points yeah all right

418
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:44,318
well moving on then so now uh you're

419
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:47,758
you're off to Europe uh tell me a little

420
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:49,679
bit about that that experience that was

421
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,680
that was an experience so I'm truly

422
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:53,359
fortunate and blessed to be able to have

423
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:56,078
done this so I got to go to Eastern

424
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,079
Europe in Macedonia for my first uh

425
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:01,278
operation over there it was an intro

426
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:03,479
into do gacp and GMP like real

427
00:17:01,278 --> 00:17:05,558
pharmaceutical grade type of production

428
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,959
and Manufacturing which is kind of

429
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:09,480
probably where the industry will be

430
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:12,919
headed at least as far as a medical

431
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:14,679
perspective I think that we over here

432
00:17:12,919 --> 00:17:17,079
should be landing in more of a food

433
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,798
grade standard whereas over there

434
00:17:17,078 --> 00:17:21,678
they're doing a pharmaceutical standard

435
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:24,038
um and we can get into the nuances of

436
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:27,038
each one of those types of things but

437
00:17:24,038 --> 00:17:29,160
basically the gacp is good good

438
00:17:27,038 --> 00:17:32,038
Agricultural and collection practices

439
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,279
and this is just going to ensure uh it's

440
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:36,919
going it's going to really try to

441
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:38,599
ensure that you have homogeneity within

442
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,720
the batch so there's not too much

443
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:43,558
variation as far as cannaboid or tpine

444
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:45,319
um it's going to monitor your inputs

445
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:48,839
it's going to make sure that your Sops

446
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:51,480
are all in place so the idea is that if

447
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:54,038
you have a patient they can actually

448
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:55,839
like set up Doses and things like that

449
00:17:54,038 --> 00:17:57,240
whereas you know over here if you eat an

450
00:17:55,839 --> 00:18:01,038
edible you never know what you're going

451
00:17:57,240 --> 00:18:03,159
to get you may be you know not feeling

452
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:06,519
anything and you may be in a spaceship

453
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:10,200
in your room at the light toop you never

454
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:12,558
know as a side note are you seeing a big

455
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:15,240
difference in variability and Edibles on

456
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:17,399
the market here in Washington um or is

457
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,319
it pretty well standardized it's pretty

458
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:22,038
well standardized at this point at at

459
00:18:19,319 --> 00:18:23,960
this point but again we are now to the

460
00:18:22,038 --> 00:18:26,038
point where we're able to maintain those

461
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,798
higher level of Standards here at at

462
00:18:26,038 --> 00:18:30,158
Smoky Point we have an amazing kitchen

463
00:18:27,798 --> 00:18:31,720
staff commercial kitchen and just

464
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,559
absolute top-of-the line Edibles with

465
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:35,839
consistency all the way through with

466
00:18:33,558 --> 00:18:37,158
award-winning chocolates and savories

467
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:40,279
and sweets I can't say enough good

468
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:42,880
things about the team over here but um

469
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:45,519
if you're a user you probably remember

470
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:47,880
the Dark Ages where you would get a

471
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:49,798
cookie and maybe take a bite of that

472
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:51,760
cookie and never know what you're gonna

473
00:18:49,798 --> 00:18:53,679
get yeah you're getting a cookie and

474
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,759
like a Ziploc baggie and they're like

475
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:59,519
only eat this much of it yeah and

476
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:01,640
I'm I have to be care careful I think

477
00:18:59,519 --> 00:19:05,480
everyone has that edible story though

478
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:10,400
maybe one day we'll I'll share mine on

479
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:13,480
air I want hear yeah yeah so uh what was

480
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,840
the so what was the setup in Macedonia

481
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:19,279
like um you talked a little B about the

482
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:21,558
GMP thing I I'm quite familiar with it

483
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,000
actually uh I'm on the board for a a

484
00:19:21,558 --> 00:19:25,000
company in Australia and it's been

485
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,839
really interesting learning about that

486
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,240
side of things um but for the for the

487
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:30,678
sake of the podcast let's talk a little

488
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,759
bit more about the the cultivation

489
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:36,400
aspect like how are they growing what

490
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:38,480
scale are we talking about here um yeah

491
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,320
yeah share your share your Insight there

492
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:45,159
I'd love to so uh we started indoors um

493
00:19:42,319 --> 00:19:47,678
just on racks like LEDs a standard setup

494
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:49,320
and then we would uh veg veg them out

495
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,798
and we called it an interim room but it

496
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:53,599
was a standard veg room and then we'd

497
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:56,918
put them outside and just to be totally

498
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:58,839
clear I just got this company kind of

499
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:00,280
started um

500
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,399
at the beginning stages of their

501
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,158
development I helped them write Sops and

502
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,480
I helped them get through the licensing

503
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,000
process um they were fully licensed and

504
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,798
we were starting to cultivate by the

505
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,839
time that I had left there but I had

506
00:20:10,798 --> 00:20:16,599
never finished any uh flowering Cycles

507
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:20,079
or anything like that with them we were

508
00:20:16,599 --> 00:20:24,119
in the stages of uh water Tre treatment

509
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:26,359
build outs uh Greenhouse build outs and

510
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:31,119
we were running living soil in

511
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:33,439
pots um it it quite a cool setup and but

512
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,798
I was just honestly offered a an amazing

513
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,600
opportunity from there that I couldn't

514
00:20:34,798 --> 00:20:38,279
turn down in Portugal so I kind of

515
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:41,279
jumped

516
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:44,480
ship okay okay so you ended up in

517
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:47,798
Portugal and uh you want to touch on

518
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,000
that I'd love to move on to Smokey Point

519
00:20:47,798 --> 00:20:51,960
yeah so Portugal is just the best the

520
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
best opportunity ever it's an amazing

521
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,000
country amazing people amazing food can

522
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,720
say enough good things about it I got

523
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,119
started there with a pharmaceutical

524
00:20:57,720 --> 00:21:02,159
company at the totally ground floor of

525
00:21:00,119 --> 00:21:04,599
everything before the land was even

526
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,520
purchased uh so we got to come out the

527
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:08,918
gate kind of setting things up the right

528
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:12,000
way which was awesome so we chose the

529
00:21:08,919 --> 00:21:14,600
land we set up an outdoor kind of an R&amp;D

530
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,200
plot and a pretty large scale Greenhouse

531
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:20,199
the total property was about 105

532
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:23,159
hectares so this was a real large scale

533
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:25,960
grow um where we're talking Acres or

534
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,360
hectors instead of uh square

535
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:30,558
footage and yeah just an amazing

536
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:32,798
opportunity we were running living soils

537
00:21:30,558 --> 00:21:35,918
we got to do a custom soil formulation

538
00:21:32,798 --> 00:21:38,000
with a big European uh soil

539
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:40,960
provider uh worked with them with the

540
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,359
soil tests to make little changes and

541
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,519
and tweaks as as we saw those come back

542
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:46,959
and how that soil was performing in in

543
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:50,119
its

544
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,679
environment and yeah I got to do really

545
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:53,158
amazing things with amazing team I

546
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,960
surrounded myself with people who are

547
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:58,880
much smarter than me and uh set up a

548
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,640
real great opportunity there

549
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,840
so were you going directly in ground or

550
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:08,000
were you in uh were you in pots in the

551
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:11,558
so uh in inside we were in pots then

552
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,159
outside we were in like uh windro style

553
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:15,879
raised beds with with Furrow so we took

554
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:18,840
the tractors through we hired a lot of

555
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:24,159
local farmers to create those beds for

556
00:22:18,839 --> 00:22:28,399
us and then we set in uh drift tape

557
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:31,200
and yeah we just amended it and drip

558
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,080
tape and and water only for the outdoor

559
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:37,880
and relied on the

560
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:39,519
soil okay so it was uh when you say wind

561
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:42,200
rose then you were you're putting in big

562
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:45,240
trenches of of potting soil with living

563
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,840
soil and then the plants were growing in

564
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,640
in those trenches kind of thing is that

565
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:51,480
what you're talking about yeah sorry

566
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:54,919
maybe I Ed the wrong term there so we

567
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:57,400
were amending the soil adding organic

568
00:22:54,919 --> 00:23:00,120
material to it gypsum and then balancing

569
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,679
out any nutrient imbalances that we saw

570
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:05,678
and then doing a light tilling and then

571
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,759
creating those

572
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,278
beds okay so you're actually growing in

573
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:14,480
the native soil there correct got it

574
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:15,759
okay yeah that that makes sense to me I

575
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,960
I always encourage folks to use the

576
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:20,000
native soil if they can if they can pass

577
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:22,919
for heavy metals if they don't have a

578
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,440
high flood flood plane there or and if

579
00:23:22,919 --> 00:23:26,559
they don't have any burrowing creatures

580
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,200
like gophers and things that are going

581
00:23:26,558 --> 00:23:31,158
to be causing big problems then it's

582
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,038
better to go right into the ground for a

583
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:35,520
ton of reasons for sure moles are always

584
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:38,038
fun to deal with but luckily there we

585
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:39,960
were good on that front um the soil was

586
00:23:38,038 --> 00:23:41,879
a little compact but we added some

587
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:44,278
gypsum in there and it really did help

588
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:46,120
actually um create some of that

589
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:48,558
Aggregate and create some of that

590
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:50,399
drainage balance out any of the the

591
00:23:48,558 --> 00:23:52,278
calcium problems that we were seeing and

592
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,600
help with some of the salinity factors

593
00:23:52,278 --> 00:23:57,919
as well I think so that that gypsum

594
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,879
helped quite a bit um we had to add a a

595
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,759
little bit of sulfur as well to to lower

596
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,840
the ph but not not too much the native

597
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:05,278
soil was really good pretty much out the

598
00:24:03,839 --> 00:24:08,798
gate

599
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:11,839
there awesome awesome um so now you've

600
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:14,359
grown it sounds like mostly outdoor at

601
00:24:11,839 --> 00:24:15,558
this point on the commercial scale and

602
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,599
you got this

603
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:20,158
opportunity um if I'm remembering things

604
00:24:17,599 --> 00:24:23,599
in order to come over back to Washington

605
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:26,399
at Smokey Point is that is that the next

606
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:28,599
stop that's the next stop I I should

607
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:30,519
clarify that um at a few of my

608
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:34,000
operations in the past we had some small

609
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:35,519
scale indoor operations um just just a

610
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,480
few rooms at each spot but nothing like

611
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:40,798
we have at Smokey Point all right well

612
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,640
so I met when I met you uh I think you

613
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:46,119
shot me an email and we started chatting

614
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,600
I I remember how um and then I came up

615
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:51,199
to Smoky Point and met you in person and

616
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:53,359
and took a visit of the facility and and

617
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:56,000
I'd been up to Smokey Point before so

618
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:59,000
Smokey Point's been around uh since the

619
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,240
beginning of 502 they actually had a

620
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,240
company called the Clone Zone which was

621
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:06,359
really smart by the the founder uh Brian

622
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,519
leade who I who I knew through the

623
00:25:06,359 --> 00:25:13,199
industry at the time um essentially

624
00:25:09,519 --> 00:25:15,319
right when um we went legal here in

625
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,600
Washington on the rec side uh they

626
00:25:15,319 --> 00:25:19,720
already had a a company providing clones

627
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:22,879
and so he was able they were able to

628
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,079
provide clones to the ma the vast

629
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,520
majority of the industry legally because

630
00:25:25,079 --> 00:25:28,839
people were having trouble sourcing

631
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:30,519
genetics um from what I understand they

632
00:25:28,839 --> 00:25:32,359
withheld some of the certain Cult of

633
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:34,440
ours for themselves that they grew

634
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:36,359
internally so then they had sort of

635
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,519
unique genetics on the market that no

636
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,479
one else was putting out because

637
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,839
everyone else was putting out all the

638
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,440
other stuff they did and it was just a

639
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:46,759
really um it was it was a really uh

640
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,399
ingenious way of approaching the an

641
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:50,278
Emerging Market you know in a legal

642
00:25:48,398 --> 00:25:53,158
state that I think was really profitable

643
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:54,919
for the company at at the time um I

644
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,240
don't know if you know anything about

645
00:25:54,919 --> 00:25:58,640
that time period because you weren't you

646
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,359
weren't around yet but um

647
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,600
yeah I I can talk about more but is

648
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:05,158
there anything you want to

649
00:26:01,599 --> 00:26:07,319
add not so much not so much I know that

650
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:10,559
um since then the Clone Zone has really

651
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:14,038
evolved and has become our research and

652
00:26:10,558 --> 00:26:14,038
development and breeding

653
00:26:14,319 --> 00:26:21,038
facility yeah and when I met Brian he

654
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:23,679
was working on he was having issues with

655
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:26,038
his compost te Brewer um and so he

656
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,759
wanted me to come up do some microscopy

657
00:26:26,038 --> 00:26:29,278
and figure out what was going on and so

658
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:32,599
I did a little bit of Consulting on that

659
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:36,079
side um they did one run in I think five

660
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:38,199
gallon pots using our soil with uh

661
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:41,000
chemical you know nutrient salts over

662
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,919
the top and I I when I came up there the

663
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,359
plants look phenomenal but they end up

664
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,759
going back to a purely uh salt program

665
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:50,439
just because that was what they were

666
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:52,200
more comfortable with um and I kind of

667
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,720
lost touch with them over the years

668
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,720
until you reached out saying you were

669
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,000
working at Smokey Point because I know

670
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:58,399
the company went through a few different

671
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:02,240
iterations

672
00:26:58,398 --> 00:27:04,000
um over that time period and uh yeah I

673
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:06,759
was excited to come back up but I have

674
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,200
to say when I first visited Smokey Point

675
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,599
I was blown away by the the

676
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,159
thoughtfulness that went into the

677
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:16,240
infrastructure and I hope to show a tour

678
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,320
of this soon um but it was one of the

679
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:23,240
best managed and cleanest facilities I

680
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:25,918
I'd ever visited at that point in time

681
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:28,399
um so yeah I mean bring me up to the

682
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,720
Future what what is Smokey Point

683
00:27:28,398 --> 00:27:32,719
now so I love to hear that you know

684
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,079
coming into a facility with good bones

685
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,240
makes everything so much easier on me

686
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:39,240
and my team and so that that's really

687
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,399
awesome that they did you know move

688
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:43,278
forward with that thoughtfulness just

689
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:45,719
with the infrastructure so that is

690
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:48,038
really great we have tried to continue

691
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,278
that as much as as possible just that

692
00:27:48,038 --> 00:27:54,240
level of cleanliness I think that we do

693
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:57,558
this better and more thoroughly than

694
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,440
probably almost all of our of our

695
00:27:57,558 --> 00:28:03,918
colleagues in in the industry so for

696
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,320
example when we cycle a room we

697
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,360
remove uh all of our tables our

698
00:28:06,319 --> 00:28:10,480
irrigation lines get rolled up they get

699
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,398
flushed out and and cleaned off and

700
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,679
sanitized every single surface gets

701
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,239
sanitized we remove every light off the

702
00:28:14,679 --> 00:28:19,278
ceiling it gets wiped down every surface

703
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,079
gets touched sanitized every line gets

704
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:23,880
blown out every filter gets changed uh

705
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:26,918
and then finally following that is a

706
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,960
fumigation of of just like hydrogen

707
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:31,080
peroxide atic acid just to make sure

708
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:33,240
everything is is totally sterile and

709
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,720
we're not cross-contaminating or

710
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,679
transferring anything onto the next

711
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,919
cycle for me it's very important that I

712
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:41,159
know that my Cycles start off you know

713
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
100%

714
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:45,000
clean so you don't feel like that's

715
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,080
Overkill you want to make sure that

716
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,038
there's nothing in that

717
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:52,398
room that's correct contaminate yeah

718
00:28:51,038 --> 00:28:54,798
like especially when we're talking

719
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:57,518
spores out out here on the West side of

720
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:59,798
Washington as you I'm sure are well

721
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:01,159
Weare uh powdery Milo btis these are

722
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:02,839
these are serious issues that we deal

723
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:05,720
with as cultivators in these high humid

724
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:08,359
environments and so to to ensure that

725
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:11,480
our crops have zero powdery Milo and

726
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:13,519
zero buritis going to our customers um

727
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:17,599
it means a lot to me and it and it is

728
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:17,599
you know at the Forefront of my uh

729
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,960
priorities absolutely so how are you

730
00:29:20,919 --> 00:29:27,679
cultivating now what's the methodology

731
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,038
that you're using in the in the facility

732
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,600
yeah so one of the first changes that I

733
00:29:30,038 --> 00:29:34,519
made coming into Smoky Point was

734
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,639
switching over to a living soil um and

735
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,319
this one's a custom soal formulation

736
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,559
same same type of deal we try to develop

737
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:44,720
it a little bit over time um and so

738
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:48,079
we're going into that we do regular

739
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,640
organic soil drenches um we add in the

740
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:53,839
fish emolion we add in some humic acid

741
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:57,640
fic acid amino acids enzymes we do some

742
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:59,278
calpin veg uh with f fulvic folar sprays

743
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,159
uh with some calcium to make sure that

744
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:02,640
we get get the meet the calcium demands

745
00:30:01,159 --> 00:30:04,200
of the plants in living soils with a

746
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,159
little bit smaller of containers it's

747
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:08,319
really difficult to keep up with calcium

748
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,960
demands of the plants and so I have to

749
00:30:08,319 --> 00:30:12,798
really monitor you know my my temps and

750
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,519
humidities and and my soil moisture

751
00:30:12,798 --> 00:30:15,759
content and my calcium levels pretty

752
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,079
carefully to make sure that those

753
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:21,599
demands are always met um but we're

754
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:24,278
trying to be as as sustainable and

755
00:30:21,599 --> 00:30:26,359
organic focused as possible we're not

756
00:30:24,278 --> 00:30:27,919
perfect and I'll just you know totally

757
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:29,879
admit that and

758
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:32,038
but but we're doing our absolute best

759
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,880
especially considering the difficulties

760
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:36,879
and the challenges of our industry and

761
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:38,200
our Market it costs a little bit more

762
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,240
for us to

763
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:45,240
be like let me use this as an example so

764
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,240
some of our jars that we use uh for our

765
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,278
habitat line we have a habitat premium

766
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:52,399
line that we launched um in

767
00:30:50,278 --> 00:30:54,880
2023 and so this is going to be our top

768
00:30:52,398 --> 00:30:57,239
shelf flower and all of our jars are

769
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,000
made from recyclable glass are joint

770
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,159
tubes are made from recycled ocean

771
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,679
plastic um these are some really cool

772
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,080
things that I think that are steps that

773
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,559
we're taking to try to uh you know just

774
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:13,798
be as sustainable as we can but it costs

775
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:16,960
us a lot more money to to do

776
00:31:13,798 --> 00:31:19,240
that and so if we switched our entire

777
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,798
company over to this it would probably

778
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:24,638
not work out um but we do have that

779
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:26,158
offering for for people who are you know

780
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:29,678
just

781
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,559
uncompromising um Quality and

782
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:34,919
sustainability focused and so we do have

783
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:37,918
that offering for

784
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:40,559
that so you you mentioned you're you're

785
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:42,240
in uh living soil you're not actually

786
00:31:40,558 --> 00:31:44,038
using our soil I want to clarify for

787
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
folks this is not an advertisement for

788
00:31:44,038 --> 00:31:47,839
my company because you're not uh using

789
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:51,719
any of my

790
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:53,480
products um and we've we've we we had

791
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:57,399
conversations about ways that you might

792
00:31:53,480 --> 00:32:01,159
be able to you know reduce inputs or

793
00:31:57,398 --> 00:32:03,558
potentially um you know change some of

794
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,840
your your fertilizing practices to to

795
00:32:03,558 --> 00:32:07,638
save costs you know and reduce the

796
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:09,199
number of touches and applications which

797
00:32:07,638 --> 00:32:10,759
is something I know you're you're always

798
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,120
looking at and experimenting with which

799
00:32:10,759 --> 00:32:15,200
is I think really important in in any

800
00:32:13,119 --> 00:32:19,359
facility um you're that you're always

801
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:21,360
you know striving towards Improvement um

802
00:32:19,359 --> 00:32:23,678
but overall like

803
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:25,519
um I I I think one other thing to

804
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,840
highlight is that so you're what size

805
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,638
container are you in let's start there

806
00:32:27,839 --> 00:32:32,398
so we started out a little bit bigger in

807
00:32:29,638 --> 00:32:34,319
a 7 gon but I had to reduce to a 3

808
00:32:32,398 --> 00:32:36,479
gallon just due to the nature of the

809
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:38,638
competitive of the of the market I'm

810
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,038
trying to reduce costs as much as I can

811
00:32:38,638 --> 00:32:43,199
and so we went to a three gallon

812
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:45,519
container I could still see um the the

813
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,798
same amount of quality and I can kind of

814
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:50,200
I know with living soils it's a little a

815
00:32:47,798 --> 00:32:52,278
little bit different than a typical like

816
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,159
cocoa based media or something with your

817
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:58,519
dryb backs but it works out really well

818
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,600
for us where I can almost have this

819
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:02,480
hybrid approach of crop steering which

820
00:33:00,599 --> 00:33:04,240
is kind of unheard of with a lot of

821
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,558
living soils and beds and stuff right

822
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,679
most people are doing that in Hydro

823
00:33:05,558 --> 00:33:09,638
application or or those types of

824
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,440
situations um to

825
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:14,599
where so we installed an automatic

826
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,120
irrigation system and I can drip into

827
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:17,398
that and then my hand waterers come

828
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:19,398
through and just make sure everything's

829
00:33:17,398 --> 00:33:21,278
totally balanced and even and I do

830
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:23,000
multiple shot sizes similar to a

831
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:25,440
traditional crop steering program so

832
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:28,278
that I can monitor my soil moisture and

833
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,320
keep it more in that goldilock Zone with

834
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:33,440
smaller shot intervals or sorry smaller

835
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:35,278
shot volumes with more intervals so that

836
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,320
we can maintain kind of that goil lock

837
00:33:35,278 --> 00:33:39,599
Zone throughout the peak periods of the

838
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,759
day and then watch our dryb backs

839
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:45,398
overnight so you're not allowing you're

840
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:47,398
you're reducing the amount of dryback or

841
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:49,959
variability in your soil moisture

842
00:33:47,398 --> 00:33:51,479
overall which is a lot harder frankly in

843
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:53,600
a three gallon pot the smaller the

844
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,960
container the harder that is for

845
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:58,319
sure it's pretty difficult for sure I

846
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,639
wouldn't want to go I mean I definitely

847
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:00,599
wouldn't want to go any smaller than a

848
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,678
three

849
00:34:00,599 --> 00:34:03,678
gallon and I know some people are going

850
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:06,278
to be listening this they're going to

851
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,519
say well that's not living soil because

852
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:10,838
the pot is size container is too small

853
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:11,878
and you're also not reusing the media

854
00:34:10,838 --> 00:34:14,519
and that's probably something we should

855
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,480
talk about too is to what went into that

856
00:34:14,519 --> 00:34:19,199
decision and that thought process um so

857
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:22,159
you are having to bring in new soil

858
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:25,000
every cycle uh why and why why do you

859
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,519
choose to do that in your facility we're

860
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:29,239
not reusing our soil we're trying re

861
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:32,039
reusing our soil right now because I

862
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:36,000
have concerns about viruses and viroids

863
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:37,679
and so we we know that Popa vroid is in

864
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,838
very high concentrations in the root

865
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,079
Zone and so my concern is that if we

866
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:46,159
chop and even if we pull out the bulk of

867
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:48,519
that root mass that maybe there's a high

868
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:50,480
viral load and whatever Roots may be

869
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:54,079
remaining in there and if I don't put it

870
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:56,878
through a thorough composting process

871
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:59,640
that maybe some of that vroid could

872
00:34:56,878 --> 00:35:01,920
transfer over to to the Next Generation

873
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:04,879
and I'm not saying that we necessarily

874
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,440
have the vroid but most people have the

875
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,358
vroid and it's very prevalent in our

876
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,679
industry and I want to make sure like I

877
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:15,159
said that my Cycles are are starting off

878
00:35:12,679 --> 00:35:16,919
clean and are clean and are the highest

879
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:19,000
quality as possible and I just don't

880
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,079
want I want to mitigate any risk of

881
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:23,199
transferring viruses or viroids off to

882
00:35:21,079 --> 00:35:25,920
my next

883
00:35:23,199 --> 00:35:28,159
cycle yeah and I can imagine in a three

884
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,760
gallon container don't have a lot of

885
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:33,519
media relative to the the route to Media

886
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,839
relationship is is probably there's

887
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:36,280
probably not a lot left at the end of

888
00:35:34,838 --> 00:35:38,759
the cycle by the time you pull the roots

889
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:41,839
out I would think um so there's not as

890
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:44,280
much to recycle either I I I don't know

891
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:46,159
what what do you think about that and

892
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,160
like I said we we are triing this

893
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:52,118
currently to where I am uh cutting it

894
00:35:49,159 --> 00:35:55,879
with new soil so like for example a 3:1

895
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,119
ratio of used soil to do soil um that

896
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,640
this is the trials that were running

897
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,960
right now and we're actually having some

898
00:35:58,639 --> 00:36:04,838
some pretty good results my my my next

899
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,400
step is just to make sure that we do

900
00:36:04,838 --> 00:36:11,159
thorough pathogen testing and make sure

901
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:13,400
that that nothing you know weird is

902
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:15,838
happening yeah I mean that that would

903
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,599
there's a lot of Labor that goes into

904
00:36:15,838 --> 00:36:21,239
bringing in and cost associated with

905
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,519
bringing in new soil um filling the pots

906
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:24,479
getting them into the rooms getting them

907
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:26,280
out of the rooms there's also a lot of

908
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,079
Labor that goes into recycling the soil

909
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,440
and contain ERS which is one of the

910
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,839
reasons a lot of folks like beds but I

911
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:34,440
can totally understand the vroid concern

912
00:36:32,838 --> 00:36:36,559
and why you guys have gone down the path

913
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:38,039
that you have um but I think it's

914
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:39,519
interesting to talk it out so people can

915
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:42,159
kind of hear the thought process behind

916
00:36:39,519 --> 00:36:45,119
it for sure me

917
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:47,480
too so um I don't think we've even

918
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:51,880
talked about exactly how large Smokey

919
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,559
Point really is um so folks can have an

920
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:57,000
idea of what we're what we're talking

921
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:58,480
about here what what scale are you guys

922
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,960
so we're tier three tier three is the

923
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,800
largest um license that's available in

924
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:04,720
Washington state we also have the clone

925
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,480
z license so the rolling Farms license

926
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:09,598
is our spot at at Smoky Point and then

927
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:12,079
we even are bringing over because the

928
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:14,280
LCB recently redefined what their

929
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,359
definition of canopy is which is really

930
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:19,000
unfortunate for almost all producer

931
00:37:16,358 --> 00:37:22,119
processors in the state right now um and

932
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,480
so we actually have to relocate our

933
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:26,119
clone Zone license over to Rolling Farms

934
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,358
just to make sure that we're staying at

935
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:31,039
maximum capacity over here it's it's not

936
00:37:29,358 --> 00:37:34,078
like necessarily a bad thing because

937
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:36,119
this whole last year I've been able to

938
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:37,800
uh have the opportunity of of breeding

939
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,800
at the Clone Zone and doing research and

940
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,318
development and at this point I have so

941
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:44,920
many seeds and fenos to test and Hunt

942
00:37:42,318 --> 00:37:47,039
that I could last me like the next three

943
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:49,559
four years literally of pheno hunting

944
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:51,679
and stuff over at rolling farm so I'm

945
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:53,199
just absolutely stoked to be able to to

946
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:55,078
use those seeds and those genetics that

947
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:57,799
we were able to develop and test them

948
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:59,280
out at rolling Farms all right so so

949
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,359
throw out a number here how big is

950
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,599
Smokey

951
00:38:00,358 --> 00:38:06,480
Point uh well the rolling Farm's license

952
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,280
is for 30,000 foot active canopy and

953
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,880
then the uh clone zone is a tier two

954
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
which is going to be 10,000 squ foot

955
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:15,480
active canopy and you're you're maxing

956
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,440
that out more or less correct at this

957
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,719
point yeah so 30,000 square feet of

958
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:24,119
flower and canopy um what what does a

959
00:38:21,719 --> 00:38:27,480
typical room size look for you look like

960
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:30,680
for you uh it's about we we have 960

961
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:35,199
plants I have 80 tables 12 plants uh a

962
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:37,559
table they're about 4,000 square ft

963
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,838
rooms um yeah with with almost a

964
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:42,119
thousand plants in each room and I have

965
00:38:39,838 --> 00:38:43,480
nine of those we're on weekly Cycles so

966
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:45,079
it works out really really well this

967
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,440
goes down to the bones of the facility

968
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:49,240
they designed it really well around the

969
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,760
flowering times of the plants to where

970
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:54,358
if we have nine rooms on nine week

971
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:56,160
Cycles every every week we we have a

972
00:38:54,358 --> 00:38:57,480
crop you know and so we're cropping on

973
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,799
Tuesday dayss we're cleaning on

974
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:00,880
Wednesdays and we're filling on

975
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,880
Thursdays and all of that cleaning that

976
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,920
I said that that these guys do um is

977
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,599
done hyper efficiently and these guys

978
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,318
just you know bust their buts it day in

979
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:14,200
and day out to be able to reduce our

980
00:39:11,318 --> 00:39:17,519
downtime and and maximize our

981
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:19,799
production so a lot of that having a

982
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:22,440
really good staff having a motivated

983
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,400
staff and a happy staff and then also

984
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:28,720
having really good

985
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,720
Sops um I got I got a taste of that when

986
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:33,078
I came by the facility uh can you talk a

987
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:37,039
little bit about what you have just on

988
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:39,560
the on the door of every room absolutely

989
00:39:37,039 --> 00:39:41,960
yeah absolutely so I have my first first

990
00:39:39,559 --> 00:39:44,159
I have my irrigation cycles of each room

991
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,838
so we we implemented our drip system as

992
00:39:44,159 --> 00:39:48,598
I said um and so all of those schedules

993
00:39:46,838 --> 00:39:50,920
are posted on the door so that my

994
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:52,720
waterers can really understand you know

995
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,519
when those irrigation Cycles are and and

996
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:57,519
where they're going to have to

997
00:39:53,519 --> 00:40:00,358
supplement by hand also I have my

998
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:03,400
um kind of kind of our our crop work

999
00:40:00,358 --> 00:40:05,400
schedule so we we fill a room and we

1000
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:07,000
stage a room we properly space those

1001
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:09,000
plants on the tables which is super

1002
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,400
important to maximize the canopy a lot

1003
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,079
of people will Overlook that but just

1004
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,519
putting the plants in the right spots

1005
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,160
and making sure everything is evenly

1006
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,039
spaced out is is really going to help um

1007
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:19,879
and then we set our drippers we do our

1008
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,119
lowers which is removing all the lower

1009
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:23,000
portions of the plant that aren't going

1010
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,960
to receive adequate light or produce

1011
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,480
anything anything substantial we remove

1012
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,639
all of that so that the plant can focus

1013
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:32,000
its efforts on on maximizing a grade

1014
00:40:29,639 --> 00:40:33,799
flour we're going to then come through

1015
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,480
and we're going to Trellis everything we

1016
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,640
LST low stress train everything we don't

1017
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,838
do any serious tying down or anything

1018
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,440
like that we just I I tell my team to

1019
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:47,239
put one Cola in each 6x6 inch square of

1020
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:49,440
trellis netting and if I can have you

1021
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:51,399
know a big a big branch and a big Cola

1022
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:54,240
in each one of those squares I consider

1023
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:57,280
that canopy maximized and so that

1024
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:59,639
schedule by the day is is posted on

1025
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:01,280
every door and I just have my team fill

1026
00:40:59,639 --> 00:41:02,879
that out and the lead will go over and

1027
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,319
check it check that the task has been

1028
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,838
done so the SOP is super important but

1029
00:41:06,318 --> 00:41:10,358
so is um the training on that sop so

1030
00:41:08,838 --> 00:41:11,960
that everyone's totally on the same page

1031
00:41:10,358 --> 00:41:13,719
and those tasks are getting done

1032
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:15,480
efficiently and then also that the lead

1033
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:17,639
is checking up that those things are

1034
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:19,159
getting done in an efficient manner and

1035
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:21,679
there's sign offs and dates so that

1036
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:23,799
there's accountability for each task so

1037
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:26,719
I have that and then we also have REI

1038
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,079
signs and so we go above and Beyond on

1039
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:31,679
our REI signs and REI is a restricted

1040
00:41:29,079 --> 00:41:33,960
entry interval and this is something

1041
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,919
that whenever a pesticide is applied it

1042
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:37,880
doesn't matter if it's a soil drench or

1043
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,358
if it's a folar application or anything

1044
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:42,800
like that and REI still applies and so

1045
00:41:41,358 --> 00:41:45,519
there's a duration of time where you

1046
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,400
can't enter that space so let's say for

1047
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:48,679
example we soil drench with something

1048
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,720
like boaria

1049
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:53,279
basana um that's going to have an REI of

1050
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:55,559
I believe four hours and all this

1051
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:57,760
information is going to be provided in

1052
00:41:55,559 --> 00:42:00,119
the label and all the information on my

1053
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,920
signs comes directly from that label and

1054
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,480
we follow those to a T and so I even put

1055
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,639
if um for early entry workers who have

1056
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,480
to enter that space before that REI is

1057
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:15,318
up um I I State the PPE requirements for

1058
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,480
that early entry you know we State when

1059
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:19,679
we finish the application in this case a

1060
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,880
soil drench so we're just literally just

1061
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:24,960
feeding the plants um B basana which has

1062
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,920
multiple effects but all but primarily

1063
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:31,880
as a a insecticide uh for soft bodied

1064
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,480
insects in the red zone and so

1065
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:36,838
we um are going to State those so that

1066
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,199
anyone even someone like yourself who's

1067
00:42:36,838 --> 00:42:40,719
visiting those areas can feel

1068
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:43,000
comfortable and safe and and understand

1069
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:45,000
that you know this product was applied

1070
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,760
or the last product was applied in that

1071
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:49,480
room and and what are the requirements

1072
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,480
to enter that

1073
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:53,960
space I was so excited to see that that

1074
00:42:51,838 --> 00:42:56,318
is super important and I think it gets

1075
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:59,480
overlooked in a lot of facilities un

1076
00:42:56,318 --> 00:43:02,440
fortunately um but I can't stress enough

1077
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,039
how important it is to follow the

1078
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,960
instructions to a te on a pesticide

1079
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:08,358
label even if it's something like

1080
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,639
Bavaria because this is why we're

1081
00:43:08,358 --> 00:43:12,480
running into pest resistance this is why

1082
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:15,440
people are getting pesticide poisoning

1083
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:18,639
in egg um you have to have proper PPE

1084
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,800
you have to follow the REI and um so

1085
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:22,639
yeah I I want to commend you guys for

1086
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,039
that um I think it's it's really really

1087
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,598
important so I'm glad you I'm glad you

1088
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:30,000
touched on it appreciate that

1089
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,880
uh one other thing um that that you and

1090
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,679
I talked about was that uh as an

1091
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,680
employee because of those Sops being

1092
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:40,279
right there um if someone walks up to it

1093
00:43:38,679 --> 00:43:42,199
you know there's no standing around

1094
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,839
because someone can always figure out

1095
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,159
what the next step is and what they need

1096
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:47,719
to do um it's not dependent on the

1097
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:49,118
person it's dependent on the room and I

1098
00:43:47,719 --> 00:43:51,759
think that's another thing to highlight

1099
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,720
do you want to touch on that at all uh

1100
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:55,640
sure yeah absolutely so and then all

1101
00:43:53,719 --> 00:43:56,719
also so we have multiple rooms as I said

1102
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:58,679
so all

1103
00:43:56,719 --> 00:44:00,838
do blue Mock and I have multiple people

1104
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:02,639
doing blue mock my IPM will do IPM

1105
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,318
related blue mock my fertigation lead

1106
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:06,879
will do you know crop nutrition related

1107
00:44:05,318 --> 00:44:07,960
and soil moisture content and all that

1108
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:10,480
kind of stuff they'll check for all

1109
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:11,639
those things I'll check for everything

1110
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,639
um and then we'll go through and set a

1111
00:44:11,639 --> 00:44:15,759
priority list and we'll put that out to

1112
00:44:13,639 --> 00:44:17,480
the entire team so that they know you

1113
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:19,000
know even though all these rooms maybe

1114
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,240
for example let's say multiple rooms

1115
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,880
need Trail list I we'll set a priority

1116
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:24,199
list on which room to get in first and

1117
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,800
then as soon as they go to that room

1118
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:27,199
they just look at the list what what

1119
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,599
what's checked off the list what's not

1120
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:32,679
and they could Jump Right

1121
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:37,480
In awesome and

1122
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:40,279
uh in regards to the the facility itself

1123
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:42,920
I know that there's some limitations and

1124
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:44,040
challenges um with the infrastructure I

1125
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,440
mean there's a lot of things they got

1126
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:48,719
right but what are what are some of the

1127
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,559
challenges that you face um with with

1128
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:52,598
your building you just just the shape of

1129
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:55,040
the building and

1130
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:57,838
everything um let's see the shape of the

1131
00:44:55,039 --> 00:45:01,599
building so we have have a a a large

1132
00:44:57,838 --> 00:45:03,239
Warehouse that has um basically a shell

1133
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,000
within a shell so we have an internal

1134
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:06,318
structure built with drop ceilings and

1135
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:08,599
stuff like that inside of a larger

1136
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:12,440
structure which has its benefits for

1137
00:45:08,599 --> 00:45:14,559
sure um as far as like insulatory

1138
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:17,000
capacity you know that that shell

1139
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:19,319
actually helps um with a lot of things

1140
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:21,119
but with a drop ceiling you can't hang a

1141
00:45:19,318 --> 00:45:22,800
lot of of weight from that ceiling so

1142
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,358
one of our limitations for example is

1143
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,880
the weight bearing capacity of our

1144
00:45:24,358 --> 00:45:33,759
ceiling and if I wanted to deck out that

1145
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:36,318
ceiling um with like 200 You Know topof

1146
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,520
Thee line LEDs it's going to weigh a lot

1147
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:41,318
um those LEDs weigh substantially more

1148
00:45:38,519 --> 00:45:44,000
than a traditional HPS and so to swap

1149
00:45:41,318 --> 00:45:46,639
over for us would be pretty difficult

1150
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,719
and so I guess um the things that we're

1151
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:51,279
doing to maximize our production with

1152
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:54,318
that is is first and foremost making

1153
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,000
sure that those lights are are at the

1154
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,679
proper spacing and distance from the the

1155
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,199
plants I think this is super important

1156
00:45:57,679 --> 00:46:02,679
to make sure you're not wasting photons

1157
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:05,078
um and you're maximizing you know that

1158
00:46:02,679 --> 00:46:06,879
the crossover of the light to to

1159
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:08,280
maximize your homogenity at the max

1160
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,559
canopy height to make sure that all the

1161
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,559
plants are getting the right amount of

1162
00:46:09,559 --> 00:46:13,559
light and the right Leaf surface

1163
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:15,559
temperature you're not wasting photons

1164
00:46:13,559 --> 00:46:18,119
on the lights or or the corridors as

1165
00:46:15,559 --> 00:46:21,079
much as possible and if you're

1166
00:46:18,119 --> 00:46:22,960
maximizing you know those light levels

1167
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:24,519
for for what you got and your Leaf

1168
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,679
surface temperature and then everything

1169
00:46:24,519 --> 00:46:29,599
else can kind of fall in line there um

1170
00:46:27,679 --> 00:46:31,118
by you know just adjusting your room

1171
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:32,800
parameters as far as temperature and

1172
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:37,039
humidity to also help with those kinds

1173
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:38,400
of things um I like a leaf surface

1174
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:41,480
temperature about two degrees cooler

1175
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,760
than our rooms we run our rooms this is

1176
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,920
something cool that I've implemented

1177
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,599
since I've been here at least I think

1178
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,760
it's cool hopefully you guys think it's

1179
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:51,200
cool um I run I start our rooms pretty

1180
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:53,440
hot relatively I think hotter than most

1181
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,078
HPS Growers because as you know with an

1182
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,400
HPS you're going to have a higher Leaf

1183
00:46:55,079 --> 00:46:58,480
surface temperature than if you're

1184
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:00,400
running with an LED so people who run

1185
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,838
LEDs have to increase their room temps

1186
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,720
to get their Leaf temps up to the right

1187
00:47:02,838 --> 00:47:08,078
optimal level so that you have the right

1188
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:11,279
transpiration rates so we run right

1189
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:14,160
around 80 82 degrees U for our room

1190
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:16,559
temps in the first weeks of Bloom and a

1191
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:19,078
higher humidity right so to optimize

1192
00:47:16,559 --> 00:47:20,400
that VPD the vapor pressure deficit it's

1193
00:47:19,079 --> 00:47:22,039
super important to make sure you're

1194
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:24,119
maximizing your transpiration rates and

1195
00:47:22,039 --> 00:47:27,079
your nutrient uptake and all these

1196
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,920
things and so from there will slowly

1197
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:31,760
drop it down throughout the cycle and so

1198
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,920
I'll lower the temp lower the humidity

1199
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,200
step by step kind of in tandem right you

1200
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,680
don't want to lower your temperature

1201
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,399
without lowering your humidity or your

1202
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:40,199
VPD will get out of whack and then it's

1203
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:42,318
going to mess your transpiration rates

1204
00:47:40,199 --> 00:47:45,358
increase pathogen pressure all these

1205
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:47,039
types of things and so we slowly step

1206
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:48,480
down our temperature and humidity to

1207
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:51,079
where when we're finishing at the end

1208
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:53,079
that temperature is pretty low around 70

1209
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:54,400
degrees and in a pretty dry environment

1210
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,920
and so what that's going to do is to

1211
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,838
make sure that you're not off gasing um

1212
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:02,039
Turpin so the turpins are really

1213
00:47:58,838 --> 00:48:04,480
volatile and they're going to um off gas

1214
00:48:02,039 --> 00:48:06,318
and volatize at a higher temperature so

1215
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,559
for us to be able to preserve those we

1216
00:48:06,318 --> 00:48:09,558
drop our temperatures pretty

1217
00:48:07,559 --> 00:48:13,000
significantly in the last couple weeks

1218
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:15,440
of flour it also helps accentuate some

1219
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,199
some of those pigments like anthocyanins

1220
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:19,519
and

1221
00:48:16,199 --> 00:48:21,078
carotenoids um make it make like

1222
00:48:19,519 --> 00:48:23,318
increase some of those secondary

1223
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:24,839
metabolites um in the end of flour and

1224
00:48:23,318 --> 00:48:27,679
preserve some of those turpins so that's

1225
00:48:24,838 --> 00:48:30,000
a kind of a cool little environmental

1226
00:48:27,679 --> 00:48:32,239
hack I'd say to be able to maximize the

1227
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,519
quality of the flower that we're putting

1228
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:37,679
out that's interesting yeah I haven't I

1229
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:40,639
haven't um heard of anyone do it exactly

1230
00:48:37,679 --> 00:48:44,598
that approach um or or lay it out so

1231
00:48:40,639 --> 00:48:46,440
eloquently um interesting enough uh I

1232
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:48,640
couldn't remember the word antoin in my

1233
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:51,358
last interview with

1234
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,078
uh with that with a Cornell researcher

1235
00:48:51,358 --> 00:48:55,679
and it was it was bothering me so I'm

1236
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,559
recording these back to back so it's

1237
00:48:55,679 --> 00:48:59,118
it's thank you for triggering that word

1238
00:48:57,559 --> 00:49:02,599
for me

1239
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:06,119
um yeah so uh your what is your light

1240
00:49:02,599 --> 00:49:08,039
level at at canopy it's pretty low so I

1241
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:10,640
but I I recently have been lowering all

1242
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:12,519
of them so I'm about at 700 at Max

1243
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:15,558
canopy right now which is super low for

1244
00:49:12,519 --> 00:49:18,639
the industry um in my opinion this is

1245
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:21,400
going to compromise yields a bit but as

1246
00:49:18,639 --> 00:49:24,480
far as overall flower quality our flower

1247
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:27,079
quality has is just an absolute another

1248
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:29,240
level from where it was two years ago

1249
00:49:27,079 --> 00:49:31,640
and I would implore anyone who tried

1250
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:33,719
Smoky Point flour in the past and we

1251
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:36,239
have a pretty large consumer demand and

1252
00:49:33,719 --> 00:49:38,798
and following but if you haven't tried

1253
00:49:36,239 --> 00:49:40,879
us recently I I just have to emphasize

1254
00:49:38,798 --> 00:49:43,480
that you gota got to give us a shot

1255
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,680
because our flower quality and our

1256
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,318
actually our

1257
00:49:44,679 --> 00:49:50,000
extracts if you don't mind a a Shameless

1258
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:50,000
plug

1259
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:54,639
Dad yeah well no I think it's great so

1260
00:49:52,519 --> 00:49:57,000
youve you've made little changes that

1261
00:49:54,639 --> 00:49:57,879
have improved the quality of your of

1262
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:00,239
your

1263
00:49:57,880 --> 00:50:02,079
flower and plant health over the last

1264
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:04,399
two years is really what you're getting

1265
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:07,400
at which is which is wonderful and I

1266
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:11,760
think um on that note when you're when

1267
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,559
you're talking about um your lights and

1268
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:17,040
the fact that the light levels were low

1269
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:18,960
I think they were even lower than that

1270
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:22,400
before you before you lowered the lights

1271
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,880
obviously were so so knowing that and

1272
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:25,838
you know and still trying to run a

1273
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,559
production facility you can't add lights

1274
00:50:25,838 --> 00:50:29,920
because of the weight issue with the

1275
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:31,839
ceiling um I I think it's just a

1276
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:34,000
highlight that on a commercial scale

1277
00:50:31,838 --> 00:50:36,078
there's always challenges that you're

1278
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:39,079
dealing with that force you to have to

1279
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,200
step outside of what is optimal

1280
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,680
necessarily like obviously you know and

1281
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:45,838
if you could wave a magic wand and have

1282
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:47,279
a th000 ppfd uh that would be great but

1283
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:49,119
a lot of times there's reasons why

1284
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:50,720
that's not realistic whether it's budget

1285
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,119
whether it's you know in this case the

1286
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:55,078
weight of your ceilings and so you have

1287
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:56,880
to learn to adapt and adjust you know

1288
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:58,519
your other environment environmental

1289
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,240
parameters or other things in order to

1290
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:01,400
be in order to stay in business on a

1291
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,919
commercial scale and that's just

1292
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,160
something that I I kind of want to

1293
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,960
highlight for folks because I think

1294
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:10,239
that's just the important reality of of

1295
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,760
this you know of growing on scale

1296
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,719
absolutely and there's things that you

1297
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,440
can do like that like lowering lights

1298
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:18,639
that really don't cost you anything I

1299
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:20,358
mean the the yo-yos that that we bought

1300
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:23,639
to lower those lights sorry I call them

1301
00:51:20,358 --> 00:51:25,960
yo-yos but um they they really are like

1302
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:28,279
pennies to the dollar and but to get the

1303
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:31,280
linear yield increase that you're going

1304
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,040
to see from increasing your ppfd is is

1305
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,798
going to be

1306
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:40,279
huge and I think on that note when we

1307
00:51:36,798 --> 00:51:42,159
when we talk about um the light being

1308
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:45,760
the limiting factor

1309
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:48,759
here it wouldn't matter so much you know

1310
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,760
how much you addressed fertility and

1311
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:52,280
these other aspects if your light levels

1312
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,760
are so low that they're just not the

1313
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,960
plants aren't able to photosynthesize

1314
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,040
what they need to in order to really

1315
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,440
grow so so one thing that you and I have

1316
00:51:57,039 --> 00:52:03,000
talked about is how you're always

1317
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:05,400
looking to make small changes as you see

1318
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,280
or identify what you think is the

1319
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:10,079
biggest limiting factor of growth in a

1320
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:14,400
given room do you want to kind of touch

1321
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:17,079
on that absolutely yeah so it it comes

1322
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,318
down to to costs and everything as well

1323
00:52:17,079 --> 00:52:21,480
right so there's other things that you

1324
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:23,519
can do like like just monitoring your

1325
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:25,880
soil moisture as you know is one of the

1326
00:52:23,519 --> 00:52:28,960
most crucial aspects and so one thing

1327
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:30,760
that we did was install um Grill link

1328
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,838
controllers and soil moisture sensors

1329
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:36,079
and it's not a massive investment to be

1330
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:38,679
quite honest and the you know the

1331
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:40,920
results that you get from being able to

1332
00:52:38,679 --> 00:52:43,798
use an analytical tool to get a precise

1333
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:46,480
calculation of your soal moisture is is

1334
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:48,639
really really important and also for

1335
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:50,039
example your environmental controlling

1336
00:52:48,639 --> 00:52:53,440
equipment if you

1337
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:55,039
can um if you can get these things

1338
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,440
communicating with each other so that

1339
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:59,798
for for example if you have heaters and

1340
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,159
air conditioners or air handlers in your

1341
00:52:59,798 --> 00:53:03,519
rooms and they're set on separate

1342
00:53:02,159 --> 00:53:05,399
thermostats and maybe they've been

1343
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:08,400
running in your facility for five six

1344
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:10,079
seven years um when's the last time

1345
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,000
those thermostats have been calibrated

1346
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,760
is everything totally accurate and so is

1347
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:16,960
any of your equipment competing with

1348
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:18,400
each other and if you can get it to make

1349
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,000
sure that it's communicating through a

1350
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:22,000
central controller and it's all being

1351
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,719
controlled together it's just going to

1352
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,400
increase the efficiency of your room and

1353
00:53:23,719 --> 00:53:27,798
your equipment as well to save you on

1354
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:30,079
that overhead

1355
00:53:27,798 --> 00:53:33,039
expense now you've had some other

1356
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:35,359
challenges with the with the

1357
00:53:33,039 --> 00:53:37,838
infrastructure um either due to scale or

1358
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:39,400
due to the the building you know the

1359
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,119
infrastructure of the building itself is

1360
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,798
there anything you want to touch on

1361
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:46,798
there in terms of small changes that you

1362
00:53:42,798 --> 00:53:49,880
made whether it's in harvesting curing

1363
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:52,039
um oh I'd love to yeah I'd love to so if

1364
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,960
I can touch on harvest harvesting and

1365
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:56,838
curing and drying I think that's kind of

1366
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:58,119
overlooked a lot of people just focus on

1367
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:01,000
growing growing

1368
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:02,559
growing and uh you know even the best

1369
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:04,440
the best grower in the world who

1370
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,200
produces an amazing product that product

1371
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:08,920
could be ruined really quick if it's not

1372
00:54:06,199 --> 00:54:10,960
dried or or you know stored and cured

1373
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:13,639
under the right condition so I can't

1374
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:15,838
emphasize this enough um that's one of

1375
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:18,358
the major changes we revamped our entire

1376
00:54:15,838 --> 00:54:20,519
dry room and for example this is

1377
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:22,960
something that's uh got a huge cost

1378
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:24,798
benefit we implemented uh polyc

1379
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:27,679
convection tubing so you might see this

1380
00:54:24,798 --> 00:54:30,239
stuff in green houses in but we

1381
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:34,078
implement it into our dry room and all

1382
00:54:30,239 --> 00:54:36,679
this basically is is like a a plastic

1383
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:38,039
tube that we connect to a Max fan and we

1384
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:39,798
hang it from the ceiling and put it

1385
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:41,719
right above our drying racks and so

1386
00:54:39,798 --> 00:54:43,400
instead of having fans or like

1387
00:54:41,719 --> 00:54:45,959
oscillating fans that most people will

1388
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:47,838
have in their dry room so we have our

1389
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,039
our dry room laid out so where we have a

1390
00:54:47,838 --> 00:54:51,519
hanging rack and another hanging rack

1391
00:54:50,039 --> 00:54:53,519
next to it but in between those two

1392
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,759
hanging racks we have a convection tube

1393
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:59,798
that goes uh in parallel to it from

1394
00:54:56,760 --> 00:55:02,000
above and gently gently blows air from

1395
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:04,519
top to bottom and then extracts from the

1396
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:07,318
bottom and so you have this almost

1397
00:55:04,519 --> 00:55:09,679
laminer air flow effect where none of

1398
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:12,599
the flow is being you know bombarded or

1399
00:55:09,679 --> 00:55:15,199
blasted with with air directly rather

1400
00:55:12,599 --> 00:55:17,000
you have this kind of soft gentle stream

1401
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,919
of air that's going in between the

1402
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,838
drying

1403
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:22,920
flowers um and providing a more

1404
00:55:20,838 --> 00:55:26,519
consistent and homogeneous you know

1405
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:28,599
drying condition for the for the flowers

1406
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:30,440
yeah I was experimenting with that uh I

1407
00:55:28,599 --> 00:55:32,359
I saw that in your facility first

1408
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,440
actually um I wasn't even aware that it

1409
00:55:32,358 --> 00:55:36,558
existed it's a I I call it Greenhouse

1410
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:38,240
convection tubing it's the same thing if

1411
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:41,160
you Google that term you can find it

1412
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:42,798
online um or if you go on our on our

1413
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:45,038
social media accounts on Instagram you

1414
00:55:42,798 --> 00:55:48,798
can see some photos from my grow um I

1415
00:55:45,039 --> 00:55:50,720
put it as under canopy airflow as a

1416
00:55:48,798 --> 00:55:53,838
there's a company called duct socks that

1417
00:55:50,719 --> 00:55:56,919
makes um a more robust version of this

1418
00:55:53,838 --> 00:55:58,318
out of a fabric material material um

1419
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:00,358
that you hook up to a fan and then it

1420
00:55:58,318 --> 00:56:01,880
pushes air and you can so I was using it

1421
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:04,519
for underc canopy air flow and this was

1422
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,720
a really cheap way of of experimenting

1423
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,559
with that um in at my grow and I so far

1424
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:12,480
really like it I think it I think it's

1425
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:14,880
working really well to get air um

1426
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,760
underneath to improve my air flow so

1427
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:19,760
yeah I appreciated that I learned

1428
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:22,319
something new and uh yeah I'm enjoying

1429
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,440
that experiment I am so glad that I

1430
00:56:22,318 --> 00:56:25,239
taught you something Tad because You'

1431
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:28,599
have taught me so much over the years

1432
00:56:25,239 --> 00:56:31,719
that's that's awesome yeah so it's been

1433
00:56:28,599 --> 00:56:33,160
it's been a fun experiment um running

1434
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:35,519
under canopy airflow because it's

1435
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:36,759
something I've always wanted to try but

1436
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:38,880
uh there W there weren't a lot of

1437
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,000
options for a home grower I mean there's

1438
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:44,358
stuff on scale but like um yeah this was

1439
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:46,519
like 30 or $40 and I massively overpaid

1440
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:48,920
for what I got but uh it gave me the

1441
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:50,159
opportunity to try it out so I'm still

1442
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,960
seeing if there's a way I can offer it

1443
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:56,279
to folks more affordably because it's

1444
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:59,240
it's literally just a plast itic bag

1445
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,720
tube that's like anywhere from let's say

1446
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:05,159
8 to 12 in in diameter and it's got a

1447
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,000
couple holes in it with a hole punch is

1448
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:09,399
spaced out so that it's just putting

1449
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,559
that air out more uh passively so you

1450
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:15,358
get a massive volume of air at a very

1451
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:18,359
low air flow rate which is uh really

1452
00:57:15,358 --> 00:57:19,798
nice um for a lot of reasons and I think

1453
00:57:18,358 --> 00:57:22,239
it's interesting that you're using that

1454
00:57:19,798 --> 00:57:25,318
in the in the drawing room you're also

1455
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:27,759
using um to to plug

1456
00:57:25,318 --> 00:57:30,759
a company that I've seen now in a couple

1457
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:34,520
different uh facilities um you're using

1458
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:35,799
those uh drying uh hangers I don't know

1459
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:36,719
what the brand is or what they're called

1460
00:57:35,798 --> 00:57:38,759
you want to you want to go ahead and

1461
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:40,358
give them a little plug I can yeah

1462
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,400
absolutely dry flow I can't say enough

1463
00:57:40,358 --> 00:57:44,159
good things about them so um these guys

1464
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,200
are making really high quality drying

1465
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:48,239
racks and it makes stuff really really

1466
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:50,279
easy for us so we have these mobile

1467
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:53,719
racks on you know really high quality

1468
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:55,319
aluminum racks um we've been using these

1469
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:57,838
kind of since I've been here

1470
00:57:55,318 --> 00:58:02,279
we're still using the exact same setup

1471
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:04,719
you know nothing like super uh durable

1472
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,280
very easy to clean you can't really ask

1473
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:07,598
for much more than than what these guys

1474
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,880
are providing I think they're out of

1475
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,519
Oregon sorry if I that I I'm pretty sure

1476
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,160
they are too and I don't know the guys

1477
00:58:13,519 --> 00:58:16,679
uh I've only seen it now in a couple

1478
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,558
facilities you guys in Collective

1479
00:58:16,679 --> 00:58:20,358
elevation but I love the Ingenuity

1480
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,880
behind it like you said super easy to

1481
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:24,798
clean you harvest and put it on these

1482
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,200
they look like kind of like massive coat

1483
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:29,280
fers for lack of a better way to

1484
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:32,358
visually describe them um and you just

1485
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,079
put the uh you put the branches or the

1486
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:35,558
buds directly on there to hang them to

1487
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:38,440
dry and then you can just wheel that

1488
00:58:35,559 --> 00:58:42,079
right into your your curing your drying

1489
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:44,599
space exactly and then we have like some

1490
00:58:42,079 --> 00:58:47,400
permanent uh poles let's say that stay

1491
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:48,960
in our dry R so instead of you you

1492
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,200
definitely can just wheel those racks

1493
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:53,400
into your dry room what we do is we you

1494
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:54,960
know we saved on the budget we only

1495
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,480
bought a couple of those racks which

1496
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:59,039
worked out really well for us so we

1497
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:01,358
transport the sticks which is what the

1498
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:03,680
coat hang let's say coat hangers are are

1499
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:05,119
hanging on WE transport those with the

1500
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:07,159
racks and then we just raise up the

1501
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:09,000
entire stick and hang it on the poles in

1502
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:11,519
the dry room and then reuse those two

1503
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:14,400
racks so we only have two rolling racks

1504
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:16,000
for our entire facility and yeah can't

1505
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:18,119
say enough good things about

1506
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,960
them I mean that's just such so much

1507
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:22,318
better than trying to throw it all into

1508
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:23,838
a bunch of totes and carry it down to

1509
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:25,318
your drive room I mean that's so much

1510
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:27,920
harder on the flow

1511
00:59:25,318 --> 00:59:30,199
yeah I mean there's it's just a really

1512
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:33,119
good solution if folks aren't aware of

1513
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:35,279
it um cuz I hadn't seen it in in a lot

1514
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:36,599
of facilities until recently so I just

1515
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,920
you know maybe everyone knows about it

1516
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:41,000
but if not it's just something people

1517
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:42,440
should consider it minimizes touches too

1518
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,039
right so we're like literally just

1519
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,240
touching the stem when we chop it we

1520
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,839
hang it one time on that hanger and then

1521
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:49,759
we don't ever you know have to

1522
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,038
reposition that plant until it comes out

1523
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:54,680
of the dry room which is really

1524
00:59:51,039 --> 00:59:57,240
convenient too yeah well um anything

1525
00:59:54,679 --> 01:00:00,199
else you want to touch on regarding the

1526
00:59:57,239 --> 01:00:02,159
harvesting drying curing side of things

1527
01:00:00,199 --> 01:00:04,798
if I could say one more thing yeah um we

1528
01:00:02,159 --> 01:00:07,000
implemented also this bearing uh Barrel

1529
01:00:04,798 --> 01:00:09,280
curing protocol which I think you got to

1530
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:11,639
see which is kind of cool um I think

1531
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,440
that most producer processors should be

1532
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:16,519
doing this a lot of us are but some of

1533
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:18,599
us aren't so I would just say you know

1534
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:21,719
and we're also doing uh moisture

1535
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:23,440
readings daily on our drying flow so

1536
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:25,118
that I can adjust the parameters of our

1537
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,039
dry R to make sure that it's always in

1538
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:28,880
the optimal conditions because when it

1539
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,680
comes down I want to make sure it's at

1540
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:32,680
the perfect um moisture

1541
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:42,119
content sorry I know I've had some

1542
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,960
technical issues the last couple of

1543
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,318
podcasts as I've been trying out new

1544
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:48,358
software that's why this podcast ended

1545
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,519
so abruptly I think I've got it all

1546
01:00:48,358 --> 01:00:52,078
smooth out moving forward though but

1547
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:53,719
that was Matthew Butters and you are
