welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:24,439
science podcast I'm your host Tad husy

4
00:00:22,118 --> 00:00:26,160
kiss Organics this is the podcast where

5
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:28,000
we discuss The Cutting Edge of growing

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:29,559
from a science-based perspective and

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:35,009
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:44,399
knowledge this week's topic micro risal

10
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:46,679
[Music]

11
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,759
fungi by now practically everyone has

12
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,840
heard of micro isal fungi it's pretty

13
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:52,640
incredible fungus that forms a symbiotic

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:55,000
relationship with the roots of many

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
plants but I see a lot of misinformation

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,119
and claims out there about it and I

17
00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,279
thought it would be a good topic to dive

18
00:00:58,119 --> 00:01:02,198
into after checking this out if you want

19
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,920
to learn more I do have a blog post on

20
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:08,478
our website at

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:11,879
www.k organics.com uh under the learn

22
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:14,400
tab or just type moo my YCO into the

23
00:01:11,879 --> 00:01:16,879
search tab scroll down and you'll see uh

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,000
the blog post as well an interview I did

25
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:22,280
episode 77 with Dr yorm kapulnik Who is

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,478
an expert researcher on micro risal

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:26,920
fungi I first heard about Mike risel

28
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:28,319
fungi from my dear friend Jeff lowenfels

29
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:30,719
he's always been great at sharing

30
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,919
exciting new findings in the micro world

31
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,599
and his most recent book teaming with

32
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,599
bacteria talks about ryop fagy a much

33
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:40,199
more recent discovery about how bacteria

34
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:42,759
can travel into root cells by infecting

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,879
the cells at the root tip marem once

36
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:46,759
inside the root these bacteria lose

37
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:48,478
their cell walls and essentially leak

38
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:50,239
nutrients inside the plant before

39
00:01:48,478 --> 00:01:52,640
leaving again through the root tips

40
00:01:50,239 --> 00:01:55,000
reforming their cell walls again in the

41
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,039
rizosphere and cycling over and over

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,599
again as a way of creating nutrient

43
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,280
cycling for the plant but Micro risal

44
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,199
fun fi wasn't a recent discovery the

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:07,519
relationship between fungi and plant

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,679
roots was written about as early as 1885

47
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,719
and new research over the last century

48
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,280
learned a lot about this amazing

49
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:16,919
symbiosis for instance we now know that

50
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,919
micro isal fungi exists in almost all

51
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,679
ecosystems ranging from deserts to

52
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:23,719
Tropical forests about 90% of plants

53
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,719
have a micro risal relationship but

54
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:28,840
Micro isal fungi have been around for

55
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:31,199
over 400 million years so Jeff is a

56
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,719
stickler for proper terminology and so I

57
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:38,399
wanted to start there moo means fungus

58
00:02:34,719 --> 00:02:40,359
Riso means root makes sense huh micology

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,640
is the study of fungi and mushrooms are

60
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,680
the Fring body of some fungi knowing

61
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:47,039
that risom mean Roots terms like

62
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,920
rizosphere the area around the roots

63
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:52,039
becomes more

64
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:54,318
clear so micro isal fungi is the proper

65
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,158
term for the specific fungi that form a

66
00:02:54,318 --> 00:03:00,039
symbiotic relationship with the roots of

67
00:02:56,158 --> 00:03:03,280
plants micro is the actual Association

68
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,199
between roots and fungi it's subtle but

69
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,919
there is a difference there so if you're

70
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
referring to just the fungi then you

71
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,119
should say micro Rizal fungi if you're

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,158
referring to the relationship then it's

73
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,959
micro

74
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:18,158
rise this relationship makes a ton of

75
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,640
sense from a from a plant and ecology

76
00:03:18,158 --> 00:03:22,840
perspective plant roots are hospitable

77
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,878
sites for fungi to Anchor to and produce

78
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,759
H The Roots provide essential nutrients

79
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:30,719
to assist in the growth of the fungi and

80
00:03:27,759 --> 00:03:33,120
the fungal biomass act in extension or

81
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:34,719
virtual root system for the plant

82
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,560
increasing the amount of water and

83
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:39,519
nutrients the plant can obtain from the

84
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,840
surrounding soil it actually increases

85
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,599
the absorbing surface area of the roots

86
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,120
by up to 40 times what it would be

87
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,679
without this relationship now in regards

88
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,599
to soil Health there's enhanced soil

89
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,519
tilth which is a reference to the

90
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:55,119
physical properties of the soil and its

91
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:57,120
suitability for growing plants it also

92
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
improves carbon sequestration and the

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,039
transfer of water and nutrients to the

94
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,840
plant like I already mentioned mentioned

95
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,519
there's good research showing that for

96
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,640
plants that have this mutualistic

97
00:04:04,519 --> 00:04:09,158
relationship that you'll see numerous

98
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:11,279
benefits typically micro risal fungi

99
00:04:09,158 --> 00:04:13,280
gets associated with improved phosphorus

100
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,719
uptake and that's certainly true

101
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,439
phosphorus being key for root growth

102
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:20,319
photosynthesis and cell division but it

103
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:21,079
also leads to Greater nutrient uptake of

104
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:23,800
other

105
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:26,840
nutrients um and much more advantageous

106
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,639
effects one such mineral is sulfur which

107
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:31,839
plays a key role in plant metabolism the

108
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:33,800
formation of proteins vitamins and amino

109
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:36,279
acids and the formation of certain

110
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,759
volatile sulfur tpin like the skunk

111
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:41,000
smell in

112
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,560
cannabis micro isal symbiosis can

113
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,680
improve photosynthesis and

114
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,839
photosynthetic pigments the plant's

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:49,720
ability to combat various abiotic

116
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,478
stressors like drought salinity cold

117
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,479
temperatures and heavy metal stress it

118
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:57,360
also plays a role in plant protection

119
00:04:54,478 --> 00:04:58,680
from microbial pathogens interestingly

120
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
something that I didn't know before I

121
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,079
started researching this podcast was

122
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,759
that many desert plants have a micro

123
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:08,198
isal relationship and would not be able

124
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,080
to survive without it so there's this

125
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:12,120
co-evolutionary perspective that I think

126
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:14,478
is really interesting from an ecology

127
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,360
perspective and there's many different

128
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:18,318
types of micro isal fungi and it's

129
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,560
important to distinguish the difference

130
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:21,319
I used to think that you could just go

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,280
buy any micro product and you'd be good

132
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,120
to go but it's a bit more complicated

133
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:28,638
than that there's four main types of

134
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,680
micro risal fungi that I'm familiar with

135
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,960
Endo micro Ral fungi Ecto micro isal

136
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:38,199
fungi ericoid micro isal fungi and

137
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,680
Orchid micro isal fungi let's skip over

138
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,319
ericoid as it has very limited usage and

139
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,519
there's only one commercially available

140
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:46,439
product that I'm aware of you know forms

141
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:49,599
a symbiotic relationship with plants

142
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:52,120
like blueberries cranberries rodendan

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,800
aelas it's less important for gardeners

144
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:56,280
and cannabis Growers since it does not

145
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,759
have a relationship with those plants

146
00:05:56,279 --> 00:06:00,079
Orchid micro isal fungi is also pretty

147
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,840
self-explanatory

148
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:04,918
forming a relationship with orchids so

149
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:07,119
we'll skip that one as well Ecto micro

150
00:06:04,918 --> 00:06:09,198
risal fungi which is a more common type

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,079
of Micro isal fungi and found in many

152
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,520
commercial micro risal Blends mostly

153
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:16,198
because it's quite easy to culture in

154
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:18,439
vitro um compared to other types the

155
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,560
majority of ecto micro risal fungi

156
00:06:18,439 --> 00:06:23,800
belong to classes like bides or Asom

157
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,680
mises and form fruiting bodies like

158
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,840
mushrooms puff balls and toad stools

159
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,918
truffles interestingly enough are Ecto

160
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:32,159
micro risal

161
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:34,959
forming a relationship with specific

162
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:37,000
tree roots typically when I think of

163
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:40,000
ecto micro risal fungi I think of

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:42,038
conifers and forests Ecto micro isal

165
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,240
fungi helped provide host trees with

166
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:47,120
nutrients from the soil and water in

167
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,079
exchange for plant carbon Ecto means

168
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,399
outer which is helpful and remember that

169
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:54,519
Ecto micro isal fungi sort of form a

170
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:57,679
sheath around the roots extending out

171
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:59,758
into the soil very cool for Forest

172
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
restoration and when you typically see

173
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,800
those photos of the plant roots with all

174
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,038
those little uh White H coming off of it

175
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,160
that's Ecto micr rizon endom micro risal

176
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:12,800
fungi is the one we want to focus on as

177
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,720
a gardener whether you're growing

178
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,000
cannabis or tomatoes or fruit trees Endo

179
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,720
means internal or within and Endo micro

180
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,319
risal fungi infects within the cortical

181
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,520
cells and grows

182
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:29,400
intercellularly in fact ericoid and

183
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:32,038
Orchid micro isop fungi are both endo

184
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:34,279
micro risal fungi however the most

185
00:07:32,038 --> 00:07:37,399
commonly heard type you'll hear about is

186
00:07:34,279 --> 00:07:41,159
vam which stands for vascular or

187
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:43,279
vascular microa or am or am which is a

188
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:47,120
shorter name that just shortens it down

189
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:50,000
to our vascular microa am fungi are the

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,280
most common and abundant of micro isal

191
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,680
of endom micro isal fungi and are

192
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:56,318
characterized by the formation of

193
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,879
arbuscules or hyoc coils within cortical

194
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:01,560
cells arbuscules is just a fancy word

195
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,639
for the shape uh picture the top half of

196
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,199
a deciduous tree with all its branches

197
00:08:03,639 --> 00:08:08,598
reaching out um and hyle coils are

198
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,560
exactly what it sounds like fungal Hy

199
00:08:08,598 --> 00:08:14,560
that form coils so cortical cells or the

200
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:17,360
cortex is the outer layer of the stem or

201
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,478
root in a vascular plant like cannabis

202
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,439
right below the epidermis but outside

203
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:27,120
the vascular bundles and lastly our busc

204
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:29,959
microa for uh form mycelium that extends

205
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:31,840
out into the soil these are muscular or

206
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:34,319
hypoc coils are the main sites for

207
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:36,079
nutrient exchange between the plant and

208
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,440
the fungi so I found this really

209
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,479
interesting there was research done in

210
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:44,040
2011 entitled reciprocal rewards

211
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:46,920
stabilize cooperation in the micro isal

212
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,559
symbiosis by K out of the Netherlands

213
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,079
that looked at how this relationship

214
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:53,239
works and what makes it mutualistic or

215
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
symbiotic the relationship between

216
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:57,440
plants and fungi and other soil

217
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:59,319
microorganisms is really complex and

218
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,120
there's a lot of potential for

219
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:04,200
exploitation of resources I mean

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,039
realistically each organism is looking

221
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,000
out for their own best interests so how

222
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:11,000
do they keep this relationship fair for

223
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,440
both parties so it turns out that plants

224
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,039
can detect discriminate and reward the

225
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,480
best fungal partners with more

226
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:21,559
carbohydrates while the micro risal

227
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,000
fungi can enforce their end of the

228
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:26,639
relationship by increasing nutrient

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,958
transfer only to the host plant roots

230
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:32,600
providing the most carbohydrates so this

231
00:09:29,958 --> 00:09:35,119
checks and balances system has evolved

232
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,600
between these fungi imp plant roots to

233
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,240
allow them to co-evolve which is really

234
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,800
fascinating you know I mentioned before

235
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,320
that Ecto micro isal fungi can be grown

236
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,359
in vitro in a lab but endom Micro risal

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,399
fungi requires a plant Host this makes

238
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,519
it much more challenging to grow and

239
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,360
therefore we see much lower Spore counts

240
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,720
in commercial products relative to Ecto

241
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,639
micro risal fungi well why is this

242
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,360
important

243
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:03,319
it's important to understand because

244
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,079
it's not as simple as just buying a

245
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:07,320
product because it contains micro isal

246
00:10:05,078 --> 00:10:09,319
fungi you have to make sure you are

247
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,879
buying the right type of Micro risal

248
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,120
fungi for your plant and in high enough

249
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:17,278
concentrations to actually get micro

250
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,639
risal infection many fertilizer or soil

251
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:21,759
companies will add just a tiny amount of

252
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:24,159
micro isal fungi to their product just

253
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:26,679
to get it on the label but not enough to

254
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,838
make any difference in regards to actual

255
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:29,919
infection in a reasonable time frame for

256
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:33,120
your

257
00:10:29,919 --> 00:10:36,240
plants endom micro isal fungi will also

258
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,560
vary based on the species of fungi the

259
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,159
most common is glomus inates also known

260
00:10:39,559 --> 00:10:43,479
as ryop fagus

261
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:45,199
irregularis and bear with me with all my

262
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,800
pronunciations I'm I'm going to do my

263
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,399
best but they're they're probably not

264
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:52,120
all going to be perfect so I'm apologize

265
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:56,360
for that in advance you'll also see

266
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:58,759
glomus Mosier glus aggregatum glus

267
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,039
desert a cola and many more and to

268
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:03,399
further complicate matters depending on

269
00:11:01,039 --> 00:11:05,759
where you Source the fungi you'll end up

270
00:11:03,399 --> 00:11:09,159
with a different strain of the same

271
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:12,240
species of ROP fagus irregularis for

272
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:14,360
example Dr yor kapulnik from the Volcan

273
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:17,159
Institute who is a soil scientist that

274
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:19,560
specializes in risos spere interactions

275
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:21,639
talks about how the product dinico was

276
00:11:19,559 --> 00:11:24,239
created by isolating a native strain in

277
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:27,039
Israel that was quite resilient and more

278
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,600
effective at greater pH ranges some of

279
00:11:27,039 --> 00:11:31,120
the strains will be more effective or

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,360
resist to Drought or flooding or

281
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,078
temperature ranges so you can't assume

282
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,839
that you'll get the same results just

283
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,399
because the name of the micro isal

284
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,800
species is the same on two different

285
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:43,919
containers that being said there's very

286
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,799
few companies that actually are able to

287
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:48,039
commercially produce and sell endom

288
00:11:45,799 --> 00:11:49,919
micro risal fungi so most of the supply

289
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,120
in North America is coming from a few

290
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,278
suppliers and everyone is just repacking

291
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,519
it what is some of the research though

292
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:58,958
on micro risal fungi in relation to

293
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:00,440
cannabis the research is pretty mixed

294
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,439
but I want to highlight some papers that

295
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,399
I found

296
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,519
interesting in 2022 a paper entitled

297
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,278
enhancement of growth and cannabinoids

298
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,600
content of hemp Cannabis sativa using

299
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:16,439
arbuscular micro isal fungi by wasan

300
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,120
sakam out of Thailand looked at the

301
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,839
effects of applying two different

302
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:24,320
species of arbuscular micro risal fungi

303
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:26,320
ryop fagus prolifer and ryop fagus

304
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,639
aggregatus and compared it to a

305
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,199
non-micro risal control and plants that

306
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,560
receive re the synthetic

307
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:36,120
fertilizer after 60 days micro risal

308
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:39,838
plants outperformed non-micro risal

309
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,519
plants in stem height stem diameter stem

310
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:46,040
dry weight number of branches and number

311
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:48,240
of flowers plants inoculated with ryop

312
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:50,838
fagus prolifer did not perform as well

313
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:54,120
as those inoculated with ryop fagus

314
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,639
aggregatus concentrations of TBD and THC

315
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:59,959
were also highest in Plants inoculated

316
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,440
with ryop fagus aggregatus with while

317
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:03,239
those that were inoculated with ryop

318
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,600
fagus prolifer and the synthetic

319
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:09,000
fertilizer variants only had

320
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:13,240
intermediate concentrations of THC and

321
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:16,078
CBD in another paper from 2021 entitled

322
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:18,120
effect of ryop fagus irregularis on

323
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:19,879
growth and quality of Cannabis sativa

324
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,560

content root and stem length weight and

329
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,920
survival rate what they found was that

330
00:13:32,759 --> 00:13:36,679
the biomass of the seedlings Roots the

331
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:39,159
fresh weight and the nitrogen content

332
00:13:36,679 --> 00:13:42,159
were not affected by the micro risal

333
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:45,039
colonization however root length stem

334
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:47,399
dry weight survival rate and phosphorous

335
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:48,919
content were significantly increased by

336
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,799
5%

337
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:53,599
24.3% and 12.4%

338
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,758
respectively and this was using

339
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,480
treatments with rates of 40 80 and 120

340
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,320
fungal spores per liter of nutrient

341
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,839
solution solution of ryop fagus

342
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,440
irregularis so fairly High rates

343
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,120
certainly much higher than you would see

344
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:11,279
in any soil or fertilizer within on the

345
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:13,320
label so in the second half of this

346
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:15,120
podcast I want to dive into the

347
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,480
Practical and actionable questions

348
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,799
regarding micro isal fungi such as the

349
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,000
best way to apply micro isal fungi or

350
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:24,359
incorporate into your grow do you need

351
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,759
to apply it every cycle if you're using

352
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,959
reusing your media uh what role does

353
00:14:26,759 --> 00:14:31,320
Micro risal fungi play in heavy met

354
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:33,958
uptake how long does it really take for

355
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,639
infection and finally my opinion on

356
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:37,638
whether or not you should be using micro

357
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:40,278
isal fungi in your grow based on the

358
00:14:37,639 --> 00:14:41,959
research I've seen the full podcast as

359
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,360
well as the transcript of this podcast

360
00:14:41,958 --> 00:14:45,479
and links to the research will be

361
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,600
