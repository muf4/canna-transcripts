1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,080
process you're going to learn a lot

2
00:00:01,919 --> 00:00:07,240
about your room just by experimenting

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:08,519
and figuring out when do I put that one

4
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:13,039
question you're going to be like holy

5
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,400
smokes like I watered these beds to

6
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:19,640
20mar give you know for

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,600
example and then I'm on day seven and

8
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:24,760
we're you know at

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,439
50 right and that really is the kind of

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,039
like holy smokes this they don't need

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,278
that much water or oh my God you know my

12
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:35,640
room super hot I'm on day four and I'm

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:39,320
at 160 like whoops so that's that kind

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,719
of experimentation um that you know just

15
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,320
the question of when do I put blue mats

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,198
in can really be a very powerful

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,119
learning experience for how your plants

18
00:00:46,198 --> 00:00:50,119
interact with their environment
