00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,420
it's good talking to Ken yeah so I

45
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,820
wanted to start off and give listeners a

46
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:52,890
little bit of a background into your

47
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,688
life history before we start talking

48
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,670
about blue mats and irrigation can you

49
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,798
share a little bit more about what kind

50
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:01,618
of path you went on that led you down to

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,710
starting sustainable village oh sure I

52
00:02:01,618 --> 00:02:07,349
well I guess what starts back in the

53
00:02:04,709 --> 00:02:10,560
early days of those sixty like the mid

54
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:13,680
1960s I was in a Peace Corps type

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,348
program in a remote part of Mexico

56
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,000
there was no power running water or

57
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:21,500
anything in the little village where I

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:26,250
was staying we worked on projects

59
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:30,000
including aquaponics and um kind of fish

60
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:31,949
farming and sanitation projects and

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,229
management projects and it just was

62
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:37,468
really interesting and kind of started

63
00:02:34,229 --> 00:02:39,358
me on a whole life path of things that

64
00:02:37,468 --> 00:02:42,299
were environmental and if you save any

65
00:02:39,359 --> 00:02:45,060
corporate technology alternative energy

66
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,790
and things like that and pretty much

67
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:48,870
have been doing it ever since

68
00:02:46,789 --> 00:02:50,400
now you mentioned to me before we

69
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,500
started the podcast that you've actually

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,019
been running small businesses or

71
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:57,299
starting businesses for almost sixty

72
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,310
years you said is that right probably a

73
00:02:57,299 --> 00:03:03,269
little bit more than that yeah I think

74
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:06,389
um some rather mid-1950s bubbly I

75
00:03:03,269 --> 00:03:08,039
started probably 55 or 60 different

76
00:03:06,389 --> 00:03:10,859
businesses Wow

77
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:13,979
so how did that path lead you to blue

78
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:17,699
mass well you know it's part of the back

79
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:20,158
to the land movement in the late sixties

80
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:23,430
who I was living your Mill Bay area in

81
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:25,408
Berkeley in my San Francisco there was a

82
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,769
whole big movement up north to Mendocino

83
00:03:25,408 --> 00:03:32,728
in Humboldt County and so I was part of

84
00:03:28,769 --> 00:03:38,750
that and moved up to Humboldt and I had

85
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:41,579
my first marijuana farm in 1971 okay and

86
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,340
it was just really intriguing and then I

87
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:46,489
I was I became a partner in a natural

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,979
food store up there in Barbourville and

89
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:52,709
we had it was kind of like a cultural

90
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:55,769
center because back in those days there

91
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:58,019
was a real contrast conflict between the

92
00:03:55,769 --> 00:04:00,560
kind of younger more counterculture

93
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:02,489
people and the old um loggers and

94
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:04,729
conservative people that were there so

95
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:07,739
our natural food store kind of became a

96
00:04:04,729 --> 00:04:10,560
kind of a community center in a way and

97
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,900
and people would always ask us to get

98
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,969
things that they needed and so I mean it

99
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,439
was real interesting we had I mean and

100
00:04:14,969 --> 00:04:21,149
the main thing white people made money

101
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:22,889
then was growing marijuana and so we had

102
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:25,168
all these customers coming in buying

103
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,180
grains and herbs and torn jeans

104
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:29,069
barefooted torn t-shirt

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,990
under dollar bills kind of falling out

106
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:34,500
of their pockets as they would walk up

107
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,780
and down the aisles and so they'd say

108
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:40,319
hey can you get us some drip tubing or

109
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:42,750
about some organic fertilizers or maybe

110
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,879
some needs in rock phosphate use some

111
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,978
granite dust we came back wormhole and

112
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:50,159
so we started getting all these things

113
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:54,449
for people they're sensing on your

114
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,449
Gatien products and it got so so big it

115
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,069
started another store it called open

116
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:01,139
circle up there that was all just I

117
00:04:59,069 --> 00:05:04,228
think it might have been the first store

118
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:05,879
oriented towards marijuana farming so

119
00:05:04,228 --> 00:05:09,029
first one I've ever heard of or knew

120
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:11,189
about at least and so you started doing

121
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:14,549
all kinds of products for for our

122
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:16,918
suppliers and that was just it was a

123
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:19,098
going crazy will end up what we had and

124
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:23,448
they started in another store in will

125
00:05:19,098 --> 00:05:27,839
another store in Ukiah and then one in

126
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:29,788
Santa Rosa and so that was all just we

127
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:33,619
designed this really steep fast growing

128
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:37,319
curve and then the war on drugs started

129
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:40,470
and at first it was pretty mellow they

130
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:42,180
would you know pull a few plants and let

131
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:43,979
me keep the rest then there's no big

132
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:46,319
deal but then you started becoming

133
00:05:43,978 --> 00:05:48,629
soldiers and helicopters and really

134
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,300
serious add new things and and they

135
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:54,120
started at least in those days we sell

136
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,310
miles and miles of poly pipe tubing to

137
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,500
go from creeks and Springs to people's

138
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,060
gardens remote gardens and then when

139
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,550
they started using the helicopters that

140
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,800
use they started following the water

141
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:07,560
lines to find that where people gardens

142
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:12,000
were and that's when I first discovered

143
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:14,038
blue mats and with some idea of instead

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,158
of having these come up telltale

145
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:18,810
breadcrumb Hansel and Gretel breadcrumbs

146
00:06:17,158 --> 00:06:21,538
going to the gardens and people could

147
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:24,030
just put a 55-gallon drum under some

148
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:26,639
trees and then just go up there every

149
00:06:24,029 --> 00:06:28,769
week or two and fill it up and bloom at

150
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,769
what are their plants so that's that's

151
00:06:28,769 --> 00:06:35,158
how a blue mattress started that was

152
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:36,870
think around 1979 1980 wow so you've

153
00:06:35,158 --> 00:06:38,788
been doing this for a long time and the

154
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:41,069
blue Mac technology has changed I know

155
00:06:38,788 --> 00:06:43,110
over the last if you

156
00:06:41,069 --> 00:06:45,480
decades but can you talk a little bit

157
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:47,100
more about what blue mats are so this

158
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,720
isn't something that you invented your

159
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,090
the as I understand your the North

160
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,490
American distributor for this product

161
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:55,979
but it comes out of is it Austria right

162
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,569
yeah they're manufactured in Austria can

163
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:01,980
you talk a little bit more about what

164
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,909
they are and well they're basically yeah

165
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,600
they're basically just a really

166
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:09,960
inexpensive tensiometer that a moisture

167
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,960
soil moisture sensing connected to a

168
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:15,269
little valve so a manual and inexpensive

169
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:18,299
compared to ten Co meters an electronic

170
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:20,399
valve so so they basically turn the

171
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,509
water on and off based on the whatever

172
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:27,179
moisture level you set them for so on

173
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,730
the disc again that's all from being too

174
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:32,850
wet or too dry automatically without

175
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:34,200
timers or batteries or electricity so

176
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,390
for our listeners who haven't heard of

177
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,339
blue mats I just want to clarify this a

178
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:39,899
little bit what they are essentially

179
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,609
looks like a little kind of we call

180
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,139
carrots but they look kind of like a

181
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:46,830
carrot and they have a little knob on

182
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:49,319
top that's adjustable and a ceramic tip

183
00:07:46,829 --> 00:07:50,879
and that ceramic tip works as you

184
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:52,649
mentioned as a tensiometer so it

185
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,110
measures the moisture tension in the

186
00:07:52,649 --> 00:07:57,750
soil and then based on where you set

187
00:07:55,110 --> 00:08:00,600
that adjustable nozzle it determines

188
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,209
whether or not that device the blue mat

189
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:06,480
is going to release more water out into

190
00:08:03,209 --> 00:08:08,819
the drip line or retain water if it's

191
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:12,270
too moist so it it's an automatic

192
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,250
watering system that uses no electricity

193
00:08:12,269 --> 00:08:15,299
it's completely mechanical is there

194
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,779
anything else you would add to that

195
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,389
definition well I think it helps that I

196
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:24,750
always think of it a little bit like a

197
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:27,149
valve attached to a piston like in a car

198
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:28,680
so the but instead of the piston going

199
00:08:27,149 --> 00:08:31,379
up and down the water goes up and down

200
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,349
so they're filled with water and when

201
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:36,809
the when the soil around the ceramic tip

202
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,520
starts to dry out it pulls that water

203
00:08:36,809 --> 00:08:40,799
down a little bit which takes the

204
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,049
pressure off of the valve and opens the

205
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,750
water and when the water gets down and

206
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:49,589
it gets moist again it stops at that

207
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:51,690
coal and Kroger's well I've never heard

208
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:54,660
that that's a bad analogy I really like

209
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,060
that so how how would

210
00:08:54,659 --> 00:09:00,000
gonna go about using this this

211
00:08:57,059 --> 00:09:01,919
technology so you have this carrot

212
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,389
that's hooked up to a drip line or this

213
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:08,729
bloom at sorry how how many drippers or

214
00:09:06,389 --> 00:09:12,149
how much drip tape or something would

215
00:09:08,730 --> 00:09:16,019
you be able to use per carat or per

216
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:17,909
bloom at well I mean a really huge

217
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:23,789
difference you know they can go anywhere

218
00:09:17,909 --> 00:09:28,049
from Vista a few drops a minute to many

219
00:09:23,789 --> 00:09:29,730
gallons in there so ideal way is to put

220
00:09:28,049 --> 00:09:31,799
the pot or the bed or whatever you're

221
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,199
trying to water get it at the moisture

222
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:37,169
level that you think is the best and

223
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:40,588
then set it and then it keeps it there

224
00:09:37,169 --> 00:09:43,078
so so it's important because otherwise

225
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:45,089
if you if you if you set them when the

226
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:47,128
soil is too wet and it keeps it too wet

227
00:09:45,089 --> 00:09:49,949
and keep it with set it when it's too

228
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:52,019
dry then it keeps it too dry so the

229
00:09:49,948 --> 00:09:54,719
ideal way to use them is to or get to

230
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,610
get your planting mix or your bed to the

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,910
moisture level you want to maintain and

232
00:09:56,610 --> 00:10:01,289
then just set it in a coop super yeah

233
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:03,688
and I think that's a big advantage to

234
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:06,240
these blue mat systems versus other

235
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:08,159
irrigation systems unless you're

236
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,899
spending you know tens of thousands of

237
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:12,360
dollars on an automatic system that's

238
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:13,589
functioning off of tensiometer z-- most

239
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,310
people are just putting in a drip system

240
00:10:13,589 --> 00:10:18,180
and then regulating it by computer or

241
00:10:16,309 --> 00:10:19,948
turning it on and off manually

242
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:23,838
themselves or putting it on a timer and

243
00:10:19,948 --> 00:10:25,889
that the advantage of the blue mat is it

244
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,199
regulates that moisture content and

245
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:29,669
maintains it I think there's this myth

246
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:31,469
in the cannabis industry that these

247
00:10:29,669 --> 00:10:33,149
wet/dry cycles are really good for your

248
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:37,470
plant but if we're talking about organic

249
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:39,778
soil where the microbes are cycling

250
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,970
nutrients and making those nutrients

251
00:10:39,778 --> 00:10:43,769
plants available the ideal fire

252
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,110
environment for these microbes is really

253
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:49,110
soil that's an optimal moisture content

254
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:50,850
that's why I think watering is one of

255
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:54,000
the most important things in your garden

256
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:56,519
and I think it gets underappreciated for

257
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,500
how much it can affect yield and the

258
00:10:56,519 --> 00:11:00,688
health of your plant and also reduce

259
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,549
plant stress so I think that's a really

260
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:04,259
good point you brought up regarding the

261
00:11:02,549 --> 00:11:05,609
fact that these blue mats maintain that

262
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:07,620
moisture content for you

263
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,470
are they any other advantages to these

264
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,539
blue mat system

265
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:12,279
over a conventional irrigation system or

266
00:11:10,539 --> 00:11:15,039
drip drip system that you want to

267
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,259
highlight well I'd say what what you

268
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:19,689
just described is really beneficial for

269
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:21,519
organic growing and especially a living

270
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,250
soil techniques where you're you really

271
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:26,169
need to maintain an even moisture level

272
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:28,360
because if it gets too wet or too dry

273
00:11:26,169 --> 00:11:31,299
the microbes and a lot of the

274
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:34,330
beneficials can go dormant and stop

275
00:11:31,299 --> 00:11:37,959
working but even in the in conventional

276
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:41,350
systems are not organic systems if if

277
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:44,470
the soil gets too wet for example it

278
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:46,980
stops the transpiration because pumps

279
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:49,509
kind of work on a similar kind of

280
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:52,779
physics principle off the blue mats do

281
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:55,539
they they pull the moisture in the

282
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:59,079
nutrients in the roots up into the leads

283
00:11:55,539 --> 00:12:00,730
and for that to work right it similar to

284
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:04,300
what I described with the blue max there

285
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:07,750
and if there's if there's um if the soil

286
00:12:04,299 --> 00:12:11,559
is too wet it prevents that pull the

287
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:13,179
transpiration cool and the plant on the

288
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:16,359
unit there's plenty of nutrients in the

289
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:19,329
soil it won't go to the plant so older

290
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,580
watering is something I think people in

291
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:24,129
general don't understand mean everybody

292
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:26,680
shall be kind of a traumatic experience

293
00:12:24,129 --> 00:12:28,779
of a plant dying because they didn't

294
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:30,909
give it enough water and so there's a

295
00:12:28,779 --> 00:12:34,209
tendency become of overcompensate and

296
00:12:30,909 --> 00:12:36,579
give too much water and there's

297
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:39,639
definitely some really big drawbacks to

298
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,080
the soil being too wet too yeah that's a

299
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:43,299
good point and I love that you can dial

300
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,910
in that moisture content where you want

301
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:48,759
it so we also use your digital moisture

302
00:12:45,909 --> 00:12:50,969
meters as a quick and easy way to get a

303
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:54,340
moisture reading so that we can quantify

304
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,110
what we like our soils at now for us we

305
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:59,230
like to keep our soils right around 100

306
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:03,310
M bar which I know is wetter than most

307
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:05,110
traditional soils even cannabis soils so

308
00:13:03,309 --> 00:13:06,909
depending on what your media is that

309
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:08,860
you're growing is you can determine what

310
00:13:06,909 --> 00:13:11,769
that optimal moisture content level is

311
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,350
using a moisture meter and then take

312
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:17,019
that information and set up your blue

313
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,190
mats around that around an actual number

314
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:20,199
so you're not just guessing at what

315
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,870
optimal moisture is you can actually set

316
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,589
it

317
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:26,509
which to me is huge right right and and

318
00:13:24,589 --> 00:13:28,430
that's when you can kind of dial in

319
00:13:26,509 --> 00:13:31,069
based on the kind of growing method you

320
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:35,088
have so so we usually recommend in veg

321
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,820
to keep it between 120 and 150 millibars

322
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:39,860
and in any flower between 150 and 1 Odin

323
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,900
but if you're doing organics especially

324
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,639
living so you're not just thinking about

325
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,069
the plant roots but you're thinking

326
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:48,409
about the whole soil mixture and the

327
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:50,510
microbes and microbiome all the

328
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:52,939
different beneficials are in there so so

329
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:54,528
keeping it more moist especially if

330
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:57,140
you're using a mulch and you want

331
00:13:54,528 --> 00:13:59,000
because the most needs to be moist

332
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:02,539
enough for the earthworms to be able to

333
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:05,750
come out and eat it so if a lot of times

334
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:09,230
people will keep it even even one with

335
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:10,940
some 100 even 80 to 90 they're from if

336
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,039
you're using like a living soil kind of

337
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,990
environment yeah it's important to note

338
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:19,669
that I always confuse these in my head

339
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:22,460
but the the millibars as you go lower in

340
00:14:19,669 --> 00:14:25,759
numbers like you said towards 80 or 90

341
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:28,550
that soil gets more moist or wet err

342
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,588
and as the number goes higher you're

343
00:14:28,549 --> 00:14:32,179
actually the soil is drier and it's just

344
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,320
for me that's a hard connection to make

345
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:35,299
but I think it's important people

346
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,310
realize that yeah yeah kind of

347
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,028
intuitively people tend to think the

348
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:40,849
other way around

349
00:14:38,028 --> 00:14:42,588
yeah yeah and I like to keep a couple

350
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:44,990
moisture meters and if you're if you're

351
00:14:42,589 --> 00:14:48,470
growing commercially as in you're making

352
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:50,990
a living on your crop and I like to have

353
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:53,690
at least two or three or more digital

354
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:56,899
moisture meters so in case one fails or

355
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:58,520
I have anything go off I have a

356
00:14:56,899 --> 00:15:00,919
redundancy there just in case because

357
00:14:58,519 --> 00:15:03,230
that the the digital moisture meters are

358
00:15:00,919 --> 00:15:05,539
electronic they can break and so having

359
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,860
something to check your results on I

360
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,599
think is really handy make sure they're

361
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:10,459
calibrated that's just another

362
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,060
suggestion I like to throw out to people

363
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:16,489
yes we have some customers that use one

364
00:15:14,059 --> 00:15:18,919
per each plant but that gets pretty

365
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:21,019
expensive then but I think I think it's

366
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:23,299
good to have one at least for each

367
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:25,039
different size pot so if you have some

368
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:27,229
plants inside gallon and you have some

369
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:30,500
plants in 30 gallon you know it's good

370
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:32,420
to have a moisture meter when we climb

371
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,370
you can't move them around but it it

372
00:15:32,419 --> 00:15:36,379
takes about five or ten minutes to get

373
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:38,690
an accurate accurate reading after you

374
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:41,389
move one so it's a kind of a budgetary

375
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:43,850
thing - it's a most convenient to have

376
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,649
one per plant but if the budgets not

377
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:47,300
there then it you just have to be a

378
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:49,000
little bit more patient then you can

379
00:15:47,299 --> 00:15:52,219
take one and move it from place to place

380
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,690
yeah and even if you can't go the you

381
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,480
know let's say the blue mats are out of

382
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:58,550
your budget then even getting a digital

383
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,259
moisture meter so that you can start to

384
00:15:58,549 --> 00:16:03,379
dial in your watering habits is another

385
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:04,850
way to go yeah yeah I do like to caution

386
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,580
people we've had this problem in the

387
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:10,100
past is that the top of the digital

388
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:11,509
moisture meter is not waterproof so we

389
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,430
don't want you don't want to water over

390
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:15,289
the top of it or it can break it and

391
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:19,039
that's something that we've learned the

392
00:16:15,289 --> 00:16:20,629
hard way as you know when these moisture

393
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:22,939
meters so I just want to let people know

394
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:24,559
ahead of time in case they do pick one

395
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,029
up and start using one in their garden I

396
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:27,769
don't know if you'd notice that we have

397
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:30,679
a cap that goes on the top of it to

398
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:32,179
prevent that no I didn't know that I

399
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,159
might have to start ordering that with

400
00:16:32,179 --> 00:16:36,949
them yeah they're pretty handy they're

401
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:38,569
only I can $2 retail and then you can

402
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:41,120
even use them outside and it doesn't

403
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:43,310
matter for drains or water gets on them

404
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,649
it just protects the electronic from the

405
00:16:43,309 --> 00:16:46,849
top very cool I'm gonna have to order

406
00:16:45,649 --> 00:16:49,100
some of those for you for the moisture

407
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:50,209
meters that we have that's great I'm

408
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:54,589
glad I'm glad I learned something today

409
00:16:50,208 --> 00:16:58,009
there okay sure so let's talk a little

410
00:16:54,589 --> 00:17:00,440
bit more about the actual usage of these

411
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:03,409
of these blue mats so they come in a

412
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,789
couple different sizes you have the what

413
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:07,699
you're calling I believe the regular

414
00:17:04,789 --> 00:17:11,209
size and then you have a maxi which is a

415
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:12,679
larger carrot essentially I can you talk

416
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,380
about when you might use those two

417
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,390
systems or those two well we actually

418
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:20,569
have about five different sizes four

419
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:22,040
types there's we have the five inch and

420
00:17:20,568 --> 00:17:25,068
the nine inch you just talked about we

421
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:28,369
also make a sixteen inch size oh and

422
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:31,460
then then we make for really big pots in

423
00:17:28,369 --> 00:17:35,239
bed and then we also have a small one we

424
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:37,549
call it a bonsai limit but it's real

425
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,769
short and stubby and then you can put

426
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,629
that in really small pots and then

427
00:17:39,769 --> 00:17:43,730
there's another one that's called a

428
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,640
surface glue mat it's got about a three

429
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,870
inch base and that's really handy for

430
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,870
starts and clone

431
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:53,389
and you can do capillary mat systems

432
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:55,058
with that which are just starting to get

433
00:17:53,390 --> 00:17:58,220
popular in the u.s. they're really

434
00:17:55,058 --> 00:18:01,399
common and popular in Europe but it's a

435
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:04,100
really inexpensive way of watering a you

436
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,470
know a whole lot of small starts and

437
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:09,859
corns and anywhere up to like a one

438
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:13,640
gallon or so size now as a general rule

439
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:17,028
I've always used the regular blue mat

440
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:18,770
size with the five inch and I've only

441
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:20,929
gone up to the nine inch if I have more

442
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:22,970
than a foot of depth in my soul that

443
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:24,860
sort of been my general rule for it do

444
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,778
you have a guidelines that you like to

445
00:18:24,859 --> 00:18:30,349
give listeners or people regarding them

446
00:18:26,778 --> 00:18:33,109
we usually use just the small ones up to

447
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:36,769
ten gallon sized pot and then a 10

448
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:40,038
gallon and up I like to Lily spinner to

449
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:42,019
15 I like to use one of each because if

450
00:18:40,038 --> 00:18:43,730
it's that deep and it's kind of my seat

451
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,980
then your moderate monitoring both the

452
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:48,079
the top half of the planting mix and the

453
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,870
bottom half yes so the big difference

454
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:52,908
between the two is where that ceramic

455
00:18:50,869 --> 00:18:54,558
tip is sitting in the soil profile so

456
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:56,059
the max the obviously reaches deeper

457
00:18:54,558 --> 00:18:58,609
into the soil so it's gonna be measuring

458
00:18:56,058 --> 00:19:00,619
your water your moisture content at you

459
00:18:58,609 --> 00:19:01,849
know whatever seven or eight inches

460
00:19:00,619 --> 00:19:03,229
instead of the other one which is

461
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:06,969
measuring I'm guessing around three or

462
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,048
four inches all right so the other thing

463
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,909
the other thing you can do with the big

464
00:19:09,048 --> 00:19:13,158
ones is you can put in the horizontally

465
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:15,710
if you have a like especially if it's

466
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:18,020
like a hundred gallon or even 50 gallon

467
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:19,819
sizes if it's really deep you can you

468
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:22,460
can put it horizontally and then you can

469
00:19:19,819 --> 00:19:24,859
ascend some moisture at any any level

470
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,390
ring Nick yes you know we experiment

471
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:28,939
with that and didn't have as great of

472
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:32,450
success because one of the challenges we

473
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:33,890
had with these blue mats is if you bump

474
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:36,350
them at all or you bump the line

475
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,210
attached to them it can throw off the

476
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:40,699
sensor and they can start they think

477
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:42,169
that the moisture content is low and so

478
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,538
they'll start just pushing out water and

479
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:47,028
pushing out water bring tell you a

480
00:19:44,538 --> 00:19:48,288
little bit about that the well you don't

481
00:19:47,028 --> 00:19:50,450
want to if you're going to put him in a

482
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:52,849
horizontal you don't want to have it

483
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,679
sticking out into a walkway yeah then

484
00:19:52,849 --> 00:19:57,168
people will bump it and you know get a

485
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,850
runaway really easy so it's if you do it

486
00:19:57,169 --> 00:20:00,380
horizontally it's better to position it

487
00:19:58,849 --> 00:20:01,789
on the side where you don't walk in

488
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:04,760
between

489
00:20:01,789 --> 00:20:05,960
so you don't have that happen so let's

490
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:08,930
talk a little bit about some of the

491
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,490
potential problems you might have it

492
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:12,470
with a blue Matt system and one of those

493
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:14,390
I just briefly mentioned but I you know

494
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,480
I've used blue Matt's myself in my test

495
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:20,720
garden and I've flooded a couple pots

496
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,120
because I didn't make that good

497
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,289
connection there in the soil can you

498
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,029
talk a little bit about that when you're

499
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:28,279
putting in the blue mats the carats

500
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:31,099
themselves into the soil well one of the

501
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:32,980
most important things to watch out for I

502
00:20:31,099 --> 00:20:35,240
guess is if you if there's a lot of

503
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:38,420
perlite especially the big chunky

504
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,910
perlite or volcanic rock or anything

505
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,130
that's are really porous like that in

506
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,950
the soil is if that's touching the

507
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,200
ceramic tip then you can take it out you

508
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:51,019
can make the blue mat thank it dry when

509
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,640
it's not really and get a runaway so but

510
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:54,769
it but it's a pretty easy thing to

511
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,340
prevent this if you just take some wet

512
00:20:54,769 --> 00:21:00,529
peat moss or cocoa and put it in the

513
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:02,720
soil so this is long if there's

514
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:05,720
something in between what the volcanic

515
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,880
rock or perlite or not and the sensor

516
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:10,400
runners of voids are kind of the same

517
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:12,230
thing with rock wall or or other kinds

518
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,269
of media like that it you just need to

519
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:17,240
have something that will prevent that

520
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,609
fake-out for the blue map thinking it's

521
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:21,829
driving not yeah that's a great

522
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:23,209
suggestion and then I think also making

523
00:21:21,829 --> 00:21:25,099
sure like you mentioned that all of your

524
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:27,019
lines and everything else are not in

525
00:21:25,099 --> 00:21:28,549
walkways or areas that they could get

526
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:31,009
bumped because if you bump it now you're

527
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:32,750
potentially moving a spot of the ceramic

528
00:21:31,009 --> 00:21:36,230
tip that's now touching air and creates

529
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:37,549
that same situation so right and again

530
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:39,200
it's a real easy fix

531
00:21:37,549 --> 00:21:41,059
but if you don't know it then you don't

532
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,309
do it but if you don't if you want the

533
00:21:41,059 --> 00:21:44,869
carat then if you don't do anything you

534
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:47,389
get a runaway but if you just push the

535
00:21:44,869 --> 00:21:49,009
soil down around it just to make sure

536
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:51,230
that that that there's a good connection

537
00:21:49,009 --> 00:21:53,930
between the ceramic tip that when the

538
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:56,390
potting mix that prevents it the other

539
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,539
thing that happens or infection Gowanus

540
00:21:56,390 --> 00:22:00,950
is like I think probably doing tech

541
00:21:59,539 --> 00:22:03,649
support probably eighty to ninety

542
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:06,890
percent of the problems we hear come

543
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:12,320
from people doing gravity systems Ohm's

544
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:15,710
forgetting to refill the reservoir o on

545
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:18,109
because yes that it

546
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,519
right away then it's not a big deal you

547
00:22:18,109 --> 00:22:21,679
just refill the reservoir and you're

548
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:24,799
still going good but if it if it stays

549
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:28,580
dry for too long the water in the carrot

550
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,139
can get sucked out and again it depends

551
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:32,509
on how quickly you catch it if you catch

552
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:34,130
it pretty fast then you can just refill

553
00:22:32,509 --> 00:22:36,259
the the carrot and you're good to go but

554
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:39,110
if it if it goes for too long at the

555
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:41,480
time it gets too dried out and if you

556
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:44,059
just fill it up it won't work properly

557
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:46,700
so it could dry it out for too long you

558
00:22:44,059 --> 00:22:48,619
need to soak it again and let started

559
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,049
again or else you can have that kind of

560
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:52,699
problem that's really interesting I

561
00:22:51,049 --> 00:22:54,619
hadn't heard of that but then I'm not

562
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,710
dealing with as many bloom at customers

563
00:22:54,619 --> 00:23:01,539
as you are so let's talk a little about

564
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:05,269
that like how you mentioned soaking the

565
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:07,879
ceramic tip portion prior to setting up

566
00:23:05,269 --> 00:23:10,879
your system can you go into sort of what

567
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,010
that process looks like well one thing

568
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:15,590
that I think can really avoid a lot of

569
00:23:13,009 --> 00:23:17,930
problems described too is making sure

570
00:23:15,589 --> 00:23:19,669
that the water that you put the kid that

571
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,690
you soaked a carrot in and fill it with

572
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:26,360
doesn't have any dissolved oxygen in it

573
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:27,950
because a lot of times cities and means

574
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:29,599
different different places what a lot of

575
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:31,910
times cities will use oxygen to

576
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:34,819
pressurize their system and there's lots

577
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:37,190
of dissolved oxygen and if you fill a

578
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:40,429
carrot with that dissolved oxygen it

579
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:43,100
will over a course of a few days form

580
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:44,990
bubbles and if there's just a few

581
00:23:43,099 --> 00:23:47,439
bubbles it's not that big of a deal it

582
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:50,089
just kind of increases the on-off cycle

583
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,220
when it turns on when it turns it off

584
00:23:50,089 --> 00:23:53,659
but if there's too many air bubbles in

585
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:56,809
there then you can get a runaway and it

586
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:58,910
just won't won't turn off so what I

587
00:23:56,809 --> 00:24:02,240
always like to do is boil the water

588
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:04,400
first and then let it cool and then use

589
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,440
that water to fill the carrots because

590
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,080
then you you're assured that there's not

591
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,200
a dissolved oxygen that will create air

592
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:15,079
bubbles and danger setting that's a

593
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,730
really great suggestion you know I when

594
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,439
I was setting up my system I didn't do

595
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:20,690
that but I let it sit in the water for I

596
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,870
think two or three days which i think

597
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:25,070
allowed a lot of the oxygen to be

598
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:27,289
removed from the water but I didn't I

599
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,029
wasn't even aware of that so that's a

600
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:30,619
really good suggestion and

601
00:24:29,029 --> 00:24:31,879
on top of that it's not a lot of water

602
00:24:30,619 --> 00:24:34,250
that we're talking about because these

603
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,140
carrots are not huge so it wouldn't be a

604
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:37,789
big deal I'll throw a pot on the on a

605
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,310
stove and then boil a little bit of

606
00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:42,500
water to soak them in no it doesn't take

607
00:24:40,309 --> 00:24:44,659
long and then the basic thing for

608
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,980
soaking them it's kind of gone down we

609
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:49,220
used to think you needed to soak them

610
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:50,779
for at least an hour or so but but now

611
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,309
we've discovered in the saucer has

612
00:24:50,779 --> 00:24:55,430
confirmed that you really only need to

613
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:57,889
do it through 10 or 15 minutes but you

614
00:24:55,430 --> 00:25:00,830
need to do it 10 or 15 minutes both with

615
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:02,840
it into piece and then when you screw it

616
00:25:00,829 --> 00:25:05,720
together under water you need to soak it

617
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:08,959
for another 10 or 15 minutes so so it

618
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,829
doesn't not a good idea to just soak it

619
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,750
for a long time

620
00:25:09,829 --> 00:25:13,579
screw it on and then use it right away

621
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,170
you need to have another little 10

622
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:17,629
minutes or something in there for the

623
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:20,690
four things that equal life inside the

624
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:24,920
carrot okay so you're gonna soak the

625
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:26,990
carrots and then attach the top part

626
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,120
which has the valve on it and there'll

627
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,890
be photos and everything on the podcast

628
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:33,199
page for people who and design

629
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:35,870
information everything there but you'll

630
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,210
screw on the top of the carrot

631
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:39,500
underwater so that we're not getting any

632
00:25:38,210 --> 00:25:42,799
air bubbles in there and that's an

633
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:45,650
important part of this and then at that

634
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:47,269
point that one that particular blue mat

635
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,210
is ready to go and we can put it right

636
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:51,859
into the soil we need to focus again for

637
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:55,819
another ten minutes after you screw it

638
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:58,339
together yes so so the ideal minimum is

639
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:00,230
to take it apart soak it under water for

640
00:25:58,339 --> 00:26:05,449
ten or fifteen minutes and take a

641
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:07,519
pipette or on a dropper and squeeze

642
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:09,230
whether there's a look you air bubbles

643
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,960
inside the top there's three little

644
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:14,180
holes in the top so if you squeeze the

645
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,940
pipette into that those air bubbles come

646
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:19,340
out and then screw it together then wait

647
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:21,440
10 or 10 or 15 minutes and then it's

648
00:26:19,339 --> 00:26:23,599
good to go and once that's done you can

649
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,269
leave it in the water for weeks or even

650
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:29,139
longer when any time you need it it's

651
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:32,420
ready to go okay and then we take that

652
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:34,880
carrot and we can push it down into the

653
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:36,769
soil wherever it is that we want to be

654
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:39,620
monitoring the moisture tension around

655
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:41,809
the plants right and make sure to push

656
00:26:39,619 --> 00:26:42,829
it all the way down till the cap is the

657
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:45,079
only thing exposed

658
00:26:42,829 --> 00:26:46,849
I didn't I made that mistake I'm gonna

659
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:49,009
mine I didn't push it all the way into

660
00:26:46,849 --> 00:26:51,859
the soil so I think that's an important

661
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:55,069
thing to point out - well that kind of

662
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,589
depends on I guess a lot of on the

663
00:26:55,069 --> 00:26:59,839
humidity like an in some some places

664
00:26:57,589 --> 00:27:02,058
like the especially if people are going

665
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,939
to transplant from a small pot into a

666
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:07,460
big one and so they want to use the long

667
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,288
carrots but they don't want to get one

668
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:12,649
for the small and N one for the big one

669
00:27:09,288 --> 00:27:15,019
the builders put the long turret Ananse

670
00:27:12,648 --> 00:27:18,500
run into a small pot like a two or three

671
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:20,388
gallon heater and then then just put

672
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,548
when it maybe it's on the hospital push

673
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:25,638
down and then when they put it into a

674
00:27:22,548 --> 00:27:27,019
bigger pot push it further but that that

675
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:29,689
works in places where there's high

676
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:32,929
humidity but in places where it's drier

677
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:34,970
then you'll get that will you'll suck

678
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:36,950
some of the water out of the carrot if

679
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:40,220
it's exposed like that I guess it

680
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:42,909
depends on the temperature - okay so if

681
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:48,769
we then put the carrot into the soil and

682
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:53,750
I hooked up all the mainline to it the

683
00:27:48,769 --> 00:27:55,970
the 10 millimeter line we then can once

684
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:57,798
the whole system is set up we then have

685
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,450
that valve on top that we can open up

686
00:27:57,798 --> 00:28:02,658
right can you talk a little bit about

687
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:04,399
how that process works with you already

688
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,190
mentioned getting the soil to field

689
00:28:04,398 --> 00:28:09,199
capacity or whatever your optimal

690
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:11,240
moisture content is for that soil before

691
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,500
as you go to dial in the system can you

692
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:16,638
talk a little about what that looks like

693
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:18,528
well well the standard suggestion is to

694
00:28:16,638 --> 00:28:21,019
open up the talk until the water is

695
00:28:18,528 --> 00:28:23,148
coming out then dial it down

696
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:26,028
until there's just a hanging drop and

697
00:28:23,148 --> 00:28:28,158
then go down one or two more the little

698
00:28:26,028 --> 00:28:31,220
triangles that are circled their little

699
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,929
cap on the top but that also depends a

700
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:35,538
little bit on the kind of planting next

701
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:41,929
people have and the kind of growing

702
00:28:35,538 --> 00:28:43,788
method they have - so if some so so like

703
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:46,100
we let me talk before about living so

704
00:28:43,788 --> 00:28:48,829
you if you want to keep more of the pot

705
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:51,199
voice and then maybe you wouldn't turn

706
00:28:48,829 --> 00:28:56,720
it down at all might just just go at the

707
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,700
hanging drop level and then occurs more

708
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,470
sand and perlite and please they have

709
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:03,440
more drainage than you might want to

710
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:06,710
keep a little bit more open to and but

711
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:09,380
if there's something with more capillary

712
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:10,669
action in the soil mix then you might

713
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,799
want to turn it down with it more

714
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:15,620
because it will spread out by itself

715
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:18,079
more evenly it you know thee there's

716
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:20,719
there's different rule of thumb ideas

717
00:29:18,079 --> 00:29:22,819
but every situation was different with

718
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,190
temperature and humidity in the room and

719
00:29:22,819 --> 00:29:28,460
kind of plants and how fast things

720
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:30,890
you're growing so so it basically needs

721
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:32,179
to be customized clean the site that's

722
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,230
where that digital moisture meter I

723
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:36,169
think comes in handy

724
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:37,970
you know we with our soil what I did was

725
00:29:36,169 --> 00:29:39,950
that exactly what you described is even

726
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:42,350
you know I put the carrot in I watched

727
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:43,970
till that dry would start dripping and

728
00:29:42,349 --> 00:29:47,209
then I would turn it I would slowly

729
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:49,519
close that valve on top until that drip

730
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:51,650
was just hanging right there then I

731
00:29:49,519 --> 00:29:54,200
would turn it back one notch but that's

732
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:57,409
after I've gotten the soil I do it after

733
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,048
I've watered the soil to get it and then

734
00:29:57,409 --> 00:30:02,179
I wait a few hours until I have it at

735
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:04,548
you know evenly homogeneous and at the

736
00:30:02,179 --> 00:30:06,470
moisture content I wanted at and then I

737
00:30:04,548 --> 00:30:09,558
go through that process of going down

738
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,659
and dialing in all the blue mats and for

739
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:13,490
me that worked really well yeah that's

740
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,960
what we all way to do it I don't the

741
00:30:13,490 --> 00:30:17,000
other thing I think that's kind of good

742
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,669
to know is if people don't do it that

743
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:21,589
way and they put it in when it's when

744
00:30:19,669 --> 00:30:24,620
the soil is too wet or too dry and they

745
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:28,359
want to adjust it later it's really

746
00:30:24,619 --> 00:30:30,769
important to not do that too much you

747
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:33,168
make a dryer or make it a little bit

748
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:35,509
more wet you don't need to turn it very

749
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:38,270
much because it's like a 24 hour system

750
00:30:35,509 --> 00:30:40,058
with we're used to watering all at one

751
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:43,579
time pretty much even with a drip system

752
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:46,099
and so what you see coming out you kind

753
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:47,658
of gauge by how much you can it down but

754
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:49,879
with glue mats because it's this

755
00:30:47,659 --> 00:30:51,260
long-term thing if you want to make it a

756
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,090
little wetter or drier it's good to

757
00:30:51,259 --> 00:30:55,400
maybe only do two or three of those

758
00:30:53,089 --> 00:30:57,949
little lines in between the triangles

759
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:59,929
otherwise you kind of go from being too

760
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:02,000
dry to doing too wet and you're kind of

761
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:04,820
always going back and forth it's hard to

762
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:07,009
find that middle ground yeah you can

763
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:08,928
definitely start playing around with it

764
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:09,869
and make the situation a lot worse I've

765
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:12,780
done that with a cup

766
00:31:09,869 --> 00:31:14,639
times two as well so like you said it's

767
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:17,039
just micro adjustments that's what those

768
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,470
notches on top are for on the on the top

769
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,119
of the valve and make it really easy

770
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,490
once you have it dialed in I have to say

771
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:25,739
it works exceptionally well well it's

772
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,970
fun to walk into the room and see that

773
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,680
you know some of the blue mats are

774
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,450
watering and some of them are depending

775
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,279
on you know the particular plant and

776
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:34,049
stage of growth and you know different

777
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:36,389
cultivars in the room will all require

778
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:39,329
different water so it really optimizes

779
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:43,290
for each plant in each container or each

780
00:31:39,329 --> 00:31:46,558
bed and I know it works I had a customer

781
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:49,170
a few years ago that had just some

782
00:31:46,558 --> 00:31:51,839
plants a medical garden in a tent and he

783
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:54,390
actually went to Alaska to go fishing

784
00:31:51,839 --> 00:31:56,490
and just had his wife refilling the

785
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:58,920
reservoir every day or every couple day

786
00:31:56,490 --> 00:32:00,599
for his plants and he came back and his

787
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,950
plants were actually touching the light

788
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:04,829
he showed me photos and they were all

789
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:06,450
burnt on the top canopy but the issue

790
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:07,109
was definitely not watering the plants

791
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:09,000
were healthy

792
00:32:07,109 --> 00:32:11,819
they just overgrown the space but

793
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,400
knowing that these things can function

794
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:16,799
and optimally water without a lot of

795
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,140
human intervention and any electricity

796
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:21,990
is really amazing I would save so much

797
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:25,770
time I've had probably three or four

798
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:27,929
people tell me that it saved their their

799
00:32:25,769 --> 00:32:30,509
marriage where their relationships at

800
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:32,220
their girlfriends or their wives were so

801
00:32:30,509 --> 00:32:34,410
fed up with them having to be there

802
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,150
every day and spend so much time doing

803
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:39,660
that they're about ready to leave and

804
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:41,850
and the blue matza save their

805
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:43,710
relationship you know I could see that

806
00:32:41,849 --> 00:32:45,000
I'm terrible about remembering the water

807
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:47,460
too if I have a bunch of other things

808
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,109
going on and then all water my

809
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,980
convenience not necessarily when the

810
00:32:49,109 --> 00:32:52,039
plants need it

811
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,339
keeping in mind though that I've never

812
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:58,230
had to rely on a cash crop for my you

813
00:32:56,339 --> 00:33:00,629
know for my salary for example if I was

814
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:02,429
you know growing commercially then that

815
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:04,320
would be a different story but if you're

816
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:06,570
just have a medical garden or something

817
00:33:04,319 --> 00:33:07,980
like that yeah it takes a lot of time if

818
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:09,928
you have another job or other things

819
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,700
going on in your life so have been the

820
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:13,050
more you can automate and the more labor

821
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,620
you can save and more than pays for

822
00:33:13,049 --> 00:33:15,629
itself

823
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:18,029
plus you're reducing the amount of water

824
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:20,010
you using which is huge and even if

825
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,928
you're there every day you're not going

826
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,859
to go on vacation like up for a week or

827
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:25,660
two it's still there's a lot of

828
00:33:23,859 --> 00:33:28,449
better ways you can spend your time than

829
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:31,000
and watering you know trimming and

830
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:34,330
watching through bugs or plant things or

831
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:36,880
these are so many more beneficial things

832
00:33:34,329 --> 00:33:38,949
you can spend your time doing than just

833
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,990
watering so not much time watering in it

834
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:43,650
I think it's even more of a factor mal

835
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:46,720
with what's legalization becoming

836
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:49,900
broader and more prevalent because I'm

837
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,900
good with the with the prices being

838
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:54,940
driven down you can't really change much

839
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:57,280
about the selling price but you can

840
00:33:54,940 --> 00:34:00,070
where you really have leverages limiting

841
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:03,160
your cost so if you do something that

842
00:34:00,069 --> 00:34:05,379
both saves a lot in your labor costs and

843
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:08,250
also at the same time increases your

844
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:11,139
yield that's kind of a really I think

845
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,269
successful way of dealing with the lower

846
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:15,429
prices that are out there already and

847
00:34:13,269 --> 00:34:17,980
probably going to be more that way in

848
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,898
the future yeah I totally agree I mean

849
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,878
reducing expenses a lot easier than

850
00:34:19,898 --> 00:34:23,679
trying to sell more product so in ways

851
00:34:21,878 --> 00:34:26,980
we can reduce our expenses or put that

852
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:30,280
labor towards more more efficient or

853
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:32,019
more effective uses is great now

854
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,669
unfortunately we got cut off at this

855
00:34:32,019 --> 00:34:35,858
point in the conversation and have not

856
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:37,898
had a chance to reconnect I've decided

857
00:34:35,858 --> 00:34:39,489
to post the podcast as it stands and

858
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:41,199
would encourage listeners to email me

859
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:43,299
with any questions they may have on blue

860
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,739
mats or irrigation in general and I can

861
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:47,769
follow up with Steve in another podcast

862
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,509
episode again that was Steve Troy the

863
00:34:47,769 --> 00:34:52,659
North American distributor of blue mats

864
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,280
automatic watering systems now I realize

865
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,898
if this is your first time hearing about

866
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,700
blue mats or you've never set up a

867
00:34:55,898 --> 00:34:59,949
system before this can seem a bit

868
00:34:57,699 --> 00:35:01,989
daunting plus every situation is

869
00:34:59,949 --> 00:35:04,149
different so it requires a custom setup

870
00:35:01,989 --> 00:35:06,009
