1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:05,120
So, I just finished making a video about

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,359
Logan Labs, which is attached to the end

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,879
of this video. I do want to say it's a

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,400
longer video, but please watch the whole

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
thing so you really understand the

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,280
context of what I'm talking about. I

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,880
also want to state that the information

8
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,879
I'm talking about in the video only

9
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:21,919
relates to the saturated pace test, not

10
00:00:18,879 --> 00:00:23,679
the Mic 3 test, and that I do have the

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,118
utmost confidence in Logan Labs. It's

12
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:27,278
been a pleasure to work with them all of

13
00:00:25,118 --> 00:00:29,118
these years, and I plan on continue to

14
00:00:27,278 --> 00:00:30,719
work with them for years to come. I

15
00:00:29,118 --> 00:00:32,640
think they're a wonderful lab and I

16
00:00:30,719 --> 00:00:34,879
really um I really do appreciate what

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,640
they do for our industry.

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,320
Hey guys, Tad here with Kiss Organics

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,759
and I wanted to talk to you about Logan

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,920
Labs. So, starting around August of last

21
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,238
year, we started to see a bit of a

22
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,440
discrepancy in the soil testing reports

23
00:00:46,238 --> 00:00:48,799
that we were getting and that the

24
00:00:47,439 --> 00:00:51,759
numbers were reporting a little bit

25
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:54,399
higher. uh specifically cat ions, things

26
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:56,640
like chlorides, sodium, sulfur, and

27
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
major cations ions like magnesium, uh

28
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:02,079
potassium, calcium, things like that.

29
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,159
And we weren't quite sure what was going

30
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,159
on with that and had reached out to

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,560
Logan and they weren't really sure what

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,240
the issue was. And I know um Bryant

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,200
Mason was also working on this as

34
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:16,640
well. And and basically we they figured

35
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,600
out what it was. And I want to give

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,280
credit to Bryant Mason. Uh So doctor

37
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,959
consulting as well as Logan as to

38
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,079
solving this because it's a little bit

39
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:25,599
challenging and I want to explain

40
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,400
exactly what was going on and what the

41
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:31,759
implications are. So what was happening

42
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,000
was uh starting about last August the

43
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,319
ICP machine that they use for these soil

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,799
tests it gets calibrated and it gets

45
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,478
calibrated using two different solutions

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
and the calibration solutions they have

47
00:01:40,478 --> 00:01:45,759
a low-end solution and a high-end

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
solution. Now, the low-end solution, I I

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,640
think Bryant mentioned it was around 4

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,399
ppm, um was fine, but the high-end

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,759
solution, the one that I think is

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,079
traditionally 200 ppm, was actually off

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,319
um quite a bit. And because of that, it

54
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:02,639
was pushing these results higher. So, if

55
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:05,679
you had an actual, you know, institute

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,280
soil, um top soil for example, you

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,200
wouldn't have seen really a lot of

58
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
change in results. But if you were

59
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,679
running a really f fertile living soil

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,360
like a lot of us do, um that's where you

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,800
start to see the numbers jump up. Um so

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,000
that was the challenge. Now it took a

63
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,520
long time to figure that out because

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,598
they kept recalibrating but they were

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:25,599
recalibrating with the same solution and

66
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:27,679
they didn't realize it right away, which

67
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:29,079
to be fair is totally understandable.

68
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
Um,

69
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:34,800
so what what the implications of this

70
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,680
are are that if you got a soil test done

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,480
between um August to what's it

72
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,159
mid-Marchch because this is the this

73
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:44,479
situation has been corrected and I just

74
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,000
found out about this um in detail as of

75
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:47,919
last week. So this is all brand new to

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,680
me. But um those numbers should have

77
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:52,000
dropped back down into the proper range

78
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
and the test should be more accurate.

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,919
But um if your test result was during

80
00:02:54,479 --> 00:02:58,479
that time period, you might have seen

81
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:59,598
some elevated numbers there. Um what

82
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:01,359
that means is you might have

83
00:02:59,598 --> 00:03:03,280
underapplied nutrients, which is really

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,200
a best case scenario for something like

85
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,120
this. You can always add more, but it's

86
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:09,119
harder to take away. So you may have

87
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
underapplied nutrients for a run, or you

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,519
may have gotten a recommendation to

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,800
flush for chlorides or sodium where you

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,560
might have been able to get an extra run

91
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,439
in. But I want to be really clear. We're

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,000
talking like maybe a 20 25% um increase

93
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:23,759
in total um cat ions that we were

94
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,158
seeing. So our soluble salt levels and

95
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:28,399
EC would look higher. But um it's not

96
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:29,598
like if you had 100 ppm of chlorides

97
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,200
traditionally all of a sudden you're

98
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,878
going to see a test that shows 400 and

99
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:34,878
you're flushing. Probably what it means

100
00:03:32,878 --> 00:03:35,919
is you might have had one more cycle you

101
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,560
might have been able to get in before

102
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:41,039
flushing if you were borderline already.

103
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,959
So um long story short, the issue has

104
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:45,199
been corrected. Like I said, I just

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,799
found out about the actual solution last

106
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:49,359
week. Prior to that, I'd had

107
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,040
conversations with Liz and Trinity and

108
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,959
Susan over at the lab. I'd talked to

109
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:54,318
Bryant about it. Um, but we didn't

110
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,719
really, no one really knew what was

111
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:58,158
going on. And so, um, if you'd reached

112
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:59,799
out to me prior to that, I might have

113
00:03:58,158 --> 00:04:02,158
just said, you know, I've talked to the

114
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:03,438
lab. We don't know if there is an issue

115
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:05,840
or what's going on. We're just seeing

116
00:04:03,438 --> 00:04:07,919
slightly higher elevated numbers. Um,

117
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,319
but now we do know what the problem was

118
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:11,518
and I'm really grateful that to to know

119
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:13,518
the solution and know that we're moving

120
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,680
forward with an answer. And I want to be

121
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,918
really clear that this is not a problem

122
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,239
unique to Logan. There's some stuff that

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:23,359
Logan does actually really really well.

124
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,120
For example, they do QC um where they

125
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,600
recalibrate their machine every 20

126
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,120
samples. Most labs don't calibrate that

127
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,600
frequently or have use a much higher

128
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,280
frequency rate. They also are part of

129
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,800
some accreditations that require them to

130
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,000
be very accurate and they always pass

131
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,600
those um with flying colors. So, I still

132
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,519
believe that they're a high quality lab.

133
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,120
I believe that their soil tests are

134
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:45,279
something that we can trust and are the

135
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,759
best tool, agonomic tool for us to use

136
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:51,198
to make datadriven decisions about our

137
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,800
fertility in our gardens. Um, and I also

138
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,960
want to be clear that this issue could

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,199
have been an issue in any lab. Um, this

140
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:58,478
is not unique to Logan. This is a

141
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,879
situation where we just had the wrong

142
00:04:58,478 --> 00:05:02,240
calibration. But I am excited to hear

143
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,279
that moving forward they're going to do

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:07,600
even a further QC step quality control

145
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:10,399
where they're going to be um anonymizing

146
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,759
the data and then looking at averages

147
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:13,839
over time to make sure they don't see

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,319
any jumps, you know, over a period of a

149
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:18,000
month or a period of a quarter that um

150
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,680
would indicate that something might be

151
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,759
off with the machinery in terms of

152
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
calibration. So, you know, they're

153
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,600
taking all the right steps to correct

154
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,719
this issue. Um, for those of you that

155
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,240
did discover, I know there were some

156
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,199
very vocal people around this that were

157
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,280
convinced that there was some stuff

158
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,960
going on. Well, in a sense, you were

159
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:36,000
right. Your numbers would have been over

160
00:05:32,959 --> 00:05:40,000
reported um, slightly. I would I would

161
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,360
estimate around 20 to 25%. So, I hope

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,800
this is helpful. I just want to get this

163
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,240
information out and let people know

164
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
what's going on. And reach out if you

165
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,439
have any questions. You can reach out to

me, you can reach out to Bryant, or you

167
00:05:47,439 --> 00:05:51,360
can reach out to Logan directly. We are

168
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
we did just record a podcast that I'll

169
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,879
be releasing soon between Brian and I

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,478
where we go into even further depth on

00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:58,639
this topic as well as a bunch of other

172
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:01,360
topics. So, appreciate everyone. Hope

173

that helps.
