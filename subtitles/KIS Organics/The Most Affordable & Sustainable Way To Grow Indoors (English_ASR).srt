1
00:00:01,639 --> 00:00:04,639
all right so I'm back in the grow room

2
00:00:02,799 --> 00:00:07,599
today I'm getting ready to amend these

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:09,480
beds and get set up for the next run and

4
00:00:07,599 --> 00:00:11,879
in case you missed it here's some shots

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,719
of my crop from last cycle using this

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,160
exact same process and then feeding

7
00:00:14,718 --> 00:00:21,559
nothing but water during the entire crop

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,518
cycle I've already done a soil test and

9
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,159
I got my report back this is what I am

10
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,159
adding to the bed and this is everything

11
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:31,160
I need to for all the fertility for the

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,439
entire cycle I'm not going to be adding

13
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:37,520
any teas any ferments any other fancy

14
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:39,479
products this is literally it right here

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,879
here's all the ones I'm going to uh

16
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:45,038
scratch into the soil next and then the

17
00:00:42,878 --> 00:00:47,718
magnesium sulfate the Epsom salt and the

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,840
potassium sulfate I mix with water and

19
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:51,719
I'm going to water this in with a

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,199
watering can but I've got that here too

21
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,920
so it's really that simple running just

22
00:00:54,198 --> 00:00:58,159
water this whole cycle so you guys can

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,480
see just how affordable and easy it is I

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:02,119
mean this is less than $10 worth

25
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,438
of organic amendments and this is what

26
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:05,959
most fertilizers are made up of anyway

27
00:01:04,438 --> 00:01:08,959
this is just a great way to save money

28
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:11,280
and get exactly what your plants need uh

29
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:13,639
in terms of targeted

30
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,640
fertility okay so I threw on a mask to

31
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,920
keep any particulate out of my lungs and

32
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,640
now I'm going through and digging the

33
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,560
nutrients into the soil I'm going to

34
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,200
come back over the top and water in the

35
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,320
potassium sulfate and the Epsom salt and

36
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,079
I'm going to let this sit for a few days

37
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,438
uh let those let the microbes work all

38
00:01:28,078 --> 00:01:34,000
the nutrients and then I'll be planting

39
00:01:29,438 --> 00:01:34,000
into the bed it's really that simple
