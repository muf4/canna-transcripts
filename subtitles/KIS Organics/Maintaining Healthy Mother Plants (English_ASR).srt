1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,198
we're talking about moms I know there

2
00:00:01,078 --> 00:00:05,080
was another question about moms in

3
00:00:03,198 --> 00:00:07,918
general in terms of how to best keep

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,599
them and what size container and some of

5
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:13,039
that I thought that might be a good

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,000
transition um and and like you guys

7
00:00:13,039 --> 00:00:16,719
touched on the Woody stems is a big

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,559
thing over time these plant every time

9
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,599
you take a cut you know you're gonna end

10
00:00:18,559 --> 00:00:23,320
up with more offshoots and it just

11
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:25,960
becomes a nightmare over time of a of a

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,399
plant um plus I think the the health of

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,320
the plant and the viability of the plant

14
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:33,558
goes down uh over time with just

15
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,640
continual wounding and pruning um when

16
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:38,519
we talk about a long time but uh in

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,439
terms of how people are storing these

18
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,840
plants most of the facilities we work

19
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:47,000
with are organic so um most of them are

20
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,039
in a range of containers ranging from

21
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,119
I've seen them as small seven gallon

22
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:54,039
typically 20 or 30 gallon pots uh

23
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:56,640
Collective elevation if you go check out

24
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:59,399
that tour on YouTube they did it they do

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,799
two plants in a 4 by8 bed with a trellis

26
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:03,480
and it looks

27
00:01:00,799 --> 00:01:05,280
awesome um I I don't know if the

28
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,759
workflow on that is better but I have to

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,599
say it's one of the coolest looking mom

30
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,359
rooms I've ever seen um so you should

31
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,079
definitely check that out but the The

32
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,239
Challenge on the fertility side with

33
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:18,359
moms is what I want to touch on before

34
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:20,959
you guys jump in and that's that's

35
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:24,519
really interesting because you know a

36
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:26,319
lot of us with the with the soil beds

37
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:28,319
you know the way that we like to grow a

38
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:30,279
kiss with with beds and reimen the soil

39
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:32,158
with soil testing every cycle that's

40
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,239
really challenging with moms especially

41
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,200
if you keep moms for more than a cycle

42
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:38,519
or two because it's uh one there's not

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,560
going to be a lot of soil left in that

44
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:44,640
pot it's G be mostly root mass and two

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:47,439
managing the fertility in that pot with

46
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,000
top dressing is really challenging um in

47
00:01:47,438 --> 00:01:51,758
terms of keeping that Mom healthy and

48
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,680
and healthy moms is the most important

49
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,718
thing for your facility uh having

50
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,880
success and even for homeowers and

51
00:01:56,718 --> 00:02:00,839
having Success Through flour starting

52
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:02,239
with like a really healthy clone if I

53
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,600
don't have a healthy Mom I'm not going

54
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:06,718
to start my next cycle it's that

55
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:10,598
important

56
00:02:06,718 --> 00:02:11,479
um that's where little things like uh

57
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:15,518
fish

58
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:18,759
hydracy um a bottle nutrient program

59
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,920
with light doses come in really handy or

60
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:24,318
um even something like Jacks like a

61
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:26,759
conventional salt based fertilizer in

62
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,839
small doses uh those things are all just

63
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:32,039
really effective ways to keep your moms

64
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,560
healthy um I would much rather you know

65
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:36,519
for example run jacks or use a bottle of

66
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,560
nutrient line to make sure I'm keeping

67
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:40,560
my fertility up in that 30- gallon pot

68
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,759
my mom looks healthy then madly trying

69
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,080
to top dress as I see deficiencies

70
00:02:42,759 --> 00:02:46,679
knowing that they're not going to get

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,040
into the plant for another s to 10 days

72
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,519
and now my plant stressed and I'm gonna

73
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,560
have to take cuting off of it so it

74
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:55,400
becomes a

75
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:58,280
real hle and it's to me it's not worth

76
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,280
it um so unless because every genetics

77
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,959
are going to they're all going to be a

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,840
little bit different so I can't just say

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,158
here's a top dress kiss hit for your

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,878
moms um and it's going to work for all

81
00:03:05,158 --> 00:03:09,878
your moms because of the wide variety of

82
00:03:06,878 --> 00:03:11,239
genetics that we have so um that's a

83
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:14,199
that's that was a good question that was

84
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:16,400
asked in our in our Q&amp;A list and and

85
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:18,199
that's sort of how I would address it um

86
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,840
do someone else want to add anything or

87
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:25,000
yeah for me when I when Dwayne put the

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,039
question forward because I work at kiss

89
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,199
and because I use kiss soil I know and

90
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:34,679
because I regularly rotate my mom at

91
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:38,679
least every three months I know that I

92
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,519
can keep a a nice vigorous healthy plant

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,439
that was vegged in a one gallon I can

94
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,719
throw that into a 10 or a 12 gallon

95
00:03:43,438 --> 00:03:52,120
smart pot and I can run that and kiss

96
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:53,158
biochar water only CGM for three months

97
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,840
and I'm not going to see any

98
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:58,878
deficiencies that plant will be fine uh

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,200
as far as the nutrient side of things

100
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:03,798
calcium and F PR are the two that I try

101
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:07,000
to make sure on point for my moms just

102
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:09,400
as far as having the best propagation

103
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,360
results you know so those those are the

104
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:14,079
two elements that show up as being an

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,760
issue if somebody is just you know if

106
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:17,560
you're if you're not if your clones are

107
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:19,798
not rooting first thing you want to do

108
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:21,238
is get a scope out and look at your moms

109
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:23,918
and make sure you don't have russets or

110
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:25,758
something horrible like that going on um

111
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:27,240
that that's definitely you know

112
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,680
something that can happen you'll see

113
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,918
propagation numbers drop off with

114
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,280
russets but you'll also see it drop off

115
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:36,000
with calcium you'll see it drop off with

116
00:04:33,279 --> 00:04:38,679
phosphorus um and then when the the

117
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,439
environment of the of the propagation is

118
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,600
not ideal you've got super low uh

119
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,319
relative humidity or something like that

120
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,120
but for me because I'm doing regularly

121
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:52,759
rotating my mom's I I like a 10 or 12

122
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,759
gallon smart pot I

123
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:00,079
like like at least

124
00:04:55,319 --> 00:05:03,199
450 for my ppfd I'll go as high as 600

125
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:06,959
um for my moms I feel like that's that's

126
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:11,000
adequate and um you know it just I just

127
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:13,560
try to make sure I have enough to cover

128
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,918
my needs I try to make sure I've got

129
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,478
cuts that I don't need sitting around um

130
00:05:16,918 --> 00:05:21,159
and I try to make sure I've got Cuts

131
00:05:18,478 --> 00:05:22,719
before I need them I I would always

132
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,919
rather have a plant that's a little bit

133
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,800
bigger that I can trim back yeah that

134
00:05:25,918 --> 00:05:30,000
nice big root mass because when you've

135
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,038
got a small shoots and a giant root mask

136
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,560
and you throw it into a bed it goes

137
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:37,959
crazy um I just did the opposite big

138
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,639
shoots almost no roots and you know lost

139
00:05:37,959 --> 00:05:42,159
power for two days so it got cold and so

140
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,478
everything's just moving a little slowly

141
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,479
this

142
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:50,240
time but as far far as you know metrics

143
00:05:48,478 --> 00:05:51,359
that's that's you know what I'm shooting

144
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,319
for for a

145
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:57,639
mom yeah for for us at the facility it's

146
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:00,600
um we really don't like to let them go

147
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:04,439
more than really three months Maybe

148
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:07,120
four the big imp reason for that is um

149
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:09,240
obviously we've got a whole area ready

150
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,720
to go for clones so why not use it for

151
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:12,759
just moms as

152
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,160
well um and the thing to think about

153
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:17,560
twoo guys is plants are a Lot Like Us in

154
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,840
some respects like the hormones change

155
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,079
over the years guys it sucks but it

156
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:24,079
happens um when they're young and ready

157
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,079
to grow they're going to be moving stuff

158
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:28,359
all over their body so taking cuting

159
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:31,198
from anywhere is going to give you a

160
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,000
really good shot at getting some really

161
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:37,160
vigorously ready to go babies um once

162
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,560
those moms get Woody and older it takes

163
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,599
it's a lot harder it's Fighting Gravity

164
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:45,120
more um those things get woodier it's

165
00:06:42,598 --> 00:06:47,079
hard those and just the the hormones

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,639
change right the plant changes all that

167
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:51,959
stuff changes so it's a lot harder to

168
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,598
clone off of an older plant even if it's

169
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:55,038
the healthiest prettiest happiest

170
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:58,000
looking thing in the world just because

171
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:01,038
the starting materials that you want in

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,319
a clone aren't going to be there in

173
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:07,240
abundance as you know using from a

174
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:10,039
younger mom so um it that it helps to

175
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,360
keep them young for sure as far as your

176
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:13,839
success

177
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,759
rate yeah and I think it's it's also

178
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:18,560
good to um take into consideration that

179
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:22,680
we we are growing in

180
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,199
annual so even in the best of conditions

181
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:27,560
let's say Southern California you start

182
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:30,240
your seeds in February they're flowering

183
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:32,360
in August so that's six months

184
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,800
and even by then I I think that's a bit

185
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,280
of a long you know most people are

186
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,879
looking at May to August which is three

187
00:07:36,279 --> 00:07:40,359
months um and that plant's just ready to

188
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,479
flower like it doesn't want to keep

189
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,759
growing it wants to flower um so I've

190
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:49,719
found that I take biochar soil and I'll

191
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,479
either add a couple cups of Bloom

192
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:56,360
booster or I'll just specifically add

193
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:59,120
fishbone and gypsum and then um I keep

194
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,520
my mom's in one gallons it's definitely

195
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,199
the the bigger the pot the longer you

196
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:06,839
can keep it happy but in one gallons

197
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:09,319
every two months um I take the most

198
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:11,638
atypical branch and I take it down about

199
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:15,400
eight inches and then I use that to

200
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,360
reset um I found that they don't skipe a

201
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:21,038
beat as long as you use

202
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,759
enough plant material and it has

203
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:25,519
dominance because there's going to be a

204
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:28,360
higher concentration of oxin and you're

205
00:08:25,519 --> 00:08:31,120
kind of taking this the brain center of

206
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,719
the plant at that Point um and then when

207
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,719
that goes into the soil and that Roots

208
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,719
the amount of growth you're going to see

209
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:41,519
come off of that clone after it's rooted

210
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,640
is way more growth than you would see

211
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:45,879
from trying to keep a mom for six seven

212
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:48,240
months but it is more work to

213
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:50,399
continually reset and if your watering

214
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,680
is not on point those one gallon pots

215
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,120
can can really kill you so I would say

216
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:59,000
beds are the best but who's got beds

217
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,000
available for each mom you know what I'm

218
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
saying

219
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
man
