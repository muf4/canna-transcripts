know we talk a lot about um challenges

51
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:20,318
that Growers are are having in the field

52
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:23,359
and we bounce ideas off of each other

53
00:02:20,318 --> 00:02:25,518
and we'll look for research together to

54
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:28,760
solve particular problems and so we're

55
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:31,599
very much uh a team in that sense in and

56
00:02:28,759 --> 00:02:33,598
trying to come up with the best

57
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:35,878
solutions for

58
00:02:33,598 --> 00:02:39,639
Growers yeah let's let's give listeners

59
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:42,919
a a quick intro into your background and

60
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:47,199
how you came into this role at

61
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:53,279
bioworks so I've been with bioworks uh

62
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:57,318
since June of 2019 so what that's

63
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,519
for um about four years I think and I

64
00:02:57,318 --> 00:03:00,399
should have done the math on that it's

65
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:04,000
been a little while since I looked

66
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,599
but um so right before covid and at

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,400
bioworks I I started off as a bio uh a

68
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,679
biological program manager responsible

69
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:18,360
for the our our insect management

70
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:21,159
portfolio and last year we had a uh some

71
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:24,519
rearranging of our Technical Services

72
00:03:21,158 --> 00:03:28,519
Department and I switched roles to a

73
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,319
technical services manager and so I am a

74
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:32,200
more uh General

75
00:03:30,318 --> 00:03:36,039
instead of just focusing on the insect

76
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:40,878
side of things I also help uh Growers

77
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:44,759
with the disease management and plant

78
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:47,039
nutrition to a um a lesser extent it's

79
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:50,280
definitely not where my strength lies

80
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:53,199
but I can speak to it a little bit but

81
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,000
diseases and insects are where my

82
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:59,199
passion

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,400
lies I so in terms of what I do as a

84
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:08,238
technical services manager I uh we have

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:12,599
a tech emails and phone calls uh hotline

86
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:16,000
that we always have someone on there

87
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:18,959
paying attention to any calls and emails

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,560
that come in and so I help out with that

89
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:27,959
and we also go and visit growers in the

90
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,839
field I am also I work also very closely

91
00:04:27,959 --> 00:04:33,079
with our regulat

92
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:37,239
at

93
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:40,359
marketing research and development um

94
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:42,280
departments internally to bring new

95
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:44,038
products to the market and improve on

96
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:46,839
the products that we currently have in

97
00:04:44,038 --> 00:04:50,240
the market so I wear a lot of hats in

98
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:52,918
that sense and uh help out where I can

99
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,160
and when I can but my main my main

100
00:04:52,918 --> 00:05:00,639
priority is working with the Growers and

101
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:04,039
helping them solve disease and arth pod

102
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:08,600
issues that they're dealing with as far

103
00:05:04,038 --> 00:05:09,918
as uh my history prior to bioworks I was

104
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:15,439
with

105
00:05:09,918 --> 00:05:18,079
BASF and I was in seed Solutions so I

106
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:22,639
mainly did a lot of work on corn

107
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:26,560
soybeans wheat and cotton um but I had a

108
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:26,560
research Greenhouse where

109
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:35,038
I uh uh treated seeds and then planted

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,319
those seeds into the greenhouse and then

111
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:41,279
infected those plants with soyan CIS

112
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:44,199
nematodes or with a corn rootworm to see

113
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:46,519
how the seed treatments performed on

114
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:49,520
those insects so it was still insect

115
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:51,240
focused even though it was in seed

116
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:54,279
Solutions

117
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,000
BASF bought the company that I was

118
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:59,239
working for originally called Becker

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Underwood and I was with Becker

120
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,360
Underwood for about six years and with

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:08,199
BASF for about seven years uh at uh

122
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:12,840
Becker Underwood I was in quality

123
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,919
control Regulatory and uh I was also a

124
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:17,758
nematode field development specialist

125
00:06:14,918 --> 00:06:19,079
where I worked specifically with the

126
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,560
beneficial

127
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:23,959
nematodes very much doing the same thing

128
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,319
that I am doing now but focused

129
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:29,719
specifically on beneficial nematodes so

130
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,400
I do have a lot of experience working

131
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,960
with um many of the nematode species

132
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:39,318
that are commercially produced and used

133
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:40,279
by Growers so that um that's pretty much

134
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,080
me and a

135
00:06:40,279 --> 00:06:45,959
nutshell great great and for folks that

136
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:47,680
are listening if if you are interested

137
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,879
uh you can also check out the podcast

138
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,840
I've done with Chris Hayes and Michael

139
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:54,399
brownbridge who are both also at

140
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:57,279
bioworks um and offer a really unique

141
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:59,560
perspective around uh talking about

142
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,638
pathogens and and insect control and PES

143
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,280
management things like that so those

144
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:05,240
podcasts were recorded a while ago so

145
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,758
people can check that out uh well why

146
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,720
don't we start off talking about

147
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:12,280
nematodes since you do have a background

148
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,680
in this now I myself have only used SF

149
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:17,559
nematodes and I tend to say SF because I

150
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:19,319
always mispronounce the name uh maybe

151
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,959
you could start off talking a little bit

152
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,879
about SF nematodes and what they treat

153
00:07:21,959 --> 00:07:25,598
and because I I found them to be very

154
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:27,599
effective and then maybe what other

155
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:31,519
commercially reared nematodes might a

156
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:35,360
cannabis grower consider in their

157
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:37,159
program excellent questions so SF stands

158
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
for Steiner

159
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:43,759
neopel and Steiner Nela is probably one

160
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,680
of the most common nematodes that you

161
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:49,680
buy and it it it

162
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:55,560
is often considered

163
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:58,360
a a specialist in in in some fly species

164
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:01,439
and uh it is very commonly used for

165
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,439
fungus net management

166
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:10,318
uh Steiner melti is also used for thrips

167
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:13,720
management so thps Pupa that fall um

168
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:17,199
free Pupa and Pupa um and it's important

169
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:20,599
to note that not all thrips pupate in

170
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,598
the soil so if you are going to

171
00:08:20,598 --> 00:08:28,000
use nematodes Steiner nlti or Steiner

172
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:31,319
aaroc capsi for management of thrips you

173
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,399
do need to make sure that you identify

174
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:37,519
the thrip species that you have and

175
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,799
confirm if that thrip species is in fact

176
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,959
pupating in the soil because if it's not

177
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,000
you can throw all of the beneficials in

178
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:45,359
the soil that you want and it's not

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
going to work because they're pupating

180
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,720
on the plant thrips are an interesting

181
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,200
species in that they are sort of an

182
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,278
intermediate between a complete and an

183
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,759
incomplete

184
00:08:53,278 --> 00:09:00,600
metamorphosis the pupa uh still kind of

185
00:08:56,759 --> 00:09:02,838
have uh legs and if you poke them they

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:05,000
can actually still move around which is

187
00:09:02,839 --> 00:09:07,399
unlike what you would think of when you

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,759
think of a pupa so that's why we kind of

189
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,559
consider thrips as you know an odd an

190
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:16,039
odd ball in that it has this odd uh

191
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:17,919
intermediate stage so that being said um

192
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:21,399
that's why the pupa can sometimes will

193
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:23,919
stay on the plant because again um they

194
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:26,278
still have legs to to grip onto the

195
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:28,799
plant so there are a few species of

196
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:31,639
thrips that do um continue to pupate on

197
00:09:28,799 --> 00:09:33,599
the plant the one of those being EO THS

198
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:35,919
are a good example of a thrips that

199
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,320
would pupate on the plant now something

200
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:40,599
like an onion or a Western Flower thrip

201
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,160
onion probably being the more common

202
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:46,720
species in cannabis and hemp are often

203
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,838
um pupating in the soil if you have a a

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,879
really thick um say flow or Bud

205
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,279
sometimes you they may get um stuck in

206
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:57,639
those and not come out and and pupate in

207
00:09:56,278 --> 00:10:00,200
those but for the most part they're

208
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:02,360
going to drop to the soil so then you

209
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:07,000
can use beneficial nematodes there are

210
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:10,200
also a couple of other um soil based uh

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,240
beneficials uh such as stratal leaps and

212
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,079
deloia which are um uh predatory might

213
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,639
uh in the case of stratal elaps and

214
00:10:17,078 --> 00:10:24,519
delosa in the uh is a beetle in and uh

215
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:26,639
they do fly at night um so I know that

216
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:28,600
delosa isn't something that a lot of

217
00:10:26,639 --> 00:10:31,519
cannabis Growers use because they might

218
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,399
not want to get that um in their

219
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,600
bud so um with that being said there are

220
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,000
a couple of beneficials that are used

221
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,399
for fungus net management one of those

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,360
being C mfti and I will tell you that

223
00:10:43,399 --> 00:10:48,519
there is research uh uh probably the

224
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:52,399
most research has been done on Steiner

225
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:56,600
nlti and Steiner carpo capsy and Steiner

226
00:10:52,399 --> 00:11:00,879
carpo capsy it it can also be used

227
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,600
for management of thrips and fungus

228
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:06,480
snats um there is research that suggests

229
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:10,639
that both of those are are uh okay to

230
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:13,680
use um traditionally we use Steiner

231
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:17,120
mlti um because we have seen really good

232
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:19,278
management um with that nematode species

233
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,879
and it can be um both of those species

234
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,838
are fairly robust

235
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:28,600
nematodes

236
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:30,320
um so basically what happens um is if

237
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,920
you were going to use nematodes for

238
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,160
management of say let's say fungus Nets

239
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:39,399
really fungus Nets or thrips say you had

240
00:11:35,159 --> 00:11:41,838
onion or Western Flower thrips and you

241
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,639
have fungus Nets which is very common

242
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:47,839
these are very very common insect

243
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:52,120
species that

244
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,160
um uh happen almost ubiquitously across

245
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:56,879
all

246
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:00,519
operations and so if you were going to

247
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,120
use Steiner mfti you

248
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:03,480
there are a number of companies that

249
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,959
sell

250
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,800
nematodes

251
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:12,759
and they can come in a variety of

252
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:14,838
formulations uh that's a um a much

253
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:17,319
longer conversation that you know if we

254
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:19,120
want to go down that path we can but

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,120
basically there's a number of

256
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,198
formulations and uh a number of ways

257
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:26,639
that the ne nematodes may come to you

258
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:30,159
some times they come in bags Sometimes

259
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:35,159
they come in trays um but in almost all

260
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:37,480
cases it's either crumbly or more of a

261
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:39,600
sugar cookie batter

262
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,159
consistency and you'll want to keep

263
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,680
those in the refrigerator because those

264
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,480
nematodes are in an infective juvenile

265
00:12:44,679 --> 00:12:50,159
stage and all of them that you receive

266
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:52,839
are infective juveniles um all of the

267
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:56,439
other life stages are going to occur in

268
00:12:52,839 --> 00:13:01,120
an insect host so those infective

269
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,120
juveniles um they're only

270
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:08,759
uh way to survive is if they find a host

271
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:11,879
so they're very driven to find this

272
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:13,240
host and if they don't find a host they

273
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:17,720
die

274
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,159
because they are a an a Very a very

275
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,839
specific life stage in the in the

276
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:24,958
beneficial nematode life cycle where

277
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:27,320
they are free living meaning that

278
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:29,599
they're found outside of the host all of

279
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,320
the other life stage ages of the

280
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,320
nematode or inside the host so that's

281
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:37,959
important to know because this

282
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:42,720
adaptation of the infective

283
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:47,439
juvenile uh they retain the Mt from the

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:50,680
previous um uh juvenile nematode and

285
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,240
that sort of creates this jacket um on

286
00:13:50,679 --> 00:13:58,078
the nematode that helps it when it's

287
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,360
outside of the host um prevent uh or at

288
00:13:58,078 --> 00:14:02,958
least decrease the chance es of quick

289
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:06,000
desiccation or drying out um so it kind

290
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:08,799
of creates this jacket of of protection

291
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,039
um and in fact it may also help with

292
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:14,439
compatibility because we've got a lot of

293
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:18,399
compatibility results out there um with

294
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:21,120
a number of the nematode companies will

295
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,639
provide compatibility with tank mixes

296
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,198
that you can apply with the

297
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:28,560
nematodes and um nematodes are are

298
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,559
fairly compatible with with a number of

299
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:31,518
um

300
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:34,559
chemistries and

301
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:36,560
Biologicals can you give an example of

302
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:38,278
something that you may want a tank mix

303
00:14:36,559 --> 00:14:41,000
with a nematode if you're doing an

304
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:42,159
application there the more common ones

305
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,559
maybe in

306
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:49,719
cannabis so another pest that is

307
00:14:45,559 --> 00:14:52,919
commonly found in cannabis and hemp is H

308
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:57,040
the rice root aphid and the rice root

309
00:14:52,919 --> 00:15:00,240
aphid uh is is is a tough one to control

310
00:14:57,039 --> 00:15:02,519
once you get it so um um obviously

311
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,560
sanitation and quarantine are incredibly

312
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:06,320
important again um we don't want to

313
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,559
necessarily go down that rabbit hole

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,199
unless unless we want to

315
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:18,000
but if you were uh many Growers use enop

316
00:15:14,198 --> 00:15:22,559
pathogenic fungus for management of rice

317
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:25,879
Rapids uh enop pathogenic fungus H genus

318
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:31,159
species Bavaria basana

319
00:15:25,879 --> 00:15:35,159
iseria um uh for most sosia uh

320
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:40,240
C the iseria has now been renamed by the

321
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:44,559
way to um Corps so if you see

322
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,519
Corps uh it is now the new ice area but

323
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:51,838
you'll see it sometimes interchangeably

324
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:55,159
but the new language is Corps um so

325
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:58,079
aeria Corps there's also a number of

326
00:15:55,159 --> 00:16:00,240
meisum uh which is another enop

327
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,838
pathogenic fungus

328
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,240
um so those are the three

329
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:10,839
main fungal enop pathogens that are used

330
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:12,079
by Growers and each one of those are I

331
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:14,000
mean they're good products there's a

332
00:16:12,078 --> 00:16:17,559
number of companies that sell a number

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,600
of these products um sometimes the same

334
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:23,559
genus species uh but different strains

335
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:27,720
and they're all uh pretty good at uh

336
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:30,479
management of various soil and folar

337
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:32,120
based insects so to get back to your

338
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,600
question

339
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:39,720
Tad you could tank mix if you also had

340
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:44,079
rice root Aid you could tank mix your

341
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:48,278
nematodes with a uh one of the Bavaria

342
00:16:44,078 --> 00:16:50,599
met isums or cep species and then you

343
00:16:48,278 --> 00:16:54,240
would be targeting

344
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,720
more more pests basically um then

345
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
sometimes those are going to work

346
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,759
synergistically together um so for

347
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,199
instance

348
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,400
the uh enop pathogenic fungus and enop

349
00:17:03,198 --> 00:17:09,279
pathogenic simply means insect killing

350
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,959
by the way um and sometimes n the

351
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,318
beneficial nematodes although that's the

352
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,519
easier way to say it technically they're

353
00:17:13,318 --> 00:17:19,480
antipop pathogenic nematodes so both of

354
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:22,199
these are insect killing fungus and

355
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:24,880
insect killing

356
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,279
nematodes so you could tank mix these

357
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:30,360
two species um you may get additional

358
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:35,200
benefits in management of your thrips

359
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:38,240
and the fungus Nets um these enop

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:44,480
pathogenic fungus are typically not

361
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:50,079
that um uh that specific so it you know

362
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:51,160
we often have labeled pests but uh you

363
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,119
can

364
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:58,640
get additional efficacy um by using some

365
00:17:56,119 --> 00:18:02,119
of the endom pathogens so that would be

366
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,919
um one obvious one I know that uh Aid

367
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:08,798
duratin is a good one to use with your

368
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:10,520
enop pathogenic fungus H or the enop

369
00:18:08,798 --> 00:18:13,879
pathogenic nematodes there's often

370
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:16,599
Synergy or um additive effects I know

371
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:19,159
that not all cannabis Growers will use

372
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:24,599
Aid duratin insect growth Regulators in

373
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:27,320
general are a good thing to pair with

374
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:31,678
nematodes and fungus because it will

375
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:33,639
slow down or stop the life cycle and

376
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
which is incredibly important if you're

377
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,960
dealing with

378
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:40,959
aphids uh or other arthropods that have

379
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:45,120
very fast life

380
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:50,480
cycles because the

381
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:54,759
fungus takes typically 24 to 48 hours

382
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:58,880
to adhere to the surface of the cuticle

383
00:18:54,759 --> 00:19:02,798
to germinate to put out the osori which

384
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:05,520
is the infection body that creates the

385
00:19:02,798 --> 00:19:08,519
metabolites and pressure that punches

386
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:11,240
into the insect's cuticle um and then

387
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:16,720
that hyy goes down into the the insects

388
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:20,640
hemil or blood and then kills the insect

389
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:24,558
um so that that process to get into the

390
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:27,840
insect typically takes 24 to 48 hours so

391
00:19:24,558 --> 00:19:29,678
let's say you apply uh one of the the

392
00:19:27,839 --> 00:19:31,038
fungal-based

393
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:35,759
um

394
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:39,480
products any aphid that mols within that

395
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:41,038
24 to 48 hour period may not be killed

396
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,640
because they are shedding off those

397
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:47,879
spores and they don't move around very

398
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:49,600
much aphids specifically so they're not

399
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:54,240
going to crawl around and get more

400
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:57,678
spores typically so what you apply

401
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,798
initially is often times going to be

402
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,759
what you're going to Conta them with so

403
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:04,639
if you can slow down the insect's life

404
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:08,839
cycle with an insect growth regulator it

405
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,320
will very very commonly uh have higher

406
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:14,439
efficacy when targeting pests like

407
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:16,279
aphids thrips white

408
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:19,159
flies

409
00:20:16,279 --> 00:20:22,399
so just to make sure just to reiterate

410
00:20:19,159 --> 00:20:24,039
you're saying using a product like

411
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,120
something that has Aid dirting it's like

412
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,599
it maybe like aagard or azamax it's

413
00:20:26,119 --> 00:20:28,678
brands that I'm familiar with I'm sure

414
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,719
there's others out there on the market

415
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:35,320
market so something AER Jackson based

416
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:37,360
and then looking at a Bavaria product uh

417
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:39,720
you obviously with bioworks you guys

418
00:20:37,359 --> 00:20:42,839
have botanigard um I'm also familiar

419
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,720
with bioceros is another uh Bavaria

420
00:20:42,839 --> 00:20:49,720
product potentially um people could look

421
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:52,759
at and then uh combining those two along

422
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:56,038
with an a nematode and you specifically

423
00:20:52,759 --> 00:20:59,319
SF nematodes or Steiner name carpo

424
00:20:56,038 --> 00:21:00,599
capser if I said that somewhat close

425
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:03,480
um very close Okay that's really

426
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:05,279
interesting so if we one thing I wanted

427
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,440
to touch on with you and we talked about

428
00:21:05,279 --> 00:21:10,158
this a little ahead of time uh was this

429
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,720
is something that I learned from from

430
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,320
Suzanne that I think is really important

431
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,440
to highlight and that's that that these

432
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:19,319
different

433
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:21,038
species uh are within let me back up

434
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,839
within like Bavaria let's take Bavaria

435
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:25,960
as an example of this um bioworks

436
00:21:23,839 --> 00:21:29,599
through banag guard has a very specific

437
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:32,558
species of or or strain of of Bavaria

438
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:35,959
bosana and that's what gets commercially

439
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:39,359
reproduced they discovered it um and

440
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:43,240
then and it has very unique special

441
00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:44,879
properties to it um and that's why it's

442
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,880
so successful because it can survive in

443
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,919
a variety of different media different

444
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,640
temperatures um but it's going to be

445
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:53,759
different than say the product from

446
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:57,000
bioceres or another company it's going

447
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:59,400
to be a different um strain or species

448
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:02,640
of fungi

449
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:05,120
also B Bavaria basana but getting to the

450
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,679
idea that not all Bavaria is the same so

451
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:08,359
just because you and this is the same

452
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,360
for micro risal fungi this is the same

453
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:14,959
for as far as I understand pretty much

454
00:22:10,359 --> 00:22:18,399
all of these um beneficial microbial

455
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:20,400
products and so uh Growers may want to

456
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,240
cons rather than saying Bavaria doesn't

457
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,360
work or Bavaria does work they need to

458
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,400
find a specific they need to try maybe a

459
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:28,158
couple different brands to figure out

460
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,919
what works in their environment

461
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:33,200
depending on what sort of you know

462
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,120
biotic and abiotic factors they may have

463
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,278
in their grow in their cultivation

464
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:40,079
facility or space um is there anything

465
00:22:38,278 --> 00:22:42,679
you want to add to that or or touch on

466
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:46,079
in in regards to

467
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:50,360
that uh yes I uh I have a number of

468
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:54,038
things to add so first of first I want

469
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:58,839
to mention that botanigard is no longer

470
00:22:54,038 --> 00:23:02,119
sold by bioworks it's now actually nope

471
00:22:58,839 --> 00:23:05,480
it's fine it's it's it's now marketed by

472
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:07,158
op however this year we are planning on

473
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,880
launching our

474
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:14,080
own product and we hope to do that at

475
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:17,480
cultivate um we're still waiting on our

476
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:21,678
EPA registration which um should be

477
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:25,000
should be soon so with that being said

478
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:27,000
um so let's talk

479
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:29,359
about a few of the products that are on

480
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:32,278
the market there is tanard which is a

481
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:38,798
Bavaria bassiana strain ghaa there is

482
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:42,640
bioc cerus um that is uh a N3 strain

483
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:44,359
there is velifer which is ppri

484
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,360
5339

485
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:47,359
strain

486
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:53,639
um and then uh th those are the main

487
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,080
ones at least um those are the ones that

488
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,360
are uh that come to the top of the mind

489
00:23:57,079 --> 00:24:01,639
uh are are strained that that we are

490
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:04,558
going to be commercializing is also a

491
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:08,320
Bavaria basana so all of these are

492
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:10,918
Bavaria basana species and but they're

493
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:13,918
different strains so what I'll say about

494
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,030
that is often times uh all of these

495
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,799
different strains have

496
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,519
[Music]

497
00:24:17,798 --> 00:24:24,839
been isolated initially from an insect

498
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:29,798
so researchers in the field they see

499
00:24:24,839 --> 00:24:32,319
these Mast or um uh fuzzy bugs that's

500
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:36,398
all the mycelium and the spores that are

501
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:39,879
produced and they take those MOS insects

502
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:42,678
into the lab and they culture them and

503
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:45,159
you know since they were on a bug in in

504
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:47,720
the field is that something that's just

505
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:50,559
advantageous fungus or is that something

506
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,640
that actually killed the bug so they

507
00:24:50,558 --> 00:24:55,200
will take those spores that they get

508
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:59,679
from their culturing and try to infect

509
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:02,000
other bugs and if they kill then it's

510
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,399
likely that it is an emop pathogenic

511
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:08,200
fungus and you know again there are a

512
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:10,678
ton out there these are just the ones um

513
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,679
uh and there's a lot more that is known

514
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,360
than is commercialized um for a number

515
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,240
of reasons mainly you know are these

516
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:21,398
particular fungal strains capable of

517
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:25,038
being mass produced and not all of them

518
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:27,038
are so for instance um with the

519
00:25:25,038 --> 00:25:30,558
botanigard being a

520
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:35,079
GHA uh GHA actually stands for

521
00:25:30,558 --> 00:25:37,519
grasshopper a so that was isolated

522
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:39,759
initially from a grasshopper um some of

523
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:43,158
the other ones

524
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:46,359
um uh uh nfly noly is another one that's

525
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:48,480
a c uh oh that's Corps though so um

526
00:25:46,359 --> 00:25:50,359
iseria uh so I'm getting a little off

527
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,919
base

528
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:57,918
but similar concept so let's just

529
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,480
continue on with the Bavaria so um all

530
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,679
of the these different Bavaria were

531
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,079
isolated from different insects so so

532
00:26:02,679 --> 00:26:10,000
sometimes we can see improved efficacy

533
00:26:06,079 --> 00:26:14,199
on uh say the tarnish plant bug uh I I

534
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,798
think um I'd have to go and look how an3

535
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:20,120
was isolated I want to say that was from

536
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,960
um a plant bug but um again I haven't

537
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:26,398
looked recently so don't quote me on

538
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:28,960
that but um you can have strengths and

539
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:31,959
weaknesses from all of your fungal

540
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,960
strains

541
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,558
so often times I will tell Growers that

542
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:41,960
you don't necessarily have to use just

543
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:46,119
one you could have a couple in of of the

544
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:50,640
fungal strains in Your Arsenal uh

545
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:54,158
within the same genus species um but you

546
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:59,240
could also have within the same gen um

547
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:03,679
in a different genus so Bavaria iseria

548
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:07,839
Corps or meisum so you could rotate say

549
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:11,759
a Bavaria with uh a Corps or a Bavaria

550
00:27:07,839 --> 00:27:15,558
with a meisum and again each one of

551
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:18,200
those uh

552
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:21,119
individual

553
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,759
fungal genus species and strains are

554
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:28,319
going to have different strengths and

555
00:27:22,759 --> 00:27:31,079
weaknesses and so you can have uh

556
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:34,000
you you can get potentially more out of

557
00:27:31,079 --> 00:27:34,000
your endom apathogenic

558
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:47,839
guard and I just completely spaced in

559
00:27:45,119 --> 00:27:49,558
the moment um but that is that I'm

560
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:52,480
excited that bioworks is going to have

561
00:27:49,558 --> 00:27:53,960
their own uh product or Strain coming

562
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:57,440
out very soon I look forward to hearing

563
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:00,440
about that I currently have in my indoor

564
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:04,200
garden I have the granulated bioer

565
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:06,480
product as well as their liquid um

566
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,600
product and

567
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,720
so I I would suggest for Growers the the

568
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:14,918
ones that you listed is a good starting

569
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,839
point for people in terms of looking for

570
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,880
uh

571
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:22,240
commercially produced high

572
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,720
quality options um and I only say this

573
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:26,679
because I know there's some other ones

574
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,200
out there that you that um Michael

575
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:31,600
brownbridge has tested with in

576
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:33,798
conjunction with Suzanne that either um

577
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:35,759
I think it was it was a metan product

578
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,639
that had claims of spores that was

579
00:28:35,759 --> 00:28:42,798
higher than physically possible to fit

580
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:46,000
into a container um as well as another

581
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:47,599
one that had Spore count so low that

582
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,759
there was no way you could get efficacy

583
00:28:47,599 --> 00:28:51,918
with it because I know you can Source I

584
00:28:49,759 --> 00:28:53,960
could Source Bavaria from China right

585
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:57,320
now I could buy it get it shipped in and

586
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:59,480
sell it um but it's not probably doesn't

587
00:28:57,319 --> 00:29:01,798
have the same EIC or quality that we

588
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,159
would want to use in our garden as well

589
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,359
as potentially containing heavy metals

590
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:09,080
other microbial contamination and other

591
00:29:06,359 --> 00:29:12,240
issues so I would just caution listeners

592
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:13,678
to make sure you you go with a a company

593
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,120
that's done a lot of research and has a

594
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:18,000
good reputation in the industry for

595
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:20,719
these specific

596
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,960
products excellent

597
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,839
point

598
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,440
the so in addition to everything that

599
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:31,918
tad just said so the products that I've

600
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:34,320
mentioned so that's the the the the

601
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:38,880
botanigard the BIOS serus valer

602
00:29:34,319 --> 00:29:43,359
botanigard um uh the lard

603
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,519
m52 um uh the isera or Corps products no

604
00:29:43,359 --> 00:29:49,359
fly isid so on and so forth those are

605
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:52,240
all EPA registered Environmental

606
00:29:49,359 --> 00:29:55,678
Protection Agency and in order to get

607
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:59,200
registration you have to have a lot of

608
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,880
uh uh Eco um pschological

609
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:06,278
toxicity um and uh to know how it's

610
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,039
going to um behave or break down in the

611
00:30:06,278 --> 00:30:13,159
environment and if there is any harm to

612
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:14,720
say humans and it it goes through all of

613
00:30:13,159 --> 00:30:16,840
that testing there's also a lot of

614
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:20,798
quality testing that goes on to make

615
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:23,480
sure that quality standards are met when

616
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:25,079
these these fungal products are

617
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,079
produced

618
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:32,158
and uh lots of data that went behind

619
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:34,480
find knowing that these particular genus

620
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:37,960
species and strains are highly

621
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,919
efficacious to the pest that are labeled

622
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,759
now when you bring in a product from

623
00:30:40,919 --> 00:30:47,919
China or from you know some of these

624
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:52,440
other countries that are

625
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:55,720
offering the uh these

626
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,759
microbes there is no guarantee that what

627
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:01,120
they say is in that container is

628
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:03,599
actually in that container Tad mentioned

629
00:31:01,119 --> 00:31:06,918
microbial contamination um there could

630
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:10,119
be human pathogens in those formulations

631
00:31:06,919 --> 00:31:12,880
they've come from overseas and um

632
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:17,079
probably not refrigerated and so as

633
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:20,840
those spores die off it could uh then be

634
00:31:17,079 --> 00:31:23,359
a breeding ground for bacteria and other

635
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:28,558
fungus and so who knows what you're

636
00:31:23,359 --> 00:31:29,558
applying so I would as Tad mentioned

637
00:31:28,558 --> 00:31:34,480
uh

638
00:31:29,558 --> 00:31:37,079
be very cautious um about bringing

639
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,519
something like that into your facility

640
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:43,359
um use the EPA registered products they

641
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:47,638
may cost you a little bit more than the

642
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:49,599
ones that you get but you know it has

643
00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:55,439
valid

644
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:57,278
um data behind it backing it and um you

645
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,440
know that you will get a good result

646
00:31:57,278 --> 00:32:04,519
where you you don't have that with the

647
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:07,320
um off-market uh not off-market but um

648
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:10,120
black market um microbes which we

649
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:12,678
sometimes call them they are technically

650
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:14,678
Black Market because they're not legally

651
00:32:12,679 --> 00:32:16,360
allowed to be sold in the US but they

652
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:18,120
are and that's the other thing and

653
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:20,000
that's the other thing yeah you also

654
00:32:18,119 --> 00:32:23,479
mentioned about formulation and I think

655
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,038
that's important to mention with the

656
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:29,200
endopath uh fungus specifically so

657
00:32:27,038 --> 00:32:31,919
there's granules there's liquids and

658
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,480
there's wable powders so those are the

659
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:37,360
three most common formulations with

660
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,558
probably the wettable powder typically

661
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:42,678
being the most commonly used and I would

662
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:44,519
say that that's probably the most common

663
00:32:42,679 --> 00:32:47,360
because well it's it's got a lot of

664
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:50,359
proven efficacy but it's got really good

665
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:54,719
crop uh tolerance profiles too wable

666
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:57,000
powders um are very crop safe

667
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,679
typically um the other one that's

668
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,720
probably the second most common is a

669
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,000
liquid and that can be in a typically an

670
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
oil-based formulation you don't want to

671
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,720
have water in your formulation because

672
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:12,720
that will make the spores germinate so

673
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,960
uh in oil that has very low water

674
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,319
content um think honey basically you

675
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,360
know you that honey has very low uh uh

676
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:25,480
water content um oils typically have

677
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:28,038
very low uh water content so you can

678
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:30,440
formulate in oils some some of those

679
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:33,558
formulations are going to be uh

680
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,558
Horticultural mineral oilbased um and

681
00:33:33,558 --> 00:33:39,000
some of those are going to be seed uh

682
00:33:36,558 --> 00:33:42,638
seed oilbased

683
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,558
um sometimes you'll see that as a uh OD

684
00:33:42,638 --> 00:33:49,558
oil dispersion sometimes it's an es um

685
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:52,000
uh emulsifiable concentrate or

686
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:55,278
suspension um but basically those are

687
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:57,278
liquid formulations and those are really

688
00:33:55,278 --> 00:33:59,119
really good formulations to use

689
00:33:57,278 --> 00:34:00,960
especially Outdoors because you have

690
00:33:59,119 --> 00:34:03,599
some rain fastness with that that you

691
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,600
typically don't with a wettable powder

692
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:07,638
um so there are strengths and weaknesses

693
00:34:05,599 --> 00:34:11,878
now you want to be careful by putting

694
00:34:07,638 --> 00:34:14,279
oil in say the roots so if uh or or the

695
00:34:11,878 --> 00:34:17,159
media where the roots are um because you

696
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:19,320
don't want to suffocate the roots and um

697
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:22,240
there are some formulations um that are

698
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,440
labeled for drench and in which case

699
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:27,559
that's something that that you may get

700
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,760
additional efficacy with so make sure

701
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,559
that that it's labeled for the

702
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:34,079
particular application that you want to

703
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:38,838
do um but the the the the liquid

704
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:42,119
formulations are are are are

705
00:34:38,838 --> 00:34:45,119
excellent in that in addition to the

706
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:48,320
efficacy you get from the Fungus you

707
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,480
also get additional efficacy from

708
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:53,519
typically Suffocation um so you get a

709
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:56,240
couple of different mode of actions with

710
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:59,400
the oilbased formulations the last one

711
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:01,199
that I will mention um is the granular

712
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,320
formulation

713
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:07,159
and we had them on the market and then

714
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,920
for a while we didn't have them and now

715
00:35:07,159 --> 00:35:12,759
they're starting to come back again and

716
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,079
I think the granular based formulations

717
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:18,960
are of En apathogenic fungus are

718
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,519
fantastic especially if you are

719
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,960
targeting insects in the soil indoor or

720
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:28,960
outdoor because basically if you when

721
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,960
you pot up your media you are

722
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,320
incorporating these granules into the

723
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:37,440
media and now you they're basically

724
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:40,640
landmines in there and those those as

725
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,519
insects um come into the soil profile or

726
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,719
moving around potentially in the soil

727
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:48,920
profile they'll encounter these these

728
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:51,159
balls of spores and get um uh infected

729
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:54,880
with them as you water those spores will

730
00:35:51,159 --> 00:35:57,078
also disseminate throughout the soil and

731
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,960
the other benefit to having a granular

732
00:35:57,079 --> 00:36:03,200
formulation in the soil is especially if

733
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:05,760
you have a lot of um microbes in your

734
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:09,838
soil you know we talk a lot now about

735
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,560
regenerative soil and um you know having

736
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:16,400
all those microbes in the soil that that

737
00:36:12,559 --> 00:36:18,000
um have a a healthy soil environment

738
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,119
with all of the things that you could

739
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,760
have in those soils you can also have um

740
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:25,760
potentially depending on what's in there

741
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:33,680
um uh uh in in

742
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:37,039
inhibition um effects so uh so something

743
00:36:33,679 --> 00:36:40,199
that may cause uh Bavaria or you know a

744
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:43,719
fungus to not germinate

745
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:46,559
so with that being said with a

746
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:49,159
granule the granule typically has some

747
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:53,880
sort of food associated with it whether

748
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:56,118
it is um a a rice grain that that Rice

749
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:58,480
is is no longer alive so you don't have

750
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,480
to worry or a mill

751
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,318
um those seeds are no longer alive but

752
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:08,440
it's food for the fungus and so by

753
00:37:05,318 --> 00:37:12,039
having that food source available as in

754
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:15,000
in that granule the if there are

755
00:37:12,039 --> 00:37:16,519
microbes that are now competing for

756
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,079
resources in

757
00:37:16,519 --> 00:37:22,239
Space by having that food source in the

758
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:29,160
granule you actually

759
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:33,199
get um uh that um fungus is able to then

760
00:37:29,159 --> 00:37:35,960
out compete many of the other soil

761
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:40,039
microbes at least in its General

762
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:43,079
vicinity so that um you can get

763
00:37:40,039 --> 00:37:45,920
increased efficacy um it's also

764
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:48,720
longevity wise um if you did a wable

765
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:53,280
powder drench um and there are studies

766
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:57,759
uh there's a study by um

767
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:01,160
uh oh um trying to think of uh out of

768
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:05,119
Vermont there was a study that was done

769
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:07,838
um where the researcher did a drench um

770
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,039
of wable powder versus the granular

771
00:38:07,838 --> 00:38:15,119
formulation and they they got good

772
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:18,199
efficacy from both but they found that

773
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:20,920
longevity wise the granules lasted a lot

774
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:23,639
longer than the wable powder um because

775
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:26,800
again the target insect in this in that

776
00:38:23,639 --> 00:38:28,920
study do you remember um you know what I

777
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,359
don't remember what the target insect

778
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,960
was I think they were they uh it

779
00:38:32,358 --> 00:38:39,279
actually it might have been

780
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:43,358
thrips um and Tad I can get you that a

781
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,400
copy of that study if if you're um yeah

782
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:48,719
I think listeners might find that

783
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,280
interesting um I know that like from

784
00:38:48,719 --> 00:38:53,358
talking to Suzanne one of the things she

785
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,880
was most excited about uh which got me

786
00:38:53,358 --> 00:39:00,358
excited was using the granule

787
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,680
formulations uh and I specifically like

788
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:05,480
I said I have the one from

789
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:08,159
bioceros that would be used for uh

790
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,240
treating rud Aid now I don't have rud

791
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:11,399
Aid in my garden currently but I am

792
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:13,879
incorporating a little bit of the

793
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:17,280
granules in at transplant yes rudit are

794
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:19,838
the worst um as a

795
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:23,079
precautionary you know uh preventative

796
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:27,000
for like thrips and I I believe it works

797
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,960
on fungus Nets as well um so uh it's

798
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,679
just a

799
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:33,880
easy formulation to work with and that

800
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:36,118
idea of increased persistence or or also

801
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,760
the idea that when when you have a pot

802
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:39,800
that has holes on the bottom knowing

803
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,560
that those root aphids can reach those

804
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:44,480
holes at the bottom it's really hard to

805
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:47,199
get spores all the way down there and

806
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:49,519
good efficacy when you're doing a drench

807
00:39:47,199 --> 00:39:51,559
uh so I think this is where these

808
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:54,800
granules could really shine as as a

809
00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:57,519
formulation option for folks um I I

810
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:59,680
would love to see these companies and

811
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,599
I'm gonna I'm GNA throw bioworks under

812
00:39:59,679 --> 00:40:04,559
the bus here too I would love to see

813
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:09,318
them come up with smaller sizing because

814
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:11,639
um it's so hard as a hom grower uh you

815
00:40:09,318 --> 00:40:14,679
know whether for my vegetable garden for

816
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:17,279
for my um indoor garden to find products

817
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:22,078
in sizings that make the sort of sense

818
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:25,599
that I can use them um it it's really

819
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:28,280
tough I I hear you and we do get that

820
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:30,039
question quite a bit and so these

821
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:33,160
commercial

822
00:40:30,039 --> 00:40:38,000
formulations again because they're EPA

823
00:40:33,159 --> 00:40:40,078
registered they have very stri uh strict

824
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,159
label language

825
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:46,280
requirements

826
00:40:42,159 --> 00:40:50,159
and uh personal protective equipment and

827
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:54,200
you know very strict use requirements

828
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:55,440
and reapplication intervals and because

829
00:40:54,199 --> 00:40:59,399
of all of

830
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:03,920
that it can be

831
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:07,760
more uh challenging to sell that to the

832
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:12,720
homeowner or the small grower

833
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:15,079
because uh they don't they may not have

834
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:18,318
the understanding that the label is the

835
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:21,839
law and that's why oftentimes in say

836
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:24,358
Home Depot you still have products um

837
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:28,239
that like seven that you can buy off of

838
00:41:24,358 --> 00:41:32,239
the shelf that have a these same active

839
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:33,959
ingredients that we use in commercial

840
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:36,679
operations

841
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:38,280
however uh if you look at the active

842
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:40,759
ingredient

843
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:43,079
concentration it's very often

844
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:46,359
significantly less than what you would

845
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,440
get in um you know these EPA registered

846
00:41:46,358 --> 00:41:54,078
products that are sold to large

847
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:59,480
operations so that's part I think of why

848
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:03,359
you don't see as much um of of the

849
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:05,400
companies supplying to homeowners now

850
00:42:03,358 --> 00:42:10,519
with that being said there is uh I don't

851
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:14,358
know if there are uh Distributors that

852
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:18,838
do cater to homeowners and smaller

853
00:42:14,358 --> 00:42:23,598
Growers and uh do offer smaller pack

854
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:25,920
sizes um or you know not case quantities

855
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:28,480
so there are some options out there just

856
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,680
remember that if you're going to be

857
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,679
using a microbial or a live organism

858
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:37,078
like a nematode or a fungus or a

859
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:40,719
bacteria that if you're buying those off

860
00:42:37,079 --> 00:42:45,000
say Amazon or something like that you

861
00:42:40,719 --> 00:42:48,078
you and um the the manufacturing

862
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:51,559
companies don't know how those products

863
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:55,599
necessarily have been stored or if

864
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:57,400
the shelf life has been you know expired

865
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,000
so you may get expired product now I'm

866
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,240
not saying that you will but I'm just

867
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,199
cautioning you that if you are going to

868
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:09,558
buy a live product please consider going

869
00:43:06,199 --> 00:43:12,679
through a distributor that is reputable

870
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:16,559
in in the sense of they know how to

871
00:43:12,679 --> 00:43:20,239
handle store and ship these live

872
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:25,200
organisms so that means that you get the

873
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:28,199
best possible product um that will kill

874
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:32,558
the you know the arthropods or diseases

875
00:43:28,199 --> 00:43:34,719
that you are targeting um cuz a dead or

876
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:37,920
a dead nematode or a

877
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:40,719
dead uh fungus or bacteria is not going

878
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,960
to control your pest populations so it

879
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:46,838
is important on how it's stored and

880
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,280
shipped yeah that's something that

881
00:43:46,838 --> 00:43:51,838
Suzanne's really drilled in my head on

882
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:55,240
the insect side you know we we now offer

883
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:57,759
insects through biob uh but we ship

884
00:43:55,239 --> 00:44:00,199
everything overnight directly from the

885
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,359
insector so we never touch it and I know

886
00:44:00,199 --> 00:44:04,639
on the insect side some folks are

887
00:44:02,358 --> 00:44:06,920
repacking into smaller quantities for

888
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:11,679
homeowners which is nice but that can

889
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:14,519
also impact the quality and efficacy of

890
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:16,239
the actual product when it arrive so I'm

891
00:44:14,519 --> 00:44:19,239
glad you brought that up and one thing I

892
00:44:16,239 --> 00:44:21,078
learned with nematodes and maybe you can

893
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:23,439
validate this or or tell me it's wrong

894
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,039
but essentially um the reason these

895
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,760
quantities are so high with the

896
00:44:25,039 --> 00:44:28,639
nematodes is there's sort of a critical

897
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,760
mass like kind of like a compost pile

898
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:34,480
there's a minimum needed to keep to

899
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:36,359
maintain the viability that we want um

900
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,880
so that's why they're sold in these you

901
00:44:36,358 --> 00:44:43,598
know fairly

902
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:43,599
large quantities is that is that

903
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:50,599
accurate so with nematodes there is a

904
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:52,839
ton of research out there on a a a

905
00:44:50,599 --> 00:44:55,119
plethora of of

906
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:57,880
arthropods

907
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,079
and the

908
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:05,280
the research

909
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:09,039
TP that has been conducted are using a

910
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:13,559
quantity of nematodes to kill said Pest

911
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:17,480
and so the rates that were recommending

912
00:45:13,559 --> 00:45:22,599
for for nematodes are based on Research

913
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:26,800
results and I would say for the uh inv

914
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:29,440
vitro uh produce nematodes or nematodes

915
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,000
that are produced in say

916
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:37,880
fermentation those uh the rates for

917
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:43,239
those types of nematodes are typically

918
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:46,280
in the 1 billion nematodes per acre rate

919
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:50,318
sometimes sometimes less sometimes more

920
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:54,440
again depending on the species of pest

921
00:45:50,318 --> 00:45:57,800
that you're targeting so uh uh I'll use

922
00:45:54,440 --> 00:45:59,599
uh for an example um

923
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,359
there is a a

924
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:06,318
nematode uh

925
00:46:02,358 --> 00:46:09,078
uh I would say lesser known but still uh

926
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:14,558
very commonly used called heterotis

927
00:46:09,079 --> 00:46:19,160
bacteria for it is a nematode that um is

928
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:22,519
very commonly available and can

929
00:46:19,159 --> 00:46:24,558
work uh better on say beetles it's a

930
00:46:22,519 --> 00:46:28,559
good Beetle

931
00:46:24,559 --> 00:46:31,480
um uh nematode speci species

932
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:33,720
so there are a couple of Beatles on the

933
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,559
label so Japanese beetle is one that

934
00:46:33,719 --> 00:46:41,159
many of us are familiar with and those

935
00:46:37,559 --> 00:46:46,280
beetles uh the grubs

936
00:46:41,159 --> 00:46:51,519
are easier to kill than say a uh

937
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:55,440
European chaffer so with uh a

938
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:58,559
a um a Japanese Beetle we're going at a

939
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,760
billion NE half to 1 billion nematodes

940
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:04,079
per acre versus a European chaffer that

941
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:06,319
may go up to four billion per acre so

942
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,519
the reason why you see differences in

943
00:47:06,318 --> 00:47:14,558
rate or often again goes back to the

944
00:47:09,519 --> 00:47:16,920
research in um uh

945
00:47:14,559 --> 00:47:19,480
how uh how many

946
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:24,400
nematodes um were required to kill that

947
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:28,119
particular Best pest um so a nematode an

948
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:32,240
infective juvenile you apply via spray

949
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:34,680
um broadcast is best um dripper can work

950
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:36,279
but you have a single point um and those

951
00:47:34,679 --> 00:47:38,318
nematodes then need to go out from there

952
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:41,599
so it can can still work but you need to

953
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:44,880
provide the moisture for them to move so

954
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:49,119
um it contacts a your uh let's say the

955
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,960
Japanese beetle grub and that and you

956
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:56,559
know really insert pest here it you know

957
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:57,480
I'm using beetles as an example but um

958
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:02,000
so

959
00:47:57,480 --> 00:48:08,280
so if that particular pest does not

960
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:12,199
recognize that nematode as uh as

961
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:14,440
self then that you you only really need

962
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:17,960
a couple of nematodes to get in to

963
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:21,240
overwhelm its immune system um nematodes

964
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:23,199
also carry a bacteria and um in the case

965
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,199
of Steiner nemma they regurgitate that

966
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:28,679
bacteria and it's actually the bacteria

967
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:30,838
that does the killing of the it it it it

968
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:34,679
um multiplies and then the nematodes are

969
00:48:30,838 --> 00:48:40,318
actually eating the bacteria um and uh

970
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:45,960
uh that the was killed by the um the

971
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:47,880
bacteria so the um and then heter rdus

972
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:51,440
nematodes actually defecate or

973
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:53,119
regurgitate the um bacteria into the

974
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,960
insect

975
00:48:53,119 --> 00:49:00,200
so you need a couple of of nematodes to

976
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:04,760
get in say that Japanese beetle to

977
00:49:00,199 --> 00:49:06,838
release that bacteria it it it may not

978
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:11,079
recognize that there is an invasion

979
00:49:06,838 --> 00:49:13,239
going on and pretty soon it goes through

980
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:15,079
septicemia blood poisoning because of

981
00:49:13,239 --> 00:49:18,159
the bacteria and it

982
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:21,200
dies now let's say the European chaffer

983
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:24,358
it does recognize the fact that oh I am

984
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:29,159
being infected by nematodes and it will

985
00:49:24,358 --> 00:49:31,679
launch a uh an immune response that is

986
00:49:29,159 --> 00:49:35,118
much stronger so you have to have a lot

987
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,759
more nematodes being applied to the soil

988
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,358
in order to

989
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:43,160
overwhelm the uh the that particular

990
00:49:40,358 --> 00:49:45,598
insect or in this case grub immune

991
00:49:43,159 --> 00:49:48,598
system to kill that insect so that's why

992
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:52,798
you see uh the difference in rate um

993
00:49:48,599 --> 00:49:56,079
with nematodes um and again typically

994
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:57,159
with the rate um being around a billion

995
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,798
nematodes

996
00:49:57,159 --> 00:50:03,679
per acre now obviously that's per acre

997
00:49:59,798 --> 00:50:05,838
so um sometimes uh on labels you'll see

998
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:08,719
that more in the you know per thousand

999
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:11,719
square feet um but if you work that up

1000
00:50:08,719 --> 00:50:13,399
to acre it's going to be in that um

1001
00:50:11,719 --> 00:50:15,558
General

1002
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,960
vicinity H that's really interesting I

1003
00:50:15,559 --> 00:50:19,480
wasn't aware that it was the bacteria so

1004
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:21,519
the so the

1005
00:50:19,480 --> 00:50:26,159
nematode it take me through that the

1006
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:28,559
nematode penetrates the grub the the the

1007
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:30,598
skin of the grub essentially and then

1008
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:32,760
deposits the bacteria and then the

1009
00:50:30,599 --> 00:50:34,838
bacteria reproduces and then it reats

1010
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,040
the bacteria is that essentially what

1011
00:50:34,838 --> 00:50:39,759
you're saying that is essentially what

1012
00:50:37,039 --> 00:50:42,239
I'm saying so uh for Steiner Neman

1013
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,480
nematodes they have to enter through

1014
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:46,479
Natural Body

1015
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:48,159
openings and so that's the mouth the

1016
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,639
anus and the

1017
00:50:48,159 --> 00:50:56,639
sphericals and but but uh then once in

1018
00:50:52,639 --> 00:50:58,879
they release the uh the bacteria they sh

1019
00:50:56,639 --> 00:51:02,358
shed that that jacket that we talked

1020
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:07,200
about earlier they release the bacteria

1021
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:10,719
and then the bacteria kills the host uh

1022
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:13,000
then the soup that is

1023
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:17,798
produced from

1024
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:21,480
the uh the um the death of that insect

1025
00:51:17,798 --> 00:51:25,838
will be the um food source for the

1026
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,280
nematodes to go through a couple of um

1027
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,440
Generations

1028
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,839
of

1029
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:34,000
nematodes inside the particular host the

1030
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:36,719
larger the host the more Generations the

1031
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:43,039
smaller the host the fewer Generations

1032
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:46,679
so um once food starts to become limited

1033
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:48,719
that next generation of nematodes

1034
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:53,118
instead of going into the next juvenile

1035
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:55,759
stage will then um once the food is is

1036
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,200
um limited will go into the infective

1037
00:51:55,760 --> 00:52:00,280
juvenile state

1038
00:51:57,199 --> 00:52:03,358
and that's the stage that leaves the

1039
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:06,960
host in search of more

1040
00:52:03,358 --> 00:52:10,239
hosts so that's basically the life cycle

1041
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:12,400
of um General life cycle of the nematode

1042
00:52:10,239 --> 00:52:13,879
um that would go for both Steiner Nema

1043
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,519
as well as

1044
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:18,400
heterotis I will tell you though that

1045
00:52:16,519 --> 00:52:22,679
heterotis

1046
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:26,639
nematodes also have uh a hook on uh the

1047
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:31,480
end of their um their nose or their or

1048
00:52:26,639 --> 00:52:34,118
their um body and uh for insects with

1049
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:37,880
very thin cuticles they can actually

1050
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:39,480
direct penetrate into uh say a grub

1051
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:41,240
because a grub would have a very thin

1052
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:44,559
cuticle and so you have direct

1053
00:52:41,239 --> 00:52:47,439
penetration which may be why we see it

1054
00:52:44,559 --> 00:52:49,760
being a little bit better for say grubs

1055
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,679
than say a steinera would be that would

1056
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,119
have to go through the mouth the anus or

1057
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,399
the

1058
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,640
spicles then there's also I mean if you

1059
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,160
want to get into um there all the the

1060
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:04,719
different nematodes um we've talked

1061
00:53:01,159 --> 00:53:07,759
about three so we have uh Steiner neli

1062
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:10,159
we have Steiner narbo capsy and we have

1063
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,559
uh heterotis bacteria for the other

1064
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,399
really cool thing about nematodes is

1065
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:16,559
they have different foraging strategies

1066
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:19,318
so starting with

1067
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:22,280
heterotis they are what we call a

1068
00:53:19,318 --> 00:53:25,199
cruiser and they are a very active

1069
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:28,079
nematode um you put them into the soil

1070
00:53:25,199 --> 00:53:29,759
and they go crazy using up their energy

1071
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:32,480
um until they find that host or they

1072
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,960
don't and they die um or they continue

1073
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:38,838
on their life cycle in a host um so

1074
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:44,519
they're go go go nematodes then we have

1075
00:53:38,838 --> 00:53:48,159
Steiner Nema uh carpo capsi that have a

1076
00:53:44,519 --> 00:53:51,400
um an ambush foraging strategy so

1077
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:55,279
they're a nematode that has been adapted

1078
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:57,760
to the surface of the soil and you find

1079
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,000
them in the upper soil layer and the

1080
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:02,920
soil surface and they're going after

1081
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:05,039
more of your mobile insects that are

1082
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:08,920
going to be on the soil surface or in in

1083
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:11,318
that that upper layer and what they they

1084
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,960
can do this thing where they can

1085
00:54:11,318 --> 00:54:18,440
actually lift their bodies up off of the

1086
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:20,559
substrate and they sort of wave around

1087
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,960
and if they sense a host that's coming

1088
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:26,040
either through vibrations or through

1089
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,838
volatile cues that are given off um by

1090
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:32,440
the sex and they sort of curl themselves

1091
00:54:28,838 --> 00:54:35,480
up into a a ball and they can flick

1092
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:39,079
themselves at their host to improve

1093
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:42,079
their success into contacting that host

1094
00:54:39,079 --> 00:54:45,039
that's called nictation um and that's

1095
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:47,160
done by our Ambush nematode so if you're

1096
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:51,920
going after a pest that is a Surface

1097
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:54,358
pest um you might want to you know pick

1098
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:56,720
steinm Corp capsi because in addition to

1099
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:59,318
what I just said they are also a little

1100
00:54:56,719 --> 00:55:01,838
bit more desiccation tolerant and

1101
00:54:59,318 --> 00:55:04,679
sometimes also heat tolerant um John

1102
00:55:01,838 --> 00:55:07,960
Sanderson from Cornell who just retired

1103
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:10,078
did a study on these nematodes um and

1104
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:13,119
found that carpo capsy is a little bit

1105
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:16,318
more heat tolerant than say Steiner neli

1106
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:19,599
now finally Steiner ofel is an

1107
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:22,599
intermediate so its inter its foraging

1108
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,680
strategy is somewhere in between that of

1109
00:55:22,599 --> 00:55:28,000
the cruiser and the ambusher um it's

1110
00:55:25,679 --> 00:55:30,078
also a very very large nematode um

1111
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,920
whereas steinon narpo capsy is a much

1112
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:36,079
smaller nematode and so uh you can have

1113
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:40,079
Steiner

1114
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:43,400
mlti um uh sort of hanging out or

1115
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:45,440
cruising around for a host so um

1116
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:48,440
typically you'll find that in the upper

1117
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:52,079
soil profile but typically much lower in

1118
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:54,679
the soil than say that of carpac capsy

1119
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,960
and your heterotis nematodes with it

1120
00:55:54,679 --> 00:56:00,919
being very active um has the largest um

1121
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,639
Range where you may find it throughout

1122
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,639
that soil profile that is a little bit

1123
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:09,558
more in um potentially in nature

1124
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:13,239
obviously when you're growing in pots um

1125
00:56:09,559 --> 00:56:19,200
the type of media does have a big impact

1126
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:20,838
um the more uh dense and um I say uh

1127
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:22,598
compact the soil the harder the

1128
00:56:20,838 --> 00:56:25,960
nematodes get through that but if you

1129
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:28,960
had say a cocoa choir um that's uh or a

1130
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:32,639
peep based media or mixture as many of

1131
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:36,679
us do uh that is a a really uh an

1132
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:39,598
excellent uh media to use beneficial

1133
00:56:36,679 --> 00:56:41,519
nematodes in as well as the um

1134
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:43,798
beneficial fungus that we talked about

1135
00:56:41,519 --> 00:56:47,599
that's also a good media you can also

1136
00:56:43,798 --> 00:56:49,119
use nematodes and fungus in say a rock

1137
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:54,240
wo

1138
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:57,200
um or uh Oasis um however the spores

1139
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:59,159
don't live as long and the nematodes

1140
00:56:57,199 --> 00:57:01,598
will often get pushed out from

1141
00:56:59,159 --> 00:57:04,879
subsequent waterings so you do have to

1142
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,160
do more frequent waterings uh I'm sorry

1143
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:11,720
more frequent applications in that type

1144
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:13,239
of media than if you were in uh the the

1145
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:19,318
um

1146
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:24,159
um soil lless based media and um um

1147
00:57:19,318 --> 00:57:25,599
those type of of Medias so um yeah that

1148
00:57:24,159 --> 00:57:28,519
was really interesting because I I was

1149
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:32,599
going to ask ask you how the heck do

1150
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:34,798
these nematodes survive if you know most

1151
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:36,920
of their life cycle is inside an insect

1152
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:39,759
how are how in nature are they surviving

1153
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:43,440
and is there any way we can apply

1154
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,720
that you know knowledge to say an

1155
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,559
indoor you know environment CA

1156
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:50,358
environment where we don't have you

1157
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:53,798
we're trying to kill off all insect host

1158
00:57:50,358 --> 00:57:56,358
and then I assume the persistence is not

1159
00:57:53,798 --> 00:58:00,480
great in terms of these these nematodes

1160
00:57:56,358 --> 00:58:01,400
surviving beyond the initial application

1161
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:04,199
very

1162
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,400
long what um what what are your thoughts

1163
00:58:04,199 --> 00:58:07,239
on that and then I have a couple other

1164
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:10,559
nematode questions since we we seem to

1165
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:12,919
be going down the the nematode and

1166
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:15,160
timathy rabbit hole here and I'm GNA

1167
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:16,920
have to have you back on I think to ask

1168
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:18,960
you the actual bulk of the questions

1169
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:21,599
that I had originally planned for this

1170
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:23,599
episode so let's just stick with the the

1171
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,798
nematodes for now um what what are your

1172
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:26,760
thoughts on

1173
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:29,000
that so

1174
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:31,880
nematode

1175
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:36,079
survival

1176
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:40,160
so the the the the biggest factor I

1177
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,960
think in nematode survival is to make

1178
00:58:40,159 --> 00:58:46,960
sure that you give

1179
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:50,720
them enough soil moisture in order to uh

1180
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:54,358
not only survive but move in that soil

1181
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:56,719
profile you don't want to have uh say a

1182
00:58:54,358 --> 00:59:00,358
lot of flushing and a lot of

1183
00:58:56,719 --> 00:59:02,118
um uh of that water that that the

1184
00:59:00,358 --> 00:59:04,159
subsequent waterings where you have a

1185
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:06,119
lot of water that's coming out the

1186
00:59:04,159 --> 00:59:08,078
bottom of the pot after you know a

1187
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:09,880
nematode application because you could

1188
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:11,960
be pushing them through especially if

1189
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:15,798
you have say a pure cocoa choir that's a

1190
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:17,920
pretty porous media and um you you could

1191
00:59:15,798 --> 00:59:20,440
wash them out

1192
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,798
so um you know think about your

1193
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:25,039
waterings obviously you still want to

1194
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:27,159
water but not to the point of a lot of

1195
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:30,000
run through through the pot

1196
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:32,318
and um in terms of

1197
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,358
survival as as long as they have

1198
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:37,440
moisture and you don't dry it out

1199
00:59:34,358 --> 00:59:40,199
they're they're going to do their thing

1200
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:43,838
they're going to search for hosts and

1201
00:59:40,199 --> 00:59:46,558
either find them an infect or perish

1202
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:51,119
because they only have um as they are

1203
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:54,640
feeding in the host uh they are gaining

1204
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,640
the lipids or the fats that they need in

1205
00:59:54,639 --> 00:59:59,838
order to find a host

1206
00:59:56,639 --> 01:00:04,719
and so they only have a finite storage

1207
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:09,798
of their um of of their

1208
01:00:04,719 --> 01:00:14,078
um um lipids so once that's run

1209
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:17,798
out it the the nematode no longer has uh

1210
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:20,000
energy to move on and it will die so the

1211
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:22,679
faster those nematodes can find hosts

1212
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,039
the better which is why doing an app you

1213
01:00:22,679 --> 01:00:28,239
know a Broadcast application to you know

1214
01:00:25,039 --> 01:00:30,720
get those nematodes all over in the pot

1215
01:00:28,239 --> 01:00:32,558
um and then down from there um is

1216
01:00:30,719 --> 01:00:34,759
generally a better strategy than doing

1217
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:37,359
drip irrigation and where they get in

1218
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:39,440
one spot and then they have to move out

1219
01:00:37,358 --> 01:00:42,960
from there they will but it will take

1220
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:45,240
longer to get to those you know outside

1221
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:50,519
um areas of the pot where a lot of the

1222
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:53,199
fungus Nets are um so just uh that's a a

1223
01:00:50,519 --> 01:00:56,920
good application tip

1224
01:00:53,199 --> 01:00:58,798
um did I answer that question or

1225
01:00:56,920 --> 01:01:00,480
uh uh a couple things so what was it

1226
01:00:58,798 --> 01:01:03,960
again I think application method is

1227
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:05,639
important to probably touch on like um I

1228
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:09,079
I had to lean heavily on Suzanne for

1229
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:11,679
this um and I know you're looking at

1230
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:12,960
this at a very much larger scale but I

1231
01:01:11,679 --> 01:01:14,558
know that there's other you know there's

1232
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,920
people like myself that are also using

1233
01:01:14,559 --> 01:01:20,680
them in home gardens or house plants or

1234
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:22,358
or situations where um you know we don't

1235
01:01:20,679 --> 01:01:24,038
we don't have a nematode bucket like

1236
01:01:22,358 --> 01:01:25,598
that cool product from drram that's

1237
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:27,280
going to keep everything agitated and

1238
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,838
stir without heating it up and killing

1239
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:33,640
the nematodes so uh I help them develop

1240
01:01:30,838 --> 01:01:36,480
that system oh you did oh Julie that's

1241
01:01:33,639 --> 01:01:37,920
so cool I had no idea yes so if you're a

1242
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:40,679
commercial facility that's using a lot

1243
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:43,200
of nematodes absolutely check out the

1244
01:01:40,679 --> 01:01:46,598
the nematode Bucket from drram it's a

1245
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:47,960
very cool product um it looks very

1246
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:50,119
simple but it's actually quite

1247
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:53,278
complicated because you're trying to

1248
01:01:50,119 --> 01:01:56,760
keep them in suspension evenly but also

1249
01:01:53,278 --> 01:02:00,278
not allow any extra heat to end up in it

1250
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:03,559
correct and yes and may I mention that

1251
01:02:00,278 --> 01:02:06,239
it is not just used for nematodes but if

1252
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:08,119
you're doing irrigation injection uh you

1253
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:09,959
could you could put your enop pathogenic

1254
01:02:08,119 --> 01:02:11,640
fungus in there you could do your

1255
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:15,318
nematodes you could do many of your

1256
01:02:11,639 --> 01:02:18,199
other applications and it h there is a

1257
01:02:15,318 --> 01:02:22,920
swirling Factor but you can also turn on

1258
01:02:18,199 --> 01:02:27,639
uh air that will that will increase

1259
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:30,639
the the um the oxygen in the water

1260
01:02:27,639 --> 01:02:32,519
nematodes aren't aquatic So eventually

1261
01:02:30,639 --> 01:02:34,759
they do drown especially if you don't

1262
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:37,318
have agitation they fall to the bottom

1263
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:40,319
of the tank um they're all still

1264
01:02:37,318 --> 01:02:42,558
consuming oxygen in the water so if they

1265
01:02:40,318 --> 01:02:45,759
don't have oxygen then that's a that's a

1266
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:48,640
really uh good way to kill them also

1267
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:52,880
cold water holds more oxygen than warm

1268
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:56,519
water and so it's very important to keep

1269
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:59,318
those Solutions as cool as possible

1270
01:02:56,519 --> 01:03:02,278
and apply them as quickly as possible so

1271
01:02:59,318 --> 01:03:05,880
that those Solutions don't heat up over

1272
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:07,760
time so I actually just did a a podcast

1273
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,480
interview I haven't released yet uh

1274
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:14,240
it'll come out before this one but with

1275
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:16,760
uh less over at dram talking about

1276
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,598
dissolved oxygen specifically because it

1277
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:20,200
is an important topic and and yes

1278
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:23,079
temperature plays a huge role in

1279
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:26,358
dissolved oxygen capabilities of water

1280
01:03:23,079 --> 01:03:27,839
um so what I did and you can correct

1281
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:29,558
this but essentially I took the

1282
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,400
nematodes out of the fridge I let them

1283
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:35,119
warm up a little bit in the room for a

1284
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:37,920
couple hours I then added some water to

1285
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:39,599
a just a watering can because I just to

1286
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,039
give you an idea I have two 4x4 beds

1287
01:03:39,599 --> 01:03:45,359
that I use for a sort of a test Garden

1288
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:46,799
here at my house um I I filled up a

1289
01:03:45,358 --> 01:03:49,598
watering can a little with a little bit

1290
01:03:46,798 --> 01:03:51,079
of water and then I added the nematodes

1291
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:53,160
stirred them all in added a little more

1292
01:03:51,079 --> 01:03:55,318
water on top um I made sure that water

1293
01:03:53,159 --> 01:03:56,879
was just comfortable maybe it might have

1294
01:03:55,318 --> 01:03:58,159
been a little bit too warm now in

1295
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,358
retrospect I might have been able to go

1296
01:03:58,159 --> 01:04:02,038
a little bit colder but I also didn't

1297
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:04,838
want to pour a bunch of cold water on my

1298
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:06,480
soil knowing that I have plants in there

1299
01:04:04,838 --> 01:04:09,519
that you know you don't want to shock

1300
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:11,318
the plants with cold water either so I

1301
01:04:09,519 --> 01:04:12,798
then applied it took me about five

1302
01:04:11,318 --> 01:04:14,480
minutes to apply my nematodes just

1303
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:15,960
stirring and dumping out making sure to

1304
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:20,000
cover as much of the surface of the soil

1305
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:22,838
as possible and I so I did this last

1306
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:26,559
cycle in the room and I had I knew that

1307
01:04:22,838 --> 01:04:28,679
the the Clones that I had came in with

1308
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:30,519
thrips not a lot but there was some

1309
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,358
damage and the grower who I got them

1310
01:04:30,519 --> 01:04:35,119
from uh pretty much warned me he's like

1311
01:04:32,358 --> 01:04:39,318
oh by the way I did not know but I gave

1312
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:43,200
you thrips so he um so I I I released

1313
01:04:39,318 --> 01:04:46,199
some um some Ro beetles uh I believe

1314
01:04:43,199 --> 01:04:49,239
some strats and then also the uh the

1315
01:04:46,199 --> 01:04:53,000
nematodes and I did not see any thrips

1316
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:55,239
damage throughout that cycle um but in

1317
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,199
regards to nematodes how is that is just

1318
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:58,318
a a real

1319
01:04:56,199 --> 01:05:00,679
basic application method for home

1320
01:04:58,318 --> 01:05:03,159
Growers are there any also are there any

1321
01:05:00,679 --> 01:05:04,598
sprayers that we need to watch out for

1322
01:05:03,159 --> 01:05:06,239
when we do if we were to put it through

1323
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:08,318
a sprayer rather than just the water and

1324
01:05:06,239 --> 01:05:12,000
can method so I just threw a bunch of

1325
01:05:08,318 --> 01:05:15,159
question probably for your uh for your

1326
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:18,719
um homeowner or small grower based

1327
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:21,199
application equipment um you know proba

1328
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:24,199
it it shouldn't be an issue like your

1329
01:05:21,199 --> 01:05:28,399
simple Venturi type um water

1330
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:30,879
displacement sprayer like a um like a

1331
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:33,519
hose end sprayer that's a pretty good

1332
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:36,278
method um for applying beneficial

1333
01:05:33,519 --> 01:05:38,880
nematodes um it's going you know it it's

1334
01:05:36,278 --> 01:05:40,880
a little bit harder to control the

1335
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:44,960
amount that you're applying in that type

1336
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:47,599
of system um so you want to be aware of

1337
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:49,559
that but um that's a good system

1338
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:52,039
basically the the biggest thing to be

1339
01:05:49,559 --> 01:05:54,359
aware of with nematodes temperature

1340
01:05:52,039 --> 01:05:59,559
which we talked about

1341
01:05:54,358 --> 01:06:02,000
um uh if there are filters in the system

1342
01:05:59,559 --> 01:06:04,200
that the nematodes will pass through uh

1343
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:08,199
they tend to get caught up on filters of

1344
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:10,879
50 mesh or finer and so uh during the

1345
01:06:08,199 --> 01:06:13,919
nemid application you want to remove

1346
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:15,240
those filters um or put in a larger

1347
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:17,559
filter

1348
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:21,358
size um so that they don't get caught up

1349
01:06:17,559 --> 01:06:22,960
and Shred uh and also PSI um the

1350
01:06:21,358 --> 01:06:25,639
pressure uh you just don't want to go

1351
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:28,559
over 300 PSI as long as you're below 300

1352
01:06:25,639 --> 01:06:31,239
PS which typically isn't a problem then

1353
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:33,559
um the N Hood should be fine basically

1354
01:06:31,239 --> 01:06:36,519
you know in the system they're subjected

1355
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:39,200
to a lot of pressure and if say it's

1356
01:06:36,519 --> 01:06:43,199
above 300 and then they go through the

1357
01:06:39,199 --> 01:06:46,239
nozzle um and they go from very high to

1358
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:48,159
very low pressure uh that that is is uh

1359
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:51,239
detrimental to them so as long as you're

1360
01:06:48,159 --> 01:06:52,838
below 300 psi should be fine um and I

1361
01:06:51,239 --> 01:06:54,479
would say the last thing is you don't

1362
01:06:52,838 --> 01:06:56,199
want to have like a Mis nozzle on there

1363
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,119
you want to have a nozzle that

1364
01:06:56,199 --> 01:06:59,838
that's large enough that you have um

1365
01:06:58,119 --> 01:07:04,640
since especially since we're applying it

1366
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:08,599
to the soil typically so um uh you want

1367
01:07:04,639 --> 01:07:11,719
to have a larger nozzle on your um your

1368
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:14,920
sprayer so that those NDS can freely

1369
01:07:11,719 --> 01:07:17,078
pass through and get into the soil with

1370
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:18,760
the moisture that you're applying now

1371
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:20,680
what about a onetime pass through like

1372
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:23,839
an impeller pump like a sump pump if I

1373
01:07:20,679 --> 01:07:25,798
had like a 50 gallon garbage can filled

1374
01:07:23,838 --> 01:07:28,119
with water and I added the nitot to that

1375
01:07:25,798 --> 01:07:31,759
and then applied that through a hose-end

1376
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:34,760
sprayer with either a a very

1377
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:36,680
simple you know spray gun on the end of

1378
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:39,240
that hose or even just my thumb and

1379
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:44,000
finger over the end like how how is that

1380
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:46,439
as an option so I actually did a study

1381
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:50,519
uh back in my Becker Underwood days

1382
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:52,159
where I uh did a the difference between

1383
01:07:50,519 --> 01:07:56,719
no

1384
01:07:52,159 --> 01:08:00,358
agitation air irration uh and basically

1385
01:07:56,719 --> 01:08:03,959
the buge pump um so an impeller that is

1386
01:08:00,358 --> 01:08:08,239
swirling the water around and

1387
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:10,639
uh obviously the the the worst option is

1388
01:08:08,239 --> 01:08:14,199
the no agitation because everything

1389
01:08:10,639 --> 01:08:16,439
falls to the bottom um if it takes you a

1390
01:08:14,199 --> 01:08:18,439
while to apply that the nematodes are

1391
01:08:16,439 --> 01:08:20,318
all sinking to the bottom typically your

1392
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:23,358
intake is at the bottom so all of the

1393
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,640
nematodes get applied first and very few

1394
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:30,520
nematodes get applied at the end of the

1395
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:34,000
cycle so you have you'll have um an in a

1396
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:36,400
a bad distribution of the nematodes in

1397
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,479
the grow or wherever it is that you're

1398
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:39,920
applying those

1399
01:08:37,479 --> 01:08:42,358
nematodes so that's that's the worst

1400
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:46,319
option so if if it's the difference

1401
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:49,960
between having agitation and not have

1402
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:52,239
agitation uh so with the bilge pump and

1403
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:57,439
the irration obviously irration was

1404
01:08:52,238 --> 01:08:57,439
better and you had a much longer

1405
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:05,359
um uh the the nematode stayed viable in

1406
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:08,000
that solution for I think it was an

1407
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:10,880
eight hour period that I did the test

1408
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:13,039
and I was doing um I was taking samples

1409
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,199
at the top of the solution every hour

1410
01:09:13,039 --> 01:09:17,920
for eight

1411
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:20,960
hours so with the BGE pump um and this

1412
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:22,079
was in a five gallon bucket um it did a

1413
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:24,719
really great job of keeping the

1414
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:27,238
nematodes in solution and within that

1415
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:30,798
first four hours the nematodes still

1416
01:09:27,238 --> 01:09:33,599
looked good but that BGE pump um that

1417
01:09:30,798 --> 01:09:35,439
you put into this into that you know in

1418
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,239
my case it was a five gallon bucket it

1419
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:44,599
is working and that BGE pump will start

1420
01:09:39,238 --> 01:09:47,798
to heat up the water over time so it I

1421
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:51,079
in the study that I did in a five gallon

1422
01:09:47,798 --> 01:09:52,640
bucket uh the recommendation was 4 hours

1423
01:09:51,079 --> 01:09:56,519
or less so if you can get those

1424
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:59,119
nematodes applied within 4 hours um

1425
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,360
using that buge pump um the nematode

1426
01:09:59,119 --> 01:10:05,000
should stay viable assuming that the

1427
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:08,639
water temperature is generally staying

1428
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:13,840
cool um can we throw a number to

1429
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:16,520
quantify cool though like uh 60

1430
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:18,800
65 below that what what are you thinking

1431
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:20,719
in terms of

1432
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:22,199
temperature top head great great

1433
01:10:20,719 --> 01:10:23,880
question

1434
01:10:22,198 --> 01:10:28,599
and

1435
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:33,000
uh let me I got oh wait no it's over

1436
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:36,440
here so uh I would I would guess around

1437
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:40,000
60° would be a good Fahrenheit would be

1438
01:10:36,439 --> 01:10:42,000
a good temperature range but um what

1439
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:44,439
what are your thoughts on

1440
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:48,279
that

1441
01:10:44,439 --> 01:10:51,599
so nematodes are going to be happiest uh

1442
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:58,920
in the environment um their ideal range

1443
01:10:51,600 --> 01:11:00,840
is 54 to 86 Dees fhe and and so if once

1444
01:10:58,920 --> 01:11:05,760
you sort

1445
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:09,159
of if you're heating up that water

1446
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:13,640
slowly um and not say beating them over

1447
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:16,279
the head with the um you know with an

1448
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:17,400
impeller it it's it's probably going to

1449
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:20,679
be

1450
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:24,198
okay um and there's an easy way to check

1451
01:11:20,679 --> 01:11:27,359
on that uh which is pull the nematodes

1452
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:30,359
out uh take a sample of the solution and

1453
01:11:27,359 --> 01:11:34,839
look at the nematodes um with a a hand

1454
01:11:30,359 --> 01:11:36,880
lens or more or or better a a dissecting

1455
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:39,319
microscope if the nematodes are still

1456
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:41,800
squiggling around um it's a pretty

1457
01:11:39,319 --> 01:11:44,319
pretty easy way to tell um if they're

1458
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:47,600
viable or not and if they're not they're

1459
01:11:44,319 --> 01:11:52,000
basically pencils if you see a bunch of

1460
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:55,719
pencils uh bad things have happened so

1461
01:11:52,000 --> 01:11:58,960
um and that's what I saw with my study

1462
01:11:55,719 --> 01:12:02,000
when it got past that 4our Mark in the

1463
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:05,399
buge pump I also measured temperature um

1464
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,960
I do have a document on this and um I

1465
01:12:05,399 --> 01:12:09,359
would be happy to share that with you as

1466
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:12,039
well showing the pictures um of the

1467
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:14,519
nematodes and and whatnot um from this

1468
01:12:12,039 --> 01:12:16,960
test and so I'll get that to you but

1469
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:20,480
basically um after that 4-Hour Mark the

1470
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:23,840
nematodes started going to pencils and

1471
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:27,839
so our recommendation currently H is um

1472
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:32,719
under four hours for a build um impeller

1473
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:35,880
type pump um sometimes with irration by

1474
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:38,239
itself it's it sometimes depending um

1475
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,319
let's say you just have a single Stone

1476
01:12:38,238 --> 01:12:42,238
in a five gallon bucket and that stone

1477
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:44,399
isn't very big it's you're giving them

1478
01:12:42,238 --> 01:12:48,119
oxygen but you're not necessarily

1479
01:12:44,399 --> 01:12:52,039
getting good agitation so with the dram

1480
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:55,639
bucket uh they have both swirling motion

1481
01:12:52,039 --> 01:12:58,479
uh as well as irration so in your

1482
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:03,319
particular operation you'll just have to

1483
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:06,879
do some testing of your particular setup

1484
01:13:03,319 --> 01:13:09,759
to see if the nematodes are surviving

1485
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:12,239
that um application and if you start to

1486
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:18,079
see pencils then you know start

1487
01:13:12,238 --> 01:13:20,479
switching up um apply it faster uh uh um

1488
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:22,840
apply with you know cooler water to to

1489
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:25,079
begin with um that sort of thing but you

1490
01:13:22,840 --> 01:13:27,679
can start to troubleshoot and figure

1491
01:13:25,079 --> 01:13:30,319
fure out ways that work best for

1492
01:13:27,679 --> 01:13:32,239
you great great so it sounds like a

1493
01:13:30,319 --> 01:13:34,439
onetime pass through an impeller if we

1494
01:13:32,238 --> 01:13:36,399
were to use it to do an application

1495
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:38,198
should in theory be fine but we could

1496
01:13:36,399 --> 01:13:40,839
test it by just taking a look at the

1497
01:13:38,198 --> 01:13:42,238
nematodes on the other end that's that's

1498
01:13:40,840 --> 01:13:43,920
great correct well we've already been

1499
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:45,279
talking for a while I didn't like I said

1500
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,440
we didn't even get to the I really

1501
01:13:45,279 --> 01:13:49,158
wanted to talk about EPA shield and sort

1502
01:13:47,439 --> 01:13:51,399
of what you're seeing in big issues on

1503
01:13:49,158 --> 01:13:53,559
Pest Management or pathogen side for in

1504
01:13:51,399 --> 01:13:56,238
cannabis so I I would love to get you

1505
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:59,000
back on to talk about those topics

1506
01:13:56,238 --> 01:14:02,000
uh sometime here

1507
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:04,679
soon I would love to come back I know we

1508
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:08,760
didn't even get to talk about oils which

1509
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:11,359
I think was our main goal other than

1510
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:12,880
talking about nematodes and uh enop

1511
01:14:11,359 --> 01:14:16,679
pathogenic fungus which I think we

1512
01:14:12,880 --> 01:14:19,079
covered uh quite well and um so if you

1513
01:14:16,679 --> 01:14:21,600
wanted to to have me back I would be

1514
01:14:19,079 --> 01:14:23,559
happy to come back and talk about some

1515
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:26,560
of the differences between you know

1516
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:29,480
Horticultural mineral oils versus the

1517
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,600
essential oilbased products the 25 BS

1518
01:14:29,479 --> 01:14:35,399
the difference between a 25b product and

1519
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:38,400
an EPA product um all that good stuff um

1520
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:40,638
so Chad I would I would uh I would love

1521
01:14:38,399 --> 01:14:42,238
that if you wanted to have me back all

1522
