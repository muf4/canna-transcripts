welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,949
science podcast

4

I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:27,118
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,310
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:31,018
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:33,089
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:31,018 --> 00:00:34,530
share their wisdom and knowledge I want

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,500
to warn listeners that today's podcast

11
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,149
is not about cultivation I do have some

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,128
great guests lined up soon for more

13
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:43,140
interviews on growing but today I want

14
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:45,869
to discuss another important topic for

15
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:48,030
anyone growing cannabis as a business or

16
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,619
working in the cannabis industry you

17
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,689
know that having a great product or

18
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,439
growing top-shelf cannabis is only half

19
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:54,299
the story

20
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:55,890
the other half is shaping your message

21
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:58,769
in a way to effectively reach your

22
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:00,390
audience on that note I had the pleasure

23
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,699
today of interviewing my good friend

39
00:01:33,269 --> 00:01:37,500
not to put myself in that category but I

40
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:39,719
did have the honour of speaking at the

41
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:42,239
Vimy event and that video on living soil

42

since 2013 has been helping cannabis

47
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:54,359
entrepreneurs bring their products to

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:56,129
market we are jumping back in with the

49
00:01:54,359 --> 00:01:57,959
second half of my interview with Shango

50
00:01:56,129 --> 00:02:01,170
we're in the middle of a discussion on

51
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:04,699
branding authenticity and creating a

52
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,700
message in your marketing

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,899
yeah for sure and I actually thought

54
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,090
kind of a like I guess like a TED talk

55
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:15,759
kind of thing at the at the first green

56
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,520
flower entrepreneurs summit about this

57
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,679
and and distilling that 20 minute talk

58
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:26,080
down to like a thumbnail for for today

59
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:29,730
the key I think is to not put up a

60
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:33,370
plastic version of what your company is

61
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:36,699
like who you are ideally instead

62
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:40,209
actually be yourself authentically on

63
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:42,399
your Instagram so so again referring

64
00:02:40,209 --> 00:02:45,610
back to Jeremy you know Jeremy sharing

65
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,189
that his that his I don't know if it's

66
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,550
wife or girlfriend but his partner was

67
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:54,609
going in for the the hip surgery it

68
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:57,910
allowed the the customer base to be

69
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,540
supportive of him and throw good vibes

70
00:02:57,909 --> 00:03:04,930
to her and also he's sharing right and

71
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:06,819
so what what I always tell folks is when

72
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,189
they're developing their social media if

73
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:11,500
your company gets a new van take a

74
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:13,750
picture of the van and put it on your

75
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,150
social media and talk about how proud

76
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:18,099
you are of your new damn van especially

77
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:20,739
if it's got some artwork on it because

78
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:22,870
for a small business buying a van is a

79
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,530
significant purchase and something to be

80
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:29,860
proud of if there is an office dog right

81
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,419
or a farm dog you know have the dog show

82
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:34,150
up occasionally in your social media

83
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:36,879
because your followers will get into

84
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:38,439
relationship with the dog and like you

85
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,299
know mmm just about everybody loves

86
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:43,500
animals right so animals are an easy way

87
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:46,959
to go if somebody's got a birthday party

88
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,519
at work and and and maybe you guys all

89
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,709
have barbecue sandwiches or maybe

90
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:52,870
there's even a birthday cake or whatever

91
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:54,099
you get together at lunchtime and you

92
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:56,680
give a little celebration for that

93
00:03:54,099 --> 00:03:59,229
coworker take a picture of everybody

94
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,110
smiling on the team and put that on your

95
00:03:59,229 --> 00:04:04,449
on your Instagram or your you know your

96
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:07,420
social media of choice the point of this

97
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,789
is to is to you know the corporations

98
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:12,488
are not doing this like the the the the

99
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:14,128
the large corporate agriculture

100
00:04:12,489 --> 00:04:18,410
companies that are coming in

101
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:20,719
everything is so polished and so

102
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:24,830
normal that there's nothing for us to

103
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:27,620
lean into and and to love whereas if you

104
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:30,439
do all of this human stuff on your

105
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,750
social media people can are more likely

106
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,610
to embrace you and the other thing that

107
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,019
you said about messaging making sure you

108
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:37,879
think about your messaging is really

109
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:40,549
important to right and I'm gonna I'm

110
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,459
gonna use an extreme example which is

111
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:47,600
advanced nutrients right now you know I

112
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:50,060
don't take money from synthetic bottled

113
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,189
folks like that on my show because it's

114
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,490
it's not within my values right I'm a

115
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:57,589
I'm a living soil guy and and I love

116
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,139
talking about regenerative agriculture

117
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,669
with my guests you know it's not all

118
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:04,339
that but you know that's that's mostly

119
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:06,170
over but but but Big Mike you know the

120
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:08,989
the the guy behind advanced nutrients

121
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:12,860
his whole thing is like you know exotic

122
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,889
yachts and helicopters and TNA and

123
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:19,069
parties in LA with bikinis and like it

124
00:05:15,889 --> 00:05:22,519
is it is a side of cannabis that I

125
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:25,909
absolutely do not embrace but that is a

126
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:30,139
dude who knows what his message is right

127
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:32,450
and those of us who don't like the

128
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:34,909
sexual objectification of women to sell

129
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,110
cannabis we know that we have a

130
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,570
different message

131
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,910
the key point I'm trying to make is know

132
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:43,579
where you are with your message and

133
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:45,590
stand up for your own values whatever

134
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:48,859
they are even if their values that other

135
00:05:45,589 --> 00:05:51,049
people you know aren't going to embrace

136
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:53,300
be true to yourself and it will come

137
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,009
through your message and the like we

138
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,530
were talking about thin slicing before

139
00:05:55,009 --> 00:06:00,019
you'll find your market you know they're

140
00:05:57,529 --> 00:06:02,299
they're pretty much any value that you

141
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:06,259
have there are going to be other people

142
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:08,870
who have that value as well and and they

143
00:06:06,259 --> 00:06:12,019
will start to follow your brand those

144
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:13,939
are all great points you had also

145
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:17,060
mentioned a couple other companies you

146
00:06:13,939 --> 00:06:18,649
wanted to talk about as examples did you

147
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:21,230
want to touch on them I know mammoth pea

148
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:23,359
was one that you had mentioned yeah so

149
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,300
so yeah mammoth pea is another good one

150
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,250
the reason why I wanted to mention

151
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:31,819
mammoth pea which is a product from

152
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:34,310
mammoth microbes out of Colorado is they

153
00:06:31,819 --> 00:06:37,279
did a couple really good things early on

154
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:40,850
with their brand so so number one you

155
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:42,319
know a lot of people they set up you

156
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,910
know they've got their product idea

157
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,129
whatever it is and then they give it to

158
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:48,260
some of their friends and their friends

159
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:50,689
come back and say oh yeah I loved your

160
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:52,610
product and and it's like stacking the

161
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:55,269
deck with your focus group right if you

162
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,370
only let your friends trial your product

163
00:06:55,269 --> 00:07:01,430
you're not getting even answers because

164
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,689
they want to they want to be supportive

165
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,250
of you and they want you to succeed and

166
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,230
they probably want you to like them

167
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:08,180
right and so you're not getting really

168
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:09,439
clean answers from your immediate peer

169
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,600
group I mean they're they're a great

170
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:14,149
place to start sure but what mammoths be

171
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,689
did or what mammoth microbes did is is

172
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:19,519
before they went to market they took

173
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:21,560
their mammoth P product and you know

174
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:23,839
they trialed it locally with some of

175
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,990
their friends but then they just spread

176
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:28,399
it out all over Colorado to people that

177
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:30,379
they knew people that they didn't know

178
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:33,139
they gave out samples all over the place

179
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:35,120
and and they said all right everybody

180
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,189
like let's hear what you really have got

181
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,730
to say about our product and so it was

182
00:07:37,189 --> 00:07:42,920
trialed all through Colorado and they

183
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:45,020
got some they got some you know feedback

184
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,030
from people like they didn't understand

185
00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:49,399
how to use the product or or they were

186
00:07:47,029 --> 00:07:51,109
concerned about the coloration but but

187
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:53,750
generally across the board people are

188
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:58,400
all like this is a damn good product

189
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:00,439
that makes my plants thrive more and and

190
00:07:58,399 --> 00:08:04,849
I want to use it again and so it was

191
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:07,459
after they gathered that R&amp;D over a

192
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:09,920
broad group of people who are not

193
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:12,079
necessarily their friends it was with

194
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:15,020
that confidence that they then put their

195
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:18,649
next level of investment in and started

196
00:08:15,019 --> 00:08:20,299
to push out now nationally one of the

197
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:22,310
interesting things about mammoth

198
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,530
microbes is you know while we all expect

199
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,660
though they will be putting out more

200
00:08:24,529 --> 00:08:31,069
products right because mammoth pee is

201
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:33,950
just their flagship product their big

202
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:36,740
deal was not to grow into a large

203
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,950
company meaning we employ all of these

204
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,990
people or to say that they're a large

205
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,190
company because they have all this

206
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:48,009
different product they are a big company

207
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:51,040
they are all around the world there in

208
00:08:48,009 --> 00:08:53,350
hydro shops in every state they're on

209
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:57,009
Amazon you can find that product

210
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:59,980
everywhere in all the major growing

211
00:08:57,009 --> 00:09:02,580
countries and and it was it's through

212
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:06,600
their reach of their sales reach of

213
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:09,100
availability that makes them this this

214
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,659
significant company anyway and I think

215
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,389
that's great that's that's a really

216
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:15,610
thoughtful way to expand and now when

217
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:17,199
they eventually do bring another product

218
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:20,710
to market they've already got all those

219
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,310
channels made so so I give mammoth

220
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:27,400
microbes you know a thumbs up both for

221
00:09:23,309 --> 00:09:31,869
you know growing and an in an inventive

222
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:33,610
and metered way and then also for being

223
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:35,740
smart enough to focus group their

224
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,960
product with people who aren't friends

225
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:40,389
before going before actually going to

226
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:43,030
the market yeah I'm a little bit on the

227
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:44,590
fence in regards to samples now in this

228
00:09:43,029 --> 00:09:48,189
case I totally agree with you it worked

229
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:49,660
really well for mammoth P but my concern

230
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:52,050
is that when people get things for free

231
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:54,339
they tend to not value them as much and

232
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:55,539
that's something I found with samples

233
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:57,100
like how many times have you come back

234
00:09:55,539 --> 00:09:59,349
from a trade show with all these samples

235
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,080
of all these products and you don't end

236
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,290
up even using them which has a cost to

237
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:07,120
the business that provided them to you

238
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:08,679
or you you think maybe a little less of

239
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,310
them psychologically because they were

240
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:13,719
free yes and to take that one step

241
00:10:12,309 --> 00:10:16,029
further it's kind of interesting right

242
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,940
because I was specifically talking about

243
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,379
like at the focus group stage of it

244
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,960
right so that they could get RNG

245
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:26,080
feedback mammoth microbes actually or

246
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:29,440
mammoth mammoth microbes now gives away

247
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,910
far fewer samples of mammoth pee than

248
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,070
they did at the beginning as a matter of

249
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:34,929
fact I recently recently reached out to

250
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,160
them for an event I said I'll send

251
00:10:34,929 --> 00:10:38,409
samples and they're like yeah we don't

252
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:41,529
do that anymore like oh alright but in

253
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:43,689
the early days they did in in Colorado

254
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,740
and then and then nationally just

255
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:48,010
because they were trying to get the

256
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:50,470
feedback so I agree with you that when

257
00:10:48,009 --> 00:10:52,450
I'm you know honestly I go to enough

258
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,160
trade shows now that I don't usually

259
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,900
take samples of stuff because then I

260
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:58,449
have to carry that crap home with me and

261
00:10:55,899 --> 00:11:00,789
so I will i'll grab

262
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:03,790
ampuls if they are something that I'm

263
00:11:00,789 --> 00:11:06,819
already gonna be interested in but you

264
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:09,250
know in in 2015 I would just take

265
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,050
everything right it was like you know

266
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,970
take it all and put it in my bag and

267
00:11:11,049 --> 00:11:17,949
have this heavy bag that I had to take

268
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:19,870
home but yeah I would say that you want

269
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:22,629
to make sure that your money is well

270
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:24,580
spent if it's your company and you are

271
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:26,529
deciding whether or not to give samples

272
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,850
you just got to make sure that you think

273
00:11:26,529 --> 00:11:30,279
that it's part of your business model

274
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:33,100
because because I I do agree and you

275
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:35,769
know so often the sample sizes are so

276
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,659
small that you're not gonna really be

277
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:40,449
able to tell very much from it you know

278
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:42,370
if you get a sample for an A+ be kind of

279
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,420
thing because you run hydro you know

280
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:47,289
they're probably not gonna give you

281
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:53,019
enough of it to really know where as a

282
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:54,849
small package of compost tea right that

283
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,850
that I might be able to make I don't

284
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,340
know ten five-gallon buckets out of well

285
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:02,200
that's plenty for a home grower and

286
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:05,170
that's probably enough for a commercial

287
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:07,000
grower to run a test on on a subset of

288
00:12:05,169 --> 00:12:09,509
their plants so I really think it

289
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,919
depends on the nature of the product

290
00:12:09,509 --> 00:12:14,230
sure in the cost of the entry into the

291
00:12:11,919 --> 00:12:16,120
market so for example you use compost

292
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,070
tea my challenge there was well if they

293
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,019
didn't have a good Brewer or they didn't

294
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:22,780
have our brewer and I'm sending them a

295
00:12:20,019 --> 00:12:24,279
compost tea sample they're probably not

296
00:12:22,779 --> 00:12:27,399
gonna get the results that I would want

297
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:29,049
them to get and yet you know a two or

298
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:30,879
three hundred dollar brewing system is

299
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:33,009
not something I can sample out due to

300
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:34,419
the cost of the system so there are

301
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:36,429
definitely some challenges around that

302
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:39,429
see ya and on the cost of your product

303
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:42,579
and I think that speaks a lot to the

304
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:45,609
problem with compost tea as a product

305
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:49,120
category is that in my experience almost

306
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:52,000
nobody uses it right you know there's

307
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,759
this new new to me anyway delineation

308
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,269
that I learned from from column at

309
00:12:54,759 --> 00:13:00,159
Malibu compost and he said they break

310
00:12:58,269 --> 00:13:06,519
their cat they're their products into

311
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:09,969
two categories yeah compost tea which is

312
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:12,220
brewed and then compost extract which is

313
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:15,610
soaked out of

314
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:18,610
teabag into the water and so one you

315
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,680
actually use a brewer and your aerating

316
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:22,930
it and it's bubbling up and in the other

317
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:24,939
one you're just throwing it in still

318
00:13:22,929 --> 00:13:26,559
water you know if you happen to have an

319
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:29,140
aquarium pump there go ahead and bubble

320
00:13:26,559 --> 00:13:31,719
it if you want but but it's you know it

321
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:33,460
is just supposed to soak out of the

322
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,889
package it's not supposed to actually be

323
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:39,160
brewed what I find with especially with

324
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:41,529
home growers is they either don't have

325
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:43,750
the know-how or don't have the brewer

326
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,029
themselves and so people are taking

327
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:50,080
compost teas that are designed to be

328
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:52,299
brewed and using it as a compost extract

329
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:56,170
and just soaking it in water and using

330
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:58,089
it and you know it doesn't you know it

331
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:59,740
does it doesn't hurt the plant but it

332
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,649
sure doesn't give you the benefits that

333
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:03,940
the product is designed to give for sure

334
00:14:02,649 --> 00:14:06,189
and there's some challenges around

335
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,990
compost extracts but I don't want to I

336
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:13,210
don't want get off the branding thing we

337
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:14,440
can talk about that another but yeah you

338
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,450
know I totally agree what you're saying

339
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,550
regarding samples and I think it's

340
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,620
interesting that mammoth pee is now sort

341
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:22,750
of slowed down that process now that the

342
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:25,509
the product is out there on the market

343
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,789
that seems really strategic to me so I

344
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,259
think that's worth highlighting yeah and

345
00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:31,120
while we're at it well well while I'm

346
00:14:29,259 --> 00:14:35,710
talking about stuff that Colin told me

347
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,179
in in an interview back a while go he

348
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:38,980
also said that you know as far as

349
00:14:37,179 --> 00:14:42,309
setting up a company goes there

350
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:44,460
retailers ask them to stop giving out so

351
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:46,929
many samples because they were they were

352
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:48,820
being starting to be experienced as a

353
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:51,399
competitor and I think that's an

354
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:53,710
important thing that that mammoth

355
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:55,929
microbes was willing to listen to

356
00:14:53,710 --> 00:15:01,509
feedback from their hydro store

357
00:14:55,929 --> 00:15:03,519
retailers take it to heart and to excuse

358
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:05,830
me and to and to work with them to meet

359
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,799
their needs and you know a lot of the

360
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:11,950
lot of larger you know corporate

361
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,529
nutrition companies they don't have that

362
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:19,150
relationship with their with their

363
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:20,740
retail stores yeah they're really the

364
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:22,929
key is how do you get the samples into

365
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,000
the hands of the people that you want to

366
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:27,559
have the product influencers

367
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,389
you work but I think you have to be very

368
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,539
clear on what an influencer is like for

369
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:34,639
example if the rock was trying if I

370
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:36,919
hired the rock to sell compost tea it's

371
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,809
not going to increase my profits because

372
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:40,219
no one believes that the rock knows

373
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:42,199
anything about gardening you know like

374
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,310
it has to fit so how do we get the

375
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,770
product and people who are actually

376
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:47,839
gonna use the product and talk about it

377
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:49,610
cuz we're too mouth marketing is by far

378
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,990
hands down been research to be the most

379
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:53,060
effective form of marketing you're gonna

380
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:54,500
trust your buddy who's a grower a lot

381
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:57,289
more than you would some random person

382
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,299
even if they're a celebrity so how do we

383
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,459
get the product into their hands and I

384
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:02,899
thought this was really interesting

385
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,100
Jonah Berger and contagious I know I

386
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:06,139
keep talking about this book but it's

387
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,820
cuz I'm listening to it for a third time

388
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:10,399
right now just because I love it so much

389
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:13,670
and one of the things he talks about is

390
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,129
how he gets books all the time from you

391
00:16:13,669 --> 00:16:17,659
know authors on on marketing and on

392
00:16:16,129 --> 00:16:21,799
branding and what makes a product stick

393
00:16:17,659 --> 00:16:23,959
and this particular book actually sent

394
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:26,149
him two or three copies of the book now

395
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,519
no person needs two or three copies of

396
00:16:26,149 --> 00:16:30,769
the same book but in that package it

397
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:33,470
said hey here's a copy of our book for

398
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:35,149
you if you like it when you pass it on

399
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:38,570
to two or three of your friends who you

400
00:16:35,149 --> 00:16:41,389
also think would like this book so he's

401
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:44,240
using or that this particular book

402
00:16:41,389 --> 00:16:47,029
company was using him as a marketing

403
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:49,070
tool he's an influencer he's gonna know

404
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:51,500
other influencers if he likes my book

405
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:53,450
he's gonna share it with these other

406
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,009
people and I just thought that was

407
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:56,960
brilliant as a way of getting your

408
00:16:55,009 --> 00:16:58,879
product out there now it doesn't work

409
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,050
quite as well with you know a fertilizer

410
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:03,139
or a product like that because people

411
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:04,849
are more likely to just use both samples

412
00:17:03,139 --> 00:17:07,430
for example but it is an interesting

413
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:10,458
take on this idea of word-of-mouth

414
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,140
marketing yeah and you know what now

415
00:17:10,459 --> 00:17:14,750
that you've mentioned that example I

416
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:16,819
actually think that I did listen to the

417
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:19,068
contagious books if I remember correctly

418
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:22,220
it's about viral marketing and things

419
00:17:19,068 --> 00:17:24,139
that go viral yes and and I it's been a

420
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,279
while I don't I don't think it's I don't

421
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,350
think you like that book just came out

422
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:30,680
but I do think I listen to it because

423
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,099
I've amilia with that example and you're

424
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,710
right

425
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:35,359
that particular one is brilliant and I

426
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:39,740
and I like your questioning of what an

427
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:42,349
influencer really is because

428
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:45,200
being an influencer is more than just

429
00:17:42,349 --> 00:17:48,399
having an X number of followers right

430
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,990
certainly having a lot of eyes on you

431
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,420
certainly increases your likelihood of

432
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:56,539
being an influencer but there are people

433
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:58,820
that I follow who have got you know

434
00:17:56,539 --> 00:18:01,220
twenty or forty thousand followers or

435
00:17:58,819 --> 00:18:03,950
more who I would never take their advice

436
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:06,319
on what to buy for my plants I just

437
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,200
think they're funny right and so

438
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:11,299
especially with the popularity of

439
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:14,450
cannabis memes right so so we probably

440
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:17,779
most of us are following one you know

441
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:20,029
meme maker or another but it doesn't

442
00:18:17,779 --> 00:18:22,160
mean that that just because they've got

443
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:26,359
all these followers that I would want

444
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:27,800
them to you know you know that I would

445
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:30,289
want to pay them for some product I was

446
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:33,349
bringing the market I would want to

447
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:37,069
choose an influencer that people respect

448
00:18:33,349 --> 00:18:39,709
for using good products and then and

449
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:41,299
then have them say you know they curated

450
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:43,850
this product and they like it because

451
00:18:41,299 --> 00:18:45,619
they you know they used it and it worked

452
00:18:43,849 --> 00:18:47,839
for them so you know choose your choose

453
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:49,969
your influencers carefully because I

454
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:53,178
think that that that word is is thrown

455
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,110
around way too way too much yeah and one

456
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:56,590
thing I wanted to mention again

457
00:18:54,109 --> 00:18:59,058
regarding grow coffee so you have this

458
00:18:56,589 --> 00:19:01,399
you have this Facebook group called

459
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:02,928
probiotic farmers Alliance I think is

460
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,030
what the name of it is right now it

461
00:19:02,929 --> 00:19:06,980
started as a beta tester group but it's

462
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:09,769
grown to twenty or thirty thousand

463
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:12,860
members that Alan was one of the

464
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,940
founders of and one of the things that

465
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:16,549
they talked about in the book is how

466
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,340
being part of a community is so

467
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:20,720
important so what I find most times is

468
00:19:19,339 --> 00:19:22,909
when people ask what's the best book

469
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,000
Hashi or you know what should I be using

470
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:29,929
in my garden Alan's not the one posting

471
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,819
about grow Kashi it's you know thirty or

472
00:19:29,929 --> 00:19:34,070
forty other people in that group that

473
00:19:31,819 --> 00:19:35,779
feel part of this probiotic community

474
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,609
that are doing probiotic growing so

475
00:19:35,779 --> 00:19:39,980
you've created this term probiotic

476
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:42,079
farming and you've created a sense of

477
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,150
community around that term and then

478
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:45,609
people are just so excited to share that

479
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,649
information

480
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:49,058
and people so people like to feel like

481
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:51,788
they're they have a secret like they're

482
00:19:49,058 --> 00:19:53,589
part of a community I love this story I

483
00:19:51,788 --> 00:19:55,269
thought this was so fascinating so in

484
00:19:53,589 --> 00:19:56,918
New York there's this there's this

485
00:19:55,269 --> 00:19:59,558
hotdog store where you can go into any

486
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:01,210
time and get any type of hotdog you know

487
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:02,528
anything from a breakfast dog to an old

488
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:04,659
Chicago dog it's just this little tiny

489
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:08,109
hotdog store but in the back of the

490
00:20:04,659 --> 00:20:10,749
hotdog store there's this old-fashioned

491
00:20:08,109 --> 00:20:12,368
bright red telephone booth

492
00:20:10,749 --> 00:20:15,100
and if you were to walk into that

493
00:20:12,368 --> 00:20:17,528
telephone booth and you know dial the

494
00:20:15,099 --> 00:20:19,358
number to someone would pick up the

495
00:20:17,528 --> 00:20:21,579
phone on the other line and say do you

496
00:20:19,358 --> 00:20:22,749
have a reservation and you know you're

497
00:20:21,579 --> 00:20:25,019
in the back of a hotdog booth you have

498
00:20:22,749 --> 00:20:27,548
no idea what they're talking about and

499
00:20:25,019 --> 00:20:29,888
turns out what they did was they created

500
00:20:27,548 --> 00:20:33,730
this bar where the only access is

501
00:20:29,888 --> 00:20:35,199
through this red telephone booth and the

502
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:36,999
name of the bar is called please don't

503
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,470
tell and it's this high end cocktail bar

504
00:20:36,999 --> 00:20:40,929
and it's super hard to get reservations

505
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:43,028
or at least it was at the time of you

506
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:45,909
know Jonah Berger writing this book but

507
00:20:43,028 --> 00:20:47,589
it it did I broke every rule of

508
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:49,028
marketing in the sense that it wasn't

509
00:20:47,589 --> 00:20:50,470
letting people know where they were but

510
00:20:49,028 --> 00:20:52,239
what it did was it created a sense of

511
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,829
community and it created a sense of a

512
00:20:52,239 --> 00:20:54,850
secret like well the first the first

513
00:20:53,829 --> 00:20:57,249
thing you want to do when you hear a

514
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:58,599
secret is you want to share it and I

515
00:20:57,249 --> 00:21:00,970
thought that was really interesting and

516
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:02,949
I see aspects of that with this Facebook

517
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:04,629
group in the sense that you know it's a

518
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:06,308
private group you have to ask to join

519
00:21:04,628 --> 00:21:08,618
once you're a part of that community

520
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:10,239
that community sort of functions and

521
00:21:08,618 --> 00:21:13,538
monitors itself but then it also

522
00:21:10,239 --> 00:21:15,730
promotes you know certain products of

523
00:21:13,538 --> 00:21:19,028
which you know grow coffee is one of the

524
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,679
primary ones yeah I think that makes a

525
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:24,970
lot of sense and I'm glad that you

526
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:26,320
shared that that's that that that phone

527
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:28,329
booth story with me because I forgot

528
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:30,759
that too and and that really is they're

529
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,849
doing it the opposite way you know as a

530
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:36,159
form of guerilla marketing and and and

531
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:37,748
really that's preserving one of the

532
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,129
values that they offer their customers

533
00:21:37,749 --> 00:21:42,009
one of the things they offer their

534
00:21:39,128 --> 00:21:44,108
customers is being elite and that

535
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,548
they're in the know and that this is not

536
00:21:44,108 --> 00:21:49,210
something that just anybody knows about

537
00:21:45,548 --> 00:21:52,118
and yeah that's actually that's really

538
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,579
fun the thing another thing about Alan

539
00:21:52,118 --> 00:21:56,618
and your example that that while he

540
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:58,599
certainly teaches about grow Kashi

541
00:21:56,618 --> 00:22:02,109
you're right that its usual

542
00:21:58,599 --> 00:22:04,599
one of his fans that is teaching you

543
00:22:02,109 --> 00:22:07,329
know in whatever thread on how to how to

544
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:08,619
use the grow Kashi and and I think that

545
00:22:07,329 --> 00:22:13,240
goes back to what we were saying earlier

546
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:15,729
about being authentic in your messaging

547
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:18,429
right because Allen's got people who

548
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,990
just like him as a human right that you

549
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:21,519
know he's an entrepreneur and he's got

550
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,259
his hustle and he's trying to support

551
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:25,388
himself to like you know all of us

552
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:28,450
entrepreneurs are but he's doing it in a

553
00:22:25,388 --> 00:22:31,719
way that's honorable right and and you

554
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:33,940
know the show that you so he was on my

555
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:37,839
podcast and it was one of the least

556
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:40,210
marketing related shows I've ever had

557
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:43,750
like he was he was talking about you

558
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:47,319
know Roman history and the use of you

559
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:49,450
know lactobacillus acid to calm soldiers

560
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:51,730
who were coming back from war and I'm

561
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:54,399
like oh my god this is so wildly

562
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:57,069
interesting and we're only tangentially

563
00:22:54,398 --> 00:22:58,928
even talking about his product but I get

564
00:22:57,069 --> 00:23:00,849
people who talk about that episode all

565
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:04,450
the time like oh my god this is such an

566
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:06,548
epic you know historical science episode

567
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,798
it's it's very just very interesting and

568
00:23:06,548 --> 00:23:12,038
I think that I think that Pete creates

569
00:23:08,798 --> 00:23:14,679
in him a following that want to see him

570
00:23:12,038 --> 00:23:16,388
succeed and who are excited by the

571
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,580
product so they're happy to they're

572
00:23:16,388 --> 00:23:21,128
happy to jump in yeah that's a great

573
00:23:18,579 --> 00:23:23,349
point you know that's I actually hear

574
00:23:21,128 --> 00:23:26,079
that about you too tad you know you know

575
00:23:23,349 --> 00:23:27,878
being a podcast guy I often get people

576
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:28,960
coming to me because they want to tell

577
00:23:27,878 --> 00:23:31,689
me about what their other favorite

578
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:35,079
podcasts are and you know it is it is

579
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:37,600
not at all uncommon for me to have

580
00:23:35,079 --> 00:23:42,069
people talk to me about you and your

581
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:43,480
show or or a a recent episode because

582
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,859
and they talk about you just like

583
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,569
they're you're you're one of their

584
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:47,918
friends right they've never met you and

585
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,418
they've you know they've maybe they've

586
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:54,129
never even been to Washington where we

587
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:56,649
both live but but they feel like they

588
00:23:54,128 --> 00:23:59,528
know you because you share enough about

589
00:23:56,648 --> 00:24:01,628
yourself especially on your your Jeff

590
00:23:59,528 --> 00:24:04,179
flow in Fell's you're the first one that

591
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:06,398
you did with Jeff you know cuz you and

592
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:08,320
Jeff Loen fellows are old family friends

593
00:24:06,398 --> 00:24:10,989
right and I learned I learned a lot

594
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:11,558
about you and your dad and your family

595
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,599
history

596
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:14,859
from listening to that interview which

597
00:24:13,599 --> 00:24:17,949
even though you and I were already

598
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:19,898
friends it made me feel more familiar

599
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,909
and friendly with you because like I'm

600
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:24,359
like hearing you talk about old family

601
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:27,460
stuff with Jeff lone fells I felt like

602
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:29,740
like I was overhearing an intimate

603
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:33,788
conversation right amongst friends and

604
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:36,399
so it increased my my connection with

605
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:39,069
you and for anybody who is launching a

606
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:42,278
new company you want to engender that

607
00:24:39,069 --> 00:24:45,819
kind of embrace from your target

608
00:24:42,278 --> 00:24:47,798
audience so that they they are

609
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:49,538
interested in your product they read

610
00:24:47,798 --> 00:24:51,009
more about your product hopefully they

611
00:24:49,538 --> 00:24:52,898
go and they purchase your product and

612
00:24:51,009 --> 00:24:54,610
hopefully they become a fan and then

613
00:24:52,898 --> 00:24:56,349
they go and they tell their friends and

614
00:24:54,609 --> 00:24:59,408
they put it on social media and they

615
00:24:56,349 --> 00:25:02,439
stay around and get you know engage with

616
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,240
the brand and and I want to hit it

617
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:06,070
because there are some anti marketing

618
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,970
people who might be listening who are

619
00:25:06,069 --> 00:25:13,148
like you're manipulating people and and

620
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:14,980
okay maybe I am helping guide them to an

621
00:25:13,148 --> 00:25:16,798
action that I would like them to take

622
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,329
but there's a difference between

623
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:21,190
manipulation we're generally you're

624
00:25:19,329 --> 00:25:23,918
creating a situation where you're trying

625
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:27,639
to limit somebody's options so they have

626
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:30,159
to go in your direction versus sharing

627
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:32,248
with someone openheartedly and giving

628
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,149
them a new option that is nearly

629
00:25:32,249 --> 00:25:36,850
irresistible because it's so attractive

630
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:39,699
to them and then they buy your product

631
00:25:36,849 --> 00:25:42,490
right I think that that is at marketing

632
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:46,600
at its best is increasing the consumers

633
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:49,089
options so they feel more freedom if if

634
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:51,398
you are you know trying to buy out your

635
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:53,168
competitors to create a monopoly so that

636
00:25:51,398 --> 00:25:55,569
you can do price fixing that's

637
00:25:53,169 --> 00:25:58,360
manipulation and and I'm and I'm not as

638
00:25:55,569 --> 00:26:00,668
interested in that kind of marketing if

639
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,898
you can if you can mark it with warmth

640
00:26:00,669 --> 00:26:06,970
stay on message so that your customers

641
00:26:03,898 --> 00:26:09,099
decide to choose in and participate you

642
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,720
know and then buy your stuff I think

643
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:13,449
you're doing it right yeah it's

644
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,669
interesting because for me I am NOT a

645
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:17,710
marketing person by nature I've had to

646
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:19,028
try and educate myself over the last

647
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:21,129
five years I mean I'm not even a

648
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:21,669
business person that's that stuffs all

649
00:26:21,128 --> 00:26:23,888
new to me

650
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:24,820
I came from a background in special

651
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:26,979
education that's

652
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:28,689
I got my masters in it wasn't in all

653
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:30,880
these other things and now you know I'm

654
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:34,929
taking horticulture classes I've learned

655
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:37,149
a lot it's it's great and for me I was

656
00:26:34,929 --> 00:26:37,570
fortunate enough to well eventually

657
00:26:37,148 --> 00:26:41,888
marry

658
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:43,898
recently marketing guru who a pretty

659
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:45,849
high level marketing executive so she's

660
00:26:43,898 --> 00:26:48,369
been amazing and helpful for me in

661
00:26:45,849 --> 00:26:49,869
learning about marketing that's taken

662
00:26:48,369 --> 00:26:54,579
that's taking your recruitment very

663
00:26:49,869 --> 00:26:58,268
seriously yes and she gives me a hard

664
00:26:54,579 --> 00:27:00,038
time a lot of times about about

665
00:26:58,269 --> 00:27:03,700
marketing and my business but I've

666
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:05,440
learned so much and so one of the things

667
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:08,019
that came about of this was you know I

668
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,490
was looking actually at builder so I was

669
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:11,349
like look these guys have this Instagram

670
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,240
they have all these things that they're

671
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,490
doing and they're doing a great job of

672
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,899
it I could never compete with that they

673
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:19,359
already have this established following

674
00:27:16,898 --> 00:27:20,678
on there and that's not I wasn't looking

675
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:22,000
to do the exact same thing that they

676
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:25,210
were doing it but I was like you know

677
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,128
what I have I have this knowledge I want

678
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:28,419
to write a book and I realized okay

679
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:30,849
maybe books are becoming a little

680
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:32,620
outdated and it's a lot of work to write

681
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,089
a book and a lot of the information I

682
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:36,729
want to put in the Berk book is actually

683
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:38,888
stuff that isn't from me it's from

684
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:40,240
people in my world that I just happen to

685
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:43,658
know like Jeff Lowe and fells like

686
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,638
Clackamas COO like my buddy Jaya and

687
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:46,929
Nelson and all these people so that's

688
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:48,668
sort of where the idea of this podcast

689
00:27:46,929 --> 00:27:51,639
came about and so when I was thinking

690
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,500
about the podcast I thought I found I

691
00:27:51,638 --> 00:27:55,298
made at least five episodes before I

692
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:57,220
ever launched and I got him where I want

693
00:27:55,298 --> 00:28:00,220
him and I looked at the five people that

694
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,700
I thought not necessarily were the most

695
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:06,210
scientific but were the five most

696
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,980
influential people in my life and I so

697
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:11,350
when I got those interviews done I I

698
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:13,149
took them and I as part of my you know

699
00:28:11,349 --> 00:28:15,219
go to market strategy which is a term I

700
00:28:13,148 --> 00:28:19,268
had to learn from my wife essentially

701
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:21,038
was I sent out to all the people that I

702
00:28:19,269 --> 00:28:22,120
considered influencers in Chango you

703
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,038
were one of them I said hey I'm

704
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:26,949
launching this podcast and you and I had

705
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:29,888
talked about the podcast I'm watching

706
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:31,240
this podcast and this is what this is

707
00:28:29,888 --> 00:28:33,819
who's going to be on it would you be

708
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:35,528
willing to share this on your Instagram

709
00:28:33,819 --> 00:28:37,079
page and I included I learned this from

710
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:39,089
you I included the

711
00:28:37,079 --> 00:28:40,980
you know an example Instagram post that

712
00:28:39,089 --> 00:28:43,589
they could edit an example Facebook post

713
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,940
so that was very easy for them to share

714
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:47,339
the information and you know not

715
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:51,509
everyone did but enough people did that

716
00:28:47,339 --> 00:28:53,339
it got a little bit of momentum and that

717
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:55,109
was that was huge for getting this this

718
00:28:53,339 --> 00:28:58,619
whole podcast started and I'm using the

719
00:28:55,109 --> 00:29:00,149
podcast as as a branding tool I'm not

720
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:03,059
really selling anything on the podcast

721
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:07,050
I'm not doing sponsorships I'm not doing

722
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:08,669
ads it's this is sort of my platform as

723
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:10,589
a way of getting my brand out there so

724
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:11,640
people will learn about kiss organics

725
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:13,619
and then hopefully if they want to

726
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:16,080
support me and there's products that we

727
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:17,729
carry that they want to use in their

728
00:29:16,079 --> 00:29:20,819
garden they can go on our website and

729
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:24,299
purchase them but for me what I've done

730
00:29:20,819 --> 00:29:26,639
is with products that I believe in so

731
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:28,529
like for example I've been using blue

732
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,920
mats in my garden for a couple years I

733
00:29:28,529 --> 00:29:33,240
love the product well rather than you

734
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,940
know going to them and not saying hey do

735
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:38,279
you want to sponsor this new podcast I

736
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,080
said okay hey can I build this

737
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:42,930
relationship and you can I sell blue

738
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:44,609
mats I make just this you know a small

739
00:29:42,930 --> 00:29:47,039
amount and you know a small percentage

740
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:49,709
every time someone buys them through me

741
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,059
versus directly on your site and they

742
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:52,650
said they were excited about that and so

743
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:54,149
I've done that with a lot of my guests

744
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:56,310
but I seek out the guests around

745
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,470
products that I believe in rather than

746
00:29:56,309 --> 00:30:01,079
allowing I've gotten a lot of requests

747
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,620
for people to either put ads on my

748
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:06,240
podcast or to come on the podcast and

749
00:30:04,619 --> 00:30:07,649
talk about their nutrient company or

750
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,660
about the products they're selling and I

751
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:11,220
always turn them down and they may be

752
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,690
great products but for me it has to be

753
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,450
something that I've used that I believe

754
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:17,730
in that I've researched because this

755
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:20,220
podcast is sort of my identity it's my

756
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:23,069
authenticity and it's a way for me to

757
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:24,990
share my belief system with growers that

758
00:30:23,069 --> 00:30:27,450
are interested in you know learning

759
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,700
about cannabis and science and and and

760
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,700
these you know it's very specific topics

761
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,740
I think that's a great example of you

762
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,269
being very clear about what your message

763
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,539
is going to be right just like we were

764
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:43,379
talking about earlier you know where you

765
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:45,629
are going to draw your boundaries about

766
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:48,600
what you are willing and and not willing

767
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:51,930
to do similarly even though I do have

768
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:57,869
ads on the show on my shaping fire

769
00:30:51,930 --> 00:31:01,049
podcast weekly I get people asking how

770
00:30:57,869 --> 00:31:04,919
much does it cost to be a guest on your

771
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:10,259
show and what I always say is you cannot

772
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:12,990
buy your way onto my show I can if you

773
00:31:10,259 --> 00:31:17,069
want to reach my audience I can sell you

774
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:21,359
a commercial spot and they will hear you

775
00:31:17,069 --> 00:31:25,859
but the the advertising sales team and

776
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:28,469
the editorial choices are separate

777
00:31:25,859 --> 00:31:30,539
departments right and and what I'm glad

778
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:33,120
is that no one's asked me so far but but

779
00:31:30,539 --> 00:31:35,460
wait you're both and that's true that's

780
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:39,269
true I am the advertising sales guy and

781
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,430
I picked the content but but as a very

782
00:31:39,269 --> 00:31:44,670
active podcast listener I may not listen

783
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:46,019
to a lot of cannabis podcasts but I you

784
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,110
know I'm listening to four or five

785
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:51,359
podcasts a day in you know science and

786
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:56,699
philosophy and and you know news and all

787
00:31:51,359 --> 00:32:02,369
this other kind of stuff but it's a that

788
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:05,460
if I let people be able to buy the

789
00:32:02,369 --> 00:32:08,399
becoming the guest on shaping fire the

790
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:11,549
show will feel different and that is

791
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:14,370
outside my boundary for message I want

792
00:32:11,549 --> 00:32:18,169
to do a show that's about that's

793
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:21,539
intelligent and is about you know

794
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:23,310
healthy cannabis you know technique and

795
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:27,000
growing and and in the endocannabinoids

796
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:28,740
system and and if I was just saying okay

797
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,529
you give me your five grand and you can

798
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:33,720
be on my show I would suddenly just have

799
00:32:31,529 --> 00:32:36,869
all these well funded products on my

800
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,230
show and there are already shows that

801
00:32:36,869 --> 00:32:42,359
are doing that and that's not my show I

802
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:45,779
would rather put a little bit more

803
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:48,419
effort into targeting the advertisers

804
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:51,089
that I want and then reaching out to

805
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:53,910
them and saying hey I love your product

806
00:32:51,089 --> 00:32:57,809
I love what you do and I would love to

807
00:32:53,910 --> 00:33:00,360
have you as a sponsor of my show and you

808
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:01,829
know very often I will get people invite

809
00:33:00,359 --> 00:33:04,168
people to be on my show

810
00:33:01,829 --> 00:33:06,329
and then they will eventually become an

811
00:33:04,169 --> 00:33:07,590
advertiser but it isn't it isn't what

812
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:09,658
they're there they weren't connected

813
00:33:07,589 --> 00:33:11,548
it's because they were on my show and

814
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:13,950
they liked me and they like shaping fire

815
00:33:11,548 --> 00:33:15,960
and they got good reaction from it and

816
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,528
they're all like dude I want to be on

817
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,509
your show

818
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:21,390
continuing this happens with happened

819
00:33:18,509 --> 00:33:22,919
with true terpenes so Ben Cassaday from

00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:26,038
Tru terpenes was on my show and we

821
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,470
became great friends and once he saw the

822
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:31,679
shaping fire community he's all like my

823
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:34,048
company wants to be associated with what

824
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,120
you're doing and so they've been you

825
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:38,730
know they've been a longtime sponsor now

826
00:33:36,119 --> 00:33:40,888
who keep on buying new packages of

827
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,980
commercials because you know our our

828
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:47,519
values and authenticity match up right

829
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:49,798
and so but but it wasn't that Oh Ben was

830
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,380
on the show and it's so that was tied to

831
00:33:49,798 --> 00:33:54,690
a purchase it was generally once people

832
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,340
are on my show they tend to like me in

833
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:58,528
the show and so then they want to stay

834
00:33:56,339 --> 00:34:00,689
involved and and I think that's a I

835
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:03,509
think that's a fair way to go and a lot

836
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:06,120
cooler than you know the the the

837
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,919
incoming sales queries that you and I

838
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:10,618
both get where people just want to bully

839
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,210
and buy their way on yeah let's talk a

840
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:13,919
little bit about some of the mistakes

841
00:34:12,210 --> 00:34:15,510
you're seeing in the industry here

842
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,960
before this before we get too

843
00:34:15,510 --> 00:34:21,659
long-winded on this podcast sure well

844
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,119
you know I think we've we've hit a few

845
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:28,250
of them already but but I'll go through

846
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,379
like a top list so so choosing a name

847
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:33,690
that people cannot remember or spell or

848
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,039
say right you got it you you know if

849
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,769
that if people are going to be hearing

850
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:40,050
about you for word-of-mouth you've got

851
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:42,329
to make that word-of-mouth easy number

852
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:44,179
two we've already talked about if you've

853
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:47,250
got a product that people actually use

854
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:49,409
you've got a focus group it at a wider

855
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,608
range of people than just your friends

856
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:52,440
who are gonna tell you they like it

857
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:55,139
probably no matter how crappy the

858
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,539
product might be third would be not

859
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,670
having enough capital to market your

860
00:34:57,539 --> 00:35:02,159
product after manufacturing it you know

861
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:03,960
I've seen plenty of people already who

862
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:06,659
they spend all their investment capital

863
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,970
or they're saved capital on on making

864
00:35:06,659 --> 00:35:11,789
the package manufacturing the product

865
00:35:08,969 --> 00:35:14,399
and now they've got cases of it and they

866
00:35:11,789 --> 00:35:15,239
don't they didn't leave any money to go

867
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,900
ahead

868
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:21,598
and do marketing or they spend their

869
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,150
they spend a big portion of their

870
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,640
marketing budget to sponsor an event

871
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:28,680
right and and in most cases sponsoring

872
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:31,199
an event is going to be your lowest bang

873
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:37,309
for your buck you're gonna do way way

874
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:40,739
better with boosting an Instagram post

875
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:43,289
and then geo-locating it and and

876
00:35:40,739 --> 00:35:44,939
targeting it based on interests you're

877
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:46,980
gonna do way better spending your money

878
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:49,619
that way for a very targeted group of

879
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,519
people then you will you know having a

880
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:56,970
banner you know at some cup that cost

881
00:35:53,519 --> 00:36:01,500
you you know at least five figures and

882
00:35:56,969 --> 00:36:05,399
so so so you'll make sure you save money

883
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:07,170
to market and then and then as oddly as

884
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,420
it is you want to make sure you don't

885
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:11,579
grow too fast you want to control your

886
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:13,858
marketing because there's a cash flow

887
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:15,989
issue that happens with you know all

888
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:18,569
product related companies but but we

889
00:36:15,989 --> 00:36:21,868
hear we see it a lot with with small

890
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:24,780
cannabis companies where they they are

891
00:36:21,869 --> 00:36:28,140
growing and expanding so fast that they

892
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:32,580
end up being cash poor for when they

893
00:36:28,139 --> 00:36:36,569
need to go and manufacture their next

894
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:40,079
round of product or expand their product

895
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:43,109
line so so generally it's a good idea to

896
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,960
get somebody in the mix who knows how to

897
00:36:43,108 --> 00:36:50,098
scale up companies because you know

898
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:52,320
certainly when people scale up wrong the

899
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:55,380
company will kind of lose its soul and

900
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,269
and they lose their original customer

901
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:59,369
base but with somebody with some

902
00:36:57,269 --> 00:37:01,800
experience who knows how to scale up a

903
00:36:59,369 --> 00:37:03,599
company so that you don't burn out all

904
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,940
your money and so that you don't burn

905
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,300
out your original followers it could be

906
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,289
done elegantly and and very nicely and I

907
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:15,950
think the last thing that I'll mention

908
00:37:10,289 --> 00:37:19,800
here is do not put all your chips on

909
00:37:15,949 --> 00:37:22,108
Amazon a lot of folks are selling their

910
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,769
stuff through Amazon and Amazon has got

911
00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:27,989
so much trust from consumers and and so

912
00:37:25,769 --> 00:37:29,038
many people have got Amazon accounts and

913
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:33,508
buy from their

914
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:36,749
but Amazon is really difficult to work

915
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:40,528
with it as a vendor their vendor relate

916
00:37:36,748 --> 00:37:43,948
they you know the reputation of treating

917
00:37:40,528 --> 00:37:47,130
their vendors difficult Lee and and also

918
00:37:43,949 --> 00:37:49,889
there are foreign competitors that if

919
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,619
your product becomes hot they will do a

920
00:37:49,889 --> 00:37:55,168
knockoff off off of it and sometimes

921
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:57,778
they'll even steal the copy that you

922
00:37:55,168 --> 00:38:02,400
wrote on your page and they will use the

923
00:37:57,778 --> 00:38:06,208
same copy for a visually similar product

924
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,539
and put it on Amazon at a lower price

925
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:11,518
and you'll lose you'll you'll lose and

926
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:14,249
that happens all the time another

927
00:38:11,518 --> 00:38:16,318
challenge with Amazon is that sometimes

928
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:18,389
they'll change their algorithm by how

929
00:38:16,318 --> 00:38:20,608
people are found and so you could have a

930
00:38:18,389 --> 00:38:22,650
very successful company and you're

931
00:38:20,608 --> 00:38:25,168
selling all of your whatever widgets on

932
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:27,358
Amazon and then they make a subtle in

933
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:28,558
internal algorithm change and now

934
00:38:27,358 --> 00:38:30,778
suddenly you're not getting the traffic

935
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:34,229
and the amount that you're selling just

936
00:38:30,778 --> 00:38:36,809
plummets I'm not saying don't use Amazon

937
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:40,018
I think Amazon is a is a is a great way

938
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:41,880
to reach people especially crossover

939
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,978
people who are new to cannabis what I'm

940
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:46,469
saying is don't put all your eggs in

941
00:38:43,978 --> 00:38:49,948
that basket make sure you're diversified

942
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:52,229
and Amazon is one of the ways that you

943
00:38:49,949 --> 00:38:53,789
distribute your product so so that's

944
00:38:52,228 --> 00:38:55,708
that's it that's a that's a quick list

945
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:59,069
of some of the things that I see people

946
00:38:55,708 --> 00:39:01,108
doing wrong yeah so for specifically for

947
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:03,599
cannabis growers that are looking to

948
00:39:01,108 --> 00:39:07,308
improve their branding or start a new

949
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,019
cannabis company cannabis is becoming so

950
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:12,390
popular in states that it's legalized in

951
00:39:10,018 --> 00:39:14,158
that you'd really need a way to

952
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:15,629
differentiate yourself if you want to

953
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:17,068
command a higher price point in the

954
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,499
market or make sure that your product is

955
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:22,318
always selling branding and marketing is

956
00:39:19,498 --> 00:39:24,028
is key to that and there's a lot of

957
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:27,748
challenges around what you're allowed to

958
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:29,429
say and do as a cannabis company in

959
00:39:27,748 --> 00:39:30,868
terms of your marketing but it is

960
00:39:29,429 --> 00:39:32,039
something to be aware of that I think

961
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,809
it's something you need to start right

962
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:37,140
away so when I talk to growers in

963
00:39:33,809 --> 00:39:38,309
Oklahoma about you know they're setting

964
00:39:37,139 --> 00:39:39,719
up their growing process I also

965
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,859
mentioned them like what do you what

966
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:42,980
have you done from on the marketing side

967
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:44,480
because even though you haven't broken

968
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:48,079
yet you know you're just looking at

969
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,000
where to source these you know soils and

970
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:52,130
nutrients and build your greenhouses and

971
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,320
all of these aspects you should already

972
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:55,700
be thinking about your marketing and

973
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:59,119
have some of those things locked down

974
00:39:55,699 --> 00:40:00,739
because it is it's crucial to be able to

975
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,289
differentiate yourself from every other

976
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:05,629
product on the market at the end of the

977
00:40:03,289 --> 00:40:07,369
day cannabis is subjective it's like the

978
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,309
wine industry to a certain extent and

979
00:40:07,369 --> 00:40:11,750
it's important that people are able to

980
00:40:10,309 --> 00:40:13,369
create that differentiation that's

981
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,070
something that you know the highlight a

982
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,900
few people that I've worked with I know

983
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:20,450
I talk about gold leaf gardens and layer

984
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:22,820
I canna garze if you want to go on their

985
00:40:20,449 --> 00:40:24,649
Instagram I'll put links to it on the

986
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:27,440
podcast page those guys are doing

987
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:32,420
amazing job as well with visually

988
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,519
showing a lifestyle around their

989
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:36,650
cannabis company you know their their

990
00:40:34,519 --> 00:40:38,539
slogan has grown with Aloha and I can

991
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:42,050
tell you these guys all buy in fully

992
00:40:38,539 --> 00:40:43,789
it's not it is very authentic and like

993
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,920
you said that's so important in this

994
00:40:43,789 --> 00:40:47,838
process is that that your marketing is

995
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,970
authentic to who you are and the

996
00:40:47,838 --> 00:40:51,230
community that you're looking to create

997
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:53,750
phantom farms is another one I know

998
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:55,750
Eddie really well they've done a

999
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:58,369
wonderful job in marketing their product

1000
00:40:55,750 --> 00:41:00,170
I've talked with Steve Cantwell over at

1001
00:40:58,369 --> 00:41:02,318
green fire I haven't worked with him but

1002
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:05,318
I can say that just from following his

1003
00:41:02,318 --> 00:41:08,329
Instagram posts they're very unique and

1004
00:41:05,318 --> 00:41:11,119
some are educational some are just

1005
00:41:08,329 --> 00:41:12,740
showing his operation and everything

1006
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:15,588
that they're doing in a really

1007
00:41:12,739 --> 00:41:17,029
interesting way and then the last one I

1008
00:41:15,588 --> 00:41:19,250
want to highlight on Instagram would be

1009
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:22,760
freshwater farms they're a relatively

1010
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:24,829
new canvas facility but there's an

1011
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,390
influencer Joshua Steen's Lynn - a lot

1012
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:29,900
of people in the living soil world know

1013
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:33,019
who works with them as their main grower

1014
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,608
and their folders are really interesting

1015
00:41:33,019 --> 00:41:36,289
because they have these living beds with

1016
00:41:34,608 --> 00:41:38,358
a cover crop that they're posting on

1017
00:41:36,289 --> 00:41:40,039
scale you know and and their big push is

1018
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:42,108
that everyone said we can't do this and

1019
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:45,219
yet here we are doing it and so it's

1020
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:48,559
it's really fun to see these different

1021
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:49,578
approaches to marketing that are all you

1022
00:41:48,559 --> 00:41:50,630
know quite different than what they're

1023
00:41:49,579 --> 00:41:53,539
promoting I mean they're all around

1024
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:55,190
cannabis but they're all very authentic

1025
00:41:53,539 --> 00:41:57,409
to the company and that

1026
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,059
that company's belief system yeah I

1027
00:41:57,409 --> 00:42:02,239
think you nailed it right there the

1028
00:41:59,059 --> 00:42:04,400
authenticity of it right instead of just

1029
00:42:02,239 --> 00:42:07,009
giving us a bunch of bud photos which

1030
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,858
you can get anywhere everybody that you

1031
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:12,560
mentioned has got a story and a message

1032
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:13,909
that's unique to them now in social

1033
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:15,289
media marketing we would say that

1034
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:18,318
they're all creating original content

1035
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:21,710
and putting it out which is true they

1036
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:22,269
you know the I mean the the lyric ana

1037
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:25,970
gars

1038
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:27,619
instagram is so gorgeous they I think

1039
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:29,779
they've developed the best cannabis

1040
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:33,619
lifestyle brand that we've got so far in

1041
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:35,780
the industry it's just gorgeous and it's

1042
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:38,420
a good feed to watch and it's a quality

1043
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:42,560
product right but they you know between

1044
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:45,769
both the the the high-end product vibe

1045
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:47,358
lifestyle brand and then also since it's

1046
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:49,219
all done in cooperation with gold leaf

1047
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,159
you get that whole you know made with a

1048
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:54,409
loja vibe which just feels good in the

1049
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:57,230
cannabis industry this is this is a

1050
00:42:54,409 --> 00:43:00,230
cogent message and and the other

1051
00:42:57,230 --> 00:43:03,108
examples that you gave do it solidly too

1052
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:05,088
and I also want to take a chance to plug

1053
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:08,239
my next episode actually I'm shaping

1054
00:43:05,088 --> 00:43:11,929
fire I'm actually interviewing Joshua's

1055
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:14,509

1056

1060
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,829
lot of conventions that Joshua is also

1061
00:43:31,369 --> 00:43:36,108
at and and I and I met him because he

1062
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:38,900
was asking such damn good questions of

1063
00:43:36,108 --> 00:43:42,049
the of the living soil and microbes

1064
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:44,030
speakers I'm like who is this cat and so

1065
00:43:42,050 --> 00:43:46,970
I started following him and then I found

1066
00:43:44,030 --> 00:43:48,950
my way to the his company website and I

1067
00:43:46,969 --> 00:43:51,679
saw the pictures and I'm like wow this

1068
00:43:48,949 --> 00:43:53,629
is gonna be great so so yeah I'm very

1069
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:56,588
happy to be interviewing Joshua tomorrow

1070
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:59,000
and and his episode will be coming out

1071
00:43:56,588 --> 00:44:02,559
right after I get back from Emerald cup

1072
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:05,079
I can't wait to check that out you know

1073
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,940
I don't know Joshua all that well but

1074
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:09,489
I've I started following him on YouTube

1075
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,500
and he's actually been using our soils

1076
00:44:09,489 --> 00:44:14,259
this whole time which is which is

1077
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:15,909
wonderful and he basically created a

1078
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,440
brand around himself he just started

1079
00:44:15,909 --> 00:44:19,149
putting up his grows on YouTube and

1080
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,159
talking on these growths and some of

1081
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:22,809
these episodes are really long and they

1082
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:24,159
all showed he was very transparent about

1083
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:27,250
everything he was doing in his garden

1084
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:29,529
and then fresh water farms reached out

1085
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,360
to him and hired him because he was

1086
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:33,190
showing these wonderful photos he's like

1087
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,910
yeah let's do this on scale and so he

1088
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:38,889
got in with fresh water along along the

1089
00:44:36,909 --> 00:44:41,559
same lines and it's really interesting

1090
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:44,679
how he used YouTube as a way of becoming

1091
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,579
this you know cannabis influencer around

1092
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:50,169
probiotic gardening and living soils and

1093
00:44:47,579 --> 00:44:52,269
building his own personal brand in terms

1094
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:54,820
of his name and it's allowed him to move

1095
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:57,009
forward in the industry just based on

1096
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,720
that yeah totally I would say Chris

1097
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:01,210
Trump is another one of those folks who

1098
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:03,819
you know Chris Trump knows a lot and

1099
00:45:01,210 --> 00:45:05,740
he's got a lot of good info to share but

1100
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:08,230
until he started making YouTube videos

1101
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:09,789
he was just kind of like one voice in

1102
00:45:08,230 --> 00:45:12,519
the wilderness but then as soon as he

1103
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:17,199
was on YouTube everyone could learn from

1104
00:45:12,519 --> 00:45:19,599
him and and you know he's pretty much

1105
00:45:17,199 --> 00:45:22,179
the you know sky rocketing on that KNF

1106
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,460
tip right now yeah I don't think you can

1107
00:45:22,179 --> 00:45:25,779
be afraid to share information don't

1108
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,309
feel like you need to keep it all to

1109
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:29,710
yourself and keep it proprietary

1110
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:32,980
by sharing information you are

1111
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:35,650
establishing yourself as knowledgeable

1112
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:39,369
in a certain part of the industry and

1113
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:42,400
that's that's invaluable and what Chris

1114
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:43,929
did was he took well he had success at

1115
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,280
his farm in Hawaii but he essentially

1116
00:45:43,929 --> 00:45:47,679
took information that he had learned

1117
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:49,060
from Korea that was inaccessible to a

1118
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,379
lot of people in the United States just

1119
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:52,210
because they didn't know about it or

1120
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:54,670
they weren't able to really research it

1121
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,260
and he started sharing that so he became

1122
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:58,420
the voice to where when you when you

1123
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,980
think of KNF now he's one of the main

1124
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:03,340
people that everyone talks about because

1125
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,800
he's one of the few KNF followers that's

1126
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,320
willing to talk to the cannabis industry

1127
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,360
and that's sort of been his little niche

1128
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,990
that has been really powerful for him

1129
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:15,579
yeah totally and he has been on my show

1130
00:46:13,989 --> 00:46:18,218
as well and he

1131
00:46:15,579 --> 00:46:20,170
he is such a good teacher too right

1132
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:23,380
there's a there's a lot of folks that

1133
00:46:20,170 --> 00:46:26,499
are into you know some of these more

1134
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:28,719
advanced cannabis techniques but they

1135
00:46:26,498 --> 00:46:30,909
don't have the kind of personality which

1136
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:33,369
allows them to calm down and teach and

1137
00:46:30,909 --> 00:46:34,838
Chris is a really good teacher and I

1138
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:36,489
think that that really helps out a lot

1139
00:46:34,838 --> 00:46:38,498
and I think that's the direction that

1140
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:42,489
the industry is going right I think that

1141
00:46:38,498 --> 00:46:45,159
you know the number of people who are

1142
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:48,219
growing are going to massively increase

1143
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:51,038
as as as home grow becomes more and more

1144
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:52,989
established and and I think that the

1145
00:46:51,039 --> 00:46:56,829
number of plants that's going to be the

1146
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:58,420
average Grove is gonna go down as

1147
00:46:56,829 --> 00:47:00,579
there's there's more and more people

1148
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:03,039
growing you know let's say three to ten

1149
00:47:00,579 --> 00:47:05,798
plants just you know in their backyard

1150
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,589
during the summer and and I think that

1151
00:47:05,798 --> 00:47:12,068
it creates this incredible opportunity

1152
00:47:07,588 --> 00:47:15,578
not only for any kind of education based

1153
00:47:12,068 --> 00:47:17,858
product or service but also all of the

1154
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:22,900
tools that all those people are going to

1155
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:25,058
use and and it creates a new niche you

1156
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,789
don't necessarily have to be talking to

1157
00:47:25,059 --> 00:47:28,599
the commercial growers to sell a lot of

1158
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:30,579
your product

1159
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,068
maybe you're gonna maybe maybe you don't

1160
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:34,890
need to sell so many five gallon batches

1161
00:47:33,068 --> 00:47:38,588
of your product to a commercial grower

1162
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:41,978
maybe you can sell you know instead a

1163
00:47:38,588 --> 00:47:44,469
hundred for ouncers to a hundred

1164
00:47:41,978 --> 00:47:49,058
different people and and you're making

1165
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:50,409
the same or similar margins but but

1166
00:47:49,059 --> 00:47:52,900
you're you're doing it to regular

1167
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:55,179
citizens regular people who are at home

1168
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:58,509
growing they're there handful of plants

1169
00:47:55,179 --> 00:48:00,848
and and not trying to target a big

1170
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:02,289
commercial grower so I think I think

1171
00:48:00,849 --> 00:48:04,028
it's going that way and you know it's

1172
00:48:02,289 --> 00:48:06,519
another good thing to point out you

1173
00:48:04,028 --> 00:48:10,778
mentioned you know how how both Joshua

1174
00:48:06,518 --> 00:48:15,338
and Chris yeah you know broke through on

1175
00:48:10,778 --> 00:48:18,789
YouTube it's amazing how much more

1176
00:48:15,338 --> 00:48:22,179
valuable soil science and cultivation

1177
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:24,099
science is now than it was you know I

1178
00:48:22,179 --> 00:48:25,389
mean heck and back in the day we would

1179
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:28,059
we would the only things that we would

1180
00:48:25,389 --> 00:48:28,568
get would be High Times right and and

1181
00:48:28,059 --> 00:48:31,630
we'd have

1182
00:48:28,568 --> 00:48:34,509
- right Reid the High Times articles and

1183
00:48:31,630 --> 00:48:37,059
discern as much as we can and then

1184
00:48:34,509 --> 00:48:39,009
rumors from like uncles and neighbors

1185
00:48:37,059 --> 00:48:42,339
right and then and then the internet

1186
00:48:39,009 --> 00:48:44,048
showed up right and and and we started

1187
00:48:42,338 --> 00:48:46,239
you know having forums and being able to

1188
00:48:44,048 --> 00:48:49,568
talk to each other and fight a lot

1189
00:48:46,239 --> 00:48:53,079
online and and and start to learn things

1190
00:48:49,568 --> 00:48:55,958
that way and and now we've got this this

1191
00:48:53,079 --> 00:49:00,519
new push of both products and

1192
00:48:55,958 --> 00:49:02,889
information sources where people can you

1193
00:49:00,518 --> 00:49:05,409
know like it's a next wave for example

1194
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:07,798
there's that there's that traveling soil

1195
00:49:05,409 --> 00:49:10,659
science conference that's going around

1196
00:49:07,798 --> 00:49:13,028
Joshua Rutherford from Dutch blooms put

1197
00:49:10,659 --> 00:49:16,088
it on it's that regenerative organic

1198
00:49:13,028 --> 00:49:17,739
cannabis calm and so so he's he's taking

1199
00:49:16,088 --> 00:49:19,298
this event across the country right it

1200
00:49:17,739 --> 00:49:22,418
starts in humbled and then goes like to

1201
00:49:19,298 --> 00:49:25,568
Canada and Detroit and domain and the

1202
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:30,429
idea that that there is a cannabis

1203
00:49:25,568 --> 00:49:32,768
related soil science traveling education

1204
00:49:30,429 --> 00:49:34,630
circus going across the country with

1205
00:49:32,768 --> 00:49:36,608
like really kick-ass speakers some of

1206
00:49:34,630 --> 00:49:38,769
them like like you know Kevin Joe jury

1207
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:41,469
right I mean wow what a great thing for

1208
00:49:38,768 --> 00:49:45,278
you know folks in Michigan to be able to

1209
00:49:41,469 --> 00:49:48,869
get Kevin Joe jury in person right so so

1210
00:49:45,278 --> 00:49:51,938
the fact that these types of things are

1211
00:49:48,869 --> 00:49:54,429
legal enough that that that they can

1212
00:49:51,938 --> 00:49:56,558
take soil science on the road I think

1213
00:49:54,429 --> 00:49:57,789
that it's just good good for everybody

1214
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,699
especially if it gets people to move

1215
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:02,140
towards living soils yeah there's

1216
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:04,959
another one called the living soil

1217
00:50:02,139 --> 00:50:06,518
symposium with Chris Jagger and he

1218
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:08,438
actually came on my podcast and we were

1219
00:50:06,518 --> 00:50:12,098
talking about it among other things

1220
00:50:08,438 --> 00:50:14,649
around hemp farming but the living soul

1221
00:50:12,099 --> 00:50:18,099
symposium was held down in Oregon but he

1222
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:19,900
was looking at maybe establishing small

1223
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,749
communities sort of like TEDx talks

1224
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:25,479
where where local communities could host

1225
00:50:22,748 --> 00:50:28,298
this living soil symposium you know in

1226
00:50:25,478 --> 00:50:30,879
their area and then bring in experts to

1227
00:50:28,298 --> 00:50:33,489
talk or even people in the industry as a

1228
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,890
way of creating discourse around a lot

1229
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:39,869
of these these organic and regenerative

1230
00:50:35,889 --> 00:50:42,278
ideas but one thing you you kind of

1231
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:43,000
brought up or popped into my head

1232
00:50:42,278 --> 00:50:45,909
regarding

1233
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:49,119
this is there is a lot of marketing out

1234
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:52,929
there there's a lot of different experts

1235
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:55,179
and information and we have an abundance

1236
00:50:52,929 --> 00:50:57,159
of resources now and information out

1237
00:50:55,179 --> 00:51:00,609
there and everyone has a different way

1238
00:50:57,159 --> 00:51:02,759
of cultivation or a different way of

1239
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:04,960
growing and so it's really really

1240
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:06,790
challenging before like you said it was

1241
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,289
all underground now we have the problem

1242
00:51:06,789 --> 00:51:11,110
of sifting through all of this

1243
00:51:08,289 --> 00:51:13,719
information and sifting through all of

1244
00:51:11,110 --> 00:51:15,340
these experts and figuring out what what

1245
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:18,449
is really accurate and what is really

1246
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:21,309
true and I found with you know having a

1247
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:23,949
cannabis podcast that's focused on

1248
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:26,590
science there's a lot of people using

1249
00:51:23,949 --> 00:51:29,730
the word science incorrectly or not

1250
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:31,990
understanding what science really is and

1251
00:51:29,730 --> 00:51:34,090
there's a lot of pseudoscience out there

1252
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:36,489
to where people are couching things in

1253
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:39,130
the way that seems scientific but yet

1254
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:39,789
doesn't really have you know there's no

1255
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:42,730
controls

1256
00:51:39,789 --> 00:51:44,650
there's no methodology around it but the

1257
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,119
claims that they're making sound really

1258
00:51:44,650 --> 00:51:49,150
great so I just want to caution

1259
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:52,299
listeners to you know do a little

1260
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:55,329
research don't accept things from

1261
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:57,700
experts or from people as at face value

1262
00:51:55,329 --> 00:51:59,409
because at the end of the day they're

1263
00:51:57,699 --> 00:52:01,839
marketing themselves they're branding

1264
00:51:59,409 --> 00:52:03,339
themselves too if you know if we're

1265
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:04,600
talking about speakers but if we're

1266
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:06,070
talking about a product to like their

1267
00:52:04,599 --> 00:52:08,829
goal is to sell you that product or

1268
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:10,870
their goal is to sell you their method

1269
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:12,610
of cultivation or whatever we're talking

1270
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:14,949
about it's all marketing at the end of

1271
00:52:12,610 --> 00:52:17,860
the day so we need to just be aware and

1272
00:52:14,949 --> 00:52:20,500
do our own research around these things

1273
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:22,420
and so we don't get taken you know yeah

1274
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:27,070
for sure and I have seen I'm seeing that

1275
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:30,039
at its most ugly in the CBD isolate

1276
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:33,269
market right now I mean to see to see

1277
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:37,179
some of these CBD from fiber hemp

1278
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:40,750
companies marketing their products you

1279
00:52:37,179 --> 00:52:44,349
know intentionally using words like full

1280
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:45,940
spectrum in accurately and and feeding

1281
00:52:44,349 --> 00:52:49,239
lines about the endocannabinoid system

1282
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:51,280
that are just factually untrue but

1283
00:52:49,239 --> 00:52:53,529
there's no enforcement about that and so

1284
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:56,030
I would say that you know anybody

1285
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:57,860
whether whether you're your

1286
00:52:56,030 --> 00:53:01,580
assuming information to grow or

1287
00:52:57,860 --> 00:53:03,950
consuming information to buy to to to

1288
00:53:01,579 --> 00:53:06,049
buy a product you know make sure you do

1289
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:08,049
your homework and all marketing is

1290
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:11,600
trying to influence you so don't be

1291
00:53:08,050 --> 00:53:15,080
unduly influenced yeah if you hear a

1292
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:18,559
claim that sounds crazy it probably is I

1293
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,670
heard one I just heard a couple the

1294
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:23,980
other day that I want to highlight I

1295
00:53:19,670 --> 00:53:26,800
heard a soil company claiming that

1296
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,150
essentially if you use their super soil

1297
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:32,390
you would you would not need to use any

1298
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:35,750
fertilizer and you can grow in any size

1299
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:37,429
container and it'll end up you know

1300
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:40,489
it'll end up perfect every time

1301
00:53:37,429 --> 00:53:41,509
and that that claim to me was just crazy

1302
00:53:40,489 --> 00:53:43,219
because there's so many other factors

1303
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:44,840
involved in terms of your lighting your

1304
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:46,159
watering all these other things and

1305
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,800
their thing was just nope you use our

1306
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:50,779
soil you're gonna get a great crop every

1307
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,390
time and then another one I heard

1308
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:55,280
recently was that if you get the biology

1309
00:53:53,389 --> 00:53:56,960
right in your soil you no longer will

1310
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,040
have to deal with weeds and you don't

1311
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,289
have to worry about fertilizer

1312
00:53:58,039 --> 00:54:02,269
everything you don't need to have any

1313
00:54:00,289 --> 00:54:05,960
other inputs moving forward once the you

1314
00:54:02,269 --> 00:54:07,519
know your your bacterial fungal ratio is

1315
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:10,190
correct and that to me was another one

1316
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:13,190
that's just illogical there's there's no

1317
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:14,570
actual science behind that so we just

1318
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,250
have to be really careful with what

1319
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,440
we're falling into when it comes to

1320
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:20,449
information and sort out these claims is

1321
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:22,340
all I wanted to say on that well I think

1322
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:25,189
that it's really funny that that you and

1323
00:54:22,340 --> 00:54:26,990
I just did you know in our podcast on

1324
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:29,090
marketing and how to do it and how to do

1325
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:31,250
the best and we're ending the show on a

1326
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:32,750
quick discussion about not believing

1327
00:54:31,250 --> 00:54:34,039
marketing and making sure you're doing

1328
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:37,789
homework because they're all a bunch of

1329
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:39,230
liars so so yeah you know it's I think

1330
00:54:37,789 --> 00:54:43,519
that I think that's why we need to

1331
00:54:39,230 --> 00:54:45,500
remain authentic right have people trust

1332
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,440
us more so they're more likely to take

1333
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:49,900
our word for it and to you know if

1334
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:52,639
you're gonna do marketing especially

1335
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:55,280
aggressive marketing do it with honor

1336
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:58,069
and make sure you remember that you are

1337
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:00,470
in service to your audience you're in

1338
00:54:58,070 --> 00:55:03,260
service to your customer base this is

1339
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:05,959
not about the hustle to create a

1340
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:07,910
win-lose relationship always be looking

1341
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,780
to create a win-win relationship with

1342
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,759
your customers

1343
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:14,180
and and you'll keep them coming back I

1344
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:15,980
think that's the perfect place to sign

1345
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:17,659
off on this podcast I totally agree with

1346
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,949
what you're saying and I really

1347
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:21,289
appreciate you taking the time today to

1348
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:22,849
share a lot of these these tips and

1349
00:55:21,289 --> 00:55:24,759
pointers and give some structure to

1350
00:55:22,849 --> 00:55:27,679
people who are starting to think about

1351
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:29,660
branding and and things like that have

1352
00:55:27,679 --> 00:55:32,559
you do you have any recommendations for

1353
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:34,909
resources to sort of and end this offer

1354
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,049
well actually the the resources that

1355
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:38,449
you've already dropped that you're gonna

1356
00:55:36,050 --> 00:55:42,950
give links to I think I think are gonna

1357
00:55:38,449 --> 00:55:45,799
be the best so so I don't think I'm

1358
00:55:42,949 --> 00:55:49,069
gonna give that but I will go ahead and

1359
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:50,960
plug the links where people can watch

1360
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:54,620
the videos and the interviews that I've

1361
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:58,159
done on YouTube and so you know when I

1362
00:55:54,619 --> 00:56:00,799
go around to conventions I often

1363
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:02,539
moderate panels and and and speak but

1364
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:06,320
anyway anytime I go anytime I'm in the

1365
00:56:02,539 --> 00:56:08,779
room I record the speaker and so there's

1366
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:11,539
a whole bunch of really great living

1367
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:14,360
soil talks and Jeff Lowen fells and and

1368
00:56:11,539 --> 00:56:17,150
oh my gosh I think we're up to like a

1369
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,769
hundred and twenty videos and and a lot

1370
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:20,480
of them are me recording stuff at

1371
00:56:18,769 --> 00:56:24,170
conventions but then a lot of them are

1372
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:26,389
me talking with people outside after

1373
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:28,670
they're done talking and asking them

1374
00:56:26,389 --> 00:56:30,949
some other questions so as far as the

1375
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,849
continuing to educate yourself tip goes

1376
