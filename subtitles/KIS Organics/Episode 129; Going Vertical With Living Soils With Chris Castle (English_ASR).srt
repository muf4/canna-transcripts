37
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:48,879
facility in California can you talk a

38
00:01:46,718 --> 00:01:49,919
little bit about a little bit about

39
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:54,158
yourself and then a little bit about

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,079
Flor and Flame sure um so I'm a Bia

41
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,600
native uh born and raised how'd you get

42
00:01:57,078 --> 00:02:01,839
into cultivation yeah uh let's start

43
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:04,879
real quick there so how I got into

44
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,080
cultivation uh I was I think I was 18 or

45
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:11,680
19 um living on my own uh I got kicked

46
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,239
out of the house for smoking

47
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,800
weed when I was 16 so uh yeah started

48
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,519
growing when I was like

49
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,040
1819 um and then had a break for a while

50
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,280
uh got back into

51
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:29,079
cultivation when I was 24 25 working for

52
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,519
other people and then uh started doing

53
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,879
my own thing again with Flor and Flame

54
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,879
with uh within the last seven years

55
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:43,400
now so what would you started floor and

56
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:46,560
Flame really from the ground up um from

57
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:51,319
from nothing what was your vision going

58
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,640
in to this you know project um so I was

59
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:55,839
I was bartending at the time um this was

60
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:58,238
like

61
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,598
2016 and I knew you know cannabis was

62
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:06,200
going legal uh in California I wanted to

63
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:09,798
take a bet on myself and um I pitched an

64
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:11,639
idea to do a small license grow in

65
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:14,120
Richmond or Oakland like you know a 20

66
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,798
or 50 lighter or something something

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:22,920
very modest um to an investor I knew

68
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:24,719
that we wanted to do soil uh soil uh

69
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,518
style cultivation because I knew that

70
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:28,438
was going to lead to better quality

71
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,640
product just from personal

72
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:33,318
experience um I didn't know anything

73
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:37,559
about living soil at the time or any of

74
00:03:33,318 --> 00:03:40,878
these terms um but yeah so we we p i

75
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,920
pitch this idea to a real estate uh

76
00:03:40,878 --> 00:03:48,280
investor and broker and he's a good

77
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:50,238
friend and Mentor as well and um he had

78
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:53,959
the vision to want

79
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,599
to uh take this project to the next

80
00:03:53,959 --> 00:04:00,799
level really so

81
00:03:56,598 --> 00:04:02,679
over um the course of you know I don't

82
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,560
know 6 months or so we were looking at

83
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:08,879
different properties for sale uh we came

84
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:11,719
across this building in Oakland that was

85
00:04:08,878 --> 00:04:15,078
on the outside of the green zone um as

86
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:16,639
soon as uh Peter the owner uh as soon as

87
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,358
he saw the building he was like we're

88
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,400
going to buy it uh he he had this vision

89
00:04:20,358 --> 00:04:25,159
of his head in his head to uh do this

90
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:28,599
this huge buildout that's just kind of

91
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:32,080
how he thinks um and I remember over the

92
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,000
course uh of the development of the

93
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:35,680
project where I went to him and I was

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,839
like are you sure you want to do this

95
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,560
because like the buildout just kept

96
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:43,679
getting bigger and bigger um and that's

97
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,519
just the way he thought and he wanted to

98
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,000
stick with it and do it he found it

99
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:50,560
really exciting and challenging um I

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,759
don't think he anticipated what a

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,720
challenge it would be especially post

102
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,280
construction which I always told him I'm

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:58,880
like the real work is going to begin

104
00:04:57,279 --> 00:05:00,638
when we're actually have plants in the

105
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:02,680
building like yeah it's a lot of work

106
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,639
with research and development and

107
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:07,400
Architectural in the construction phase

108
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,280
and startup but I'm like yeah the real

109
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:13,159
work begins when you when you get plants

110
00:05:09,279 --> 00:05:15,399
in the building but um yeah and then the

111
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:18,560
the name Florin flame that was uh

112
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:20,560
founded by uh my fiance she she kind of

113
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,959
came up with the name when we were

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,839
brainstorming and the name was uh

115
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:30,638
conceptualized in

116
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:32,159
2017 and um we started off with uh

117
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:36,160
a very

118
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,520
small um we called it like our our trap

119
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,639
lab essentially but it was

120
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:45,240
this illicit uh facility that we set up

121
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,038
where we had um where we were testing

122
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,319
different

123
00:05:46,038 --> 00:05:52,318
LEDs and

124
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:54,879
k&amp;f and uh living soil and learning all

125
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:57,439
these different terms and taking courses

126
00:05:54,879 --> 00:06:00,519
and stuff uh but that's really kind of

127
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:03,120
where we cut our teeth and and figured

128
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:07,079
out how we were going to scale up what

129
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:10,560
we were doing to what you see now with

130
00:06:07,079 --> 00:06:15,079
400 plus lights and I think like 8,500

131
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,079
Square ft in our uh state-of-the-art

132
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,199
facility yeah and I want to ask you some

133
00:06:19,399 --> 00:06:24,239
questions about that but I just want to

134
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,080
let listeners know um we are going to be

135
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,879
talking about this from a commercial

136
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:30,879
perspective here at the beginning but I

137
00:06:27,879 --> 00:06:32,719
do plan on uh getting some information

138
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:34,759
from Chris about how he would approach

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,720
hom grows too because I know there's a

140
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:38,360
lot of people that listen that are not

141
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
commercial cultivators and I want to

142
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:42,199
make sure the information applies to

143
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:44,119
everybody so uh if you can stick around

144
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:46,360
through the commercial stuff and the

145
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,478
vertical uh talk that we're going to do

146
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:53,919
about uh grow in vertical then we'll get

147
00:06:48,478 --> 00:06:56,038
back into the you know all all

148
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,719
applicable cultivation information that

149
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:00,439
really goes whether you you have five

150
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,800
plants or 5,000 so

151
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:03,519
uh just want to throw that out there but

152
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,560
let's talk a little bit more about what

153
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:09,680
you're calling this trap room or trap

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,879
facility at first um how big was it how

155
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,720
many lights what were some of the

156
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:15,400
lessons that you learned in there

157
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,879
because you just kind of threw out a

158
00:07:15,399 --> 00:07:21,000
bunch of terms of things that you tried

159
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:24,280
out like k&amp;f and living soils what what

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,279
were your experiences yeah so that was

161
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:30,198
really interesting so it was it was

162
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:35,239
about we had six lights three 4X by8

163
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:38,120
beds um two of the 4x8 were initially

164
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,439
really shallow so like maybe four 5 in

165
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:45,879
of soil so not a lot of soil depth and

166
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:49,879
uh this was a uh gas station property

167
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:51,840
that we we modified to uh to this to

168
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:54,199
build out this grow essentially for us

169
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:58,478
to uh figure out what we were going to

170
00:07:54,199 --> 00:08:00,919
do um so over the course of 3 years um

171
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:03,279
we were working on and when I say we it

172
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:05,959
was me and my colleague Alex who still

173
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:09,478
works with us at Flor and Flame and I

174
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:11,279
worked with Alex at another grow you

175
00:08:09,478 --> 00:08:13,800
know 10 plus years ago so I've known him

176
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:17,079
for a long time it was really him and I

177
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,639
that developed our our Sops if you will

178
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:23,878
so uh we actually built our own soil mix

179
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:28,400
initially um that was a good learning

180
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:31,360
experience um and then uh I don't even

181
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:35,158
remember where we first heard about

182
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:38,479
k&amp;f um initially but I remember we took

183
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:41,080
an in inperson like crash course we

184
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:44,839
drove up to you know somewhere in humbl

185
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:47,160
up in AR near Arcada and uh this guy a

186
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:50,160
World's Last Hope was his Instagram

187
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:54,719
handle and he was one of the I know so

188
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:57,399
he was one of the few people um you know

189
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
basically talking about knf and ferments

190
00:08:57,399 --> 00:09:02,078
and all this and I remember going to the

191
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,599
class and he was passing around the fpj

192
00:09:02,078 --> 00:09:07,799
and having people drink it and you know

193
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,879
it was just fascinating at the yeah it

194
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:13,399
was I didn't wow I haven't heard that I

195
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:17,278
didn't drink it but um uh you know it's

196
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:22,120
like a kombucha or something but um sure

197
00:09:17,278 --> 00:09:24,078
sure or you know semi quasi but um yeah

198
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:26,000
it was just fascinating learning or

199
00:09:24,078 --> 00:09:28,519
hearing all these different terms and

200
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,440
seeing how there was different uh

201
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:36,799
methodology of living soil if you will

202
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:40,120
um or soiless media indoors and um so we

203
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:44,559
took that crash course I even bought um

204
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,480
you know a Cho's book and me and Alex we

205
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:50,319
made all these ferments and did all

206
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,039
these recipes and we applied them at our

207
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:56,920
our little lab that we had and fantastic

208
00:09:54,039 --> 00:10:00,399
results I mean just

209
00:09:56,919 --> 00:10:04,000
unbelievable um Tricom coverage

210
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:06,519
and beautiful structured flower and

211
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,639
flavorful and the feedback that we were

212
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,720
getting from people on that first run

213
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:13,439
was just unbelievable it was like oh

214
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:15,639
okay we're we're like really on to

215
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,760
something with this but it had its

216
00:10:15,639 --> 00:10:21,639
challenges too indoors and because I had

217
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:24,000
so little experience with it but um we

218
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:28,159
saw that it increased pest pressure

219
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:31,600
indoors um was causing other issues and

220
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:36,000
we were concerned with with um using

221
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:37,320
those methods in a licensed uh uh Market

222
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,399
where we're going to have to go through

223
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:42,200
lab testing so we were worried about

224
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,879
microbials or other failures and you

225
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,839
know keep in mind this was like

226
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,838
2017

227
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:52,480
um and we see people in today's market

228
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,920
using k&amp;f like Moon Valley that are able

229
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,200
to pass testing so I think we've learned

230
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:59,799
a lot since then um but yeah we we moved

231
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,040
away from

232
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:06,679
k&amp;f um and the reason we we pivoted was

233
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:08,879
uh you know concern for testing but also

234
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:11,519
I went to a soil conference down in

235
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:14,919
Santa Barbara and heard Steve kwell

236
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:18,480
speak and I think this was like 2017 or

237
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:22,319
18 and uh was completely blown away by

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:25,399
what he was doing indoors in a license

239
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,600
Market uh with living soil I was it was

240
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:31,679
just unheard of and um yeah I I could

241
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:34,278
relate to him and his story and I

242
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,799
introduced myself and kind of helped me

243
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:40,439
along the way and then with that timing

244
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:44,199
I was able to take a um a soil food web

245
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:47,200
course with Dr Ingam she was uh she had

246
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,200
her last in-person course that she

247
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,079
taught um at this ashram in Castro

248
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,839
Valley it was a week long where we uh

249
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:59,479
yeah it was just a crash course of of

250
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:01,839
you know her talking every day for 8

251
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,920
hours we're building compost piles we're

252
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,320
using a

253
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:07,639
microscope and uh that was another like

254
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,760
just huge eye openening experience for

255
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:14,600
me too and and uh we use a lot of those

256
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:17,480
methods but um indoors it's different

257
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,079
you know and uh I use a microscope but

258
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:23,720
maybe not to the extent that some other

259
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:26,319
soil food web enthusiastics enthusiastic

260
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,879
uh use because I don't think it's it's

261
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,879
quite that important I think you've

262
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:35,679
you've mentioned that too like it's not

263
00:12:30,879 --> 00:12:38,679
a NE necessity to uh to use a microscope

264
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:38,679
to do living soil

265
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:44,079
indoors yeah I mean I have my microscope

266
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:47,719
literally right next to me here I'm

267
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:49,919
looking at it uh but I don't use it in

268
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,199
most cases for making any actionable

269
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:55,078
decisions in terms of my soil or

270
00:12:52,198 --> 00:12:57,639
fertility management but I I think I've

271
00:12:55,078 --> 00:13:01,120
shared my opinion on here already about

272
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:02,600
that um I do want to just say that I I

273
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
Steve has been such a wonderful

274
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,199
representative and voice for the living

275
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:10,519
Soul Community um he's really done an

276
00:13:07,198 --> 00:13:13,639
amazing job of of straddling you know

277
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:16,278
this the differences between folks that

278
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:19,198
are in the so food web or k&amp;f or soil

279
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:23,720
testing uh he's been so open-minded and

280
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:27,120
accepting and um just a really great

281
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,278
person to to really show what what the

282
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,519
potential of this methodology really is

283
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:33,879
is so I'm I'm honored to consider him a

284
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,120
colleague and friend and and know him

285
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:38,759
and have seen his property like his farm

286
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:41,240
is beautiful um so yeah shout out to

287
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:43,519
Steve for just really doing a great

288
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:45,959
job and just the person that he is he's

289
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,919
a fantastic person and friend and yeah I

290
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:52,319
definitely feel lucky to to know him and

291
00:13:48,919 --> 00:13:56,159
uh yeah what it's it's a

292
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,399
huge Testament as far as how big of an

293
00:13:56,159 --> 00:14:02,078
influence he is to the living soul

294
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:06,240
Community just based off of how good of

295
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:06,239
a person he is and how open-minded he

296
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,480
is yeah and that's the thing that him

297
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:12,399
and I have talked about like he may not

298
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,600
agree with everything I say but he says

299
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,078
he'll listen to it because if he can't

300
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,560
come up with a good argument against why

301
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,919
I might be saying something then he's

302
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:23,518
probably going to try it out or he's

303
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:25,439
probably going to adapt it you know and

304
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:28,278
or adopt it so same the same thing for

305
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,079
me like I don't necessarily agree with

306
00:14:28,278 --> 00:14:33,120
all of the things that he does uh in his

307
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:35,599
facility some of them to me seem like an

308
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:38,120
IPM risk and we've talked about this uh

309
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,639
actually on the podcast even uh but that

310
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:42,799
being said like he pulls it off very

311
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:45,399
successfully and he's very thoughtful

312
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,159
about how he does it so he's not just uh

313
00:14:45,399 --> 00:14:50,720
you know scattering cover crops and he's

314
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,600
not just um you know doing the things

315
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,199
that he does without putting a lot of

316
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,720
thought into why he does them and I

317
00:14:54,198 --> 00:14:58,559
think that's the the most important part

318
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:01,639
of all of it so definitely yeah well

319
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:07,078
let's let's get back into your uh

320
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:10,000
buildout here so you had a very uh tall

321
00:15:07,078 --> 00:15:11,599
building that kind of it's if if I'm

322
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
remembering correctly sort of forced you

323
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:18,040
into going more vertical and and doing

324
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,639
uh a tiered grow or vertical grow can

325
00:15:18,039 --> 00:15:24,198
you talk a little bit about that process

326
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:26,360
yeah so I I remember uh when we started

327
00:15:24,198 --> 00:15:29,278
the like architectural rough

328
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,278
architectural phase of the project um we

329
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:34,799
were just trying to so so people can

330
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:38,720
picture we bought this building the

331
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:45,359
property is 50 feet wide by I think 110

332
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:48,319
ft long uh big open inside uh 28 ft tall

333
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:52,000
um inside so we were just trying to

334
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:56,479
figure out how to design the facility

335
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,318
and fit all the different you know

336
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,360
processes that we need to fit within

337
00:15:58,318 --> 00:16:05,599
that space like you know drying uh

338
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,680
trimming uh curing just everything

339
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,920
um and

340
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,000
initially I remember we were we were

341
00:16:09,919 --> 00:16:14,958
just trying to fill how much how many

342
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,759
how much flower space could we fit in

343
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:18,799
this in this space That's how little we

344
00:16:16,759 --> 00:16:19,959
knew we were just trying to fill it out

345
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:22,439
with with just

346
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:24,599
flowering um and lights flowering rooms

347
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,000
and lights

348
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:31,839
um and then we figured out we needed to

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,679
build up to fit just everything we

350
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:41,319
needed to do from Veg uh to curine so

351
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:45,638
with that um I remember I we came across

352
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:49,759
a uh a bad advisor um but not all it was

353
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:51,120
not all bad but um he was familiar with

354
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,039
vertical

355
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,879
farming uh through a farm actually out

356
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:59,000
in Nevada as well called The Grove I

357
00:16:56,879 --> 00:17:00,919
don't know if you've heard of them but

358
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,199
but they were a

359
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:05,879
two-tiered um uh they were growing in

360
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:08,720
soil and auto pots but they were a

361
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:12,439
two-tiered LED grow in outside of Las

362
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,279
Vegas or in Las Vegas so uh he advised

363
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:18,000
us to look into vertical

364
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:20,759
farming um we eventually got rid of that

365
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,759
advisor I was introduced to Michael

366
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:27,519
Williamson uh I think he works he's

367
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:29,519
worth pip now um but he he cut his teeth

368
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,599
in the industry doing

369
00:17:29,519 --> 00:17:35,038
um managing big grows like big outdoor

370
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:36,918
grows as well as vertical farms and

371
00:17:35,038 --> 00:17:39,359
helping people set up their facilities

372
00:17:36,919 --> 00:17:41,880
so I was introduced to him through

373
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:45,719
fluence and he really helped us out with

374
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:48,280
the facility uh design and layout um cuz

375
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,839
I just I've never managed a facility

376
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:51,759
that big we wanted to make sure that we

377
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:54,359
were going to get the dry room sizes

378
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:59,279
right uh the veg room the mother space

379
00:17:54,359 --> 00:18:01,479
all that um the equipment selection y um

380
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:03,960
so he was huge in helping us develop

381
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,519
those vertical farming Sops and just

382
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,880
helping us uh wrapping our head around

383
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:13,400
vertical farming so really uh we came

384
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:15,559
across or we needed to do vertical

385
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:19,038
farming just purely out of necessity of

386
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:21,558
being in a urban dens environment and we

387
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,960
could only build up and we had to fit

388
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:26,720
everything that we needed to do so it's

389
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,720
purely out of

390
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:31,759
necessity

391
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,759
yeah and I think you brought up a good

392
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:35,919
point in terms of facility design

393
00:18:33,759 --> 00:18:37,919
there's a lot of other aspects that need

394
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,320
to come into play and we haven't even

395
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,000
talked about like HVAC and and

396
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:44,558
electrical and things like that but just

397
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,599
even like I I know with your facility

398
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:48,759
having places to Stage

399
00:18:46,599 --> 00:18:51,639
material uh was in something that you

400
00:18:48,759 --> 00:18:54,919
had to consider I always like a facility

401
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,440
to have a quarantine and or R&amp;D space

402
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:58,240
because at some point in time if you're

403
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,440
bringing in new genetics you don't want

404
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,319
to bring them directly into the facility

405
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,880
it'd be nice to have a space where you

406
00:19:02,319 --> 00:19:07,079
can grow them for a month or two and

407
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,760
make sure they're truly clean that's

408
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:11,319
separate from everything else before

409
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:15,558
they actually go into your production

410
00:19:11,319 --> 00:19:17,759
portion of your facility um any sort of

411
00:19:15,558 --> 00:19:18,918
before we get into the vertical aspect

412
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,879
what what do you feel like you guys

413
00:19:18,919 --> 00:19:23,640
really nailed with this buildout um in

414
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,880
terms of considerations and what things

415
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,919
do you wish you know in retrospect You'

416
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:31,600
done differently uh well I think overall

417
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:35,640
all uh because it's a purpose you know

418
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:37,678
groundup uh facility it's it's truly

419
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:40,080
state-of-the-art and one of one of a

420
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:42,120
kind um so I think there's a lot of

421
00:19:40,079 --> 00:19:44,678
things we did do right I think HVAC

422
00:19:42,119 --> 00:19:46,319
equipment selection our environmental

423
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:49,798
controls and

424
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:53,439
sensors um and just the layout and

425
00:19:49,798 --> 00:19:56,759
design overall um cuz it it it's working

426
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,159
um as far as things that can you can you

427
00:19:56,759 --> 00:20:02,480
touch on that really quick like uh what

428
00:19:59,159 --> 00:20:04,640
brands you're using even for HVAC and

429
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,400
and some of the things there that were

430
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,360
really you know because you are

431
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,600
stateoftheart like can you describe some

432
00:20:08,359 --> 00:20:11,479
of the things that you guys have in your

433
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:13,879
facility that you know most facilities

434
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:16,440
may not have or even be aware of yeah so

435
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,880
for HVAC equipment we went with a

436
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,919
company called cultiva um I can't

437
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,039
remember who's their main manufacturer

438
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:25,000
could be train or something but these

439
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:28,279
are you know specifically designed

440
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:32,359
packaged units uh that are meant to De

441
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:35,359
DEH ify first and then cool second um so

442
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:38,038
we have I think well over 200 tons of AC

443
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:40,519
just on our roof um and then our

444
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,119
environmental control system so we use

445
00:20:40,519 --> 00:20:46,440
all industrial grade sensors um and then

446
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:50,119
the whole system was custom designed

447
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:53,880
with myself and David uh luou he was

448
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:55,918
formerly of grow remote so grow remote

449
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,799
uh is the company he David doesn't work

450
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:00,520
with them anymore just because uh

451
00:20:58,798 --> 00:21:04,079
they've had to shrink their staff and

452
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:07,000
stuff but um yeah we we did a custom

453
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:08,960
custom catered built design with the

454
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,759
environmental control system so is me

455
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,519
and David working on every aspect of

456
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,359
that from water

457
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:22,918
irrigation um you know our reverse

458
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:26,399
osmosis condensate reclaim uh what types

459
00:21:22,919 --> 00:21:28,120
of sensors placement of sensors um yeah

460
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,880
just basic basically everything from

461
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:35,719
start to finish um I would say yeah our

462
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,200
equipment and then the environment our

463
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:40,880
environmental control system are like

464
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:44,000
the two main things that make us uh

465
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
stand out from other

466
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:49,599
facilities I remember in your talk there

467
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,360
was something related to airf flow that

468
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,278
you wished you had done a little bit

469
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:55,199
differently in at least one of the rooms

470
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:58,400
uh could

471
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:02,120
you go into that really quickly yeah so

472
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,600
uh you know five five six years ago we

473
00:22:02,119 --> 00:22:07,158
just didn't know what we know now in

474
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:11,439
terms of vertical farming and

475
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:14,200
HVAC airflow room design so in our

476
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,759
design we have the supplies at the top

477
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:22,558
of the room and we have one one return

478
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:25,519
per room uh kind of on the on um ground

479
00:22:22,558 --> 00:22:28,558
level tucked away in one of the corners

480
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:30,639
well now that we we've learned a lot I

481
00:22:28,558 --> 00:22:35,240
ideally you want

482
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:39,080
the um the supplies on the ground on one

483
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:40,880
end of the room on uh floor level and

484
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:42,519
then on the opposite end of the room

485
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,159
towards the top of the room is where you

486
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:48,679
want your returns so you're able to pull

487
00:22:45,159 --> 00:22:51,559
that cool cool air completely through uh

488
00:22:48,679 --> 00:22:55,200
your canopy and then as far as inner

489
00:22:51,558 --> 00:22:59,399
canopy Air Flow Design um we've tried

490
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:02,798
duck socks and oversized you know fans

491
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:05,880
that are pushing large CFM but even in a

492
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:08,440
40 foot uh row which is the length of

493
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:13,000
our rows in most of our rooms it's still

494
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:16,880
not enough so um ideally you would want

495
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,960
to be running fans from either staggered

496
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,159
on opposite ends of the room or you

497
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:24,159
would want them in the same row facing

498
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:27,679
each other because you're not going to

499
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:30,200
have enough cfms to push that entire 40

500
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,159
ft no matter what you think with the

501
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,480
duck sock it just it doesn't work so we

502
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,240
actually just went back to oscillating

503
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,519
fans for the inner canopy air flow cuz

504
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:45,000
that just works better um that could be

505
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:47,879
the space of our um tear it could be the

506
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,200
fact that uh we're doing living soil in

507
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:52,840
these beds and how much you know

508
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:56,080
moisture uh that's perspiring into the

509
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:59,918
air um could be a a number of different

510
00:23:56,079 --> 00:24:04,639
things but we found that um our air flow

511
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:07,240
and humidity is lower obviously on the

512
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,080
top tier but it's easier to control than

513
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:13,558
the inner canopy so it's really hard to

514
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:18,678
achieve um inner canopy airf flow

515
00:24:13,558 --> 00:24:18,678
without uh just the right equipment or

516
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:28,840
design yeah in my uh homow I'm doing a a

517
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:31,398
poor man's version of uh duck socks

518
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:32,759
essentially because you can't get them

519
00:24:31,398 --> 00:24:34,278
you have to have a certain commercial

520
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,200
scale to make it even worthwhile you're

521
00:24:34,278 --> 00:24:39,558
not buying 10 feet of them for example

522
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:42,120
yeah or whatever so I used um Greenhouse

523
00:24:39,558 --> 00:24:44,119
convection tubing that had prepunched

524
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:45,959
holes in it and hooked that up to a fan

525
00:24:44,119 --> 00:24:48,239
and that's I I've been pretty happy with

526
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:50,480
that um in terms of the air flow that

527
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,960
I'm getting um so that's been kind of a

528
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,480
fun thing if people want to check it out

529
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:55,200
I've put it up on Instagram and I'll

530
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:59,159
I'll be starting another cycle here now

531
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,519
that I'm home from the soil Summit so um

532
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:02,919
yeah that's that's really interesting I

533
00:25:00,519 --> 00:25:05,720
appreciate you sharing that

534
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:07,440
um other than the HVAC is there anything

535
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,120
that you would have done differently in

536
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,480
terms of the build

537
00:25:10,119 --> 00:25:16,158
itself yeah I I think we would have

538
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:18,480
gotten um well one also reheat uh we

539
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,159
should have gotten reheat in the HVAC I

540
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,079
think that makes a big difference in

541
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:25,880
preventing temperature swings during the

542
00:25:22,079 --> 00:25:29,119
lights off period um I would have gotten

543
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,679
better drain placement as as well in the

544
00:25:29,119 --> 00:25:34,319
rooms I think that would have helped

545
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,960
more

546
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:39,000
um that's pretty much it I'm pretty

547
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,919
happy with their buildout and design but

548
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,679
those those are like the few things that

549
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,679
we would have done

550
00:25:44,839 --> 00:25:50,519
differently what where is your current

551
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:52,278
drains in in the rooms and why where

552
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:54,918
would you move them to I I actually

553
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:58,359
don't know so yeah I I don't know that

554
00:25:54,919 --> 00:26:01,399
about your so we have and this is from

555
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:03,759
part partly push back from the owner too

556
00:26:01,398 --> 00:26:06,558
you know it's it's a tough balance with

557
00:26:03,759 --> 00:26:09,480
a big project

558
00:26:06,558 --> 00:26:11,519
um getting your needs across and then

559
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:14,679
also making that argument with the owner

560
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:16,798
or contractor so he was kind of against

561
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,200
uh getting any floor drains of any kind

562
00:26:16,798 --> 00:26:21,798
in the room but we just have small uh

563
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,798
Corner drains maybe one or two in each

564
00:26:21,798 --> 00:26:25,960
of the flower rooms but I would have

565
00:26:23,798 --> 00:26:28,038
done a um I can't remember the the name

566
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:30,720
the style of the drain but I would have

567
00:26:28,038 --> 00:26:33,640
got like more of a continuous run in the

568
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:35,679
front of the room so you have a bigger

569
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:37,960
drain to like clean your floors and

570
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:39,360
stuff that also has its challenges

571
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:42,360
because you have to keep that drain

572
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:43,879
constantly clean um but yeah it just

573
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,319
would have helped with just cleaning

574
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:47,320
more with with better drain

575
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:52,519
placement you're even lucky to have

576
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:53,960
drains honestly a lot of facilities work

577
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:57,480
with don't have drains and then trying

578
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:59,679
to retrofit that sucks so it's expensive

579
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:04,038
that that's

580
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:06,519
good yeah so moving on to the vertical

581
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:09,919
farming aspect are there any tips or

582
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:11,440
pointers uh for going vertical uh I know

583
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,278
you and I talked ahead of time that you

584
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,720
would not have you would not in

585
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:19,000
retrospect go vertical if you weren't

586
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,278
forced to based on your building um what

587
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,960
are the what are the challenges and what

588
00:27:21,278 --> 00:27:27,200
are some tips oh gosh I mean a lot of

589
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,880
challenges it takes it takes longer to

590
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,519
do certain tasks

591
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,840
um because we're we're us utilizing

592
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:37,519
scissor lifts to work on the second tier

593
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:39,720
just because it's it's safer than maybe

594
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,720
putting up some type of temporary

595
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:45,919
catwalk system um or something like that

596
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:47,960
but so we use scissor lifts um so tasks

597
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,480
take longer in that respect uh there was

598
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:53,640
a little bit of a learning curve with

599
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:54,720
that and um just getting getting the

600
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,759
team

601
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,440
to um to check out the second tier

602
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:03,158
enough to make sure that it's getting

603
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:07,519
adequately watered uh scouting for uh

604
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:09,519
pest pressure um stuff like that so it's

605
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,679
easier to manage stuff that's on the

606
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:14,519
ground floor cuz we're just walking on

607
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:18,399
it all the time it's it's much harder to

608
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:21,120
get your team even two days a week to

609
00:28:18,398 --> 00:28:22,719
spend all day up on the second tier

610
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:26,199
making sure everything's getting taken

611
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:28,720
care of because because of the style of

612
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,720
um growing that we're doing we have to

613
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,200
give these plants that extra attention

614
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:37,480
to make sure that we're we're getting uh

615
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,960
Boutique quality cannabis otherwise it's

616
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,519
just impossible to compete in the

617
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,919
established you know California Market

618
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:46,640
um so yeah just

619
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:48,360
workflow

620
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,679
um

621
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:53,240
tips yeah I would I mean I wouldn't do

622
00:28:50,679 --> 00:28:57,840
it if you don't have to do it that's

623
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:59,759
that's that would be a big tip but uh um

624
00:28:57,839 --> 00:29:01,119
God yeah just making the time and

625
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:03,839
scheduling

626
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:08,278
appropriately um also I've noticed on

627
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:11,359
the second tier with airflow um the beds

628
00:29:08,278 --> 00:29:13,000
can get uh more of a dryback or just

629
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,879
less water so you just have to make sure

630
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,319
they're getting watered adequately and

631
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:22,240
uh the humidity is just a little bit

632
00:29:17,319 --> 00:29:25,158
lower too so um that and I would grow

633
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:28,159
strains that are easier to manage so

634
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:31,600
strains that you know um that trellis

635
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,960
easy or um you don't have to thin out as

636
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:36,719
much um yeah just less canopy management

637
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,880
you would want to put those on on your

638
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,880
second tier or third

639
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:46,200
tier have you not well I have two

640
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:49,440
questions so the first one would be if

641
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:52,440
you had to guess at a percentage of

642
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,720
time uh how much more time would you say

643
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,320
that second tier costs you because you

644
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:59,120
have to utilize scissor lless you have

645
00:29:56,319 --> 00:30:00,918
to go up and down um it's just harder to

646
00:29:59,119 --> 00:30:05,359
get to and

647
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:05,360
access great question

648
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:11,240
uh I mean we probably have versus like

649
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:14,080
another grow that wasn't growing

650
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:17,720
vertically we probably have to have two

651
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:20,798
to three more staff full-time staff than

652
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:24,640
what a nonvertical grow would need just

653
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:27,038
just to for that extra time uh needing

654
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,278
to spend on on grow tasks so like if you

655
00:30:27,038 --> 00:30:30,558
had a task

656
00:30:29,278 --> 00:30:31,839
yeah if you had a task like let's just

657
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:34,599
say like def

658
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:38,240
defoliating how long if it were to take

659
00:30:34,599 --> 00:30:40,639
you I don't know half a day to do the

660
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,880
lower tier how long would you budget for

661
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,080
that upper tier sort of a

662
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:48,799
thing maybe it would take you know 3/4

663
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,519
of a day or something cuz what what we

664
00:30:48,798 --> 00:30:52,319
would do in that instance we would try

665
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:54,679
to get at least two scissor lists in

666
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:57,240
that room so we're having two people in

667
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:59,399
each lift maybe working on opposite

668
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:04,278
sides of each of each other or in that

669
00:30:59,398 --> 00:31:06,839
same row so I mean it might add an

670
00:31:04,278 --> 00:31:10,159
extra you know two to four hours

671
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:10,158
depending on what the task

672
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:18,360
is okay and uh how much of an issue is

673
00:31:15,038 --> 00:31:20,720
stuff uh dropping down onto that lower

674
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:24,798
canopy you know your plants down below

675
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:26,558
with disturbance or dust or or Leaf

676
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,200
matter when you are defiling things like

677
00:31:26,558 --> 00:31:30,480
that is that an issue at all for for you

678
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,240
guys yeah no definitely uh you know you

679
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,839
get some when you're de leafing you get

680
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,319
some leaves that drop down so just

681
00:31:33,839 --> 00:31:38,119
having to go through the bottom canopy

682
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:40,079
and just grabbing those making sure that

683
00:31:38,119 --> 00:31:44,119
they're not stuck in that canopy on the

684
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:45,638
bottom tier um oh I guess another point

685
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,038
I should have brought up as far as

686
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:49,638
things uh or tips for people with

687
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:53,440
vertical grow or things we would have

688
00:31:49,638 --> 00:31:57,359
done differently is drainage for runoff

689
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,399
on your second tier so we accounted for

690
00:31:57,359 --> 00:32:01,079
it

691
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:03,479
but we didn't account for cracked trays

692
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:05,599
because of the weight of the soil um

693
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,278
there's uh that was probably the biggest

694
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:08,798
thing so even if you do have drainage

695
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:11,480
for runoff we would still get some

696
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:13,558
cracks in those trays so we get

697
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,278
sometimes if there's too much runoff

698
00:32:13,558 --> 00:32:18,918
which obviously we try to avoid um but

699
00:32:16,278 --> 00:32:22,200
with the blue mats sometimes floods

700
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:25,759
happen um so we've had to hang like 5

701
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,639
gallon construction buckets under those

702
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:30,558
points where the tray might be cracked

703
00:32:27,638 --> 00:32:32,798
just to capture any possible runoff to

704
00:32:30,558 --> 00:32:36,240
prevent that from dripping onto the

705
00:32:32,798 --> 00:32:40,119
plants on the bottom tier or dripping

706
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,638
onto the lights or the floor and more

707
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:43,158
importantly the plants cuz if you're

708
00:32:41,638 --> 00:32:46,119
getting that runoff water on those

709
00:32:43,159 --> 00:32:51,480
plants you might run into Bettis or some

710
00:32:46,119 --> 00:32:51,479
kind of um fungal issue later in

711
00:32:53,679 --> 00:32:59,759
flower yeah that would be a challenge uh

712
00:32:57,278 --> 00:33:02,558
let's let's touch on that for people

713
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,960
because um how I know someone had asked

714
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:09,200
me like how deep are your beds oh gosh

715
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,200
ours are at least 14 inches

716
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:17,120
now okay they're about 14 inches deep

717
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:21,519
and okay and uh oh shoot I had another

718
00:33:17,119 --> 00:33:22,319
question just based on it um oh are you

719
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,919
in

720
00:33:22,319 --> 00:33:28,398
4x4 beds 4 by eight beds what are the

721
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:31,120
length the sizes of your beds

722
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,599
4 by8 this is a question I have because

723
00:33:31,119 --> 00:33:36,798
I'm always trying to talk people into

724
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:39,798
4x4 beds o over a 4 by8 bed because I

725
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:41,558
think it gives you one more replication

726
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:45,000
so it's a better it's a smaller data

727
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:47,519
point and or end value higher end value

728
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,839
and then also if you have an issue like

729
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,120
a cracked tray maybe you could only

730
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:54,798
remove a half yard of soil instead of a

731
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:56,879
full yard assuming a 10in depth so you'd

732
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:59,599
actually have more than that anyway but

733
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,120
are there any advant to a 4x8 other than

734
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:04,798
a slight savings and

735
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:07,719
cost um what what are your thoughts on

736
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,398
that that's a great question um I don't

737
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,679
know if I've put too much thought into

738
00:34:09,398 --> 00:34:14,638
it I think the biggest difference

739
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,960
between like a 4x4 and a 4x8 as you said

740
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,039
it would be like costs like you know you

741
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,440
might be spending more on uh components

742
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:23,559
for your irrigation system in a 4x4

743
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:27,398
versus a

744
00:34:23,559 --> 00:34:29,199
4x8 um so maybe more points of failure

745
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:31,519
or you're just needing more

746
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:34,878
parts

747
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:37,559
um yeah I don't I don't know I mean I

748
00:34:34,878 --> 00:34:41,639
just felt like a 4x8 was was the right

749
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:44,000
move um and in case there was an issue I

750
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:45,679
felt like it would be easier to deal

751
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,440
with that whether it's like a pathogen

752
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,559
or some kind of pest in the soil like a

753
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:54,679
root feeding nematode or whatever it may

754
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:58,199
be um yeah but yeah I think it would

755
00:34:54,679 --> 00:35:02,039
just be excuse me just more cost from uh

756
00:34:58,199 --> 00:35:02,039
for more parts for like

757
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:09,400
irrigation yeah I definitely like a

758
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,040
smaller like you said a 4 by8 even I I

759
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,079
don't want a 40ft row of soil if I can

760
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:16,800
avoid it just because if you do have an

761
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,079
issue like a pathogen or something let's

762
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,480
say the fertility gets wacky in a bed

763
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:23,280
you can always just pull out a smaller

764
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,679
section of soil if you ever did have to

765
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:26,920
replace something so that is kind of

766
00:35:24,679 --> 00:35:28,159
future proofing yourself you mentioned

767
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,000
irrigation

768
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:32,000
that's an interesting point and I let's

769
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,480
let's start talking about blue mats

770
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:38,559
because our the design that we use for

771
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:42,440
blue mats uh that we've come up with is

772
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:45,960
a 4x4 design that's modular so it would

773
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:47,800
be the same for me in a 4x4 as it you

774
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:50,119
know we just d double it in a 4 by eight

775
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,760
so the number of Parts wouldn't change

776
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:54,400
what is I know you use blue mats as well

777
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:56,119
because I I saw your presentation we've

778
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,920
talked about it

779
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:01,838
um what is what are what does your

780
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:04,000
design look like uh for blue mats let's

781
00:36:01,838 --> 00:36:05,799
start there and then we'll talk about

782
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:08,519
your overall feelings about blue mats

783
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:10,640
pros and cons for people who haven't

784
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:12,440
haven't considered them so I've done all

785
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,598
kinds of different layouts with blue

786
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:19,679
mats I've been using them or working

787
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:24,559
with them for at least six years now um

788
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:26,960
initially we started uh off with uh like

789
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,119
the the drip not the drip tape but like

790
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,159
the the little drippers we use two

791
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:36,920
different carrots uh we used a 6 in and

792
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:39,318
a 9 in at different points in the bed um

793
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:43,318
so I've tried that I've tried the blue

794
00:36:39,318 --> 00:36:45,800
soak tape in a variety of different

795
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:47,159
layouts currently or what we did

796
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:50,720
initially with the

797
00:36:47,159 --> 00:36:54,838
setup uh gosh I think we started with

798
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:57,598
6in carrots and then um we kind of did

799
00:36:54,838 --> 00:37:00,960
like almost like a figure8 type design

800
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,519
around the plants um and then we moved

801
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,519
to a 9-in carrot um and kind of modified

802
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:09,800
the tape so it it would be touching uh

803
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:13,199
the corners and the sides a little bit

804
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:17,440
more um and then recently Cooper from

805
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:20,639
bloat he stopped by with their new

806
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:23,200
design which is using blue soaked tape

807
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:26,920
it's four rows of it running the length

808
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:29,879
of the bed from corner to corner with a

809
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:33,559
one prep pressure reducer manifold I

810
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,640
think it's at like 10 psi um that design

811
00:37:33,559 --> 00:37:39,000
has been working great so the new layout

812
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:40,358
and design that they came up with um I

813
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,800
don't know if you were a part of that at

814
00:37:40,358 --> 00:37:46,199
all um but that that worked out really

815
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,760
well um so I'm happy to see that room

816
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:53,118
working I might fluctuate on the side of

817
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:55,000
overwater versus underwatered but I'd

818
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,800
rather be overwatered in living soil

819
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,960
than

820
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,039
underwatered um

821
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,679
and

822
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:03,400
then yeah it's it's been a challenge

823
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,639
though with the blue mats

824
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:08,599
but we need we can't hand water all of

825
00:38:06,639 --> 00:38:11,519
our rooms there's just we have six

826
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:14,079
flowering rooms 8,500 Square ft of

827
00:38:11,519 --> 00:38:17,318
canopy with you know the two tiers it's

828
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:20,039
just not feasible so um I needed the

829
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:22,920
blue mats to work I think they've worked

830
00:38:20,039 --> 00:38:24,960
overall but also you know just to be

831
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,800
frank I've also baned my head against

832
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:32,559
the wall dealing with these because it's

833
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:35,039
um you know we go in into rooms where

834
00:38:32,559 --> 00:38:38,318
there's floods and water on the floor

835
00:38:35,039 --> 00:38:41,199
and now I'm having to pay staff to you

836
00:38:38,318 --> 00:38:44,559
know shop back water for three or four

837
00:38:41,199 --> 00:38:47,199
hours or drain the the lines um

838
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:51,159
underneath the trays um the drain lines

839
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:52,879
so um it's it's been a challenge but

840
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:54,879
also I'm trying to work with them

841
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,519
because I I need this to work and I've

842
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,079
seen good results with it too where

843
00:38:56,519 --> 00:39:01,559
we've hit really good metrics in living

844
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:05,400
soil with with uh some of the cultivars

845
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:08,000
we're growing so um yeah some good some

846
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:11,400
good and some bad but uh I like the

847
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,239
direction that they're heading in um I

848
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,880
don't want to spend more money though

849
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:16,639
we've already spent enough

850
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,119
money

851
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:23,799
uh you know installing it that's that's

852
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,599
my only complaint with the new manifold

853
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:29,400
design is that all those parts and

854
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:32,720
pieces are more expensive and there are

855
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:36,000
also potential fail points that being

856
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:38,078
said um I think I think it's a perfectly

857
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,358
good design we

858
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:42,480
use we use with the blue mats when we

859
00:39:40,358 --> 00:39:44,318
recommend them we use kind of a spiral

860
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,199
similar to your s design but just a more

861
00:39:44,318 --> 00:39:47,759
of a spiral with the I I like the

862
00:39:46,199 --> 00:39:50,559
shorter carrot I want to read the depth

863
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,440
a little short a little shallower than

864
00:39:50,559 --> 00:39:56,000
the Maxi but

865
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:57,400
um it'd be interesting to do uh to AB

866
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,000
test this because I haven't I have

867
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:03,559
haven't done that yet um but I thought I

868
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,719
think your review of blue mats is very

869
00:40:03,559 --> 00:40:07,318
very honest I think folks going into

870
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,719
them should realize that there's a

871
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:13,559
learning curve and there are challenges

872
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:15,679
but also every irrigation system has the

873
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:17,480
has the potential for leaks and floods

874
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:20,519
and these things so there's no perfect

875
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:23,400
solution out there the only upgrade I

876
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:25,679
would consider would be a a

877
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,639
commercial system like something from

878
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:29,559
dram where you have uh uh you know a

879
00:40:28,639 --> 00:40:31,960
very

880
00:40:29,559 --> 00:40:33,679
industrial built-in tensiometer that's

881
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:36,318
reading the moisture content in the bed

882
00:40:33,679 --> 00:40:38,199
and then irrigating that bed

883
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:40,719
specifically for that similar to what

884
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:44,199
the blue mats do um but this would you

885
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:47,199
know require electricity it would be ex

886
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:50,519
ex very expensive compared to the the

887
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:53,759
cost of Entry the blue mats offer so

888
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:57,119
unless you have the budget to really go

889
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,920
you know all in on irrigation management

890
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,358
um I think the blue mats are a very good

891
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:05,720
entrylevel solution for facilities or

892
00:41:03,358 --> 00:41:08,598
even for homeg Growers I'm G set them up

893
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:12,318
for my next run at my house here

894
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:13,920
um that that are that that make sense so

895
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:15,599
I don't know anything you want to add to

896
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,519
that no I think I think I think you're

897
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:22,680
you're right um I think it's blue matat

898
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,679
is great for hom Growers um and and it

899
00:41:22,679 --> 00:41:28,559
could be great for a commercial setup

900
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:30,239
too um yeah there's there's definitely a

901
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,960
huge learning curve I think they've

902
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:36,639
learned a lot um they're always making

903
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:40,199
improvements um I like their sop that

904
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,838
they've developed with the hanging drip

905
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:44,838
um yeah but also we're we're looking

906
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:47,039
into implementing a different style of

907
00:41:44,838 --> 00:41:49,480
irrigation in one of our rooms too

908
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:51,279
because uh something similar to what you

909
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:53,559
just described because we already have

910
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,680
that capability with our environmental

911
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:57,400
control system so for us it would

912
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,919
probably be pretty cheap to set up in

913
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,559
one of our rooms and get something like

914
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:04,119
that going uh cuz we already have the in

915
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:06,719
infrastructure in place so um we're

916
00:42:04,119 --> 00:42:10,119
going to look into that uh when we get

917
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:13,000
some more money and can afford to do

918
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:14,760
that interesting interesting yeah I have

919
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,480
to give credit to the guys over at

920
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,160
sustain of the village for really

921
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:21,960
continuing to innovate with the product

922
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:23,159
and come up with new Solutions so um

923
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,599
yeah and I really like I really like

924
00:42:23,159 --> 00:42:29,759
what they're doing we also sell blue

925
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:32,519
mats like they do uh we just have a

926
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:33,960
slightly different design philosophy but

927
00:42:32,519 --> 00:42:37,400
it's very close and I think either

928
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:41,280
system would work so yeah uh let's move

929
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:44,079
on let's talk about soil and fertility

930
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,920
management um you you mentioned you

931
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:49,480
started with k&amp;f and had good results um

932
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,960
that's really interesting I I didn't

933
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,440
know any of that part of your journey I

934
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,800
didn't meet you until or really connect

935
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,800
with you on soil management until much

936
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,039
later um what what did it look like when

937
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:03,480
you first opened the facility then and

938
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:08,199
then how did you get to where you are

939
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:11,199
now oh man yeah the last year has been

940
00:43:08,199 --> 00:43:14,239
huge and just um learning a lot about

941
00:43:11,199 --> 00:43:18,759
soil F fertility especially you know

942
00:43:14,239 --> 00:43:21,959
living soil or soilless media indoors um

943
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:25,480
I didn't realize the challenges as far

944
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:28,559
as making sure that um that soil remains

945
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,440
fertile because we're trying to you know

946
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:36,119
get four and a half turns a year per

947
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:38,159
room so um it's it's not it's not as

948
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:41,720
idealistic as one might think with

949
00:43:38,159 --> 00:43:44,039
living soil indoors and trying to be

950
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:48,318
sustainable and

951
00:43:44,039 --> 00:43:52,239
um yeah so uh we started off with fully

952
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:53,440
charged um soil uh from a well-known

953
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:54,959
soil

954
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,559
company

955
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:02,960
um had you know really really good

956
00:43:57,559 --> 00:44:06,720
results good yields at first um and then

957
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,679
um gosh I'm just trying to think back uh

958
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:11,480
we were mulching at the time we did some

959
00:44:09,679 --> 00:44:13,199
cover cropping

960
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,800
diondra

961
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:19,719
mustard um barley stuff like that and uh

962
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:21,800
you know learned a lot about companion

963
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:26,558
planting and cover cropping too what not

964
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:27,920
to do uh what you can do I kind of lean

965
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:30,240
uh more

966
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:32,760
with with where you stand on on

967
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:37,479
companion planting indoors I think it

968
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:40,079
can be more of a problem um than

969
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:41,960
beneficial um I think no matter what

970
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,839
you're going to attract pest even with

971
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:51,760
diondra I've seen it um I think it could

972
00:44:45,838 --> 00:44:54,000
be good or uh or utiliz to maybe uh to

973
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,599
capture pet pest kind of like a banker

974
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,119
system but um we primarily rely on a

975
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:04,640
mulch layer uh to keep our you know

976
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,039
risos spere going and and um keeping

977
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,118
those microbes and fungi alive I see

978
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:12,800
better results with that um We've ran

979
00:45:10,119 --> 00:45:15,440
into pill bug issues like Steve has

980
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,240
talked about with the chop and drop so

981
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,240
we've definitely moved away from that um

982
00:45:19,239 --> 00:45:25,558
we've learned a lot about um making sure

983
00:45:22,239 --> 00:45:29,199
to test all of your inputs uh in your

984
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:31,760
soil and where your sourcing your soil

985
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:35,639
um cuz you don't want to contribute to

986
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:38,440
heavy metals because of you know how

987
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:41,480
good a bioaccumulator cannabis is it'll

988
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:43,400
pick that up no matter what you do um so

989
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:47,079
we've had to deal with heavy metal

990
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:49,680
issues uh due to some inputs in our soil

991
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:52,760
um I've thrown the kitchen sink at it

992
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:55,759
we've tried manipulating pH adding

993
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:58,240
biochar pulling soil out adding new soil

994
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,640
in um

995
00:45:58,239 --> 00:46:05,039
utilizing mushrooms I've planted hemp

996
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:08,719
before we planted cannabis to try to get

997
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:12,960
it out um we've done a variety of

998
00:46:08,719 --> 00:46:14,719
different things um you my experience

999
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,400
with heavy metals there's literally

1000
00:46:14,719 --> 00:46:21,399
nothing you can do unless you want to

1001
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,639
replace the soil or after so many rounds

1002
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,240
of just pulling it out naturally with

1003
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:28,838
with cannabis so we've had it yeah we've

1004
00:46:26,239 --> 00:46:30,838
had some challeng es with that um but

1005
00:46:28,838 --> 00:46:32,679
also we've had plenty of rooms that have

1006
00:46:30,838 --> 00:46:36,358
passed just fine and where we haven't

1007
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:40,480
had to deal with heavy metals um yeah

1008
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:43,880
but soil fertility overall

1009
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,599
um I've learned not that we weren't

1010
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:48,280
testing our soil

1011
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:50,599
before but I I've just come to the

1012
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:53,000
realization how how important it is to

1013
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:55,440
test your soil at the same time like so

1014
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:58,039
we test we kind of follow what your

1015
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:01,119
guys' sop so just for the audience we

1016
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:05,358
work very closely with Tad and his team

1017
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:08,960
with Brandon uh we submit a soil sample

1018
00:47:05,358 --> 00:47:11,799
around uh after 8 weeks in flower so

1019
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:13,838
we're kind of getting the same snapshot

1020
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,119
in time of where rooms are we try to

1021
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:19,519
take different points in the room just

1022
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:21,838
to try to get a general idea um and then

1023
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:23,639
we go off of uh Brandon's

1024
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,199
recommendations or working with them

1025
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:30,480
being like hey we need to get our yields

1026
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:32,719
up can we bump you know X Y or Z up um

1027
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:35,599
so I think it's uh super critical

1028
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:38,679
especially in a commercial setting where

1029
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,280
you're trying to hit certain metrics um

1030
00:47:38,679 --> 00:47:42,879
you need to be doing soil testing and

1031
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:45,519
you need to be making sure that the

1032
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,760
inputs that you're using are uh clean

1033
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:47,759
and

1034
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:53,639
tested yeah I I mentioned this a lot you

1035
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,559
know when we Harvest a plant we're

1036
00:47:53,639 --> 00:47:57,159
pulling out organic matter and we're P

1037
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:00,079
pulling out nutrients and those things

1038
00:47:57,159 --> 00:48:03,279
need to be replaced every cycle so it's

1039
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:05,800
important that uh that we take that into

1040
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:09,680
account when we're when we're thinking

1041
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:12,599
about Harvest and um yeah Also to

1042
00:48:09,679 --> 00:48:14,318
clarify for listeners um you you

1043
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:17,720
originally did not have our soil in the

1044
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:19,440
facility that wasn't um contributing to

1045
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:21,159
your heavy metal issues when you were

1046
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,679
dealing with that in caseing you was

1047
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:26,480
listening we've we've been pretty

1048
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:29,000
successful at at sort of mitigating

1049
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:30,719
heavy Metals I would say uh but there

1050
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:33,719
are all the challenges that you listed

1051
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:38,318
in terms of understanding your inputs um

1052
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:39,159
and knowing that that tests can be um I

1053
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:41,400
don't want to say tests can be

1054
00:48:39,159 --> 00:48:43,318
manipulated but it's important to know

1055
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,599
what it's important to do your own

1056
00:48:43,318 --> 00:48:48,558
testing and one thing that you and I

1057
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,640
talked about off air beforehand was I

1058
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:54,880
had done some testing with a lab um that

1059
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:58,159
was using xrf technology instead of

1060
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:59,640
icpms um and it wasn't I did not fully

1061
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:01,679
understand it at the time and what I did

1062
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:04,960
not realize was that the the detection

1063
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:07,039
limits for that technology were not

1064
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,679
stringent enough to give me the

1065
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:12,159
information that I needed to make a good

1066
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:13,759
decision so for example and I'm I'm

1067
00:49:12,159 --> 00:49:16,199
going to make up some numbers here but

1068
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:18,799
it'll they'll be close for arsenic it

1069
00:49:16,199 --> 00:49:21,118
might not detect anything under 6 PPM so

1070
00:49:18,798 --> 00:49:23,559
it'll give back a non-detect

1071
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:25,640
non-detectable level as an answer or for

1072
00:49:23,559 --> 00:49:28,880
lead it might be 10 PPM and so it comes

1073
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:31,719
back non-detectable so if I had 9 PPM of

1074
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,960
lead and 5 PPM of arsenic in that soil

1075
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:36,598
or in that product it would come back

1076
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:39,240
nondetectable as if it was not there and

1077
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:41,400
those levels are just frankly too high

1078
00:49:39,239 --> 00:49:44,239
in a regulatory Market to feel

1079
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:47,760
comfortable passing so you have to

1080
00:49:44,239 --> 00:49:49,519
understand the test and I would just

1081
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,599
throw out as a guy don't trust test you

1082
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:53,199
see on social media to necessarily

1083
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:56,838
reflect what's in the actual product

1084
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:58,759
that you're receiving um that's just

1085
00:49:56,838 --> 00:50:01,199
advice for folks do you want to add

1086
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:03,599
anything to that Chris or I I mean move

1087
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:06,318
on no I mean I think that's fantastic

1088
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:08,480
points um yeah you have to understand

1089
00:50:06,318 --> 00:50:10,079
the method of testing or the equipment

1090
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:13,400
that you're using and making sure that

1091
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,960
it's accurate enough so you can feel

1092
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:17,680
comfortable with um the decision that

1093
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,199
you're making making sure that the soil

1094
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:23,558
or inputs you're using are clean and

1095
00:50:20,199 --> 00:50:26,000
just to add on yeah you can't take what

1096
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:28,599
someone posts on social media as just

1097
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:30,798
truth or accurate accurate when it comes

1098
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:34,280
to testing like like Tad said you have

1099
00:50:30,798 --> 00:50:38,559
to do your own testing in due diligence

1100
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:38,559
it's uh I can't stress that

1101
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,679
enough and now you're you've got a

1102
00:50:41,519 --> 00:50:45,400
program that seems to be working um you

1103
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,719
have some of our s in the facility now

1104
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:51,000
but not exclusively and uh it seems like

1105
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:54,399
youve figured out how to manage and pass

1106
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:55,719
successfully now which is awesome so

1107
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,240
because California has very tight

1108
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:59,759
regulations around heavy

1109
00:50:57,239 --> 00:51:01,719
yeah no no things are looking up and and

1110
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:03,640
much better and and we're we're happy to

1111
00:51:01,719 --> 00:51:05,598
be yeah working with you guys you guys

1112
00:51:03,639 --> 00:51:08,039
are providing all the soil for our veg

1113
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,160
and and Mom program so that soil is

1114
00:51:08,039 --> 00:51:12,960
getting put back into our our flower

1115
00:51:11,159 --> 00:51:15,879
rooms and we're using other inputs that

1116
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:18,760
you provide as well but um yeah things

1117
00:51:15,880 --> 00:51:22,440
things have been great man so uh but

1118
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:24,839
yeah lot lots of learning um cuz again

1119
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:27,159
it's like we have to hit certain metrics

1120
00:51:24,838 --> 00:51:28,759
because it is a business um

1121
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:31,440
and we have to make sure that there is

1122
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,839
enough fertility in that soil to uh to

1123
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,200
hit those metrics and it it's just

1124
00:51:33,838 --> 00:51:40,078
different in a soiless media

1125
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:44,239
setup are you adding any nutrients

1126
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,000
midcycle any T's k&amp;f ferment stuff like

1127
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:47,879
that I don't actually know the answer to

1128
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:51,760
a lot of these questions so it's good

1129
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:55,000
it's great to hear um we do uh but that

1130
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:58,280
we try to do low low cost input so we

1131
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,280
definitely utilize comp compost extracts

1132
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:04,000
and teas and that's compost Source from

1133
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:07,519
Catalyst bio amendments um their

1134
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:11,519
material is amazing um so we use those

1135
00:52:07,519 --> 00:52:12,880
and then we do some uh soil drenches um

1136
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:16,559
some foiler

1137
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:19,519
feeds um but again it's it's like a cost

1138
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:21,480
perspective it's like okay uh cuz if

1139
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:23,239
you're doing soil drenches with all

1140
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:27,599
kinds of Bio stimulants or you're trying

1141
00:52:23,239 --> 00:52:31,199
to add pottassium or calcium um

1142
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,359
or humic or fulvic um or aloe or coconut

1143
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:36,798
or whatever it may be well that costs a

1144
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:38,838
lot um the more you're scaling up so uh

1145
00:52:36,798 --> 00:52:41,318
we try to do at least one or two

1146
00:52:38,838 --> 00:52:43,679
drenches of some of those things I just

1147
00:52:41,318 --> 00:52:46,400
mentioned um and compost teas and

1148
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:50,078
extracts we try to keep it really simple

1149
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:53,798
um after hearing Eli speak at the soil

1150
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:56,720
Summit and what he's doing with knf and

1151
00:52:53,798 --> 00:52:59,000
and fermented plant juices I am going to

1152
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:02,279
be looking back into that uh cuzz he has

1153
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,480
been doing testing um on his input so

1154
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:06,280
I'm going to be looking into different

1155
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,838
fermented plant juices as like a

1156
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,680
potassium Source or just a good sugar

1157
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:13,558
Source because it's always good to get

1158
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:14,838
sugars um into your living soil system

1159
00:53:13,559 --> 00:53:18,000
because I think that makes a big

1160
00:53:14,838 --> 00:53:19,440
difference in your end product and uh

1161
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:21,719
doing all these little things it

1162
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:24,960
definitely adds up and you can you can

1163
00:53:21,719 --> 00:53:28,439
see uh how much of a better product you

1164
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,440
end up getting

1165
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:34,160
that's awesome and I I have to say I've

1166
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,639
heard really great stuff about the the

1167
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:38,639
Cannabis you guys are producing from uh

1168
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:41,879
Nelson over at poetry plants and then

1169
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:45,039
in-house with Brandon Hudson our uh our

1170
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:46,960
in-house agous grower guy so uh Kudos

1171
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:50,440
kudos to you guys for producing a

1172
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:54,079
quality product appreciate it

1173
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,960
man and um one thing I just want to

1174
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,798
mention when you mentioned the fermented

1175
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,559
plant juices for folks uh you can

1176
00:53:58,798 --> 00:54:02,280
absolutely make those yourselves there's

1177
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:04,559
plenty of information on how to do that

1178
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:07,200
you don't necessarily need to buy it um

1179
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:09,720
if you do go down that route keep an eye

1180
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,598
on sodium and chlorides those are two

1181
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:13,519
things that I would want to test because

1182
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,680
we I've been seeing a lot more sodium

1183
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:16,880
and chlorides on my test results and

1184
00:54:15,679 --> 00:54:20,838
those are two things that you want to

1185
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:23,358
keep low on a soil test and compost is

1186
00:54:20,838 --> 00:54:25,798
probably the biggest source for that

1187
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,000
possibly water when if we talk about um

1188
00:54:25,798 --> 00:54:30,159
that as well

1189
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:32,798
but uh I have seen pretty high sodium

1190
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:36,558
and chloride levels in some um

1191
00:54:32,798 --> 00:54:38,559
commercially produced fjs so just keep

1192
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,599
an eye on it and make sure if you are

1193
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:41,000
adding it because that's something

1194
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:43,838
that's going to impact your soil long

1195
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:46,239
term and is may require flushing or

1196
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:49,239
leeching out of your beds at some point

1197
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:50,598
but um yeah I enjoyed Eli's talk too you

1198
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,759
know hearing about how people are

1199
00:54:50,599 --> 00:54:56,000
successfully using these techniques to

1200
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:56,960
save money I mean I think you're trading

1201
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:59,119
l

1202
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:01,880
for money at that point CU you're kind

1203
00:54:59,119 --> 00:55:05,519
of making your own nutrients and if that

1204
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:07,240
makes sense then I fully support it um

1205
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:10,199
some places you just don't have time to

1206
00:55:07,239 --> 00:55:11,598
to do that kind of work but um I I think

1207
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:14,399
it can produce a very high quality

1208
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,039
flower you know has has been shown so

1209
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,039
that's great yeah

1210
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,480
definitely um okay couple last questions

1211
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:26,880
for you Chris I appreciate this um let's

1212
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:29,318
take a look at this from uh homow

1213
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,960
perspective you know I'm sure

1214
00:55:29,318 --> 00:55:33,920
cultivating commercially has changed

1215
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:35,519
your views on cultivation so what

1216
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:38,680
principles would you apply if you were

1217
00:55:35,519 --> 00:55:41,400
setting up a hom grow like what what's

1218
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:44,159
sort of the same and what's

1219
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:47,358
different well a lot a lot would be the

1220
00:55:44,159 --> 00:55:50,440
same in terms of just you know moisture

1221
00:55:47,358 --> 00:55:52,480
Water Management um that's always the

1222
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,880
number one thing I'm looking at is

1223
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:56,880
making sure that uh the soil is

1224
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:59,200
adequately watered

1225
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:01,798
um and we're not underwatered or

1226
00:55:59,199 --> 00:56:04,159
overwatered and I'd say you know 90% of

1227
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:05,920
Growers probably overwater or new

1228
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:09,798
Growers

1229
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:12,680
um and then um as far as what would be

1230
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:16,239
different it would be my ability just to

1231
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:19,118
give more attention to you know less

1232
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:21,479
plants or just a smaller grow so with

1233
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:23,400
that you can do a lot of the smaller

1234
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,838
things like I mentioned you can do a lot

1235
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:28,358
of these inputs of humic fulvic you know

1236
00:56:26,838 --> 00:56:32,480
every other day even if it's just a

1237
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:36,119
light drench um or your fpj or your aloe

1238
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:38,400
your coconut um stuff like that over a

1239
00:56:36,119 --> 00:56:40,880
period of a flowering cycle it's going

1240
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:44,798
to make a big difference in your home

1241
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:46,519
grow um and that's why you know like I

1242
00:56:44,798 --> 00:56:47,960
think what we're doing we are producing

1243
00:56:46,519 --> 00:56:50,960
some of the cleanest and some of the

1244
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:53,318
best flour in the world but I also know

1245
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:55,960
that a small homeg grow or like a six

1246
00:56:53,318 --> 00:56:57,880
lighter 10 lighter they're going to have

1247
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:00,280
better better batches and probably

1248
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:02,680
slightly better flower than us just

1249
00:57:00,280 --> 00:57:05,599
because they can give it that much more

1250
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:08,480
attention or they're just giving um

1251
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:13,240
those inputs you know over a period of

1252
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:16,400
that flowering cycle and there's certain

1253
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:20,679
you know um measurements or things maybe

1254
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:24,960
we can't measure yet as far as what what

1255
00:57:20,679 --> 00:57:27,118
makes a living soil or soiless media um

1256
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,920
product better than a synthetically

1257
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:32,599
grown because you know a lot of people

1258
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:34,559
um say well the plant doesn't know the

1259
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:37,798
difference between you know a

1260
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,039
carbon-based um nutrient or Amendment

1261
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:43,358
then versus a synthetic one okay that

1262
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:46,440
may be true but what's happening with

1263
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:50,920
that microbial or fungal life um that's

1264
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:53,838
leading to a superior product you know

1265
00:57:50,920 --> 00:57:57,838
um you can't say THC percentage or even

1266
00:57:53,838 --> 00:58:00,719
tping necessarily um so it's it's other

1267
00:57:57,838 --> 00:58:03,078
factors or variables that we're not able

1268
00:58:00,719 --> 00:58:05,759
to measure yet

1269
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:08,039
um yeah so it's it's just interesting to

1270
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,799
think about too like what what is going

1271
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:12,839
on in the soil uh cuz like you see with

1272
00:58:10,798 --> 00:58:14,838
hash competitions or even flower

1273
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:16,639
competitions and the people that win

1274
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:19,880
those it's it's usually living soil

1275
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:19,879
Growers indoor or

1276
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:29,038
outdoor yeah and um you essentially said

1277
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:32,400
a lot of what Bryant Mason Soul doctor

1278
00:58:29,039 --> 00:58:34,079
says in regards to um cultivation and

1279
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:36,079
this idea that if we can just keep

1280
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:37,798
feeding small amounts of carbon to our

1281
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:40,000
plants which is what a lot of you know

1282
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:41,480
most of these amendments and tees are

1283
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,199
are just little bits of carbon then

1284
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,760
we're we're creating um an optimal

1285
00:58:44,199 --> 00:58:47,639
environment for soil health and plant

1286
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:50,359
health so yeah I feel like you really

1287
00:58:47,639 --> 00:58:52,759
nailed it with that

1288
00:58:50,358 --> 00:58:55,078
um yeah is there anything else you'd

1289
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:57,280
like to share regarding uh from a

1290
00:58:55,079 --> 00:59:00,798
cultivation perspective

1291
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:02,280
um um otherwise I guess yeah I'll let

1292
00:59:00,798 --> 00:59:04,599
you answer that and then I have one last

1293
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:08,920
thing for you uh I guess one thing I've

1294
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:12,240
noticed with um ppfd and light intensity

1295
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:14,519
with LEDs um in a smaller setup when

1296
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:18,000
you're able to do those you know small

1297
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:21,038
inputs over um the course of that

1298
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,920
flowering period I was able to increase

1299
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,960
my

1300
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:29,680
ppfd um much more than in a commercial

1301
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,318
setting um um and I think that's um

1302
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,239
based off of like what's actually

1303
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:35,639
available for the plant to uptake and

1304
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:39,078
use and I think in in our commercial

1305
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:41,558
setting we're relying on you know that

1306
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:43,359
that macro micro and macro life to kind

1307
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:46,319
of break down what we're putting in to

1308
00:59:43,358 --> 00:59:48,598
make it available and then with those

1309
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:52,119
small inputs on a smaller

1310
00:59:48,599 --> 00:59:54,680
scale I think those inputs are available

1311
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:56,480
more quickly you know so I think it's

1312
00:59:54,679 --> 00:59:59,639
it's um a different different

1313
00:59:56,480 --> 01:00:01,559
perspective when driving ppfd in a

1314
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:04,000
smaller setting versus a commercial

1315
01:00:01,559 --> 01:00:07,280
setting at least in my experience with

1316
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:10,358
living soil or or soilless media cuz in

1317
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:13,519
in the facility currently I I'm not

1318
01:00:10,358 --> 01:00:15,480
going to push more than 800 or 900 ppfd

1319
01:00:13,519 --> 01:00:19,400
depending on the strain and that's even

1320
01:00:15,480 --> 01:00:22,000
with you know 1200 PPM CO2 um I've just

1321
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:26,280
noticed uh a lot of strains can't take

1322
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,519
that much ppfd but in our R&amp;D facility I

1323
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:33,480
was able to push anywhere from 12200 to

1324
01:00:28,519 --> 01:00:36,038
1500 ppfd without seeing any um negative

1325
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:38,199
uh drawbacks or negative uh effects on

1326
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:38,200
the

1327
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:43,639
plant and you were doing a lot

1328
01:00:40,798 --> 01:00:45,119
more applications of of fertility

1329
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:47,078
applications too at that time right all

1330
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:49,039
the k&amp;f stuff and other T's it sounds

1331
01:00:47,079 --> 01:00:51,318
like and I assume you're supplementing

1332
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,400
so when I think of ppfd I immediately go

1333
01:00:51,318 --> 01:00:56,400
to CO2 so I would assume you were also

1334
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:57,639
supplementing CO2 in the other facility

1335
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:59,880
because as a homerow if you're not

1336
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:03,639
suppling CO2 I would not play around

1337
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:07,680
with levels over 8 or 900 um your plant

1338
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:07,679
just can't keep up yeah there's just no

1339
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:15,240
way um cool well then last thing uh Flor

1340
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:18,720
and Flame I think you guys have a fun uh

1341
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:20,239
slogan sort of uh company company

1342
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,959
Mission that you put on your containers

1343
01:01:20,239 --> 01:01:25,159
you want to your packaging you want to

1344
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:26,760
share that with folks yeah sure so uh we

1345
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:29,838
came up with

1346
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:32,680
uh this phrase when we were uh going

1347
01:01:29,838 --> 01:01:34,358
through our rebranding which I regret

1348
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:36,480
and we're actually going back to our old

1349
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:39,759
logo but we came up with this great

1350
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:42,920
phrase that kind of represents who who

1351
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:45,240
we are as a brand in a company and uh so

1352
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:48,280
that phrase is a small batch indoor

1353
01:01:45,239 --> 01:01:52,439
flower grown with love in living soil by

1354
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:54,480
humans who give a [ __ ] um so uh I I

1355
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:57,760
wouldn't have started this brand if if

1356
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:58,960
one I wasn't a cannabis user and two if

1357
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:01,520
I didn't believe in you know the

1358
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:05,679
medicinal qualities of the plant and uh

1359
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:07,719
wanting to uh produce a product that not

1360
01:02:05,679 --> 01:02:10,558
only that I consume myself on on The

1361
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:13,519
Daily but um something that I can stand

1362
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,599
behind and be proud and want to share

1363
01:02:13,519 --> 01:02:19,679
with people to uh to use so yeah I think

1364
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:22,359
it's a great slogan um you know I I tell

1365
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,719
people well we're the largest vertical

1366
01:02:22,358 --> 01:02:27,318
indoor living Sol Farm currently in the

1367
01:02:24,719 --> 01:02:30,000
world but also

1368
01:02:27,318 --> 01:02:32,079
we're only a small you know Mom and Pop

1369

1370
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:37,160

1371
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:40,480
we're this big you know

1372

1373
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:47,199
that's that's our uh that's our

1374
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:49,000
phrase or slogan awesome well I hope

1375
01:02:47,199 --> 01:02:50,798
folks in the Bay Area will will try it

1376
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:53,079
out if they're ever visiting or or

1377
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,239
something when they go to dispensary and

1378
01:02:53,079 --> 01:02:56,480
I appreciate you sharing you know that

1379
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:58,439
was the one thing thing about this Soul

1380
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:00,559
Su that I really appreciated is that

1381
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:01,920
we're a we're a community and even

1382
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,640
though we might have slight differences

1383
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:06,400
in how we cultivate at the end of the

1384
01:03:03,639 --> 01:03:08,038
day we're all trying to push a a what we

1385
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:12,200
think is most sustainable or

1386
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:14,720
regenerative um and environmentally um

1387
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:16,399
friendly and appropriate so yeah it's a

1388
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:18,199
cool community of folks that fall on

1389
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,920
into this sort of living soil camp for

1390
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:23,000
sure yeah it's uh it's definitely a

1391
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:25,318
challenge we're the minority but you

1392
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,519
know like we said we uh we believe in it

1393
01:03:25,318 --> 01:03:28,079
and uh

1394
01:03:26,519 --> 01:03:31,639
we think this is the most you know

1395
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,680
sustainable way to cultivate indoors and

1396
01:03:31,639 --> 01:03:35,920
the most regenerative way to cultivate

1397
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,919
uh

1398
01:03:36,199 --> 01:03:41,159
