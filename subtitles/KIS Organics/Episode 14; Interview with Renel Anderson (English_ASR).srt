university studies and research and

30
00:01:13,688 --> 00:01:17,109
today Rennell will be sharing with us

31
00:01:15,489 --> 00:01:20,199
some of the ways to both make and

32
00:01:17,109 --> 00:01:21,909
evaluate the quality of your biochar in

33
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,150
honor of our guest this week I'd like to

00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:33,430
price on the website if you go to

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:35,320
www.hsn x-com and search for biochar

38
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,520
this is a great opportunity if you've

39
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:38,529
been waiting to try a high-quality

40
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,929
biochar in your garden or growing

41
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,868
environment without further ado though

42
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:46,060
here's this week's podcast all right

43
00:01:43,868 --> 00:01:48,188
well I'd like to start asking you first

44
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:49,840
off a little bit about what is biochar

45
00:01:48,188 --> 00:01:51,609
like how would you define it and can you

46
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,100
talk a little bit about its relationship

47
00:01:51,609 --> 00:02:00,459
with Terra Preta in some of that history

48
00:01:54,099 --> 00:02:03,328
sure biochar is biomass in some form and

49
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:06,959
then and it can be any form of biomass

50
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:12,180
anything from sewage sludge to

51
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:17,769
unfortunately dead creatures to

52
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:21,099
grasses and woods that are carbonized in

53
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,590
the limited oxygen atmosphere there's a

54
00:02:21,098 --> 00:02:27,488
variety of ways it can be carbonized but

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:32,409
you end up with typically a product

56
00:02:27,489 --> 00:02:34,930
called ash biochar perhaps water and in

57
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:38,939
some cases bio oil so it's a very

58
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:42,689
general description for what biochar is

59
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:45,639
once the American Association of

60
00:02:42,689 --> 00:02:47,439
fertilizer Control Officers got in there

61
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:50,048
they've narrowed the definition for

62
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,189
agriculture and horticulture down to

63
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:56,830
wood based biochar and so that would be

64
00:02:54,189 --> 00:03:00,310
wood that's been thermo chemically

65
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:04,180
processed from being wood into being

66
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:09,420
more of a charcoal type product high

67
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:12,159
carbon black charcoal looking product

68
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:17,048
it's related to the Terra Preta because

69
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:19,299
in those days in South America what it

70
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:22,000
took science to figure out a long time

71
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:25,239
why there were certain areas of real

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,870
high productivity and agricultural

73
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:32,500
success and therefore population success

74
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,019
what they found was that they had been

75
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,629
taking their excess biomass and putting

76
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,900
it into pits which made them low oxygen

77
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:42,939
and then creating these fires

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:45,879
underground and then using that material

79
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:49,509
mixed with pottery shards that would

80
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:54,039
have minerals in them and creating a

81
00:03:49,509 --> 00:03:57,849
really high nutrient high soil organic

82
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:59,620
carbon soil that's lasted for thousands

83
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:04,599
of years and not only that it kind of

84
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:08,560
grows additional soil with time so that

85
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:11,379
fertility supported large populations

86
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:16,269
and it's only something that we're

87
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:18,939
really about in the last decade or so so

88
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:21,000
just to simplify the the definition

89
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:24,129
essentially we're taking wood and we're

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,699
paralyzing it or we're heating it to a

91
00:04:24,129 --> 00:04:26,920
really

92
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:28,599
temperature but with very low oxygen

93
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:32,319
conditions is that correct that's right

94
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:34,330
okay and so the only real relationship

95
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,949
with Terra Preta is the fact that it has

96
00:04:34,329 --> 00:04:41,139
sort of this loose association with this

97
00:04:38,949 --> 00:04:43,240
area that there's no other relationship

98
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:45,099
with the South America beyond that we're

99
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,050
trying to kind of replicate this using

100
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,340
more advanced technology is that correct

101
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:54,790
yes yes we learned from looking at what

102
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:58,359
they had done and you know modern

103
00:04:54,790 --> 00:05:00,910
agriculture has in tilling and the way

104
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:03,520
it's been done most of the carbon in the

105
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,590
soil has been released I think the

106
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:09,250
carbon stores have been reduced by about

107
00:05:05,589 --> 00:05:13,419
60% plants are dependent on that the

108
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,290
whole soil ecosystem is diminished when

109
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:19,930
the carbon levels are diminished so

110
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:22,210
enhancing the carbon levels ie that

111
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,600
being the most important component of a

112
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:29,680
biochar that they learned from studying

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,430
the soils they very rich soils of the

114
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,800
Terra Preta okay and how did you get

115
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:37,870
into this exactly I know you own a peony

116
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:39,610
farm with your husband and have been

117
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:41,379
doing that for a long time and I'm

118
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,750
looking at a photo here which I'll add

119
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:45,399
to the podcast page that shows some of

120
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,160
the trials that you ran initially can

121
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:50,139
you talk a little bit how you got into

122
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,350
biochar in the first place yes that was

123
00:05:50,139 --> 00:05:55,509
interesting we had this farm we were

124
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,240
going to develop the field so it was

125
00:05:55,509 --> 00:06:00,699
sort of in a natural state with a lot of

126
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,840
weeds and I wanted to do everything

127
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:07,719
organically for a lot of reasons but

128
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:11,169
among them was that I'm allergic to a

129
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,020
lot of the chemistry that's used and in

130
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,420
normal farming I get asthma attacks so

131
00:06:14,019 --> 00:06:19,389
we were going to make this an organic

132
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:23,050
farm and I read I had been through heart

133
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:27,009
a culture school but I read every book I

134
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:30,069
could find on organic farming and in

135
00:06:27,009 --> 00:06:35,289
every article and I came across an

136
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:37,899
article about biochar and then it it

137
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:42,939
really sparked my interest

138
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:45,310
so I we spent I spent a few months

139
00:06:42,939 --> 00:06:49,959
trying to run some biochar down because

140
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:53,699
this was way back in 2009-10 and there

141
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:57,519
was no commercial biochar so to speak

142
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:59,409
available at the time what did you find

143
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:01,060
in terms of some of the benefits of

144
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:03,340
using biochar we'll talk a little bit

145
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,589
more about how to tell different types

146
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:06,969
of biochar and inputs and all that but

147
00:07:05,589 --> 00:07:08,379
what are just some of the general

148
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,490
benefits if you're using a high-quality

149
00:07:08,379 --> 00:07:14,199
biochar product I'll answer that real

150
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,840
quickly but I want to say that when we

151
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:20,949
put biochar en we were just going off of

152
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:24,579
this one article and it was a leap of

153
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:27,189
faith we were able to get some what

154
00:07:24,579 --> 00:07:30,129
would not really be considered biochar

155
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:33,009
in this day and age but we we ended up

156
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:35,079
having this bumper crop of flowers in

157
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,449
the first year and you're supposed to

158
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:41,050
have three years of waiting before you

159
00:07:37,449 --> 00:07:43,930
get a bumper crop of flowers so we've

160
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:47,470
got enhanced growth that we got hearty

161
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:50,920
growth we got disease disease prevention

162
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:53,650
or suppression we we've had the field

163
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:56,050
inspected by the University and they

164
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:58,779
can't find any of the typical normal

165
00:07:56,050 --> 00:08:02,050
expected fungal diseases on on the

166
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:05,409
plants we got by with a little less

167
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:08,500
water but the main thing was the vigor

168
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:11,439
and the speed of the plant growth and

169
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,899
the productivity when we planted that

170
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:17,350
field I simultaneously did a hundred and

171
00:08:13,899 --> 00:08:20,949
fifty pot randomized study that combined

172
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:24,430
fertilizer and biochar and potting soil

173
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:29,019
and then what you know controls for

174
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:31,900
everything and we found that potting

175
00:08:29,019 --> 00:08:35,139
soil and biochar outperformed potting

176
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:37,509
soil and fertilizer which I think is

177
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:40,649
there's some dependency on the biochar

178
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:45,389
to get a result like that but the

179
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:49,399
results were run through WSU's

180
00:08:45,389 --> 00:08:52,399
statistical analysis machinery

181
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:55,819
they found out that in every case where

182
00:08:52,399 --> 00:09:00,220
biochar was used versus the control we

183
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:05,240
got 70% more so more 70% more biomass

184
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:08,690
70% more root mass 70% more blossoms and

185
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:10,549
on and on so that was pretty convincing

186
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:12,350
evidence that the biochar was

187
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:15,079
responsible for some very positive

188
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:17,870
outcomes okay and just for those

189
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,759
listeners who are not in Washington WSU

190
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,250
stands for Washington State University

191
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:24,200
and they are one of the bigger

192
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:28,190
agricultural colleges here in Washington

193
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,770
just to clarify so when we say biochar

194
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:34,700
it has this connotation that there's

195
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:36,289
biology in it but when we get biochar

196
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,509
and we're charring this wood there's no

197
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:40,549
biology we have to inoculate it or

198
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:44,419
charge it with something is what do you

199
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:48,379
recommend for that okay let me just say

200
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:50,629
this would the starting product that we

201
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:53,028
use is virgin wood it's important that

202
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:55,100
whatever you use it's not a treated wood

203
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:56,720
and I think it's important to use wood

204
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,720
there's a there's a big industry and

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:03,110
chicken manure biochar it has different

206
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:05,778
properties it's a high ash content thing

207
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:09,980
but it has different properties than a

208
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:13,159
wood biochar so agreeing that you don't

209
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:16,339
want to use treated wood you just want

210
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:21,439
your virgin and we use the waste part of

211
00:10:16,339 --> 00:10:24,560
a tree like limbs and tops and bases of

212
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:29,089
harvested trees we don't use any trees

213
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:32,989
for our our process but anyway in that

214
00:10:29,089 --> 00:10:36,830
the word biochar the bio came from it

215
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:39,289
has to be made from biomass because most

216
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:41,540
charcoal historically was made from coal

217
00:10:39,289 --> 00:10:44,838
at that point it's not considered

218
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:50,059
biomass anymore it's considered a fossil

219
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,110
fuel so biomass indicates it was a

220
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:54,919
living matter

221
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:58,759
so why you have to pre charge it is that

222
00:10:54,919 --> 00:11:00,469
when you process it it vaporizes the

223
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:04,700
things that turn into gas

224
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:07,580
and one of those important constituents

225
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:11,440
is the nitrogen that's held within the

226
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:15,440
planet in it vaporizes it goes up as

227
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,500
nitrogen oxide and so if you're not

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:22,750
processing it correctly you can add to

229
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:26,149
the burden of pollution air pollution so

230
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:28,909
there are there are some actually

231
00:11:26,149 --> 00:11:31,039
multi-million dollar processing machines

232
00:11:28,909 --> 00:11:34,039
out there that cannot get past the Air

233
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:39,399
Resources Board it's very much in our

234
00:11:34,039 --> 00:11:42,079
case that is that gaseous component

235
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:46,279
there's some carbon there's some oxygen

236
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:50,710
there's some hydrogen and nitrogen all

237
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:54,620
that are are reformed into gases and

238
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:57,280
eliminated from from the wood lignin and

239
00:11:54,620 --> 00:12:01,129
hemicellulose and cellulose that

240
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,120
survives in the form of carbon the

241
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:08,720
heating process those we burn to run a

242
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,659
boiler to create energy and other

243
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,029
machinery can create energy

244
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:16,339
were they finding that there's a little

245
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:18,139
bit of difficulty in getting a good

246
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:22,190
biochar product is when they are also

247
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:24,919
trying to make biofuel which is you you

248
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:27,980
get three Co products from the

249
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:30,099
processing of wood like this so if I

250
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:34,129
have that final product then how do I

251
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,440
prepare it for my soil or my garden so

252
00:12:34,129 --> 00:12:39,139
like in our case in full disclosure we

253
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:43,520
use your product The Blackout biochar in

254
00:12:39,139 --> 00:12:47,088
our biochar soil mix and we're soaking

255
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,309
it in fish hydrolysate for a few days

256
00:12:47,089 --> 00:12:53,540
prior to mixing it into our soil mix as

257
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:56,359
a way to buffer some of the high carbon

258
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:58,129
in the biochar and also lower some of

259
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,050
the pH which we'll talk about here in a

260
00:12:58,129 --> 00:13:02,629
little bit - but what it what are you

261
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:04,579
finding a lot of people are using to

262
00:13:02,629 --> 00:13:06,320
inoculate that biochar because as I

263
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:09,110
understand it if I were to take raw

264
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,420
biochar and stick it right on to a soil

265
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:12,830
with a plan it could potentially pull

266
00:13:11,419 --> 00:13:13,149
some of those nutrients because of the

267
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,940
high

268
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:17,829
on exchange capacity from that soil or

269
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:19,240
be more efficient at utilizing them than

270
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:23,500
the plant could be is that it's

271
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:26,230
particularly nitrogen that you find out

272
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:30,700
because when you do the same studies

273
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:34,029
with mixing like sand and woodchips and

274
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:36,280
biochar not adding any nutrients with

275
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:40,689
the nitrogen fixing plant you don't see

276
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:44,139
any slowdown our competition for for it

277
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:48,160
so it's basically pre charging it needs

278
00:13:44,139 --> 00:13:50,740
to be adding back nitrogen but it

279
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,289
doesn't take a lot to offset it because

280
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,930
you can do it with compost tea you can

281
00:13:53,289 --> 00:13:59,649
do it with organic fertilizers that are

282
00:13:55,929 --> 00:14:03,069
low you know in numerically low like a

283
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,240
two to two it depends on the crop that

284
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,120
you're trying to grow and a lot of

285
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,370
people pre charge it with compost my

286
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:14,019
thought there is that you want to know

287
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:17,049
what what the compost is but typically

288
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:21,059
that's enough to pre charge it

289
00:14:17,049 --> 00:14:24,219
fish is it's really high nitrogen

290
00:14:21,059 --> 00:14:26,919
quality product the one thing I would

291
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:30,370
say is that you know this this product

292
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:33,759
in completely cooked or our charge that

293
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:35,350
have tar formation in the process that

294
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,870
recondense us on the chart

295
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:41,379
those chars tend to be a little oily and

296
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:44,799
they're hydrophobic or they will not

297
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:47,649
take on water or take on liquid

298
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:49,329
substance as well and actually they can

299
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:52,750
be toxic

300
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:55,870
ours is hydrophilic it likes water it

301
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:59,500
will absorb water and any liquid that

302
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:02,560
you put with it so that becomes part of

303
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,669
the particle then and is retained by the

304
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:08,829
particle and is available for plant use

305
00:15:05,669 --> 00:15:12,370
okay so just to be clear backing up

306
00:15:08,830 --> 00:15:14,400
really quick we can charge biochar with

307
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:17,500
just about anything including compost

308
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,209
the fish you said was fine in fact I

309
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:21,399
know some permaculture guys that are

310
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:22,519
there peeing on the their biochar is a

311
00:15:21,399 --> 00:15:24,679
way to add

312
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:26,870
so it sounds like there's a lot of ways

313
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:29,839
to do it we've also run compost tea

314
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:33,289
through it sort of like a sieve is that

315
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:35,750
okay yeah and compost tea the

316
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:38,689
interesting thing about it we make

317
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:41,330
product like that but and it's fairly

318
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:44,810
popular it will lower the pH as well

319
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:47,600
almost anything almost anything that

320
00:15:44,809 --> 00:15:52,209
you're gonna mix it with has a lower pH

321
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:56,480
lower than 7 so compost fish fertilizer

322
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:58,790
and most organic fertilizers on the

323
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,909
market if you actually were to get their

324
00:15:58,789 --> 00:16:04,969
pH as their below so you get a balancing

325
00:16:01,909 --> 00:16:07,429
of the pH though I want to say something

326
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:10,700
really quick here there is a difference

327
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:13,370
in the kinetics or the speed and the

328
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:16,340
amount of cation exchange with biochars

329
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,340
so in the case of ours if you didn't

330
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:23,509
pre-charge it but you put it in a system

331
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:26,750
with a dry fertilizer and the soil that

332
00:16:23,509 --> 00:16:30,139
you're gonna plant in its kinetics for

333
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:32,539
grabbing the minerals that are needed

334
00:16:30,139 --> 00:16:36,580
happens really fast so you come to

335
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:41,149
equilibrium in the soil real quickly and

336
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:42,230
so once it's satisfied itself for oxygen

337
00:16:41,149 --> 00:16:44,449
and nitrogen

338
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:46,879
you know it's willing to give it all

339
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:50,440
back to the system charge that take a

340
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:55,070
lot longer to do that transaction are

341
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:58,070
pulling for a longer time and aren't

342
00:16:55,070 --> 00:17:00,860
able to give it back so it's a unique I

343
00:16:58,070 --> 00:17:03,500
think to our chart that it reacts so

344
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:05,180
quickly and that in the broader scope of

345
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,279
things what you're trying to do is make

346
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:09,670
sure that you have all the nutrients

347
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:13,129
necessary for the plant they're

348
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:17,480
simultaneously with the char if if not

349
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:19,820
infused into the char itself okay so you

350
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,579
brought up that there there is a

351
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:23,990
difference in quality with biochar not

352
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,809
all products are the same we have the

353
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:28,640
same issues in the compost tea industry

354
00:17:26,809 --> 00:17:32,750
in terms of claims that people are

355
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:34,190
making and a variety of quality so one

356
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,808
of the things I'd like to talk about

357
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,460
first before we get into the lab

358
00:17:35,808 --> 00:17:41,329
tests which i think are really important

359
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:44,450
is you'd given me some general ways for

360
00:17:41,329 --> 00:17:46,908
a gardener or homeowner to test biochar

361
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,169
just on the surface level one of the

362
00:17:46,909 --> 00:17:49,940
things he talked about was whether or

363
00:17:48,169 --> 00:17:52,070
not it floated in water can you expand

364
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:55,190
on that a little bit yes it's gonna

365
00:17:52,069 --> 00:17:57,259
float on water only like if it has oils

366
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:58,278
or tars attached to it or if it's

367
00:17:57,259 --> 00:18:01,128
undercooked

368
00:17:58,278 --> 00:18:03,980
because like wood chips will float in

369
00:18:01,128 --> 00:18:07,878
water but they're not cooked if there's

370
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:10,819
oils that if this product can be

371
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:13,959
processed in several types of machinery

372
00:18:10,819 --> 00:18:17,058
and if it happens to be a long tube as

373
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:20,679
this product goes down the long tube

374
00:18:17,058 --> 00:18:24,019
those gases can reform into tars and

375
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:27,278
they actually end up on the chart itself

376
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:32,028
so one of the big tests is does it smell

377
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:35,210
does it taste does it leave a film on

378
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:38,138
your fingers that's something you want

379
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,600
boy because actually those stars can be

380
00:18:38,138 --> 00:18:44,479
again be toxic so when you talk about

381
00:18:41,599 --> 00:18:46,248
leaving some residue on your fingers I

382
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,169
know when I pick up your biochar and

383
00:18:46,249 --> 00:18:51,499
frankly that's really the only biochar I

384
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:53,778
have experience with is it looks like I

385
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:57,980
have charcoal I mean it's not a it's not

386
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:59,388
a leaper se but it will leave residue so

387
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,230
we're not saying no rest you're saying

388
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:06,618
no oily residue it is no oil eNOS it's a

389
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:09,200
concern and that because it's oily it

390
00:19:06,618 --> 00:19:11,990
will float if it's a poor char

391
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,819
okay so the quick easy test for a home

392
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:16,069
gardener or a grower would be to take a

393
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:17,839
small amount put it in a container of

394
00:19:16,069 --> 00:19:20,240
water and see if it floats or not well

395
00:19:17,839 --> 00:19:23,658
that's one test okay that will eliminate

396
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:24,079
that the potential toxicity of oils and

397
00:19:23,659 --> 00:19:27,440
tars

398
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:30,470
in which you don't really want there not

399
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,179
a benefit um so should it should it sink

400
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,798
immediately to the bottom should it stay

401
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:35,659
a little bit suspended in the water well

402
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,058
some of it flow and some of it sink what

403
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:40,639
would be what would be an expectation

404
00:19:37,058 --> 00:19:43,908
you want it to have it take it on fairly

405
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,869
fairly quickly Matt again is how porous

406
00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,220
is it

407
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:52,250
it's a measure of porosity however

408
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:55,069
minerals are heavier and they will sink

409
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:59,778
first and fastest and they look very

410
00:19:55,069 --> 00:20:02,450
much like char pyrolysis minerals which

411
00:19:59,778 --> 00:20:03,950
do which are not the carbon fraction

412
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:07,009
that we're talking about that's so

413
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:09,830
important in all of this they will sink

414
00:20:07,009 --> 00:20:12,440
really fast there okay so we're talking

415
00:20:09,829 --> 00:20:14,449
about biochar quality and we talked

416
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:16,190
about a floating were there other ways

417
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:19,250
you can evaluate biochar

418
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:20,450
besides the floating test no without

419
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,288
looking at lab tests yeah we'll talk

420
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,259
about that next

421
00:20:21,288 --> 00:20:27,849
it's really hard I will say I've had

422
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:31,210
people who who are speakers who are

423
00:20:27,849 --> 00:20:33,949
quote-unquote experts who have a lot of

424
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:38,750
familiarity with these products and I

425
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:42,798
have had them come up and had what would

426
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:45,648
be considered just ash next to medium

427
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:48,769
grade biochar next to very high grade

428
00:20:45,648 --> 00:20:51,439
biochar and said they all cost the same

429
00:20:48,769 --> 00:20:54,109
which one do you want and and this is

430
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,630
one of the problems in the industry but

431
00:20:54,109 --> 00:20:58,750
you know some of them people that should

432
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:02,390
be carrying the most knowledge all

433
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:05,778
pointed the whole ash pile it's it went

434
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:09,110
that so you can't really tell by looking

435
00:21:05,778 --> 00:21:11,419
at it and that's unfortunate ash you

436
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:15,288
know I think people think ash is gray

437
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:17,470
and people think also that that biochars

438
00:21:15,288 --> 00:21:20,599
but they take out of their fireplaces

439
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:22,220
residue with just its ash what they're

440
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,959
taking on their fireplace and the reason

441
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:28,569
they're getting a good response from man

442
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:33,528
is because of the calcium magnesium and

443
00:21:28,569 --> 00:21:36,379
potassium that that's in the ash but

444
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:39,528
that's also raising the pH as part of

445
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:42,230
where the pH number comes from but in

446
00:21:39,528 --> 00:21:44,778
the case of biochar that's commercially

447
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:47,569
made your your ash is gonna be black

448
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:49,369
it's not gonna be great or white okay so

449
00:21:47,569 --> 00:21:51,829
you can't tell for the most part just

450
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:53,569
looking at you do a lab test one

451
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:56,079
question I brought up before the lab

452
00:21:53,569 --> 00:21:58,329
test was particle size

453
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:01,299
so I know you do remediation work and

454
00:21:58,329 --> 00:22:03,429
some other things around with a bio with

455
00:22:01,299 --> 00:22:05,500
the biochar how what should we be

456
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:09,900
looking for in terms of particle size as

457
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:12,000
a as a grower I the particle size

458
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,259
depends on what you're trying to achieve

459
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,549
because if what you're trying to achieve

460
00:22:14,259 --> 00:22:19,569
this better drainage in the soil or

461
00:22:17,549 --> 00:22:21,339
actually if what you're trying to

462
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:24,309
achieve if you have a sandy soil and

463
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:28,689
what you want is more aggregation you

464
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:34,059
need a different bulk of the particles

465
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:37,120
to be larger right in because they will

466
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:39,309
actually help the soil perc in the other

467
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:42,339
case they they're forming soil

468
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:44,259
aggregates in the sand but the small

469
00:22:42,339 --> 00:22:48,129
particles the real small ones are

470
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:51,640
actually eaten by worms if you're in a

471
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:54,730
field where there's worms the worms will

472
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:58,540
eat it they actually grow amazingly

473
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:03,009
large themselves but they excrete this

474
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:06,460
clear gluey substance that that helps

475
00:23:03,009 --> 00:23:09,309
with the TEL thenis of the sandy soil as

476
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,809
well there and then of course then

477
00:23:09,309 --> 00:23:14,919
they're moving around and they're

478
00:23:10,809 --> 00:23:17,379
creating air flow and oxygen so they

479
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:20,490
like to eat it so with a smaller

480
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:24,220
particle size be better in terms of the

481
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:29,380
cation exchange capacity or the ability

482
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,850
of microbes to process some of the the

483
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:32,950
biochar would it be would it be faster

484
00:23:30,849 --> 00:23:36,730
acting in terms of the plant growth and

485
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:39,970
healthy would see not necessarily it but

486
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:43,150
it it's true like when when we were

487
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:45,990
first started working with this people

488
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:50,110
would say and but we've tested all this

489
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:52,210
they would say our largest particles

490
00:23:50,109 --> 00:23:55,809
aren't terribly large they're like four

491
00:23:52,210 --> 00:24:00,279
millimeter particles but then it goes

492
00:23:55,809 --> 00:24:02,889
down to microns in size and I like that

493
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:05,899
diversity of particle size because you

494
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,890
got different functions from

495
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:13,009
the different sizes but we do screen it

496
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:15,590
for particular purposes and there's some

497
00:24:13,009 --> 00:24:18,049
groups of folks that want only the large

498
00:24:15,589 --> 00:24:21,319
and some groups of folks at what only

499
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:23,869
the small you would expect with a

500
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,939
typical bio chart that the smaller the

501
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:28,819
particle size the more surface area you

502
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:31,308
would have yeah and surface area is

503
00:24:28,819 --> 00:24:35,139
everything with biochar but

504
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:38,319
interestingly ours is so porous and so

505
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:41,809
it has so much surface area that

506
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:44,808
grinding it into a smaller unit does not

507
00:24:41,808 --> 00:24:48,079
really increase the surface area it's

508
00:24:44,808 --> 00:24:51,289
it's it's that much like the catacombs

509
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:54,710
you know it's just slice of orange it's

510
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:57,319
already so porous okay so particle size

511
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,500
in our case doesn't really work like

512
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:02,869
that but the general assumption would be

513
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:05,960
like if you were making it at home and

514
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:09,589
you have those larger chunks grinding

515
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:11,900
those down which should make for more

516
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:13,879
surface area and then therefore you get

517
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,800
more the transactions that you want in

518
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,020
the soil

519
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:20,089
ok so let's dive into these lab tests

520
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:21,558
and I'll post these on the podcast page

521
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:23,599
where people don't want to see them tea

522
00:25:21,558 --> 00:25:26,210
but we'll we'll talk about this right

523
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:28,569
now here so you have these two tests

524
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:31,789
looking at two different samples of

525
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:34,159
biochar and the difference in numbers

526
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:36,319
and I wanted to have you point out some

527
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:39,529
of the more important figures on the

528
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:41,839
test as a comparison and this is really

529
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:44,450
the only way to effectively compare

530
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:45,889
biochar as I understand it is in order

531
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:48,170
to compare apples to apples is to

532
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:49,640
actually look at the tests I see the

533
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:51,259
first one on here is moisture can you

534
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,759
talk a little bit about what the

535
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:55,279
differences in numbers of what we should

536
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:58,009
look for is optimal ranges yeah so let

537
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,920
me just say this first this bottom half

538
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:04,549
for their where they're showing the

539
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:06,050
heavy metals this is required if you

540
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:09,769
want to get ordered organic

541
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:11,869
certification by any state or or armory

542
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:14,720
once you put biochar in the soil you

543
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:16,729
can't get it out so therefore you these

544
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,190
people that have created products with

545
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:21,559
tars and negative things

546
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:24,799
the producers have run into legal

547
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:27,799
problems because you can't get it out of

548
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,740
the soil so you can potentially although

549
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:33,500
this is rare but you do want to know

550
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:35,660
what the company what your biochar

551
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:39,710
consists of so this heavy metal section

552
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:44,570
down here shows you if you're low on

553
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:47,470
heavy metals or in this one report we

554
00:26:44,569 --> 00:26:49,849
had fairly high arsenic it was a

555
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:52,009
different chart yeah you showed me over

556
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:54,259
here so yeah you have three samples here

557
00:26:52,009 --> 00:26:58,759
and on one sample it looks like you

558
00:26:54,259 --> 00:27:02,059
range from 1.5 all the way up to 18

559
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,069
point four and this is in ppm so it

560
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:06,470
looks like so there's a fairly big range

561
00:27:04,069 --> 00:27:08,480
in terms of what what we're looking at

562
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:10,250
in terms of arsenic and some of these

563
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,529
other heavy metals so the first thing

564
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:14,210
you're suggesting people look at heavy

565
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:16,039
metal content that's the the most

566
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:17,480
important aspect to make sure you're not

567
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,710
bringing anything in your soil that's

568
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:23,420
dangerous right now

569
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:26,630
edibles things like spinach they mistake

570
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:28,250
cadmium for calcium they need a lot of

571
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:31,010
calcium and everybody tells you eat

572
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:34,460
spinach oh good calcium bet if there's a

573
00:27:31,009 --> 00:27:37,430
lot of cadmium in your chart the plant

574
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:40,130
or in the soil anyway which there is in

575
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,799
California quite a bit of cadmium in the

576
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,200
soil plant will uptake it and you'll end

577
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,690
up beating it's not a good thing so I

578
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:54,019
guess the first rule of thumb is do no

579
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:56,000
harm moisture is indicative of just what

580
00:27:54,019 --> 00:27:58,960
you're getting for your money so when

581
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:04,220
you buy biochar you're buying water

582
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:06,769
carbon and ash and in some combination

583
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,200
one thing we found is you've got to be

584
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:13,609
really careful about your water sourcing

585
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:17,569
because that water can be the place from

586
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:21,109
which this copper or lead or arsenic is

587
00:28:17,569 --> 00:28:23,539
coming from so the these reports that

588
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:25,609
are produced about the heavy metals the

589
00:28:23,539 --> 00:28:29,329
moisture can be the source of the

590
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:32,990
problem most producers produced biochar

591
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:36,619
comes out of the kiln super hot 500

592
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:40,308
something like that or Celsius or higher

593
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:43,369
and so what they do is they put

594
00:28:40,308 --> 00:28:46,579
industrial water on it to to cool it

595
00:28:43,369 --> 00:28:49,219
down and so it's very hard for them to

596
00:28:46,579 --> 00:28:53,960
create a char that doesn't have about

597
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:56,419
50% weight of moisture so moisture is

598
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,759
like 50% on this report I don't know

599
00:28:56,419 --> 00:29:01,179
what it is on that one but we have found

600
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:05,658
a way to bring it out of the kiln dry

601
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:09,649
let it cool and what water we add back

602
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:14,360
in is there is a death suppressant and

603
00:29:09,648 --> 00:29:17,269
it's it's water that we we track the the

604
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:21,139
purity of okay so just to give listeners

605
00:29:17,269 --> 00:29:24,710
a range here the black about char has

606
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:27,259
about 23 percent moisture content and

607
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:30,019
the the other ones that I'm looking at

608
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:31,250
here are range from 48 percent to 52

609
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:35,210
percent so you're getting about 25

610
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:37,819
percent more water which means you're

611
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,409
getting I assume 25 percent less product

612
00:29:37,819 --> 00:29:42,319
so even though another biochar may be

613
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:45,409
less expensive or if they're comparably

614
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:47,599
priced you may not be getting as much of

615
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:49,909
actual biochar which is what you want so

616
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:53,750
that's a good number to be aware of and

617
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:56,860
this 23 is us moistening this because

618
00:29:53,750 --> 00:30:00,679
the biochar that we make inherently

619
00:29:56,859 --> 00:30:04,158
comes out what they consider bone dry

620
00:30:00,679 --> 00:30:08,450
but in that bone dry there are some

621
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:11,028
hydrogen and oxygen gases trapped in the

622
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:14,450
particle and they will come together

623
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:17,990
under the right circumstances and form

624
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:21,740
ten percent water which is a good thing

625
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:23,929
because for transportation you want it

626
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,690
to have a little bit of moisture content

627
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:29,690
because it's a lot less flammable but

628
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:33,259
when you get up to this waterway so much

629
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:37,460
more than biochar that while a

630
00:30:33,259 --> 00:30:39,528
percentage of of it is is water it makes

631
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:42,889
a transportation of these heavy water

632
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:46,038
chars much more expensive does that make

633
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:46,909
sense so moving on here it looks like

634
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:49,700
your

635
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:52,580
you've highlighted the total ash content

636
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:58,819
and it looks like the range between

637
00:30:52,579 --> 00:31:03,740
these three tests go from let's see 34

638
00:30:58,819 --> 00:31:06,349
down to 4.7 and I know you you had said

639
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:08,269
you want a low ash that low total ash

640
00:31:06,349 --> 00:31:10,490
number can you explain why and what that

641
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:12,650
tells us about the combustion okay well

642
00:31:10,490 --> 00:31:15,579
that means that your if you if there's

643
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:19,580
three components water carbon and ash

644
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:22,039
low ash content ash is it's not

645
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:24,230
necessarily a bad thing and in some of

646
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,639
our products we add it back in you know

647
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:28,430
I'll get to that in a minute

648
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:31,759
but generally speaking the reason you

649
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:35,630
want biochar is for the carbon what the

650
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:38,500
carbon the organic stable organic carbon

651
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:41,780
does in the soil for the whole

652
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:45,079
rhizosphere for the whole ecosystem down

653
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,690
there and replacing that carbon that has

654
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:50,569
been lost is really important and

655
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:52,960
there's a lot of chemistry that goes on

656
00:31:50,569 --> 00:31:56,000
that we never think about and

657
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:00,789
biochemistry that's related to that

658
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:06,140
carbon so the higher the carbon content

659
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:08,960
the more valuable the biochar is to the

660
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:12,650
soil that you're putting in it now ash

661
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:16,549
can be used you can see that when they

662
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:20,000
put it as carbon it's this is a liming

663
00:32:16,549 --> 00:32:23,210
value so if you want to buy biochar and

664
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,769
use it to lime your soil a high ash

665
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:29,660
content is a okay thing but it does seem

666
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:32,089
like an expensive way to approach

667
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:33,740
lightening a field do you know yeah

668
00:32:32,089 --> 00:32:36,230
calcium carbonate is really cheap you

669
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,000
can get egg lime for nothing compared to

670
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:40,220
the cost of biochar or other products

671
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,410
right so I want to ask you so the next

672
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:45,500
one down here the point out was this

673
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:48,440
butane mm-hmm and then what is the AC T

674
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,480
stands for activity butane activity and

675
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,630
what is that significant okay well one

676
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,579
day they try to determine this surface

677
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:58,520
area using this beauty

678
00:32:55,579 --> 00:33:01,250
activity test or several approaches but

679
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:03,019
this lab is sort of the standard in the

680
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,019
industry and they use butane activity

681
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:09,769
and that's how much butane gas is orbed

682
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:12,829
you know under they heat it up they put

683
00:33:09,769 --> 00:33:16,119
in the dry char and they see how much

684
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:19,909
butane gas disappears because it's

685
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:22,069
correlated to the surface area there's a

686
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:25,060
mathematical equation that ranges

687
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:27,589
surface area so the absorption

688
00:33:25,059 --> 00:33:32,990
properties of the chars what that number

689
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:34,669
shows us yeah only and also in a way it

690
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:37,490
ends up being the surface area

691
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:39,769
correlations being based on the butane

692
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,170
activity now you can get there other

693
00:33:39,769 --> 00:33:46,549
ways like with electronic microscopes

694
00:33:42,170 --> 00:33:51,320
but this is like the ordinary lab tested

695
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:55,750
that an on University lab would have the

696
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:59,720
university labs can get down to not just

697
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:03,579
what the estimated surface area is but

698
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:06,500
what the actual surface area is and also

699
00:34:03,579 --> 00:34:10,429
what part of that surface area comes

700
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:14,570
from macro pores micro pores and mezzo

701
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:17,750
pores and most of the transactions that

702
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:21,680
happen with biochar including the cation

703
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:24,789
exchange you know all the interactions

704
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:29,179
with the soil minerals so you're turning

705
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:32,889
soil minerals into more useful or more

706
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:36,230
usable forms with the addition of carbon

707
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:38,629
how much surface area is available to do

708
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:41,030
that how much surface area is available

709
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:44,450
to hold water how much surface area is

710
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:48,430
available to hold nutrients because

711
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:51,319
biochar does it by adsorption more than

712
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:54,799
absorption and that means sticking to

713
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,430
the surface of the particle so having a

714
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,010
high surface area means you have a high

715
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:03,049
efficiency in the product that you're

716
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:05,780
putting in the soil yeah I usually

717
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:08,580
describe biochar as a sort of a giant

718
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:11,400
sponge so it has a really strong ability

719
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:13,739
retain nutrients in the in the soil and

720
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,900
then release them to the plant as the

721
00:35:13,739 --> 00:35:19,019
plant needs them so if you're doing

722
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:21,960
living soils if you are farming if it's

723
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:25,619
if you're reusing your soil mix it's

724
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:28,349
really great to have biochar in there

725
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:29,759
for those properties that's is that an

726
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:32,730
OK way to describe it or is there

727
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,580
something even say yeah that's very a

728
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:38,849
good way to look at it and I'll put up

729
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,889
some photos too we are seeing about 8 to

730
00:35:38,849 --> 00:35:43,230
10 percent better growth and yield with

731
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:45,059
our biochar soil over our water only

732
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:46,860
soil and that the only difference there

733
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:48,449
in the recipe being the addition of the

734
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,700
biochar that we're soaking in the fish

735
00:35:48,449 --> 00:35:52,139
we're really happy with the quality of

736
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:55,259
the biochar and also that the growth

737
00:35:52,139 --> 00:35:57,449
that we're seeing with it so I I want to

738
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,830
move on from the test because they're a

739
00:35:57,449 --> 00:36:00,929
little dry but I think it's important

740
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:03,119
that people take a look at these numbers

741
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:05,219
and actually compare what they're

742
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,079
getting because the term biochar is

743
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,789
synonymous as you said with so many

744
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:10,170
different things that we don't really

745
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:12,529
know what we're buying and what we're

746
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:14,789
applying to the soil so it requires some

747
00:36:12,530 --> 00:36:17,430
education on the part of consumer rights

748
00:36:14,789 --> 00:36:19,440
right and yeah let's move on though and

749
00:36:17,429 --> 00:36:21,359
talk about some other questions let's

750
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,309
see here what research is being done

751
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:25,950
right now with blackout biochar I know

752
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:27,480
you've talked to me off there saying

753
00:36:25,949 --> 00:36:29,250
that you've been doing some some work

754
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:33,570
can you is there anything you can you

755
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:36,300
can talk about well we work we work with

756
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:41,090
a lot of universities and some of the

757
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:44,930
work is egg oriented Cornell Purdue just

758
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:51,360
Washington State Montana State and

759
00:36:44,929 --> 00:36:53,940
usually we ask for the results and we

760
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:57,120
have yet to get back anything that's

761
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:00,750
we're embarrassed about our unhappy

762
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,960
about Montana State just sent us some

763
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:08,309
results that they got with grains they

764
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:13,250
got 40% more harvestable grain I believe

765
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:15,239
it was wheat and with the use of biochar

766
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:15,880
do you know how they were using the

767
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:18,729
biochar

768
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,519
study hurry that trial and not really

769
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:24,519
debate I know it was a field study it

770
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:29,588
was it wasn't hot steady it was a field

771
00:37:24,518 --> 00:37:31,808
study was plots okay and the Purdue had

772
00:37:29,588 --> 00:37:33,759
forty to sixty percent better they

773
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:37,000
they've been working with it for about

774
00:37:33,759 --> 00:37:40,059
three years and different crops Cornell

775
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,409
was able to overcome a problem in their

776
00:37:40,059 --> 00:37:47,230
tomato high tunnel using it because the

777
00:37:44,409 --> 00:37:50,139
phosphorus didn't lock I guess

778
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:52,778
phosphorus locking is an issue and I

779
00:37:50,139 --> 00:37:55,750
think it may be an issue in cannabis

780
00:37:52,778 --> 00:37:58,420
plants too because you because the way I

781
00:37:55,750 --> 00:38:00,849
understand it a lot of growers go

782
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,740
through and add these nutrients and then

783
00:38:00,849 --> 00:38:05,619
they wash them out because they're ready

784
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:07,808
for it to move on to the next phase but

785
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:10,900
what biochar does is make that

786
00:38:07,809 --> 00:38:15,329
phosphorus available but it doesn't lock

787
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:19,470
it into place so this washing notion is

788
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:23,140
probably eliminated as necessary

789
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:25,239
yeah phosphorus doesn't it's it's fairly

790
00:38:23,139 --> 00:38:27,250
a mobile in soils it doesn't leach out

791
00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:30,548
like other nutrients like nitrogen would

792
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:32,829
but it I think what you're referencing

793
00:38:30,548 --> 00:38:36,429
is how available it is which I believe

794
00:38:32,829 --> 00:38:38,920
is I believe it's p2o5 which is what

795
00:38:36,429 --> 00:38:40,419
you're talking about in terms of night

796
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:42,909
phosphorus that the plant can

797
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:44,528
immediately uptake it sounds like

798
00:38:42,909 --> 00:38:49,088
there's some some good research being

799
00:38:44,528 --> 00:38:50,798
done using biochar and then also I know

800
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:52,509
you do projects on the remediation side

801
00:38:50,798 --> 00:38:54,909
how are people how other where are other

802
00:38:52,509 --> 00:38:58,539
ways people are using biochar okay well

803
00:38:54,909 --> 00:39:02,649
we've found that in water remediation

804
00:38:58,539 --> 00:39:04,690
and filtration this product is activated

805
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,789
carbon substitute in some cases is

806
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:10,568
better than activated carbon and about

807
00:39:06,789 --> 00:39:13,569
the tenth the cost so what we found with

808
00:39:10,568 --> 00:39:17,079
our char and this is it's funny to

809
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:21,099
overlap between remediation and egg

810
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:23,470
science because some of the things like

811
00:39:21,099 --> 00:39:26,109
the kinetics a speed of the reactions

812
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:29,118
are really important because like in

813
00:39:26,108 --> 00:39:32,179
water remediation they found that

814
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:35,539
you know typically it takes 24 hours for

815
00:39:32,179 --> 00:39:37,399
a biochar to filter out sand heavy

816
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,799
metals like copper and zinc which are

817
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:42,289
really prevalent in the water here it

818
00:39:39,798 --> 00:39:44,449
takes two minutes for ours to filter it

819
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:47,089
out what that means is you need a lot

820
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:49,699
less of it a lot smaller bed

821
00:39:47,088 --> 00:39:53,778
they make these gigantic swimming pool

822
00:39:49,699 --> 00:39:56,419
treatment areas with other products and

823
00:39:53,778 --> 00:39:59,018
if you can cut that footprint down it's

824
00:39:56,420 --> 00:40:02,389
a lot less expensive for the industry to

825
00:39:59,018 --> 00:40:06,048
maintain that water so that's one thing

826
00:40:02,389 --> 00:40:09,528
and then it has a natural affinity for a

827
00:40:06,048 --> 00:40:12,139
lot of these heavy metals but not the so

828
00:40:09,528 --> 00:40:16,909
much the an ion ones which would be

829
00:40:12,139 --> 00:40:19,159
selenium and arsenic and let's just talk

830
00:40:16,909 --> 00:40:22,038
about selenium in arsenic right now but

831
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:24,949
we are able we are able to make a

832
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:29,140
coating now to put on that biochar and

833
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:33,439
still get that real speedy reaction time

834
00:40:29,139 --> 00:40:39,528
but have it attract the arsenic sand so

835
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:42,950
and and the anion problem things salsa

836
00:40:39,528 --> 00:40:46,608
really good at oil oils petrochemicals

837
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:49,460
and that has some bearing on restoring

838
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:53,869
fields that have been damaged by some of

839
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:55,548
this death making land usable again so

840
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:59,059
can you tell me a little bit then about

841
00:40:55,548 --> 00:41:01,460
what makes black owl unique what makes

842
00:40:59,059 --> 00:41:03,798
your biochar different than say some of

843
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,059
these other ones on the market besides

844
00:41:03,798 --> 00:41:07,099
the fact that you're fully you know

845
00:41:05,059 --> 00:41:09,079
paralyzing the material you have the lab

846
00:41:07,099 --> 00:41:10,190
tests and the university research to

847
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,989
support what you're doing is there

848
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,858
anything else that really separates you

849
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:16,690
and your eyes for me

850
00:41:12,858 --> 00:41:19,548
yeah we're it kind of and working on

851
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,710
we've done several publications where

852
00:41:19,548 --> 00:41:25,210
we've pointed out this kinetic thing

853
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:31,039
which is really really important

854
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:34,400
also if a biochars got enough time

855
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:36,200
against a this oh it's understandable

856
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,349
it has a charge to it it's a negative

857
00:41:36,199 --> 00:41:41,710
charge and that charge the strength of

858
00:41:39,349 --> 00:41:45,260
that charges is really important because

859
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:48,289
the scientists are theorizing that

860
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:51,500
that's what stimulates the plants growth

861
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:55,460
hormones and why in part that you're

862
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:58,699
getting faster maturation you'll

863
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:00,980
absolutely I also get compost to mature

864
00:41:58,699 --> 00:42:03,558
faster in stimulating the growth

865
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:08,179
hormones it's also making the plants

866
00:42:03,559 --> 00:42:13,339
larger and the yields larger so it's a

867
00:42:08,179 --> 00:42:16,519
standout in the forces and you know that

868
00:42:13,338 --> 00:42:17,719
magnetic charge thing is there

869
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,429
speculating

870
00:42:17,719 --> 00:42:21,519
there's more than one school of thought

871
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:26,000
on how to explain this but they think

872
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:30,858
it's what's communicating underneath the

873
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:34,460
soil with the fungi which like it the

874
00:42:30,858 --> 00:42:37,429
beneficial fungi but the negative molds

875
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:40,880
gray black and white are getting their

876
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:45,048
communication systems messed up so the

877
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:47,838
plants have a better resistance to those

878
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:50,389
molds so how what kind of research have

879
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:54,288
you seen with biochar and mycorrhizal

880
00:42:50,389 --> 00:42:56,719
fungus oh well quite a bit enough so I

881
00:42:54,289 --> 00:43:00,740
brought one picture down to show how

882
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:02,419
good the interaction is encourages it so

883
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:05,118
you're seeing a symbiotic relation yeah

884
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:07,548
and what levels are you recommending for

885
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,880
people to use biochar in potting soils

886
00:43:07,548 --> 00:43:12,288
or in fields to see results okay I would

887
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,250
like this one say one thing about

888
00:43:12,289 --> 00:43:18,829
potting soils and compost we have number

889
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:21,260
of landscapers who come and get the

890
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:25,660
biochar to put in the compost because

891
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:30,079
people round up and some of these

892
00:43:25,659 --> 00:43:33,259
herbicides and pesticides survive the

893
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:35,000
composting process so I put the biochar

894
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:38,359
in there and it has a natural affinity

895
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:41,150
to hold that so that when they use that

896
00:43:38,358 --> 00:43:42,139
composted product they know that they're

897
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,548
not going to and

898
00:43:42,139 --> 00:43:46,639
have it the growth of the plants that

899
00:43:43,548 --> 00:43:49,369
they have just put in the landscape you

900
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:53,690
know it holds it within the biochar

901
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:56,869
particle it doesn't allow it to be taken

902
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:59,599
by the plant we have the same research

903
00:43:56,869 --> 00:44:02,390
on eco lion and taro caucus too by the

904
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,750
way so so where does it go exactly that

905
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:10,068
if it's it's it's stuck in the particle

906
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:13,699
forever yeah and you know microbes do

907
00:44:10,068 --> 00:44:16,940
come and eat degrade that stuff in time

908
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:21,500
okay so but at least it doesn't cause a

909
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:22,909
compost to do crashing a new planting so

910
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:24,920
they they put it in there as a

911
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:27,558
preventative so what rates are you

912
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:31,519
seeing people using okay so the rate

913
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:36,519
that's why this carbon number is so

914
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:41,719
important we use five percent by volume

915
00:44:36,518 --> 00:44:45,528
in a container and get excellent results

916
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:48,669
beyond 15 with ours would not be good

917
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:52,130
but I call our biochar a high efficiency

918
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:54,980
biochar because it is holds more water

919
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:58,670
holds more nutrients works faster and

920
00:44:54,980 --> 00:45:01,449
has this high carbon and high surface

921
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:05,599
area that its orders of magnitude higher

922
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:07,548
than these these other charts and so you

923
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:12,019
need less of it yeah it's high

924
00:45:07,548 --> 00:45:16,099
efficiency char so 5 percent 10 percent

925
00:45:12,018 --> 00:45:19,729
snice if a person wants to go that far

926
00:45:16,099 --> 00:45:21,829
with it and 15 percent is max Cornell

927
00:45:19,730 --> 00:45:25,219
did really interesting bunch of studies

928
00:45:21,829 --> 00:45:29,240
were they they kept adding salt salts

929
00:45:25,219 --> 00:45:32,149
are a problem from synthetic agriculture

930
00:45:29,239 --> 00:45:34,758
their residual in the soil and their

931
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:38,150
impede the growth of plants in future

932
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:41,119
years and so Cornell took these plants

933
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:45,019
and they put our biochar in some of them

934
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,240
and not another biochars and some of

935
00:45:45,018 --> 00:45:50,449
them and no biochar and some of them and

936
00:45:47,239 --> 00:45:52,769
they kept putting on briny water salt

937
00:45:50,449 --> 00:45:56,519
water and you know

938
00:45:52,769 --> 00:45:58,530
the controls died and the and these were

939
00:45:56,519 --> 00:46:01,949
soybeans which are sensitive the

940
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:05,390
soybeans in our biochar went to full

941
00:46:01,949 --> 00:46:07,649
maturity and created new soybeans and

942
00:46:05,389 --> 00:46:09,019
even though they increased the

943
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,519
braininess

944
00:46:09,019 --> 00:46:16,530
continuously to try to see what upper

945
00:46:11,519 --> 00:46:19,110
level it would take so that may not be a

946
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:22,140
common situation but it's fairly common

947
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:23,730
in the California soils so it has a good

948
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:26,519
buffering capacity was what you're

949
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:29,130
saying yeah for sodium so for people

950
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,289
that are say doing imagined synthetic

951
00:46:29,130 --> 00:46:34,079
chemicals or ionic salts all right are

952
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:36,269
you seeing that people use are using

953
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:40,440
biochar with salt based fertilizer

954
00:46:36,269 --> 00:46:43,559
programs as well yeah we we have people

955
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:45,599
using Oh in just every imaginable way

956
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:47,940
and that's one thing that we've been

957
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,650
criticized for is having white why do

958
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,289
you sell a biochar

959
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,269
that's just biochar and you're not

960
00:46:52,289 --> 00:46:56,969
adding this and that the other thing to

961
00:46:54,269 --> 00:47:00,090
it well we do do that if somebody wants

962
00:46:56,969 --> 00:47:01,980
us to do it really the reason is is

963
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,309
because everybody has their own unique

964
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:08,039
thing that they like to do and products

965
00:47:05,309 --> 00:47:09,570
that they like to use so we think just

966
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:12,809
give him a really good high-quality

967
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:17,400
charter add to whatever that product is

968
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:20,130
it not yet have we had anybody say that

969
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,619
gave them a bad result if you're using

970
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:25,050
biochar in a living soil like let's say

971
00:47:22,619 --> 00:47:27,600
a raised bed for example and you have it

972
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:29,789
in there at well with our souls we're

973
00:47:27,599 --> 00:47:32,368
like eight to ten percent mm-hmm how

974
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:35,608
often would you reinvent that bed with

975
00:47:32,369 --> 00:47:36,900
biochar or would you ever rien oculi tit

976
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:39,389
or would you just assume that for the

977
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,369
next year or two it's probably gonna be

978
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:43,230
at optimal levels or what are your

979
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:45,840
thoughts on that if you have it in there

980
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:48,240
at eight to ten percent I don't think

981
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,320
you need to do anything more for the

982
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:53,368
foreseeable future

983
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:55,410
okay frankly it should be there and it

984
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:58,769
kind of it kind of grows and multiplies

985
00:47:55,409 --> 00:48:02,549
and also it speeds up the formation of

986
00:47:58,769 --> 00:48:04,338
humic acids we've had apple growers over

987
00:48:02,550 --> 00:48:06,440
and one add you use it and they

988
00:48:04,338 --> 00:48:09,078
called up [ __ ] but he make acid in

989
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:10,789
that biochar you know because it your

990
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:14,930
lady they have their agronomist doing

991
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:18,440
the test so yeah and nature intended

992
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:20,389
carbon to be in the soil so that brings

993
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:23,778
up an interesting question for me I know

994
00:48:20,389 --> 00:48:26,268
when I was getting my soil labels made I

995
00:48:23,778 --> 00:48:29,748
was told that I had to put virgin

996
00:48:26,268 --> 00:48:32,058
forests slash on my ingredient list for

997
00:48:29,748 --> 00:48:34,068
the black out biochar and that sounded

998
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:35,989
terrible to me when I first read that's

999
00:48:34,068 --> 00:48:37,608
just those three words together didn't

1000
00:48:35,989 --> 00:48:39,318
sound like it was a good ecological

1001
00:48:37,608 --> 00:48:40,429
solution and then you sort of explained

1002
00:48:39,318 --> 00:48:41,659
to me a little bit about what that

1003
00:48:40,429 --> 00:48:44,149
actually means

1004
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:47,808
could you just review that a little bit

1005
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:49,910
for listeners yes if you've seen there

1006
00:48:47,809 --> 00:48:53,479
are a lot of slash piles around even in

1007
00:48:49,909 --> 00:48:56,509
our neighborhood now where they taken

1008
00:48:53,478 --> 00:48:59,808
down trees because they're clearing to

1009
00:48:56,509 --> 00:49:01,909
do more building well they they let

1010
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:04,249
those piles build up and dry and then

1011
00:49:01,909 --> 00:49:09,228
they ignite them that's the typical

1012
00:49:04,248 --> 00:49:11,868
slash and we're you know harvest tree in

1013
00:49:09,228 --> 00:49:14,868
the forest or outside of the forest they

1014
00:49:11,869 --> 00:49:17,960
burn those things up well in a

1015
00:49:14,869 --> 00:49:20,239
commercial tree operetta creation and

1016
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:23,329
like a private forest what they do is

1017
00:49:20,239 --> 00:49:25,909
they can get a forest certification and

1018
00:49:23,329 --> 00:49:27,710
that means for every tree that's been

1019
00:49:25,909 --> 00:49:30,199
pulling a lot of carbon out of the

1020
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:32,778
atmosphere each one of those that they

1021
00:49:30,199 --> 00:49:36,468
take they they have to plant like five

1022
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:38,329
trees to replace it and then the growth

1023
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:41,210
of those trees they're pulling more

1024
00:49:38,329 --> 00:49:44,420
carbon out we would never recommend

1025
00:49:41,210 --> 00:49:47,298
harvesting trees for making biochar but

1026
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:49,519
there is this waste that's called slash

1027
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:51,798
which are the limbs that they can't turn

1028
00:49:49,518 --> 00:49:53,629
into two by fours right and the tops

1029
00:49:51,798 --> 00:49:56,389
that they can't turn into two by fours

1030
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:59,088
and the bases which they can't turn into

1031
00:49:56,389 --> 00:50:01,429
two by fours so those things and most

1032
00:49:59,088 --> 00:50:03,679
forestry operations aren't left in the

1033
00:50:01,429 --> 00:50:07,068
forest and there's two problems without

1034
00:50:03,679 --> 00:50:09,978
one if they don't end up being tinder

1035
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:12,798
for a forest fire what they do do is

1036
00:50:09,978 --> 00:50:14,838
degrade over a period of time the

1037
00:50:12,798 --> 00:50:16,289
microbes come in and they're just

1038
00:50:14,838 --> 00:50:18,750
releasing all that

1039
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:22,199
I've been dioxide up into the air so we

1040
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:25,349
take that stuff and converted that's

1041
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:28,589
what virgin virgin meaning it's never

1042
00:50:25,349 --> 00:50:31,799
been treated wood forest means came from

1043
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:34,410
a forest and slash means it's otherwise

1044
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:37,170
waste okay so essentially it's a

1045
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:39,869
byproduct of the logging or forestry

1046
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:43,740
industry and it's a way of sequestering

1047
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:45,119
that carbon into a usable by-product so

1048
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:46,739
you're taking a waste stream and

1049
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,569
actually making it more ecological by

1050
00:50:46,739 --> 00:50:50,969
making this biochar crap

1051
00:50:48,570 --> 00:50:53,130
that's wonderful which makes me want to

1052
00:50:50,969 --> 00:50:54,509
switch gears a little bit so as as you

1053
00:50:53,130 --> 00:50:57,300
know because we've talked about this my

1054
00:50:54,510 --> 00:51:01,950
father after retiring was got really

1055
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:04,860
into biochar and started he bought a

1056
00:51:01,949 --> 00:51:07,799
kontiki kiln or built one and was

1057
00:51:04,860 --> 00:51:10,980
looking into how to take this technology

1058
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:13,620
into poorer countries

1059
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:15,960
and villages and as a way of raising

1060
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:18,210
soil fertility so he was looking into

1061
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:21,260
China and he took a few trips over there

1062
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:23,639
before getting ill himself and was

1063
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:27,270
working with them but then he was also

1064
00:51:23,639 --> 00:51:29,849
working with the Oregon some forestry

1065
00:51:27,269 --> 00:51:31,619
people down in Oregon as a way for these

1066
00:51:29,849 --> 00:51:34,319
kilns to be something they could take on

1067
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:38,069
to site and then as they're doing the

1068
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:39,240
cuttings or the the harvesting in the

1069
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:40,950
timber industry they could then take

1070
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:43,739
this slash and put it right into the

1071
00:51:40,949 --> 00:51:45,449
kilns pyrolyze it right there on site

1072
00:51:43,739 --> 00:51:47,669
and then apply that material back onto

1073
00:51:45,449 --> 00:51:50,129
the forest so is there any have any

1074
00:51:47,670 --> 00:51:53,460
thoughts on that or I think it's a

1075
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:57,390
really good idea however you know it

1076
00:51:53,460 --> 00:52:00,720
you've got to manage that equipment and

1077
00:51:57,389 --> 00:52:06,359
you have to you know take several hours

1078
00:52:00,719 --> 00:52:09,419
in a kontiki kiln and so I think it's a

1079
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:13,140
good idea it would be nice to have

1080
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:17,280
really good pyrolysis units that are

1081
00:52:13,139 --> 00:52:20,460
mobile however we found that bringing it

1082
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,300
out of the forest on the logging trucks

1083
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:26,010
themselves didn't add to the pollution

1084
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:28,160
so our way of doing it is to

1085
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:31,830
take it out of the forest and then

1086
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:34,529
process it and therefore we can use the

1087
00:52:31,829 --> 00:52:36,989
energy the you know who can create

1088
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:39,960
energy yeah I love the I love the idea

1089
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:41,159
of taking a byproduct like this or a

1090
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:44,400
waste stream and making it into

1091
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:46,019
something that adds fertility and I know

1092
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:48,180
my dad was really excited about that

1093
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,820
whole process in terms of how he could

1094
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:53,339
utilize that in you know recreate this

1095
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:55,980
and maybe some villages out in China and

1096
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:58,110
other places in the world now in terms I

1097
00:52:55,980 --> 00:53:00,900
mean I have a kontiki kill on our

1098
00:52:58,110 --> 00:53:03,180
property but I still choose to use your

1099
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:05,220
biochar because I can't produce it in a

1100
00:53:03,179 --> 00:53:07,349
quantity that makes it cost-effective

1101
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:09,629
for me and it like you said it is a lot

1102
00:53:07,349 --> 00:53:12,929
of time but I do love the idea of being

1103
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:14,789
able to hopefully encourage the forestry

1104
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:16,250
industry to start considering biochar as

1105
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:19,199
a viable option rather than

1106
00:53:16,250 --> 00:53:20,130
slash-and-burn and and you know some of

1107
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,239
these other things that you've talked

1108
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:26,610
about one other question I had along

1109
00:53:24,239 --> 00:53:27,989
those lines though I know my dad

1110
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:30,630
initially when he started licking the

1111
00:53:27,989 --> 00:53:33,689
biochar he took a class to make a

1112
00:53:30,630 --> 00:53:35,220
biochar stove and then he came back and

1113
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:36,960
showed it to me and this was he was

1114
00:53:35,219 --> 00:53:38,250
first getting into it and and we looked

1115
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,269
at it or like this isn't actually

1116
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:41,789
pyrolized

1117
00:53:39,269 --> 00:53:43,289
you're making ash essentially you might

1118
00:53:41,789 --> 00:53:44,670
as well just go put this in your

1119
00:53:43,289 --> 00:53:46,230
fireplace for probably what you're

1120
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:47,970
getting so do you have any

1121
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:50,460
recommendations for people on a small

1122
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:52,349
scale and who say I wanted to try making

1123
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,269
their own biochar I've seen people

1124
00:53:52,349 --> 00:53:55,829
digging pits I've seen a whole bunch of

1125
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:57,900
different designs is there any anything

1126
00:53:55,829 --> 00:54:01,769
you can recommend there's all kinds of

1127
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:05,250
stuff there's another dr. T Lloyd whose

1128
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:08,849
actual name is Paul Anderson he he makes

1129
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:12,000
a cook stove you put the wood and this

1130
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:14,610
is really meant for villagers in there

1131
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:18,420
and you really control how much oxygen

1132
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:20,519
is burning that fire they're using the

1133
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:23,700
heat to cook on and then they take that

1134
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:26,969
little bit of material out and throw it

1135
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:30,869
on their garden and it works well I've

1136
00:54:26,969 --> 00:54:33,929
seen these some people have cans that go

1137
00:54:30,869 --> 00:54:36,239
into their wood-burning stove and while

1138
00:54:33,929 --> 00:54:38,639
the wood-burning stove is throwing up

1139
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:39,149
gases into the atmosphere at least what

1140
00:54:38,639 --> 00:54:43,049
they have

1141
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:45,780
the can is low to no oxygen and so it

1142
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:47,730
actually will retain the carbon and as

1143
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:49,769
long as they don't cook it too long you

1144
00:54:47,730 --> 00:54:52,679
need to look at pyrolysis a lot like

1145
00:54:49,769 --> 00:54:55,079
baking your baking you want to bake it

1146
00:54:52,679 --> 00:54:58,500
rather than burn it there's a million

1147
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,559
different models of product and I know

1148
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:05,489
that they've taken made some larger

1149
00:55:01,559 --> 00:55:08,849
units that they're taking out into the

1150
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:11,609
forest but nothing that can utilize the

1151
00:55:08,849 --> 00:55:14,250
heat or the energy and and unfortunately

1152
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:17,099
I think I'm not talking about the

1153
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:20,219
kontiki kiln because that's a basic

1154
00:55:17,099 --> 00:55:22,170
thing that as long as you're there to

1155
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:25,949
suppress it at the right time you can

1156
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:28,230
get biochar from it it works and I liked

1157
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:31,799
your dad's unit because it could take

1158
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:33,780
fairly large limbs and work with them

1159
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:38,100
because a lot of people don't have

1160
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:42,330
chipped wood to work with so that that

1161
00:55:38,099 --> 00:55:45,150
is practical and inexpensive but I don't

1162
00:55:42,329 --> 00:55:48,059
like is this mid tier group of things

1163
00:55:45,150 --> 00:55:51,329
that are put on wheels that don't use

1164
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:55,079
the heat in energy and do create tars in

1165
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:58,549
the end so knowing a little bit about

1166
00:55:55,079 --> 00:56:02,340
the engineering but this can all be

1167
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:05,930
calculated from a lab report so I think

1168
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:09,840
with any big outlay of capital for

1169
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:12,179
machinery a person should always use get

1170
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:15,480
their own feedstock that they anticipate

1171
00:56:12,179 --> 00:56:18,599
using have a load run and and then pay

1172
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:20,880
for a test to see what kind of result

1173
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,829
they're getting yeah I just think we

1174
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:24,750
have two different types of listeners

1175
00:56:22,829 --> 00:56:25,920
here potentially we'll have people that

1176
00:56:24,750 --> 00:56:27,449
want to make it themselves

1177
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,180
you know just for their home garden or

1178
00:56:27,449 --> 00:56:31,889
for home grow you know really small

1179
00:56:30,179 --> 00:56:33,089
scale just to try it out and you know

1180
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,829
and it may not be the highest quality

1181
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,150
biochar but it's not gonna hurt their

1182
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:38,159
plants and they want to you know give it

1183
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:39,690
a shot nothing dangerous and then you'll

1184
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:42,480
have other people on a commercial scale

1185
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:43,860
that say hey I have all these biochar

1186
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,360
companies out there and they're all

1187
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:46,980
trying to sell me product and they all

1188
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,650
make different claims how do I evaluate

1189
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:50,929
them and that's where that lab test

1190
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:52,608
I think is really important yeah I was

1191
00:56:50,929 --> 00:56:56,480
talking about if you're buying equipment

1192
00:56:52,608 --> 00:57:00,078
and in you and you're putting some big

1193
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,059
dollars into equipment it's like you're

1194
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:05,900
talking about the forest model the

1195
00:57:02,059 --> 00:57:08,000
kontiki kiln makes a lot of sense some

1196
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:10,760
of the machinery that's been drug out

1197
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:13,849
into the forest is $300,000 machinery

1198
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:18,700
okay before you do that get it a lab

1199
00:57:13,849 --> 00:57:22,359
test is what I my strong recommendation

1200
00:57:18,699 --> 00:57:26,348
sure and there's all kinds of different

1201
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:29,239
configurations vertical horizontal

1202
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:31,338
gasification as as opposed to pyrolysis

1203
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:34,729
which just means there may be some

1204
00:57:31,338 --> 00:57:39,038
airflow or some people put oxygen in

1205
00:57:34,730 --> 00:57:41,480
there and it depends on you know what

1206
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:44,420
you're trying to achieve in the end but

1207
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:47,240
for a home gardener I think the kontiki

1208
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,278
kiln is a good thing for a third world

1209
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:51,919
country I think a cook stoves a good

1210
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:54,769
thing it depends on how horrible you

1211
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:57,889
need it to be but with any of these

1212
00:57:54,769 --> 00:57:59,960
things if you do it right you can you

1213
00:57:57,889 --> 00:58:03,769
can end up making some very good carbon

1214
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:05,929
even Boy Scouts can do it with campfires

1215
00:58:03,769 --> 00:58:09,170
you just want it to burn from the top

1216
00:58:05,929 --> 00:58:11,149
down not the bottom up often it gets

1217
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:14,150
some links or resources to put on the

1218
00:58:11,150 --> 00:58:15,470
page from you after this talk this got

1219
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,838
me thinking and this is gonna be kind of

1220
00:58:15,469 --> 00:58:20,000
a silly question for you but something

1221
00:58:17,838 --> 00:58:22,119
that I know I've seen online is people

1222
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:24,769
think of biochar and they go okay well

1223
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:27,349
why can't I just go get some charcoal

1224
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:30,170
briquettes and pound those up and add

1225
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:32,420
that to my soil or pulling out of a

1226
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:33,858
fireplace or things like that so I know

1227
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:36,650
we talked about a little bit but can you

1228
00:58:33,858 --> 00:58:39,048
just reiterate again any potential

1229
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:42,470
dangers there what the major difference

1230
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:47,358
is besides the carbon to ash ratio right

1231
00:58:42,469 --> 00:58:50,169
okay so charcoal in a bag is made to be

1232
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:54,159
an energy source to cook food its

1233
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:58,070
purpose is to be a source of the energy

1234
00:58:54,159 --> 00:59:03,079
like coal for instance but it's charcoal

1235
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:05,360
usually it's made from wood but it also

1236
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:09,319
has binders in it that gives it the

1237
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:12,380
shape that it is I and sometimes they

1238
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:15,550
put accelerants in that charcoal but in

1239
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:20,539
any case it's not a nice pure carbon

1240
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:22,820
product to enhance the soil its whole

1241
00:59:20,539 --> 00:59:25,699
purpose is different and there's a lot

1242
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:28,370
of unknowns about it that are of concern

1243
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:30,919
to agronomist so there could be other

1244
00:59:28,369 --> 00:59:33,469
things in that charcoal briquette that

1245
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:35,599
may not be safe for you yeah I just know

1246
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:37,459
you don't know you don't know what it's

1247
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:39,559
made of you don't need to it's

1248
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:41,389
supposedly you don't need to know but

1249
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:44,210
you know there's been some some

1250
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:48,920
criticism in the health field about

1251
00:59:44,210 --> 00:59:52,039
charred meats cooked on a charcoal grill

1252
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:56,110
and you know all of this stuff when you

1253
00:59:52,039 --> 00:59:59,090
heat something up you get reformation of

1254
00:59:56,110 --> 01:00:02,690
chemistry and you can end up with things

1255
00:59:59,090 --> 01:00:07,610
like dioxins and stuff that's just not

1256
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:10,610
good so with the charcoal briquettes

1257
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:15,380
they're not they are not to be used in

1258
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:17,630
substitution for actual biochar and did

1259
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:19,910
we we did go into the fact that you want

1260
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:21,590
it to be at least sixty percent carbon I

1261
01:00:19,909 --> 01:00:24,889
don't know if we talked about that from

1262
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:28,370
the test results but you know the

1263
01:00:24,889 --> 01:00:30,949
combustion what you're doing in a grill

1264
01:00:28,369 --> 01:00:33,799
with charcoal too is they're doing full

1265
01:00:30,949 --> 01:00:35,899
combustion house all air coming in on it

1266
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,140
right and what you end up with is a gray

1267
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:41,119
ash you're burning up what carbon is in

1268
01:00:39,139 --> 01:00:44,150
there but it could be wood it could be

1269
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:47,599
torrefied wood that serves as that

1270
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:50,750
charcoal and so that hg ratio would not

1271
01:00:47,599 --> 01:00:55,639
be a good number for plants for for

1272
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:57,650
optimal stability and the soils so okay

1273
01:00:55,639 --> 01:00:59,960
so the hydrogen and carbon ratio is a

1274
01:00:57,650 --> 01:01:03,240
reflection of how stable that product is

1275
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:04,500
is in how long the the carbon will stay

1276
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:05,639
in a form that will allow it to remain

1277
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:10,019
in the soil that's what you're saying

1278
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:13,319
right and not degrade so you probably

1279
01:01:10,019 --> 01:01:15,949
find that the degradation rates of a

1280
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:19,830
charcoal that are meant for barbecue are

1281
01:01:15,949 --> 01:01:22,649
much faster I think that you'd find the

1282
01:01:19,829 --> 01:01:25,110
absorption is much lower in much lower

1283
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:26,849
cation exchange capacity yeah which is

1284
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:28,890
its ability to retain nutrients

1285
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:31,500
okay well was there anything else you

1286
01:01:28,889 --> 01:01:33,239
wanted to cover talking about biochar do

1287
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:35,730
you feel like we got a good foundation

1288
01:01:33,239 --> 01:01:40,049
there for people to get an idea of what

1289
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:44,510
biochar is you know I just want to say

1290
01:01:40,050 --> 01:01:49,289
this you can't there's a lot of magical

1291
01:01:44,510 --> 01:01:52,560
thinking around biochar and you won't

1292
01:01:49,289 --> 01:01:55,320
believe it till you see it I mean you

1293
01:01:52,559 --> 01:01:57,210
really experience and it turns you into

1294
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:01,019
a believer if you end up with a good

1295
01:01:57,210 --> 01:02:04,289
product on the other hand you know buyer

1296
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:06,269
beware would just like anything else so

1297
01:02:04,289 --> 01:02:09,900
source a good high quality biochar and

1298
01:02:06,269 --> 01:02:12,239
then try out a plant or five plants and

1299
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:14,070
use scientific method so make sure you

1300
01:02:12,239 --> 01:02:16,469
have a control so the only difference is

1301
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:19,710
the addition of biochar versus your

1302
01:02:16,469 --> 01:02:20,879
other the rest of your crop and see the

1303
01:02:19,710 --> 01:02:22,349
