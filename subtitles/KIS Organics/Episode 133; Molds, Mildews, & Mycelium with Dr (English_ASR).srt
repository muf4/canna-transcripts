welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:24,840
science podcast I'm your host Tad hussy

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,399
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:28,518
where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

6
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,358
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:28,518 --> 00:00:32,119
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:34,280
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:37,280
knowledge my guest this week is a

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:39,480
returning guest Dr Nicole goce is a

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,920
pathologist and professor and extension

12
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:43,718
specialist at the University of Kentucky

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
her program focuses on disease

14
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:48,600
management of specialty crops including

15
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,519
hemp in her extension role she develops

16
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,079
educational and Outreach programs to

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,719
help Growers manage disease through

18
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:56,840
identification understanding of

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,359
pathosystems and integration of

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,399
management strategies her research

21
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:04,079
program Focus focuses on a range of hemp

22
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:06,760
diseases including fusarium

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:08,840
headlight Dr goce earned her Bachelor's

24
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:10,719
of Science in horiculture science and

25
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,520
her PhD in Plant Pathology from

26
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:16,400
Louisiana State University she joined

27
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:18,199
the UK College of agriculture in 2011

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
and began working with Industrial Hemp

29
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:23,240
in 2014 there will be a link on the

30
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,359
podcast page to access her resources and

31
00:01:23,239 --> 00:01:29,640
research in social media now on to the

32
00:01:27,359 --> 00:01:33,319
show hi Nicole thanks for coming on the

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,478
podcast again today hello how are you

34
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:38,078
wonderful I'm really excited to talk to

35
00:01:35,478 --> 00:01:40,399
you again um it's always great to hear a

36
00:01:38,078 --> 00:01:43,000
pathologist perspective on

37
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,399
cultivation and I actually went back and

38
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,560
relistened to our last conversation

39
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,920
which was I think a year or two ago now

40
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,439
um and there were some really important

41
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,560
takeaways that I I thought Growers would

42
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:57,839
find really interesting uh could you

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,118
review some of those I know we just

44
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,960
talked about them uh before the show but

45
00:02:00,118 --> 00:02:02,840
um maybe the especially the ones around

46
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:05,640
powdery

47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:07,880
mildew okay so powdery mildew probably

48
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:10,800
hands down number one disease on

49
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:13,519
cannabis um in particular in greenh

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,719
houses um we see powdery mildew in the

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:19,159
field in kind of like the

52
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:22,359
Northeast um a lot less so like in the

53
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:25,598
South and Southeast um out west it kind

54
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,519
of like in the um the Pacific Pacific

55
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:30,039
Northwest we'll see some powdery milde

56
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,000
so it kind of really depends uh powder

57
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:34,799
Milos overall don't like a lot of heat

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,318
are not the ones that we see as much in

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,200
um in cannabis so um in the greenhouse

60
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:41,839
we're more of controlled temperature so

61
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:44,518
we'll see a lot more powdery mildew

62
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,280
there okay I digress um so powdery

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:52,599
mildew um the primary powdery mildew

64
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:55,519
that we see in cannabis is um a a Genus

65
00:02:52,598 --> 00:02:57,919
golovinomyces so you might see it as

66
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,239
golovinomyces spacius um but

67
00:02:57,919 --> 00:03:04,479
golovinomyces ambrosier

68
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,519
is um is the pathogen um the the the

69
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:10,318
correct name um and of course you know

70
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,799
in the pathology world we always uh

71
00:03:10,318 --> 00:03:15,878
we're always at battle with taxonomist

72
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,799
and uh so golovinomyces so you might

73
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:19,840
hear a couple of different species there

74
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:23,560
but it looks like that's all the same

75
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:26,799
one you may hear in the Pacific um the

76
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:29,840
Pacific Northwest a little bit of Buzz

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:32,840
about pisia macularis and that is the

78
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,360
hops powdery mil do it has been shown to

79
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:40,000
jump from hops to cannabis or hemp um

80
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,920
when they're planted in close proximity

81
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,840
um so it hasn't become a problem yet

82
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:46,719
everybody's on standby everybody's

83
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:49,438
watching that but if you or an indoor

84
00:03:46,719 --> 00:03:52,959
cannabis grower or if your cannabis is

85
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:56,039
located outside of a hops production

86
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,560
area you probably are dealing with the

87
00:03:56,039 --> 00:04:01,959
uh go of Venom

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,280
IES now now one thing that you you'd

89
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:07,319
mentioned was the humidity ranges of

90
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,719
some of these species can you touch on

91
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:13,598
that again too okay yes so we we know we

92
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:17,319
say kind of in general so we tend to

93
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:19,719
lump powdery mil as just a single um a

94
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:21,439
single pathogen and they're not there

95
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:23,400
are lots of different powdery mil there

96
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:25,040
are a lot of host specific powdery Milos

97
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:27,159
the one you see on roses it's not the

98
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,039
one you see on CRP Myrtle it's not the

99
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,560
one you see on cucurbits and your

100
00:04:30,038 --> 00:04:37,079
backyard and um but the one the one or

101
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:42,038
the ones that the go ofen amyes that

102
00:04:37,079 --> 00:04:46,519
affects um cannabis tends to be more of

103
00:04:42,038 --> 00:04:48,839
a broad a broad Host range um uh

104
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:51,399
golovinomyces or or powdery milde

105
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:55,239
pathogen um they are fungal by the way

106
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:57,799
um this is a fungus um so they don't

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,478
need free water to complete their life

108
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,360
cycle so a lot of our pathogens we

109
00:04:59,478 --> 00:05:04,399
always talk about free water free water

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,800
and that means rain irrigation fog like

111
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:10,719
that that physical water that you can

112
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,160
see on a Surface say on a leaf um but

113
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,039
humidity is a different animal and when

114
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,199
you start playing with humidity so a lot

115
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,318
of our pathogens need some level of

116
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,360
humidity to be able to sporulate that's

117
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,680
produced spores or to infect um once

118
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:27,520
infection occurs none of the rest

119
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,959
matters um high humidity or high

120
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:33,719
temperature can cause um uh uh

121
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:35,599
golovinomyces in this uh situation to

122
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,520
actually produce spores from that leaf

123
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,080
for example to produce those spores so

124
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,198
those spores can disseminate um so the

125
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:43,758
golven amyes and I'm going to talk just

126
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:45,160
about that one and I know last time we

127
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,840
talked about different different powdery

128
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,080
M but let's just focus on that one

129
00:05:46,839 --> 00:05:52,079
because probably 95% of what we see is

130
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:56,560
the golovinomyces and

131
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:58,800
brosier um it can it can infect it'll

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,280
need higher humidity to infect but to

133
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,918
sporulate

134
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:08,439
um as low as 40% relative humidity 40%

135
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:10,879
is low okay usually though um we talk

136
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:13,598
about 40% humidity but usually when

137
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:15,240
we're seeing those uh warmer days cooler

138
00:06:13,598 --> 00:06:17,879
nights where you start getting that

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,160
condensation so you really will get kind

140
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:25,719
of some spikes in um humidity in those

141
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,520
cycles of temperature uh variation um so

142
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:30,400
we can we can see that especially when

143
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:33,318
we have those cool nights

144
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,679
um powdery mildew loves that scenario

145
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:38,439
and then um but it does not like free

146
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,478
water so the opposite of all of our

147
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:45,959
other plant pathogens um the kind of the

148
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:48,800
moral of the story though is Tad is that

149
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:51,399
powdery mildew is going to find a way

150
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
right so it it kind of it's resilient

151
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:56,038
when it's dry and it's resilient when

152
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:59,598
it's wet it always picks like a little

153
00:06:56,038 --> 00:07:01,560
um um a little caveat where it kind of

154
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,759
will infect and it will sporulate it

155
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,120
produces lots of spores we call those

156
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,120
asexual spores canidia it'll produce

157
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:11,720
lots of canidia they um wind or air

158
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:14,319
disseminated and we call this uh disease

159
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,759
of mildew because what we see on the

160
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,160
surface lots of spores all that fuzzy

161
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,400
stuff you see Mycelia and spores lots of

162
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,599
spores they're wind disseminated it's a

163
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:25,959
it's a numbers game for for that

164
00:07:23,598 --> 00:07:29,079
pathogen and they're everywhere and they

165
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:31,680
fly around and uh that's what makes it

166
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:35,240
the number number one disease of

167
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,639
cannabis now how far can those spores

168
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,120
travel and what are some other you

169
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,478
mentioned it was a generalist what are

170
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,240
some other plants that might be in the

171
00:07:41,478 --> 00:07:48,279
area that would be considerations for

172
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,879
for from a management perspective oh the

173
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:53,918
okay so the question about how far they

174
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:56,158
can travel um and that it depends you

175
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:58,639
know the the perfect pathology answer it

176
00:07:56,158 --> 00:08:01,680
depends depends on how windy it is it

177
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,439
depends on um the directions of the wind

178
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,639
um you can definitely suck it into a

179
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:11,319
greenhouse through a fan um it so it can

180
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,158
definitely blow around on a site um

181
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:18,240
again there are so many spores it's a

182
00:08:13,158 --> 00:08:22,240
numbers game with this pathogen um so um

183
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:24,598
Host range all of your cucurbit crops

184
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,079
cucurbit weeds okay so cucurbits are

185
00:08:24,598 --> 00:08:31,240
your pumpkins cucumbers um watermelons

186
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:33,439
but there are lots of cucurbit weeds um

187
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:37,000
you that you have outside outside of

188
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,360
green houses um we see this pathogen in

189
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,879
lots of just just general weeds outside

190
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,720
a lot of your ornamentals um some of

191
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:48,000
your forest trees so it it it's a it's a

192
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:50,360
pretty wide Host range and

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,839
um you know some of these some of these

194
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
weeds or some of these plant species

195
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,200
you've probably never heard of you know

196
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,600
we don't even have common names for so

197
00:08:56,200 --> 00:09:00,480
very wide so it's there is the point and

198
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,720
yes we try to be clean and yes we try to

199
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,759
be careful like we're not going to go uh

200
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,920
Scout our vegetable garden or play in

201
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:08,240
our landscape and then walk into our our

202
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:11,120
green our clean Greenhouse we're not

203
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,200
going to do that but it will come in and

204
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:19,959
that's what makes it very hard um and um

205
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,800
to add insult to injury um powdery mil

206
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:23,239
especially the GOL of Venom myy so not

207
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:25,159
everyone does this but the GOL of Venom

208
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,399
IES do they will produce at the end of

209
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:29,439
the season when the plant starts um

210
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,078
sessing they will produce an over

211
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:33,720
wintering structure called casm thesia

212
00:09:32,078 --> 00:09:35,239
and these are these are going to be your

213
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,120
overwintering structure they're hard

214
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:38,839
they're melanized I call them like

215
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,799
velcro balls they have appendages and

216
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:44,120
they stick to things and that's going to

217
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:46,039
be your sexual uh spores inside and when

218
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,320
your crop returns or your your

219
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:49,599
conditions or spring returns it they're

220
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,920
going to germinate and they're going to

221
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:55,560
release those sexual spores so the point

222
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:58,838
there once it's in your greenhouse and

223
00:09:55,559 --> 00:10:00,919
once casm thesia develop it's very hard

224
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:03,279
to get rid of them because they they're

225
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,000
lodged in and they're hunkered down for

226
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:08,200
whatever over summering over wintering

227
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,399
and I know in my research greenhous is

228
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,278
here um I think we went phow for like

229
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:16,879
two years and that Dorn powdery mildew

230
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:19,278
was back so those casm thesia I know

231
00:10:16,879 --> 00:10:20,958
we're on plants when we clean that

232
00:10:19,278 --> 00:10:23,159
Greenhouse up now of course I'm a

233
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:26,319
pathologist so I bring disease into my

234
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:29,360
Greenhouse um I do really bad things in

235
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,640
uh from a research perspective but um

236
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,720
once P once the powdery mildew pathogen

237
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:36,759
is there if it has been allowed to um

238
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,079
produce those Chasm thesia it can be

239
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:40,000
there for the Long Haul so we can talk

240
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:42,039
about sanitation

241
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,679
later yeah I want to highlight something

242
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:47,399
you said because like I have a vegetable

243
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:50,599
garden you know just outside here and I

244
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:53,600
grow a variety of squashes and I do have

245
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,200
a couple cannabis plants um I was under

246
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,879
the impression that it was not the same

247
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
species of powdery mildew when in fact

248
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,799
what you're telling me is quite likely

249
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,040
it is and so I need to be

250
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:06,399
much I need to have stronger management

251
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:10,399
practices in place cultural practices

252
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:13,600
than I have in the past it sounds like

253
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,879
um so I think that's really interesting

254
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,639
uh let's let's talk a little bit about

255
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:21,360
what options we have I would assume

256
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:23,519
physical removal of the plant or even

257
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:27,919
those leaves would help reduce Spore

258
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:30,519
pressure potentially um oils seem to be

259
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:34,000
fairly effective but with cannabis we

260
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:36,839
can't use oils after a certain point in

261
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,399
flowering what other what other

262
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:39,680
management practices do we have I know

263
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,320
there's some microbes out there on the

264
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:45,759
market um what are your thoughts okay so

265
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,040
a couple of things is that yeah it

266
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:49,759
probably is the same one and we're

267
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:52,838
learning more and more and um if time

268
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:55,720
and money allowed I would do a a a

269
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,680
survey of us cannabis and I just I have

270
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,519
this plan in my head that I would love

271
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:02,439
to see powdery Milos from across across

272
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,639
the US and and be able to to be able to

273
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:07,399
really say that like I'm absolutely sure

274
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,200
but um so it's probably the same one um

275
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:10,679
so all of my research counterparts in

276
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,440
other states they keep reporting the

277
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:15,879
same golov Venom ises either spacius and

278
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:20,839
brosier chorum so we're we're lumping

279
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:23,320
those all together um so um you know can

280
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,160
you can you relocate your cannabis

281
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,639
plants on maybe the other side of your

282
00:12:25,159 --> 00:12:30,519
house um you know what can you do to

283
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:33,278
physically add space um you will have

284
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:35,198
powdery mildew okay so there is it's

285
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,320
just one of those diseases that

286
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:39,078
unfortunately you will have you will

287
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,839
have it on your squash you will have it

288
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:44,239
on your pumpkins you will have it on

289
00:12:40,839 --> 00:12:46,760
your cannabis sorry for the bad news um

290
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,839
more sun more blistering sun will help

291
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:52,120
your cannabis so you can physically

292
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:53,839
separate them as much as possible um or

293
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,360
give up either the squash or the

294
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,680
Cannabis so think about that um um yeah

295
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:05,879
I I'm making a joke but like it's really

296
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:09,159
true um in terms of um products for

297
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:12,720
management we have found the best

298
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:16,879
results with um and I don't like to use

299
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,440
products but uh a uh millstop plus

300
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:23,720
cease um that combo we have found really

301
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,800
good results um we have found good

302
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:30,639
results with

303
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:33,838
regalia um Trilogy and um whole milk um

304
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,480
but that one has to be um applied very

305
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,120
often um so if we were talking about

306
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,399
conventional which we cannot use

307
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:42,639
conventional products in in cannabis

308
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,078
production we would have systemic

309
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,079
products that would actually enter the

310
00:13:45,078 --> 00:13:50,198
the um the plant and would not wash off

311
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:53,758
but with these Biologicals um they're

312
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:56,039
washing off and so depending on where

313
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,959
you are how much rain you get and so the

314
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:59,679
application the time between

315
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:02,919
applications is

316
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,359
um it is very short so a lot of

317
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:09,000
reapplication so being able to do some

318
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:12,159
pruning being able to space um air

319
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,839
circulation um anything like that um

320
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:16,120
pruning if you start seeing severe

321
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:18,519
powdery mildew to either get the plants

322
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:20,039
out to salvage other plants or to you

323
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:22,639
know clip leaves depending on how many

324
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:24,360
you have right so if you have a 5,000

325
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,159
squ square foot green commercial

326
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,000
Greenhouse you're not going to treat it

327
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:30,159
the same as a homeowner that maybe has

328
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,120
two plants in the backyard so very

329
00:14:30,159 --> 00:14:36,078
different management um

330
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,560
possibilities yeah commercially I'll be

331
00:14:36,078 --> 00:14:42,799
much more active in my spring um because

332
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:46,239
it's you know it's my viable crop um try

333
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:48,559
U try botra stop as well so that's a um

334
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:51,120
it's a competitive UL cladium so try

335
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:53,159
botra stop as well um so there are some

336
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
possibilities out there it's they're not

337
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:56,719
going to work like a conventional

338
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,639
fungicide So for anybody out there

339
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,480
listening who uses conventional

340
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:04,240
fungicide sides for powdery me do in

341
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:06,639
other crops they're the Biologicals are

342
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:09,600
just not going to do the same thing if

343
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,560
you are in a commercial setting sulfur

344
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:14,278
is the best okay sulfur is nasty you're

345
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,479
not going to put sulfur in after

346
00:15:14,278 --> 00:15:21,600
flowering um but sulfur really works

347
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:24,320
well um it's omry um listed but it's not

348
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,159
a biological so um be careful on that

349
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:29,680
one but if you really have a problem in

350
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:32,278
a greenhouse that might be a a solution

351
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:37,000
there's there's been some research using

352
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:39,879
uh silica like w asite dious Earth um

353
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:43,240
egg sill pottassium silicate um to

354
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:45,480
reduce the prevalence of powdered Milo

355
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,799
have you seen any of that research we

356
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:52,039
actually did some research on using

357
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:55,318
silicon um in the greenhouse and um so

358
00:15:52,039 --> 00:15:58,719
we tracked so we we utilized silicon and

359
00:15:55,318 --> 00:16:02,838
we tracked it for six weeks so we got um

360
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,680
we got six week excellent management um

361
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:09,240
using silicon as a um as a root um

362
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,599
Amendment as a soil amendment we did not

363
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:16,360
really get any good results on um liquid

364
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:19,040
feed um fully applied uh silicon

365
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,000
products and I will link I will send you

366
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,519
a link and maybe you could put it in the

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,480
description for sharing but we had

368
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:29,440
excellent results with the Silicon um

369
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,720
there's some details on how we did it um

370
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,440
so we started our plugs and we started

371
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:37,560
it on a um silicon amended media and

372
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:40,279
then when we bumped those plants up it

373
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:43,278
went into another silicon amended medium

374
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:46,159
um how long we could keep that going um

375
00:16:43,278 --> 00:16:48,078
I don't know we didn't go that far but

376
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:51,078
yes we had excellent results and I will

377
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:53,919
share that happy to share that thank you

378
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,439
actually I an apology because I did a

379
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:59,399
podcast with uh Dr Wendy zeldner who's a

380
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:01,160
silicon expert and um

381
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,639
I think I confused I forgot that you had

382
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,519
done you actually did the research the

383
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,838
one with W last tonight that was okay we

384
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:11,838
talked about that in the podcast so yeah

385
00:17:08,838 --> 00:17:13,438
no that's wonderful um okay well I know

386
00:17:11,838 --> 00:17:15,279
we talked about powder midle before I

387
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:18,199
just think it's such an interesting one

388
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:20,240
um you had shared a couple other key

389
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,759
takeaways that I I found really

390
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,078
interesting in the last podcast um I

391
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:27,078
don't know if you could touch on those

392
00:17:24,078 --> 00:17:30,839
again uh one of which was regarding uh

393
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:30,839
photos of plant

394
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:35,319
diseases okay you want to elaborate on

395
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,960
that I you know I don't want to give

396
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:40,159
away I mean it was your information so I

397
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:43,558
don't want to but yeah this is my Soap

398
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:47,519
Box a lot of times um so plant diseases

399
00:17:43,558 --> 00:17:49,240
are the plants reaction to an infection

400
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:51,480
okay so there's infection and there are

401
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,839
symptoms so infection is when the

402
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:56,960
pathogen that's the fungus or bacterium

403
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:59,399
or virus when it infects the plant so it

404
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,480
can be days weeks months depending on

405
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,360
the system before you actually see

406
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:07,960
symptoms and it's those symptoms that we

407
00:18:03,359 --> 00:18:11,558
call disease so our symptoms can be Wilt

408
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:14,919
or Leaf curl or marginal Leaf Scorch or

409
00:18:11,558 --> 00:18:19,480
bliding um so the symptom is usually how

410
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:22,080
we name a plant disease right um so if

411
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,720
you have a Wilt for example I don't know

412
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,158
what that infection is I need a

413
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,038
microscope or I need other molecular

414
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,679
tools or I need to you know something

415
00:18:28,038 --> 00:18:32,279
else to be able diagnose that so

416
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,440
unfortunately and this is where my

417
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,798
soapbox kicks in is that we have a lot

418
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,720
of people sharing online and the

419
00:18:36,798 --> 00:18:41,319
Cannabis industry has been so closed off

420
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,519
for so long that Growers had to find a

421
00:18:41,319 --> 00:18:45,119
way to communicate and unfortunately

422
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,519
there's a lot of misinformation out

423
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:50,079
there so just looking at a picture and

424
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,879
this is what I do all day and I cannot

425
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,399
look at a picture and make a diagnosis I

426
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,760
can point you in a direction I can make

427
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:58,798
some guesses but um there's a lot more

428
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,319
to it than that and when we start

429
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:03,200
managing and we start trying to

430
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:06,240
understand is this a Seaborn pathogen or

431
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,038
is this a pathogen that can maybe um

432
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,279
over winter or over summer in a

433
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:12,919
greenhouse or what does it take to

434
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:15,359
manage it well we have to know exactly

435
00:19:12,919 --> 00:19:19,520
what it is and you have to utilize a

436
00:19:15,359 --> 00:19:22,879
Diagnostic lab um now dealing with high

437
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:25,359
THC cannabis versus low THC like hemp

438
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,120
those are you know we get into the weeds

439
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,798
there but we can't diagnose by symptoms

440
00:19:28,119 --> 00:19:33,798
and symptoms or disease and we we just

441
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:37,119
can't do that we can guess we can get a

442
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:39,400
you know have a head start like um

443
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:41,279
people listening before uh we started

444
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,840
recording Chad and I were talking about

445
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,200
a leaf that had some Galls on it and

446
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,959
we're just kind of bantering back and

447
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,679
forth making some guesses and

448
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,159
eliminating some obvious but you know

449
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,240
that in the end we don't know and that's

450
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:56,200
the same situation for anyone who sends

451
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,839
me a picture or even sends their

452
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:00,840
Diagnostic lab a picture we uh we don't

453
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,879
know but really be careful of armchair

454
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:06,199
diagnosticians out there because there's

455
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,559
a lot of them and even some real experts

456
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,880
um that I follow online have

457
00:20:08,558 --> 00:20:14,279
misdiagnosed things that I can look at

458
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:17,880
and say oh no um so really rely on a

459
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,599
pathologist please and um your crop will

460
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,559
your crop will be much better for

461
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:24,678
it okay I'm done with my soapbox Tad

462
00:20:23,558 --> 00:20:27,798
yeah commercially I think that's

463
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:30,280
essential um because you talked about

464
00:20:27,798 --> 00:20:32,720
the the life cycle of these these

465
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:35,000
pathogens can vary dramatically and if

466
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,319
we want to really manage it properly we

467
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,200
need to know what it is um interestingly

468
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:42,079
enough I was on social media yesterday

469
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:44,679
and saw a photo someone had posted on

470
00:20:42,079 --> 00:20:46,599
Reddit of a plant and he said you know

471
00:20:44,679 --> 00:20:50,240
in 24 hours the plant crashed you know

472
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:52,439
you see this severe wilting and a lot of

473
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,558
people were saying it was watering or

474
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,880
something but I'm like this has to be a

475
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:58,158
pathogen if it happens that if we see

476
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,799
that level of Wilt it has to be

477
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,360
something happening within the vascular

478
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:05,918
system of the plant um what what does

479
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,839
that narrow it down to for us and then

480
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,400
are there any treatment options when we

481
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:11,879
have vascular disease because sometimes

482
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:14,440
you'll see just one branch for example

483
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
just crash on a plant can you touch on

484
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,320
that really

485
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:24,158
quickly oh quickly no

486
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:26,200
um so um we talk a lot about patterns um

487
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,720
with with diseases if it is a plant

488
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,798
pathogen if it's caused by a pathogen

489
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,000
not a biotic like environmental or um

490
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:35,359
there usually won't be a pattern um it's

491
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,159
rare that those are pattern so usually

492
00:21:35,359 --> 00:21:38,839
if it's a disease it's scattered so what

493
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:40,840
did those other plants look like was it

494
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,798
just this one plant did this person have

495
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:47,119
more than one plant right to even make a

496
00:21:42,798 --> 00:21:50,200
comparison um so usually if there is a

497
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:55,158
pathogen we see some type of symptom

498
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,278
coming in now um a homeg grower or a a

499
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,120
like a non- pathologist might not notice

500
00:21:57,278 --> 00:22:01,798
it as much um

501
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,319
but if it it is a quick death indeed two

502
00:22:01,798 --> 00:22:06,679
things can be happening it could

503
00:22:03,319 --> 00:22:09,038
definitely be a vascular problem but any

504
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:10,919
problem so think about it this way if a

505
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:12,278
plant has a really good root system or

506
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:14,120
like it's raining outside my window

507
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:16,400
right now if it's raining and we have

508
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:17,599
root loss or any kind of uptake issue

509
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,240
right we can have a crown Rod but

510
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,558
there's still a little bit of vascular

511
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,960
tissue functioning right that flum is

512
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:25,759
functioning enough then it kind of

513
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:27,759
you'll get that balance and then you

514
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:30,440
might get a hot sunny day you might

515
00:22:27,759 --> 00:22:33,599
suddenly right go from this raining to

516
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:37,400
885 degrees and suddenly that plant's

517
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:40,240
needs are not being met right because of

518
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:43,480
because of that heat and and and sun and

519
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:45,558
transpiration has has taken a um you

520
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,720
know an increase then that plant can

521
00:22:45,558 --> 00:22:49,200
suddenly collapse so when we talk about

522
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,319
sudden collapse there's a lot of

523
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,440
questions that go with that um have you

524
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:56,798
really watched or there any patterns or

525
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,159
there other plants um I give more

526
00:22:56,798 --> 00:23:01,519
information that I didn't even

527
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,720
about when I was looking at the photo so

528
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:05,278
they had three other plants in the room

529
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:07,159
all those plants looked fine they were

530
00:23:05,278 --> 00:23:09,720
all receiving the exact same amount of

531
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,120
water because he was bottom watering two

532
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,159
gallons of water per plant and these

533
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:16,319
were fully established plants uh almost

534
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:18,600
finished in flour so they were at least

535
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:21,519
okay 40 days into flow so they're pretty

536
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:23,558
big plants and then he showed a 24-hour

537
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:27,000
change where the plant just

538
00:23:23,558 --> 00:23:29,359
completely wilted so my question would

539
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
have been what about 40 hours 48 hours

540
00:23:29,359 --> 00:23:33,959
before what did that look like was there

541
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,278
some sign or some some symptom that you

542
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:39,079
know again most people don't and and if

543
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:41,720
was this in a tent it was an indoor

544
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:43,759
environment okay so usually the lighting

545
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,720
is really hard to see it's not like

546
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,240
being outside with a with a brighter

547
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:52,159
light so it is harder to see there's

548
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:55,120
Shadows Etc but um and I look for any

549
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,440
kind of wound or damage or physical

550
00:23:55,119 --> 00:24:00,759
damage like a canker at that

551
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,519
crown so um I I always tell my outdoor

552
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:04,720
Growers if your knees aren't dirty you

553
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:07,038
haven't looked hard enough and to really

554
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,600
look look there and see what else could

555
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:12,599
it be I mean could um it be any kind of

556
00:24:10,599 --> 00:24:16,199
you know just insect even things like

557
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:18,918
pill bugs or um are the worst they just

558
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:22,400
chew things um my colleagues in the

559
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,960
Southeast are having fire ants eat the

560
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,440
crowns of plants so there are a million

561
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,240
possibilities it might be something

562
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,600
super quirky but it might truly be

563
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:33,159
something vascular as well and if it is

564
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:36,439
if it's an indoor

565
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:38,278
environment then how would a pathogen

566
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,120
have gotten in you're using soilless

567
00:24:38,278 --> 00:24:44,720
media that should be clean free of any

568
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:48,079
kind of pathogen so how are you how

569
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:50,120
would you have brought in a fusarium uh

570
00:24:48,079 --> 00:24:51,759
oxypro how would you have brought that

571
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:54,719
in and you have to start asking yourself

572
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:59,000
all of these questions so the likelihood

573
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:02,319
of a new grow indoors in a clean envir

574
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:05,640
having a a um vascular pathogen or a

575
00:25:02,319 --> 00:25:09,079
rootborn pathogen are unlikely unless

576
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:12,960
there's an unsanitary situation um going

577
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:15,918
on so I'm not answering your question

578
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:17,440
right this is this is perfect because I

579
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:18,799
think it it wasn't so much getting an

580
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,080
answer it was hearing your thought

581
00:25:18,798 --> 00:25:22,679
process yeah as you and that that's what

582
00:25:21,079 --> 00:25:26,079
I think is really fascinating about it

583
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,320
but um with the use of

584
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,519
compost that may have not been fully

585
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:33,038
treated that would be one source where

586
00:25:30,519 --> 00:25:36,558
Fus serum correct

587
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:38,558
absolutely the use of other cover crops

588
00:25:36,558 --> 00:25:41,158
I think potentially if transplanted

589
00:25:38,558 --> 00:25:44,200
could have brought in fusarium um if

590
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,799
people are using cover crops or mulches

591
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,480
um yeah any kind of

592
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:54,079
soil okay any kind of soil and and

593
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:57,798
compost rarely does our compost get hot

594
00:25:54,079 --> 00:26:01,119
enough um rarely does it get hot enough

595
00:25:57,798 --> 00:26:04,879
especially with fusarium Oxys

596
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:07,839
um so yeah you're saying thermally it's

597
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:12,720
not treated hot enough to actually kill

598
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:14,918
it right to kill um so we're doing we're

599
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,079
working on a solarization project right

600
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:20,080
now um which is a whole another

601
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:21,918
fascinating thing but fusarium oxysporum

602
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:23,720
that's the fusarium that causes fusarium

603
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,799
wil there are lots of fusarium by the

604
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:29,319
way that can cause disease um it is so

605
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:31,278
stinking resilient I I mean we just

606
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,558
we're doing these oven studies as a side

607
00:26:31,278 --> 00:26:35,278
project and we can't kill it like it

608
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,398
just we think it's dead and we leave

609
00:26:35,278 --> 00:26:41,398
Petra dishes out and it just comes back

610
00:26:37,398 --> 00:26:43,879
after 21 days so um so compost is a

611
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:46,158
tricky one don't home compost make sure

612
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:49,159
you're using a hot compost from a

613
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,919
commercial facility um if you are indeed

614
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,080
going to use compost or you can just

615
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,200
take the risk um depends if you're a

616
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:57,439
home grower you're a hobby grower fine I

617
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,038
take those risks all the time um

618
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,120
commercial Growers should never ever

619
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:02,599
take those

620
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:04,798
risks what about in worm castings how

621
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:06,759
often do you see it in because those

622
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:09,440
usually aren't thermally

623
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:11,558
composted worm casting should not no

624
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,480
they wouldn't be thermally composted but

625
00:27:11,558 --> 00:27:18,440
they should not include they should be

626
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:20,360
fully um it it should be okay you know

627
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,960
again what is the starting material what

628
00:27:20,359 --> 00:27:23,759
are they feeding those worms it's a

629
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,319
starting material usually not plant

630
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:28,798
material in most cases yeah that I can

631
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:32,000
think commercially at least should be

632
00:27:28,798 --> 00:27:33,720
okay um okay I not you know when when

633
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,519
when we can't figure it out out an

634
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,880
answer sometimes we start going down

635
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,558
rabbit holes and trying to figure out

636
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,480
what if what if but you know think think

637
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:43,879
of the big common ways that it could

638
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:45,360
have gotten in what you know was your

639
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,880
did you buy commercial potting soil it

640
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:48,558
was it sitting on the ground outside

641
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,440
next to your vegetable garden before you

642
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:53,398
finally brought it in so think of the

643
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:56,320
big ways um eliminate all of the obvious

644
00:27:53,398 --> 00:27:59,479
eliminate um things you can see like

645
00:27:56,319 --> 00:28:02,519
insects uh or orthopod then eliminate

646
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,798
big things like abiotic physical damage

647
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:07,759
um you know I've seen I've seen people

648
00:28:04,798 --> 00:28:09,879
like planting um on plastic like plastic

649
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:12,398
culture system and just the plastic

650
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,840
rubbing against a very tender stem so

651
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:17,319
look for physical damage and then if it

652
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,558
you know so start with really big start

653
00:28:17,319 --> 00:28:21,599
with a really obvious if it's something

654
00:28:19,558 --> 00:28:24,558
that's such a caveat that we can't

655
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:27,319
really identify it easily it's probably

656
00:28:24,558 --> 00:28:28,678
never going to happen again um but if

657
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:31,558
you do suspect

658
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:33,880
um disease if you do suspect a vascular

659
00:28:31,558 --> 00:28:36,240
uh problem you could definitely start

660
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:39,278
doing some cutting and looking at that

661
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,960
vascular tissue um trying to see if that

662
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:43,240
really could be

663
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,960
it you know interestingly enough one of

664
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:49,679
the biggest suppliers of organic soils

665
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:52,960
in my industry um for what living soil

666
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:54,919
is actually is growing cannabis and uh

667
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,480
other vegetables on site where they're

668
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:02,278
mixing soils which to me seems like a

669
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:04,640
fairly large L risk um in Vector but um

670
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:06,200
yeah I I don't know if if it if it's

671
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:08,038
causing a problem or not but I I am

672
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:11,278
seeing that

673
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:13,240
so something something interesting um

674
00:29:11,278 --> 00:29:15,000
one one other thing I was curious about

675
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,720
when you're talking about stems though

676
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,038
getting back to that idea um we I do

677
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,440
sometimes see like a fuzzy mold growth

678
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:28,398
on a stem or people do um what is that

679
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,480
typically and how do we how do we deal

680
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:33,839
with that if we wanted to save our

681
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,480
plant okay fuzzy stem grow so okay let's

682
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:40,158
go let's go to definitions here um and I

683
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:44,360
I see this a lot online um so

684
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,519
fungi um it's a whole you know broad

685
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:50,240
spectrum but fungi the body of a fungus

686
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,839
is string like

687
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:58,319
um um hyy we call those Melia or melum

688
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:59,798
melium is singular Melia is plural as so

689
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:03,079
there's always a lot so we always say

690
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:05,359
Melia and any fungus in the body of any

691
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:09,119
fungus is called Mycelia all right so if

692
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:12,678
you see Melia there is no way that you

693
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:15,558
know what that is okay hands hands down

694
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:19,080
um so just because there's Mycelia

695
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:20,558
present you have no clue it could be um

696
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:22,558
it could be a decomposer right it could

697
00:30:20,558 --> 00:30:24,960
be a sapry just decomposing things

698
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:27,558
that's usually what we have um it could

699
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,278
be pathogenic or it could be something

700
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:34,038
like and rarely do we see um micro risal

701
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:36,640
U Mycelia um they're they're really thin

702
00:30:34,038 --> 00:30:38,440
and spindly and they're not that big

703
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,399
fluffy white Mycelia so they're

704
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:44,519
different kinds of U growth patterns of

705
00:30:41,398 --> 00:30:48,359
a lot of these Mycelia so if you have

706
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:52,000
Melia growing on a stem on a an

707
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:53,798
unhealthy plant and not indoors um it

708
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,440
could very well be a pathogen right so

709
00:30:53,798 --> 00:30:59,720
sclerotinia or um a white rot or um

710
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:02,159
there a lot of there a lot of sorry

711
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,839
there are a lot of common names um white

712
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,480
rot or Timber rot um white mold so

713
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:11,759
that's a sclerotinia sclerosi Orum so

714
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,000
that's a cool season um disease and here

715
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,398
in the south-southeast we have Southern

716
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,919
blight that's later in the season and

717
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:21,959
that is Agro

718
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:23,038
aelia or rcii and that will make a um

719
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,960
that will make a

720
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:29,398
Melia melal mat on the base of a stem it

721
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,639
quickly caners and that plant will die

722
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:35,038
so there's a correlation between when

723
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:37,759
you see that and the plant dying um most

724
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:41,679
of the time when we see Mycelia that are

725
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:44,759
not affiliated with a um Crown rot or

726
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:48,240
stem rot pathogen it's usually something

727
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:50,119
some decomposer some sapry um something

728
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,919
people feed a lot of things they feed

729
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:54,959
compost and compost tea they feed

730
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:59,880
molasses they feed all of these things

731
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:03,480
that are simply um contributing to the

732
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:05,639
population of these sap sapres and um so

733
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,679
those Mycelia the Mycelia you see can be

734
00:32:05,638 --> 00:32:10,398
anything and that doesn't mean your soil

735
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:12,159
is healthy um if you're feeding it it

736
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,278
doesn't mean it's healthy so it's an

737
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:18,080
indication of really nothing um except

738
00:32:15,278 --> 00:32:19,960
that maybe you've put basses in your in

739
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,278
your soilless media you should not have

740
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,798
anything growing in a soilless medium

741
00:32:22,278 --> 00:32:24,839
okay so potting soil you shouldn't have

742
00:32:23,798 --> 00:32:28,398
anything growing in there because

743
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:31,398
there's you know it's it comes in like

744
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:32,918
uh not sterile but um you know it

745
00:32:31,398 --> 00:32:35,959
doesn't have compost in it so it's

746
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:39,000
usually just a spag other things right

747
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,079
um but if you're growing go ahead sorry

748
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,480
oh no I just wanted to highlight a

749
00:32:40,079 --> 00:32:42,720
difference so a lot of the people that

750
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,200
listen to the podcast and a lot of

751
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,038
Growers nowadays are doing what people

752
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,840
call living soils where they had a

753
00:32:46,038 --> 00:32:51,519
compost fraction so in those cases when

754
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:55,038
we add a food source alpha alpha meal

755
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:58,200
oat flow any any fertilizer really plant

756
00:32:55,038 --> 00:33:00,679
fertilizer we're feeding fungi so if we

757
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:03,759
see the sapric fungi what you're saying

758
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:05,880
is it it's not a good indicator of of

759
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:07,679
anything really it's probably just some

760
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,799
Airborne fungi or something that was in

761
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:12,038
that compost we don't know if it's good

762
00:33:09,798 --> 00:33:15,278
bad most likely innocuous but we don't

763
00:33:12,038 --> 00:33:17,240
know right most likely and and the more

764
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,880
you feed it the more it'll grow but it's

765
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,960
not doing anything for your

766
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,639
plant um so a lot of these a lot of

767
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:26,600
these um

768
00:33:23,638 --> 00:33:30,519
sapres um you know they're producing U

769
00:33:26,599 --> 00:33:35,079
humic acids um they can do things like

770
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:37,638
um compete in the soil with bad things

771
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:38,439
right with pathogens uh sometimes they

772
00:33:37,638 --> 00:33:42,038
can

773
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:44,120
parasitize some things like um so I'm

774
00:33:42,038 --> 00:33:47,240
not going to name any but uh sometimes

775
00:33:44,119 --> 00:33:50,359
they'll be uh s you know kind of induce

776
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:52,798
systemic required resistance um they

777
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,240
might produce antimicrobial compounds

778
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:57,798
and we see that a lot you know a lot of

779
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:00,839
these products have been um um made in

780
00:33:57,798 --> 00:34:05,759
to Biologicals that we buy as as

781
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:07,720
fungicides um but really we're not they

782
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:10,039
they're not feeding them is not going to

783
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,440
benefit anything right let nature take

784
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:15,320
its course if you are buying living soil

785
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:18,480
and Mother Nature has balanced that

786
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:20,800
living soil let it do its thing don't

787
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,358
shift a population to something that

788
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,639
might not be as beneficial let it be

789
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:28,199
that's why you're buying a living soil

790
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:30,399
um I would not put living soil in a

791
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:31,719
container I like it more outside but

792
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,759
that's my opinion and we don't have to

793
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:36,319
go down that road um but if you are

794
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,079
going to buy living soil please let it

795
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,480
do its thing don't feed it anything um

796
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:44,039
there's no need to um kind of like your

797
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,800
gut microbiome right don't don't shift

798
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:47,119
it to something that's not natural let

799
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:49,519
it do its

800
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,280
thing so just to be clear when we say

801
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,918
living slow what we're describing is

802
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,880
typically a peep based media with a

803
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:02,039
compost fraction and a lot more f izer

804
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,960
in the mix hopefully balanced um by the

805
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:07,719
company MH um or people are making their

806
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,639
own you know sort of a third compost

807
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:12,439
third p a third pmus or perite and then

808
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,440
they're adding a bunch of nutrients so

809
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,079
that's just like so we're clear on the

810
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,838
definition there yeah it's still

811
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,280
technically soiless because it doesn't

812
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:22,960
actually contain soil but um does

813
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:25,839
contain a typically more organic matter

814
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:29,480
more biology

815
00:35:25,838 --> 00:35:30,920
um so I I think the now one thing I'm

816
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,519
curious about is because people will

817
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,240
with what you just said people will say

818
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:37,480
okay well you just you just shared that

819
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,838
these These funi are typically innocuous

820
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:42,880
they can produce humic acid which is

821
00:35:39,838 --> 00:35:46,279
good they can maybe trigger SAR which is

822
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,160
good they they may be decomposers with a

823
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,680
high organic matter soil that which is

824
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:53,440
good um what are the chances these

825
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:54,559
things are are probably beneficial then

826
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,039
can we because you're saying we

827
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:59,199
shouldn't look at them as indicators of

828
00:35:57,039 --> 00:36:01,920
anything really in terms ofil Health but

829
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:04,559
a lot of these things can be beneficial

830
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,720
so if you could just kind of okay touch

831
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:10,078
on L more I appreciate it okay so if

832
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,199
you're if you've got a we'll call it

833
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:15,200
soil okay living soil it's a um kind of

834
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,919
a soil is medium with compost in it

835
00:36:15,199 --> 00:36:19,118
let's just leave let's let's generalize

836
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,200
there so

837
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,119
um they so there there's a x number of

838
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:27,078
different uh microbes that kind of go

839
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,680
into the mix from the very start there's

840
00:36:27,079 --> 00:36:32,200
also organic matter so those populations

841
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:36,318
are going to shift based on what's there

842
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:40,639
okay so um if there's a good food source

843
00:36:36,318 --> 00:36:42,519
for uh let's say um an antagonistic one

844
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:44,960
let's say it has a food source its

845
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:46,719
numbers are going to ramp up right you

846
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,720
don't want it competing with something

847
00:36:46,719 --> 00:36:50,959
that's not going to be

848
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:52,358
beneficial so they're gonna they're

849
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:53,720
going to fill their own needs and if

850
00:36:52,358 --> 00:36:55,199
there's not a food source for them

851
00:36:53,719 --> 00:36:56,719
they're going to go away because

852
00:36:55,199 --> 00:36:58,759
something else is going to take its

853
00:36:56,719 --> 00:37:02,318
place so so that's going to be based on

854
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:05,160
what's there um let's see another way to

855
00:37:02,318 --> 00:37:08,400
put that is that

856
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:10,039
um the ones that so the ones that so

857
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,920
once you put a root system in there

858
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:14,159
right once you got that risos spere

859
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:17,519
there you want that population to be

860
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:19,799
able to shift to benefit that risone you

861
00:37:17,519 --> 00:37:21,960
want that population to be able to shift

862
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,640
like any that are micro risal like you

863
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,679
don't want to out compete your micro

864
00:37:23,639 --> 00:37:27,719
rise you know if you've got a root there

865
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:29,559
you and you have Micro rise there you

866
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,318
want them to be able to do their thing

867
00:37:29,559 --> 00:37:35,000
and not be out competing by something

868
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:37,759
that's just really breaking down a

869
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:40,838
little bit of um a little bit of organic

870
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,079
matter um

871
00:37:40,838 --> 00:37:48,000
so more microbes are not necessarily

872
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,160
good more isn't always better um so I

873
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,519
would rather see that let it balance on

874
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:55,598
its own um because what's there is

875
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,119
what's going to shift so that population

876
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,920
is going to shift based on what in that

877
00:37:58,119 --> 00:38:03,559
root zone or what's in that pot um does

878
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,599
that make

879
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:08,400
sense I think so you're say what you're

880
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:11,160
saying is that these that this soil is

881
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,358
alive it's essentially an ecosystem yes

882
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:16,480
there's all these like functional niches

883
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:17,679
that already exist in that ecosystem we

884
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,159
don't want

885
00:38:17,679 --> 00:38:21,838
to uh we don't want to sway It One

886
00:38:20,159 --> 00:38:23,960
Direction or another too far we just

887
00:38:21,838 --> 00:38:26,599
want to let essentially let nature take

888
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,240
its course and those microbes are highly

889
00:38:26,599 --> 00:38:30,680
diverse they to manage that themselves

890
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,719
and the plant can really control a lot

891
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,799
of that through the rizosphere

892
00:38:31,719 --> 00:38:37,559
interactions yeah yeah well said much

893
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,880
better than I did so one thing that I

894
00:38:37,559 --> 00:38:43,199
see a lot is when I add so well let's

895
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:45,519
say at the end of a cycle we have a bed

896
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:49,919
and this is indoor or outdoor um we've

897
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:52,079
done a soil test we add our uh nutrients

898
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:57,838
back in and this may be a combination of

899
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:59,160
fish meal lime gypsum uh whatever soft

900
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:01,838
rock phosphate whatever these

901
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:04,639
fertilizers are to to read the fertility

902
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:06,440
that was removed during that crop cycle

903
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,239
when we do that we we will Tull that

904
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:11,838
into the first six to eight inches of

905
00:39:08,239 --> 00:39:13,759
this of the soil profile and then um

906
00:39:11,838 --> 00:39:17,119
what I typically see over the next few

907
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:21,119
days is I will see some my mycelial

908
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:23,400
growth on the surface of the soil I will

909
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,960
typically just turn that back into the

910
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,519
soil so it doesn't really take off um

911
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,000
but what what are your thoughts when you

912
00:39:28,519 --> 00:39:33,838
see that and what sort of management

913
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:35,400
practices if any would you incorporate I

914
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:37,480
wouldn't manage it at all if you've

915
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:38,960
added in more organic matter more

916
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:41,559
compost whatever you're doing to put

917
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,800
that nitrogen back um usually some kind

918
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:45,559
of um carbon Source then you got the

919
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:47,720
decomposers that are there and they're

920
00:39:45,559 --> 00:39:49,318
just decomposing they do what they do

921
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,679
and if they're on the surface it's not

922
00:39:49,318 --> 00:39:52,719
even the same ones that would be

923
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:56,440
functioning at the root system right

924
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:58,598
deeper down just let it do its thing um

925
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:00,400
speaking of all of that I am a big

926
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:01,880
proponent of mulch if you're an outdoor

927
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,160
grower you should be mulching just like

928
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,000
you you mulch your flower beds you

929
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:07,879
should mul mulch your vegetable garden

930
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,920
and you should mulch your cannabis I am

931
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,160
a big mulch person um so again you're

932
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,400
feeding organic matter and then nature

933
00:40:13,159 --> 00:40:17,199
does what it needs to do but um you're G

934
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,318
to have different profiles at different

935
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:20,639
depths and every time every inch you go

936
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:23,639
down you're going to see different types

937
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:25,318
of microbes so the ones on the surface

938
00:40:23,639 --> 00:40:28,960
are generally not going to be the same

939
00:40:25,318 --> 00:40:30,838
ones that are at that root Zone hm so

940
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,000
what's from a pathologist perspective

941
00:40:30,838 --> 00:40:36,279
what are your favorite mulch

942
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:39,440
options anything is better than nothing

943
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,000
so um any any and so organic that's

944
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,159
lowercase o any natural mulch whether

945
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,400
it's wood mulch pine straw I'm

946
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:48,759
originally from Louisiana so Bas which

947
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:51,559
is the fiber from sugar cane I've used

948
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:54,040
that um I use leaves at my house now

949
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:55,559
because my neighbors rake and so I just

950
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:57,719
pick up the bad leaves on the side of

951
00:40:55,559 --> 00:41:01,679
the road in the fall and I'm mulch I

952
00:40:57,719 --> 00:41:04,480
mulch with anything um and so any way to

953
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:06,519
cover that soil to keep from losing the

954
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,639
Integrity of degrading the Integrity of

955
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:11,639
your soil so you're protecting the soil

956
00:41:08,639 --> 00:41:14,279
and it's organic matter um and I don't

957
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:15,838
till it in I just layer it I just layer

958
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,599
layer every year and that's what Mother

959
00:41:15,838 --> 00:41:19,920
Nature does right walk into an Old

960
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,920
Forest Mother Nature has done the very

961
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,318
same thing it balances

962
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:28,400
out now with Mother Nature though Mother

963
00:41:26,318 --> 00:41:31,559
Nature doesn't really believe in

964
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:33,160
diseases or pests right these are just

965
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:36,400
organisms trying to complete a life

966
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:39,118
cycle right so we may see those occur in

967
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,880
our in our Gardens right if we're if

968
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,680
we're managing them from a natural

969
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,000
perspective uh I mean what are your

970
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:48,000
thoughts on

971
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,000
that um so we know that monoculture okay

972
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,318
let's talk about monocultured egg right

973
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,760
we know that when we put lots of the

974
00:41:51,318 --> 00:41:57,318
same plant together and any pathogen um

975
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,760
finds a niche it just goes right because

976
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:01,000
there's nothing there there's nothing to

977
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:04,839
balance it when we start talking about

978
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:08,000
living soil or you know using whatever

979
00:42:04,838 --> 00:42:11,239
for mulch um so kind of an organic mulch

980
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,800
or we um do a lot of intercropping or

981
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:16,598
intra cropping um we're we're

982
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,400
introducing a lot of different microbes

983
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:20,640
right so then again that's where Mother

984
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,079
Nature starts balancing but you can very

985
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:25,759
well I mean look what we're doing we're

986
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,640
putting in a plant that we have bred for

987
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,440
Bud size for high

988
00:42:27,639 --> 00:42:33,838
for whatever it is we want we're as we

989
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:36,079
breed we can lose traits resiliency

990
00:42:33,838 --> 00:42:38,599
right we can um accidentally breed in

991
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:41,599
more susceptibility to a pathogen and

992
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:44,800
that's what keeps me in business right

993
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:48,760
but the more diversity we have in our in

994
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,720
our micro microbiome the the more chance

995
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:52,559
we have of that balance but you will

996
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:55,959
again back to our powdery milw powdery

997
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:59,000
mildew will come in um you know in

998
00:42:55,960 --> 00:43:01,358
nature it doesn't really matter but what

999
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,358
we have now we have these these plants

1000
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:07,279
these cultivars we've cultivated these

1001
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:09,838
varieties um exactly

1002
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:14,200
for size

1003
00:43:09,838 --> 00:43:16,000
flavor um Tarpin height and we've lost

1004
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:17,759
some resiliency so we're not going to

1005
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,199
get the magic

1006
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,720
of um what Mother Nature provides not

1007
00:43:21,199 --> 00:43:25,919
100% so we do have to realize that

1008
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:29,279
diseases will come in but the more

1009
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:33,200
diversity we have have the better chance

1010
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,640
we have of having that um um natural

1011
00:43:33,199 --> 00:43:38,118
kind of Pest Management or to be able to

1012
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:41,078
say that's not enough powdery mil do to

1013
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,318
to be worth it for me um powdery mil do

1014
00:43:41,079 --> 00:43:45,440
we usually do manage powdery mildew but

1015
00:43:43,318 --> 00:43:47,800
other things like uh C cosper leaf spot

1016
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:49,599
or septor Leaf spot's a really big one

1017
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,200
um it doesn't matter we've we've

1018
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,318
realized that right we've done enough

1019
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:54,358
research it doesn't matter we can leave

1020
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:57,759
it

1021
00:43:54,358 --> 00:44:00,159
alone it doesn't have an A economic

1022
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,000
impact cor the crop itself correct or

1023
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:04,879
not really even a plant health impact

1024
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,440
like it might look really bad and

1025
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:09,079
septoria is a really good example

1026
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:12,760
septoria leaf spot is for a pathologist

1027
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:14,800
a beautiful disease for a grower it it's

1028
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:18,720
horrible right it starts as a small spot

1029
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,280
there's a really broad um yellow Halo

1030
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:24,519
and very quickly leaves turn yellow and

1031
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:26,680
leaves drop and we've seen 90% Leaf loss

1032
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:29,519
and then the plant produces more leaves

1033
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:32,679
and we have a completely normal Harvest

1034
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:36,559
um with no yield loss

1035
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:38,960
so it can be really deceiving and

1036
00:44:36,559 --> 00:44:41,319
Growers tend to not believe me because

1037
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,440
they say all my leaves are on the ground

1038
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:45,000
um so those are the kinds of things that

1039
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:47,960
we have to balance and that's why we

1040
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,920
keep doing research and trying to to

1041
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,679
understand what matters and what doesn't

1042
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,760
and when is a um um a more natural um

1043
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:59,039
scenario with just a few plants like you

1044
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,160
you've got a couple of plants in a

1045
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:03,239
vegetable garden you probably have a lot

1046
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:05,558
less disease than maybe someone with a

1047
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:09,358
lot of plants and nothing else because

1048
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:11,680
of that diversity and um you know if you

1049
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:14,558
have an epidemic it's going to be much

1050
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:16,919
more severe in a monocultured scenario

1051
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:18,839
but sure sure um we always trying to put

1052
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:21,079
a square peg in a round hole and that's

1053
00:45:18,838 --> 00:45:22,400
what we do as humans so uh we're always

1054
00:45:21,079 --> 00:45:25,480
trying to balance

1055
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:27,480
that are you risking any Disease by

1056
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:30,559
bringing in like in this case you you

1057
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:33,440
mentioned fallen leaves I I would think

1058
00:45:30,559 --> 00:45:37,760
that would be a vector for potentially

1059
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:40,960
other pathogens as well as uh whatever

1060
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,760
that homeowner might have sprayed

1061
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,039
um I I don't know what your thoughts on

1062
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:48,599
that yeah same thing with compost right

1063
00:45:46,039 --> 00:45:51,639
so anything we bring in we can risk

1064
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:53,519
introducing um people who get wood chips

1065
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:54,960
from the city you know that that

1066
00:45:53,519 --> 00:45:57,800
composting the wood chips you know they

1067
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,599
often bring in pois and Ivy um so yeah

1068
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:02,599
yeah you can you can risk bringing a lot

1069
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,760
of things in um and you have to decide

1070
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:08,359
what that risk is for you I can also be

1071
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:10,640
bringing in diversity um I have balanced

1072
00:46:08,358 --> 00:46:12,679
my Risk by saying I've got these leaves

1073
00:46:10,639 --> 00:46:16,239
I've got this organic matter and by

1074
00:46:12,679 --> 00:46:18,399
improving my soil um you know the the

1075
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:20,358
risks do not outweigh the rewards and

1076
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,119
that's what I do again I'm not making a

1077
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:26,358
living on it right it doesn't pay my

1078
00:46:22,119 --> 00:46:28,920
bills um so so I'm taking that risk it's

1079
00:46:26,358 --> 00:46:30,920
a balance and you can very you know

1080
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:33,880
let's say let's say some of these leaves

1081
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:36,400
so okay

1082
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:40,039
rephrase what are you risking bringing

1083
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:42,318
in that can equally infect your cannabis

1084
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:45,400
or your tomato plants in your garden or

1085
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:48,199
your squashes right so which one what

1086
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:51,720
what are you risking bringing in and

1087
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,480
leaves of an oak uh from my neighbor's

1088
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:57,199
yard it's highly unlikely that I'm

1089
00:46:53,480 --> 00:47:00,559
bringing anything in that's detrimental

1090
00:46:57,199 --> 00:47:02,399
right especially if it's local but if um

1091
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,599
if it comes from you not know where

1092
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,280
what's in there yeah yeah there is a

1093
00:47:04,599 --> 00:47:08,960
risk that's exactly

1094
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:12,240
right I I have yet to find the perfect

1095
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:15,039
mulch I feel like um and that's just

1096
00:47:12,239 --> 00:47:17,519
it's like straw I find I end up with a

1097
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:19,519
bunch of grass seeds there's always and

1098
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:23,000
and then that becomes a pain to deal

1099
00:47:19,519 --> 00:47:26,519
with um plus most straws sprayed in that

1100
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:29,199
I can find locally anyway um leaves I

1101
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:32,000
like to bag leaves in the fall and over

1102
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:35,719
winter with leaves um but I typically

1103
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:37,400
don't use them during the season uh one

1104
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:40,039
from an aesthetic perspective I'll be

1105
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,760
honest that's that's part of it is just

1106
00:47:40,039 --> 00:47:44,159
the Aesthetics of it my wife likes a

1107
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:49,440
very clean looking garden and I okay I

1108
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:52,598
have to account for that um and also uh

1109
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,720
I just I find that sometimes the the the

1110
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:57,960
Water Management I have a little less

1111
00:47:54,719 --> 00:48:00,558
control over it um okay irrigation

1112
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:02,400
however it from from if you're not if

1113
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,000
your water is not dialed in I think

1114
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,639
mulching offers a ton of benefits in

1115
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:09,159
terms of the ability for the soil to

1116
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:10,679
retain moisture um and you mentioned all

1117
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:13,199
the benefits from a microbial

1118
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,078
perspective um adding carbon to the soil

1119
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:16,879
you're increasing organic matter though

1120
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:19,240
typically our soils are already

1121
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,480
sufficiently high in organic matter

1122
00:48:19,239 --> 00:48:25,759
relative to agricultural or actual soil

1123
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,920
right um yeah I think it's a it's

1124
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:31,240
a you know you have to you have to weigh

1125
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:33,639
it out as a as a benefit cost benefit

1126
00:48:31,239 --> 00:48:35,719
sort of situation and just as there's no

1127
00:48:33,639 --> 00:48:38,199
perfect mulch there's no perfect soil

1128
00:48:35,719 --> 00:48:39,480
there's no perfect media there is no

1129
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:41,480
there you know you're not going to find

1130
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,719
perfection you just have to decide where

1131
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:46,318
you fall but if there was a perfect

1132
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:48,879
mulch it would be pine straw in my

1133
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:51,119
book I love pine straw especially fresh

1134
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,760
pine straw that you can rake it's like

1135
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,240
the best so anybody listening that has

1136
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:59,160
access to Pines it's the best um second

1137
00:48:56,239 --> 00:49:01,159
to like Cypress bark not Cypress Wood

1138
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,879
but Cypress bark it's shredded and it

1139
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:06,318
like tangles in together and it's really

1140
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,920
nice too but uh free mulch is my

1141
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,159
absolute

1142
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:13,559
favorite because I put enough right so a

1143
00:49:11,159 --> 00:49:15,519
sufficient layer of mulch is much better

1144
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:18,400
than an insufficient layer a thin layer

1145
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,759
so anyway that's uh my ornamentals

1146
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,079
background coming

1147
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,000
out yeah I have to look into those

1148
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:24,680
because they're not things that are

1149
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:27,519
easily accessible to me here in the

1150
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:30,239
Northwest um right right that's a big

1151
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,920
difference location I have a greenhouse

1152
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:34,118
grower in Montana that really wants to

1153
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,119
run a mulch but has yet to find anything

1154
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:39,920
that he can run in his Greenhouse that

1155
00:49:36,119 --> 00:49:43,240
either um doesn't bring in pathogen risk

1156
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:45,000
or uh weed seeds um but would give him

1157
00:49:43,239 --> 00:49:48,879
all the benefits of moisture management

1158
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,639
and and soil health so we're still still

1159
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:52,798
okay I would consider a steamer if I was

1160
00:49:51,639 --> 00:49:56,838
a greenhouse

1161
00:49:52,798 --> 00:49:58,440
grower um because you can um make sure

1162
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:59,719
you're not bringing anything in now of

1163
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:01,440
course you don't bring in the microbes

1164
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:03,598
either the beneficials you lose

1165
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:05,440
everything um green houses are a

1166
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,400
different story right because in a

1167
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,159
greenhouse you don't have that

1168
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:13,119
ecological balance that you do outdoors

1169
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:15,239
and you can try but you're never going

1170
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:18,920
to get the equivalent of an outdoor grow

1171
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:23,118
in terms of of of a a Natural Balance of

1172
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:25,599
um beneficials and so when a greenhouse

1173
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,200
grower or a basement grower a closet

1174
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,880
grower should never try to mimic they're

1175
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:33,598
different they're very

1176
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:35,200
different so just be careful of that if

1177
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,079
you're Greenhouse growing on a

1178
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:40,558
commercial level um be very very careful

1179
00:50:39,079 --> 00:50:42,760
about some of the things that we've been

1180
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,880
chatting about like bringing in leaves

1181
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:47,960
and bringing things in from the outside

1182
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:51,720
and never ever bring in soil um that's

1183
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:54,760
my that is my pathology take on on the

1184
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:56,719
situation it's just different um so be

1185
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:59,240
very careful understand what you're

1186
00:50:56,719 --> 00:51:03,358
doing try things at a small scale before

1187
00:50:59,239 --> 00:51:06,039
you you dive in um put test plants out

1188
00:51:03,358 --> 00:51:07,920
whatever you need to do um always test

1189
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:10,039
things before going in with jumping in

1190
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:12,119
with both

1191
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:15,679
feet yeah no that's a really good point

1192
00:51:12,119 --> 00:51:18,880
we do uh we do see that you mentioned

1193
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:21,279
isopods roly py and we see we've see

1194
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,318
that as a as a big issue for people with

1195
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:25,839
really high organic matter in in

1196
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:27,358
controlled environments because they

1197
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:28,318
actually will girdle the plant and then

1198
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:31,358
we have other people that are

1199
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:33,880
intentionally introducing them so

1200
00:51:31,358 --> 00:51:36,558
um you know it's it's a wild world out

1201
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:40,079
there in the camp it is that's

1202
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:43,119
right um well we talked about the main

1203
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:44,880
stuff that I really wanted to cover um

1204
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:47,680
but I did have one question you know

1205
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,599
since we last talked what sorts of

1206
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:51,960
things are you seeing uh in the

1207
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:54,960
pathology World in relation to hemp and

1208
00:51:51,960 --> 00:51:57,280
cannabis um right

1209
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:59,599
now o

1210
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,240
you know not a lot different that you

1211
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:05,359
know we we've seen a lot of new

1212
00:52:01,239 --> 00:52:08,039
cultivars um and over time I I think I

1213
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:09,480
see that when a cultivar is highly

1214
00:52:08,039 --> 00:52:11,838
susceptible to disease it's kind of

1215
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:13,920
going away um people aren't using it

1216
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:15,400
anymore it's not for sale anymore so I

1217
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,720
think we're shifting we're finally

1218
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:21,160
shifting um that we're not breeding for

1219
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:23,959
disease resistance but we're kind of

1220
00:52:21,159 --> 00:52:25,798
selecting um you know now we've got some

1221
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,199
cultivars that are kind of listed as

1222
00:52:25,798 --> 00:52:31,199
powdery mil resistant for example uh to

1223
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:33,318
keep with our theme um resistance a big

1224
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:35,159
word we use it but it doesn't mean

1225
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,599
completely resistant but there's some

1226
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:38,558
tolerance in there and we're starting to

1227
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:42,318
identify those things so that's really

1228
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,839
good um Leaf diseases are always number

1229
00:52:42,318 --> 00:52:46,440
one because that's what people see um

1230
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:49,159
there are a lot of other pathogens

1231
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:51,318
beware of root of root pathogens or soil

1232
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:53,358
born pathogens as we call them be be

1233
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:55,400
really weary of that um and we've kind

1234
00:52:53,358 --> 00:52:56,960
of talked about that this this you know

1235
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:00,519
what last 30 minutes

1236
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:04,079
uh be careful what you bring in um you

1237
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:06,280
know the industry shifts so quickly um

1238
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:08,160
one thing we're seeing in the hemp world

1239
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:10,519
and we've we've identified it in flowers

1240
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:13,279
too is ferium headlight we're seeing it

1241
00:53:10,519 --> 00:53:16,599
in grains we're seeing it um even in

1242
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:17,920
flowers of uh floral cultivars um so

1243
00:53:16,599 --> 00:53:20,559
just kind of be careful of that if

1244
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:25,000
you're near wheat or anything like that

1245
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,920
so we have a big um project going there

1246
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,199
um what what was fusarium you said

1247
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:33,200
fusarium headlight ferium headlight that

1248
00:53:31,199 --> 00:53:35,358
is U it will infect the Grain and the

1249
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:37,759
flowers it is very different than

1250
00:53:35,358 --> 00:53:40,400
fusarium Wilt which is a vascular Wilt

1251
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:43,559
or fusarium salani which is a crown Rod

1252
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,358
so different fusarium species out there

1253
00:53:43,559 --> 00:53:48,960
um but this one affects grain um and

1254
00:53:46,358 --> 00:53:50,078
flowers and it's very common in wheat if

1255
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,559
you want to know anything about it you

1256
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,240
could just Google fusarium headlight um

1257
00:53:53,559 --> 00:53:57,640
you'll something will come up with wheat

1258
00:53:55,239 --> 00:54:00,239
and you'll know about that um so it's

1259
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:02,639
out there and we're seeing it a lot near

1260
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:04,479
um corn and especially wheat or when

1261
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:07,279
wheat is used as a cover crop and

1262
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:09,920
letting it go to seed so if you use any

1263
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,960
kind of Gman Nicholas cover crop

1264
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:14,639
terminate it before it goes to

1265
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:16,920
flour um that's really good advice what

1266
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:20,159
what does it present as in cannabis what

1267
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:24,039
would we look for um it is just kind of

1268
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:26,159
a dieback in that flower um so the um

1269
00:54:24,039 --> 00:54:29,519
kind of that that stem and that in into

1270
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:31,039
that rayam um that peduncle I think

1271
00:54:29,519 --> 00:54:33,159
that's the word you call it anyway it'll

1272
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:36,358
kind of be in there you'll see some um

1273
00:54:33,159 --> 00:54:39,159
Melia back to our term you'll see Melia

1274
00:54:36,358 --> 00:54:42,759
in there in between the flowers and um

1275
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:45,199
it'll be kind of um fuzzy and and like

1276
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:48,640
betrus then it'll kind of have that

1277
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:52,039
betrus look U betrus is gray the

1278
00:54:48,639 --> 00:54:55,279
Mycelia um uh from fusarium headlight is

1279
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:56,798
more white um betrus is gray that's why

1280
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,440
they call it grey mole because of all

1281
00:54:56,798 --> 00:54:59,719
the

1282
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,599
sporulation um so it's going to look

1283
00:54:59,719 --> 00:55:04,159
different definitely to a pathologist

1284
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:06,760
but yeah it'll be in there so um you

1285
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,920
should not see it in a greenhouse we've

1286
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:13,280
seen we've identified some of it in um

1287
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,480
green houses in a germ plasm study um

1288
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:17,920
but we have not really seen it in green

1289
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:22,318
houses you know as a as a primary

1290
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,680
disease um but it is Seaborn so kind of

1291
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,318
heads up on that so we have a big

1292
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:29,440
project going there it's mostly

1293
00:55:26,318 --> 00:55:31,759
pertaining to feed grain um hemp grain

1294
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,838
as animal feed um so that's where that's

1295
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:36,720
coming from but we do see it in Floral

1296
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:39,759
hemp so cover crops just don't let your

1297
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:42,239
your wheat U and Fry um cover crops go

1298
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,680
to seed um make sure you mow it or crimp

1299
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:49,519
it before you start seeing

1300
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:52,318
flowering um other diseases um probably

1301
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:55,280
nothing super new

1302
00:55:52,318 --> 00:55:58,239
um po plant health is going to bring up

1303
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,839
a lot of secondary diseases um we get

1304
00:55:58,239 --> 00:56:02,000
excited about them in the pathology

1305
00:55:59,838 --> 00:56:03,639
world but healthy plants are going to

1306
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,880
have kind of the same few diseases over

1307
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:10,358
and over again um and and I say this

1308
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,079
every time um that outdoor plants will

1309
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:14,038
have different diseases than indoor

1310
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:17,318
plants so that's where I make my

1311
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:20,119
separation not um high THC versus low

1312
00:56:17,318 --> 00:56:22,079
THC or floral versus grain it's really

1313
00:56:20,119 --> 00:56:23,880
that indoor versus outdoor that's the

1314
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:26,359
where that difference really lies in the

1315
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:29,318
pathology world

1316
00:56:26,358 --> 00:56:32,558
are there any insects that you see as

1317
00:56:29,318 --> 00:56:34,318
bigger vectors for pathogens than others

1318
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:37,039
in terms of's

1319
00:56:34,318 --> 00:56:39,440
pests um a lot of your pest will

1320
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:41,280
transmit viruses right so white fly

1321
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,200
transmitted viruses thrips transmitted

1322
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:45,640
viruses aphid transmitted viruses so um

1323
00:56:44,199 --> 00:56:47,598
those are there there's there that's

1324
00:56:45,639 --> 00:56:50,679
nothing new there no new discoveries

1325
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:53,880
there but uh definitely Pest Management

1326
00:56:50,679 --> 00:56:55,558
um any kind of um insect screen to put

1327
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,880
around green houses and Greenhouse Vents

1328
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:02,200
and those kinds of things um you we see

1329
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:05,240
a lot more viruses out west um from the

1330
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:07,960
Rockies on West A lot more viruses we

1331
00:57:05,239 --> 00:57:11,279
really don't see many viruses in the um

1332
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:13,760
Central and Eastern region of the US but

1333
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,200
those are generally insect transmitted

1334
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:17,839
there are some that are me mechanically

1335
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:21,118
transmitted that means us that means

1336
00:57:17,838 --> 00:57:23,440
hands um and then we see um and I'm

1337
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:26,318
going to generalize and say that anytime

1338
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,280
you have a physical damage to any plant

1339
00:57:26,318 --> 00:57:32,000
right and that could be um chewing an

1340
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:34,160
insect chewing or it could be mechanical

1341
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:36,798
damage or environmental damage like a

1342
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:39,759
hail storm anytime you have a wound then

1343
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:42,759
there are lots of pathogens that get in

1344
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:45,880
that way right um betrus loves to get in

1345
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:48,160
through a wound so um any kind of

1346
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,838
management so so insects can contribute

1347
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:51,838
that way not directly but

1348
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,880
indirectly yeah that's that's a good

1349
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:59,000
point but we I mean I know

1350
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:02,838
intentionally wound our plants by

1351
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,880
pruning to increase air flow and open up

1352
00:58:02,838 --> 00:58:06,920
a plant you know allow the plant to

1353
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:09,440
focus its energy more on the flower

1354
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:14,079
versus the overall uh you know Leaf

1355
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:15,280
biomass so we control that ratio um but

1356
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,798
what you're saying is we are also

1357
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,039
opening ourselves up to more pathogen

1358
00:58:18,798 --> 00:58:24,119
pressure yeah you're asking all the hard

1359
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:26,760
questions today yeah that's I mean this

1360
00:58:24,119 --> 00:58:30,400
plant also seems to respond really well

1361
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:32,520
to herbivory yeah um yeah as a stress

1362
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:34,480
response that allows for it seems like

1363
00:58:32,519 --> 00:58:36,798
increased growth from what we're seeing

1364
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:40,240
with cannabis compared to other

1365
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:42,400
crops um yeah I don't I don't know so

1366
00:58:40,239 --> 00:58:46,078
every time we prune we do open that

1367
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:48,798
plant up to infection but what's there

1368
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:51,440
right is betrus is your inoculum load

1369
00:58:48,798 --> 00:58:52,599
for betrus in your Greenhouse so high

1370
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,679
that you're not willing to take that

1371
00:58:52,599 --> 00:58:56,200
risk so it's it's at an oculum load it's

1372
00:58:54,679 --> 00:58:58,759
how many spores are floating around in

1373
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,879
the air or or if it's um you know

1374
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:03,280
something else right your pruners wh

1375
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,920
we're going to transmit but yeah you

1376
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:07,119
that's another balance right it's the

1377
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:09,680
art of growing that's why not everybody

1378
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:12,920
can do it so every time you prune you're

1379
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:16,239
making a wound and the you know anything

1380
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:18,798
can get in so having that that the plant

1381
00:59:16,239 --> 00:59:21,719
being healthy and having a very low

1382
00:59:18,798 --> 00:59:23,920
disease um there from the start is

1383
00:59:21,719 --> 00:59:27,439
really going to take you a long way and

1384
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:29,400
that's when you start seeing um um a

1385
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:31,519
separation of good Growers and poor

1386
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:33,400
Growers so if you're sloppy and then

1387
00:59:31,519 --> 00:59:34,400
it's time to make really hard heavy

1388
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:36,838
pruning

1389
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:39,358
Cuts that's usually where your Vigor

1390
00:59:36,838 --> 00:59:42,038
will take a dive or plants are going to

1391
00:59:39,358 --> 00:59:46,119
say okay fine I can you know overcome

1392
00:59:42,039 --> 00:59:48,359
this um yeah always a risk everything we

1393
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:50,720
do is a risk right we walk into our

1394
00:59:48,358 --> 00:59:53,920
Greenhouse we open the door and created

1395
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:56,798
another layer of risk absolutely so

1396
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,639
interestingly enough uh I just got back

1397
00:59:56,798 --> 01:00:02,798
from uh Melbourne Australia and I got to

1398
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:06,199
visit one of the larger uh Farms there

1399
01:00:02,798 --> 01:00:08,079
it's a greenhouse operation great guys

1400
01:00:06,199 --> 01:00:09,239
plants looked amazing one of the things

1401
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:11,079
they shared with me that I think you'll

1402
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:13,038
find interesting is they don't have

1403
01:00:11,079 --> 01:00:15,720
powdery mildew pressure out there it's

1404
01:00:13,039 --> 01:00:19,280
just not an issue where they are uh they

1405
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:21,318
deal with Bettis which obviously is is

1406
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:22,599
difficult but uh they've never had

1407
01:00:21,318 --> 01:00:24,440
problems with powder and build because I

1408
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:26,359
was asking that we walking through with

1409
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,920
the humidity and the in the space you

1410
01:00:26,358 --> 01:00:31,038
know it's winter right now over there so

1411
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:34,440
it's colder um so they have conditions

1412
01:00:31,039 --> 01:00:37,440
that I would think um would be you know

1413
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:38,838
more optimal for for powdering me but

1414
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,960
there was none that they just said it's

1415
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:44,000
just not something they've had to deal

1416
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:47,039
with that's really interesting so um

1417
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,440
I'll tell you a a grey mold or a betrus

1418
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:53,240
uh little bit a tidbit about petritis um

1419
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:55,079
it likes very high humidity 85% and up

1420
01:00:53,239 --> 01:00:58,439
um and that's almost where you can feel

1421
01:00:55,079 --> 01:00:59,839
it in the air right um so 85% humidity

1422
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:03,240
and up is usually where we're going to

1423
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:06,480
see U Bettis powdery mildew between 40

1424
01:01:03,239 --> 01:01:08,358
and 70% most of your pathogens 70% is

1425
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,960
your magic number that's your magic C

1426
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:13,239
off you can have your uh humidity below

1427
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:16,838
70% you're usually good for most of your

1428
01:01:13,239 --> 01:01:19,719
pathogens but betrus 85% and up um

1429
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:21,639
betrus also likes it to be cool um if

1430
01:01:19,719 --> 01:01:23,480
you've got condensation so if you've got

1431
01:01:21,639 --> 01:01:25,558
those warm days cool nights and you're

1432
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:27,760
kind of Dripping Greenhouse you know

1433
01:01:25,559 --> 01:01:31,000
that's again contributing to that uh

1434
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:34,400
free water that betrus likes so much it

1435
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:37,599
likes it to be cooler also but Bettis is

1436
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:40,119
a weakling okay it's it's the Sissi of

1437
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:42,880
all of our pathogens it has to get in

1438
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:44,039
somehow you have to let it in right and

1439
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,358
but you know we talked about pruning

1440
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:49,359
cuts um and there are a lot of um there

1441
01:01:47,358 --> 01:01:51,639
are a lot of natural openings and wounds

1442
01:01:49,358 --> 01:01:54,000
that it can get into but when you see

1443
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:55,440
Bettis we call it gry mold because again

1444
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,239
those are all spores that's what you're

1445
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,480
looking at that's what's gray or that

1446
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,759
brownish gray that's spor so there's a

1447
01:01:59,480 --> 01:02:05,760
lot of there's a lot of inoculum when

1448
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:10,559
you see gray mold it also will get in

1449
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:13,319
and colonize dead dying disease tissue

1450
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:16,160
so if you've got yellowing leaves if

1451
01:02:13,318 --> 01:02:19,679
you've got spent blooms if you've got

1452
01:02:16,159 --> 01:02:21,278
any kind of debris any uh dropped leaves

1453
01:02:19,679 --> 01:02:24,159
that fall on the the floor of your

1454
01:02:21,278 --> 01:02:26,639
Greenhouse that's where betrus is really

1455
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:28,558
going to colonize so so that when you do

1456
01:02:26,639 --> 01:02:32,480
have a wound it can get in or you do

1457
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:35,640
have a really humid um microclimate

1458
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:38,159
between um between uh inflorescence

1459
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:41,239
right in that in that head that's where

1460
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:43,960
you'll see it in there but um it really

1461
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:47,798
will primarily colonize anything that's

1462
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:50,920
damaged dead wounded um so keeping

1463
01:02:47,798 --> 01:02:54,480
things clean um once you see bet trus

1464
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:57,440
once you see gray mold um you have

1465
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,159
almost exclusively cultural practices

1466
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:01,679
that have to be taken care of before you

1467
01:02:59,159 --> 01:03:03,159
can even think fungicide you've got to

1468
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:04,838
manage your humidity you've got to

1469
01:03:03,159 --> 01:03:07,480
circulate that air you've got to space

1470
01:03:04,838 --> 01:03:10,000
your plants and you got to clean up um

1471
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,880
so be you know think about it in that

1472
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:15,000
way think about that life cycle of the

1473
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:17,160
petritis um scenaria pathogen and then

1474
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:19,400
that will help help you make sense in

1475
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:22,480
how you can use cultural practices to

1476
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:24,119
really reduce that risk and that will

1477
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,358
let your fungicides work if your

1478
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:30,640
inoculum load is so heavy

1479
01:03:26,358 --> 01:03:33,400
that you still got you know um decaying

1480
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:36,920
um plant tissue there no fungicide is

1481
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:39,278
going to manage um grey mold um you have

1482
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:41,599
to be able to reduce that humidity and

1483
01:03:39,278 --> 01:03:41,599
clean

1484
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:47,639
up wow that was a lot of great

1485
01:03:44,159 --> 01:03:50,440
information so if so boom so many

1486
01:03:47,639 --> 01:03:53,558
questions all right so if we see betrus

1487
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:55,880
let's say I spot it in One Bud on my

1488
01:03:53,559 --> 01:03:57,960
plant so I'm already laid in flower that

1489
01:03:55,880 --> 01:04:01,318
eliminates the ability to spray any oils

1490
01:03:57,960 --> 01:04:05,358
sulfur things like that

1491
01:04:01,318 --> 01:04:06,639
um I I you were you're suggesting that

1492
01:04:05,358 --> 01:04:09,358
the first thing we need to do is make

1493
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:11,000
sure that we lower humidity absolutely

1494
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:13,519
we can't control that little

1495
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:15,920
microclimate inside the flower itself

1496
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,000
necessarily inside the bud as most

1497
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:19,519
people call it um but we can't control

1498
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:21,119
the humidity in the room what would be a

1499
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:23,480
good Target humidity are we going to try

1500
01:04:21,119 --> 01:04:27,318
and drop it as much as we can I mean

1501
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:29,719
even outside of you know typical VP

1502
01:04:27,318 --> 01:04:33,038
ranges as the pathologist I'm telling

1503
01:04:29,719 --> 01:04:35,159
you to get it below 85% okay 85 is

1504
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,720
really high though like I mean most

1505
01:04:35,159 --> 01:04:38,399
people are not going to be that High I

1506
01:04:36,719 --> 01:04:40,598
mean I've seen Bettis in rooms when

1507
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:43,400
we're at 60% humidity you know what is

1508
01:04:40,599 --> 01:04:45,440
the fluctuation what is the nighttime so

1509
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:47,400
it's that so watching it watching it

1510
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,760
over time because usually it'll raise at

1511
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,278
night it'll raise when you water right

1512
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:54,400
greenh houses wet floors wet surfaces

1513
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:57,000
wet soil everything is wet in a

1514
01:04:54,400 --> 01:05:00,400
greenhouse so yeah when you walk in it

1515
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:02,480
may be low but think about the

1516
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,318
fluctuations because you don't need a

1517
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,199
lot of time so how can you maybe water

1518
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:10,838
less right making sure that when you do

1519
01:05:08,199 --> 01:05:12,318
water that you know we always say to you

1520
01:05:10,838 --> 01:05:14,078
know water in the morning so things dry

1521
01:05:12,318 --> 01:05:16,239
out so maybe switching some of your

1522
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:19,318
watering so those floors don't stay wet

1523
01:05:16,239 --> 01:05:21,959
all night or um being able to vent your

1524
01:05:19,318 --> 01:05:24,038
green house even when you normally would

1525
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:26,880
keep it closed to keep it warm maybe do

1526
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:28,839
more air exchange um um especially if

1527
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:30,599
you've got those cool nights and you've

1528
01:05:28,838 --> 01:05:33,400
got that condensation in that Greenhouse

1529
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:36,880
so um look at your look at your

1530
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:39,559
nighttime humidity and you may be

1531
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,039
surprised okay assuming though our night

1532
01:05:39,559 --> 01:05:43,319
let's Okay so let's just take humidity

1533
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:46,400
out of the picture though and say that

1534
01:05:43,318 --> 01:05:47,558
it's we're keeping it below 85% because

1535
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:49,160
I think because I'm thinking a lot of

1536
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:51,519
controlled environment agriculture a lot

1537
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:53,480
of these guys are keeping it below 85

1538
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:54,880
we're still seeing betrus and some of

1539
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:56,639
that is genetics you know they're just

1540
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:59,119
more susceptible we need to be aware of

1541
01:05:56,639 --> 01:06:02,000
that because they grow these massive

1542
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:03,838
large colas that um frankly that

1543
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,400
microclimate inside the bud inside that

1544
01:06:03,838 --> 01:06:10,318
Cola is just it's impossible to manage

1545
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:12,680
Laden flour um but you're also

1546
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:14,599
suggesting we need to remove all detrius

1547
01:06:12,679 --> 01:06:18,118
all dead matter we certainly don't want

1548
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:22,720
to be dropping any leaves onto the the

1549
01:06:18,119 --> 01:06:24,200
soil or the the media because so so what

1550
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:26,879
what if I'm understanding correctly we

1551
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:30,159
may not see betrus on those leaves but

1552
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:33,559
their potential habitat and a food

1553
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:36,920
source for petritis to increase sport

1554
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:38,960
pressure in the room yeah um so so

1555
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:41,440
you're right those dense colas so right

1556
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,480
think about think about a cultivar with

1557
01:06:41,440 --> 01:06:46,119
that really dense um head versus the

1558
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:48,760
ones that kind of look spinley that

1559
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:50,640
nobody ever really takes seriously you

1560
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:53,200
have more air circulation there right

1561
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:56,400
you can spread plants out more hair

1562
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:58,879
circulation you can add fans um um those

1563
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,400
kinds of things and all too often we see

1564
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:03,119
commercial production plants are too

1565
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:06,200
close together and that's all air

1566
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:07,920
circulation that's all so you you know

1567
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:09,919
you can look at the humidity in the room

1568
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:14,200
okay the humidity in the room might be

1569
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:16,760
70% but bring that bring that um

1570
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,960
humidity meter between plants right and

1571
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:20,039
then that's where you have that high

1572
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:22,838
humidity so what can you do to lower

1573
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:24,799
humidity between plants inside a canopy

1574
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:26,719
and yes yes it's hard to manage inside a

1575
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:28,920
canopy in some of of these cultiv Wares

1576
01:07:26,719 --> 01:07:31,439
but think about ways that you can

1577
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:33,240
increase air circulation which is doing

1578
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:35,798
just that it's lowering that humidity

1579
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:38,558
it's exchanging air the more you can do

1580
01:07:35,798 --> 01:07:40,358
that but once you get kind of inside

1581
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,559
like that late season when you've got

1582
01:07:40,358 --> 01:07:44,719
that really dense flower head it's

1583
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:47,039
really hard at that point but at that

1584
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:50,399
point you've had that inoculum load all

1585
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,960
along so if you can manage it until then

1586
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,960
then your inoculum load may be lower

1587
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:59,760
that's another approach would you avoid

1588
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:01,639
all pruning in a room once ptis has been

1589
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:03,160
spotted like you mentioned an area that

1590
01:08:01,639 --> 01:08:04,879
has air circulation that you need to

1591
01:08:03,159 --> 01:08:07,000
increase one of the ways you can do that

1592
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:09,278
is mechanically through pruning to

1593
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:12,159
remove leaf matter

1594
01:08:09,278 --> 01:08:15,039
um are you saying though that it's where

1595
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:17,000
where's the cost risk benefit on

1596
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:19,600
something like

1597
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:21,439
that I guess I can't directly answer

1598
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:23,600
that I would look at other things other

1599
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:26,000
ways that I can manage how far along in

1600
01:08:23,600 --> 01:08:29,239
the season right um or we at early

1601
01:08:26,000 --> 01:08:31,759
flowering or very late flowering can um

1602
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:34,079
Can pruning actually help at that point

1603
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:38,838
is an oculum load so high can we rescue

1604
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:41,880
this crop um I would probably prune um

1605
01:08:38,838 --> 01:08:43,759
but I would also look broadly and you

1606
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:45,640
know to see what else I can do and some

1607
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:49,359
other things I can do pruning alone is

1608
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:52,560
not going to be magic um so thinking

1609
01:08:49,359 --> 01:08:54,960
about it and and again every situation

1610
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:56,640
um the weather outside is going to

1611
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,439
dictate even a controlled environment

1612
01:08:56,640 --> 01:09:01,920
Greenhouse the weather outside you know

1613
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:03,439
if it's cloudy outside versus sunny

1614
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:08,239
outside all of those things are going to

1615
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:10,399
play in um but it's it's all humidity

1616
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:13,678
and um debris

1617
01:09:10,399 --> 01:09:15,439
driven at that microclimate level if not

1618
01:09:13,679 --> 01:09:17,279
at the broader level okay so it's going

1619
01:09:15,439 --> 01:09:18,960
to be in that microclimate level we can

1620
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:21,000
look at the humidity inside of a canopy

1621
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:24,319
and I guarantee you it is going to be

1622
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:26,238
really really high um can you can you

1623
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:29,480
back off on the water a little bit on

1624
01:09:26,238 --> 01:09:32,318
your plants um those kinds of things how

1625
01:09:29,479 --> 01:09:34,439
how how can you clean um are plants far

1626
01:09:32,319 --> 01:09:36,759
enough apart to clean do you have enough

1627
01:09:34,439 --> 01:09:38,479
space right is your Greenhouse such

1628
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:42,560
Prime real estate you're not willing to

1629
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:45,358
space a million questions um yeah I've

1630
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:47,560
added under canopy air flow as a way of

1631
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:49,359
increasing air flow through the canopy

1632
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:51,440
and i' I found I mean I haven't had to

1633
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:52,838
deal with Bettis at this point so it

1634
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:54,678
hasn't been issue but I think that

1635
01:09:52,838 --> 01:09:56,479
that's something that that cultural

1636
01:09:54,679 --> 01:10:00,480
practice that could help

1637
01:09:56,479 --> 01:10:01,959
um so when I see Bettis in a Bud um I

1638
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:03,959
want to remove that from the room right

1639
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:06,439
like I actually want to with gloves and

1640
01:10:03,960 --> 01:10:07,760
clean pruners I assume cut that out and

1641
01:10:06,439 --> 01:10:10,039
take it remove it from the room that's

1642
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:12,640
going to remove a far a large amount of

1643
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:14,840
spores right rather than trying to spray

1644
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:17,960
it or treat it at that point because I'm

1645
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:20,039
not going to salvage that flour anyway

1646
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,679
correct um so think about how you're

1647
01:10:20,039 --> 01:10:23,719
going to prune that right okay so let's

1648
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:25,560
say we have a greenhouse with I don't

1649
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:28,800
know let's pretend let's say we have th

1650
01:10:25,560 --> 01:10:30,640
plants and only this corner that maybe

1651
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:33,960
gets a little bit of shade from a tree

1652
01:10:30,640 --> 01:10:35,640
outside is is affected how are you going

1653
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:37,960
to remove those are you going to remove

1654
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:40,440
the plant are you going to remove just

1655
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:43,239
the the obviously infected

1656
01:10:40,439 --> 01:10:45,039
flowers um are you going to prune those

1657
01:10:43,238 --> 01:10:47,279
and gently Take It Outside or you going

1658
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:48,800
to cover that flour before you cut it so

1659
01:10:47,279 --> 01:10:51,359
that you're not shaking spores

1660
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:53,800
everywhere um or you going to toss it

1661
01:10:51,359 --> 01:10:56,319
into a wheelbarrow or or a wagon or a

1662
01:10:53,800 --> 01:11:00,520
cart and disseminate those spores like

1663
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:03,119
as you're tossing um lots of questions

1664
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:05,000
as opposed to if it's the entire house

1665
01:11:03,119 --> 01:11:06,760
right if it's the entire house then

1666
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:10,960
you've had a problem for a longer time

1667
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:13,320
than you realized um you spread pretty

1668
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,319
fast though right like we're talking of

1669
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:18,759
hours instead of days or weeks right I

1670
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:21,279
mean with petritis it seems like seems

1671
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:22,719
like it moves pretty fast it seems like

1672
01:11:21,279 --> 01:11:25,639
a lot of times it's usually somewhere

1673
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:28,079
lurking um it's usually like inside of a

1674
01:11:25,640 --> 01:11:31,159
dense area um dense flower head or

1675
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:34,399
something or um it's on the floor in in

1676
01:11:31,158 --> 01:11:37,960
debris um it's probably somewhere else

1677
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:40,079
um if you have a history of Bettis um

1678
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:41,880
for whatever reason right your climate

1679
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,238
your maybe your Greenhouse you can't

1680
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:48,000
really um control the climate as well as

1681
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:50,519
you thought um using um using fungicides

1682
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:52,279
until flower begins right so if you can

1683
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:54,719
control that inoculum load before

1684
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:57,158
flowering it's not there it's not there

1685
01:11:54,719 --> 01:11:59,158
at High enough numbers so you're kind of

1686
01:11:57,158 --> 01:12:01,359
just you're just lowering that inoculum

1687
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:04,679
load for when flowering starts so

1688
01:12:01,359 --> 01:12:08,559
starting to balance all of those um

1689
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:10,158
those IPM practices right um IPM is

1690
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:12,960
integrated Pest Management you're using

1691
01:12:10,158 --> 01:12:15,479
all of the tools in your toolbox um but

1692
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,560
thinking about where it came from how

1693
01:12:15,479 --> 01:12:19,678
long it's been here maybe you didn't

1694
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:21,600
recognize it fast enough and that's okay

1695
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:24,039
it's a learning process but how do you

1696
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:27,480
find it earlier where would it appear

1697
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:29,800
first how do you Scout for it um if

1698
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:32,678
you've had it two years in a row you

1699
01:12:29,800 --> 01:12:34,920
absolutely need to be um spraying

1700
01:12:32,679 --> 01:12:39,399
something at least early in the season

1701
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:41,480
but um finding out why where that where

1702
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:44,638
that high humidity is or where you may

1703
01:12:41,479 --> 01:12:46,158
have not been able to clean up as well

1704
01:12:44,639 --> 01:12:49,520
those kinds of things but these are

1705
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:51,359
airborne spores right so not as much as

1706
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,920
the sanitizing the pruners and

1707
01:12:51,359 --> 01:12:57,238
sanitizing the greenhouse at the end of

1708
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:59,760
the season um a lot more about um

1709
01:12:57,238 --> 01:13:02,439
environmental

1710
01:12:59,760 --> 01:13:04,480
control so you mentioned that it could

1711
01:13:02,439 --> 01:13:07,439
be an issue

1712
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:08,959
earlier like before we're in flower

1713
01:13:07,439 --> 01:13:12,000
because the only time I really associate

1714
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:14,439
Bettis is when I see grey mold inside

1715
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:17,800
the buds themselves the inside the

1716
01:13:14,439 --> 01:13:20,158
flowers I I've never really looked at

1717
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:22,360
betrus or I've never looked at like a

1718
01:13:20,158 --> 01:13:24,599
veg plant that doesn't have any flowers

1719
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:27,359
and said oh that's clearly betrus

1720
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:30,199
whether that's on the the the Le the

1721
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:31,880
detrius on the ground there or on the

1722
01:13:30,198 --> 01:13:34,119
plant itself what does that look like if

1723
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:37,039
how do I Scout for Beyond just pulling

1724
01:13:34,119 --> 01:13:40,719
apart Buds and seeing gray

1725
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:42,039
mold um okay so you can it it can cause

1726
01:13:40,719 --> 01:13:45,840
damping off so right it can affect

1727
01:13:42,039 --> 01:13:47,519
ceilings it can cause a tip light um and

1728
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:50,880
so look at it from a tip light

1729
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,199
standpoint um and look at it in in just

1730
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:55,960
a yellow leaf hanging on the plant look

1731
01:13:53,198 --> 01:13:57,519
look at those kinds of things um

1732
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:59,399
when you say that so I want to take like

1733
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,480
a Jeweler's Loop or a microscope and

1734
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:05,359
look closer at that yellow leaf and see

1735
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:06,879
if there is any Mycelia growing is that

1736
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,960
not necessarily you should be able to

1737
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,319
find you should be able to see it with

1738
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:11,760
the naked eye visually okay okay that's

1739
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:14,319
good that's good yeah so just keep your

1740
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:18,159
eye out because sometimes we see like if

1741
01:14:14,319 --> 01:14:20,759
we've got a a you know dead dying leaves

1742
01:14:18,158 --> 01:14:22,319
and we see they kind of get like moldy

1743
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:24,039
we kind of just disregard it that leaves

1744
01:14:22,319 --> 01:14:25,599
dead anyway that's just you know it's

1745
01:14:24,039 --> 01:14:27,039
just a sacrify

1746
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,560
yeah be careful it could very well be

1747
01:14:27,039 --> 01:14:30,920
petritis and again it's just kind of

1748
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:32,520
it's it's going through its life cycle

1749
01:14:30,920 --> 01:14:35,600
it's doing what it does because it's

1750
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:37,520
primarily a sapry it's a very very weak

1751
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:39,360
pathogen um so we call those

1752
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:43,159
opportunistic right you put out the all

1753
01:14:39,359 --> 01:14:45,759
you can eat buffet it's G to arrive um

1754
01:14:43,158 --> 01:14:47,439
but if you've got if if you've got it

1755
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:50,320
there and it's in your greenhouse and

1756
01:14:47,439 --> 01:14:51,960
it's lurking and it's multiplying um and

1757
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:54,079
then you go to flower and you've got

1758
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:57,158
that really great dense Bud where it can

1759
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,639
hide there's more of it there so it's a

1760
01:14:57,158 --> 01:15:03,079
it's a numbers

1761
01:14:59,639 --> 01:15:04,359
game now you said when I add fertilizer

1762
01:15:03,079 --> 01:15:07,119
there's

1763
01:15:04,359 --> 01:15:09,920
um and I see some sort of Mycelia

1764
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:12,760
growing from that fertilizer um if it's

1765
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,840
at all gray do I need to turn that back

1766
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,639
into the soil then to make sure it's not

1767
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:18,719
betrus or is there no chance that that

1768
01:15:16,639 --> 01:15:20,840
would be a betrus species because of the

1769
01:15:18,719 --> 01:15:24,198
fact it's a fertilizer and not plant

1770
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:26,719
material yeah so um so betrus is not

1771
01:15:24,198 --> 01:15:28,919
going to be colonizing soil it will be

1772
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:31,480
it's it's it'll be above ground it might

1773
01:15:28,920 --> 01:15:33,920
be on you know debris on setting on the

1774
01:15:31,479 --> 01:15:36,319
ground on the surface but um it's really

1775
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:40,239
going to be higher in the canopy or at

1776
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:43,599
least on the surface on um Leaf tissue

1777
01:15:40,238 --> 01:15:46,678
would I want to avoid adding leaf mulch

1778
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:49,520
if I have a petritis problem or I've had

1779
01:15:46,679 --> 01:15:51,560
a petritis problem in the

1780
01:15:49,520 --> 01:15:54,159
past that's a good question in your

1781
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:56,159
garden like Outdoors yeah if we're

1782
01:15:54,158 --> 01:15:58,079
talking Outdoors you you mentioned using

1783
01:15:56,158 --> 01:16:00,439
Leaf mulches as one of your favorite I

1784
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:03,119
love Leaf mulches um and I love Leaf

1785
01:16:00,439 --> 01:16:05,079
compost it's my favorite you know Lea

1786
01:16:03,119 --> 01:16:07,760
mold compost is my absolute favorite but

1787
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:09,479
if I have a history of betrus would I

1788
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:15,719
want to avoid

1789
01:16:09,479 --> 01:16:20,399
using Leaf litter as my mulch near my

1790
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:22,920
cannabis plants um Outdoors unless you

1791
01:16:20,399 --> 01:16:25,599
have a unless you have an environmental

1792
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:28,399
condition that I that's really really

1793
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:31,120
humid you should not there should not be

1794
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:32,599
a a red flag there for outdoors it's

1795
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:35,158
usually really that's when you're in

1796
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,639
that indoor environment um that's when

1797
01:16:35,158 --> 01:16:39,359
we really see betrus as a real problem

1798
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:41,119
uh and we'll find betrus outside it's

1799
01:16:39,359 --> 01:16:43,920
always out there

1800
01:16:41,119 --> 01:16:45,359
um um I'll use it like for teaching a

1801
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:47,639
class you know I'll go out there and

1802
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:49,920
I'll I'll find it somewhere um but that

1803
01:16:47,639 --> 01:16:51,760
doesn't mean it's like taking out plants

1804
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:54,158
like it would inside of a

1805
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:55,920
greenhouse okay okay that's good to know

1806
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:59,039
end of season here in the Northwest it's

1807
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:01,079
just not ideal for growing anous plants

1808
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,079
so we always see betrus in powdery

1809
01:17:01,079 --> 01:17:05,198
mildew it's just the plants just crash

1810
01:17:03,079 --> 01:17:06,960
because of the colder temperature the

1811
01:17:05,198 --> 01:17:09,960
higher humidity you know all the things

1812
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:13,480
we talked about so and betrus likes

1813
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:15,319
betrus likes that cool weather um so you

1814
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:17,039
know anybody that has major problems

1815
01:17:15,319 --> 01:17:19,279
maybe try an autoflow or something

1816
01:17:17,039 --> 01:17:20,600
that'll flower faster that you can get

1817
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:23,279
your Harvest out before it starts

1818
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:27,400
turning cool so think of some ways that

1819
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:28,639
you could um protect a little bit but um

1820
01:17:27,399 --> 01:17:31,119
you know you may have to jump through

1821
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:33,600
some hoops if that if if outdoor grow is

1822
01:17:31,119 --> 01:17:35,679
really going to be conducive for betrus

1823
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:38,120
but Bettis is everywhere like you can't

1824
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:40,079
you can't exclude betrus It's Kind like

1825
01:17:38,119 --> 01:17:42,639
powdery mil do it will appear it will be

1826
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:45,158
everywhere if you give it the um the

1827
01:17:42,639 --> 01:17:47,079
microclimate to u to infect and to

1828
01:17:45,158 --> 01:17:49,759
colonize it will be

1829
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:51,479
