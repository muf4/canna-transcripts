1
00:00:03,879 --> 00:00:07,560
okay this is the African nightcrawlers

2
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:14,440
with molasses at 24 hours with

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:18,960
uh in distilled

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:23,278
water um stumbled across this fungal

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,278
strand it looks pretty nice and if

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,719
we zoom

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,039
in

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,239
you can see that we have a lot of

9
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,519
bacteria cruising around too so this

10
00:00:35,238 --> 00:00:40,439
material might be a suitable uh

11
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:42,960
substitute for making aided compost teas

12
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:45,119
as well as a good biological additive to

13
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
your

14
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,399
soil
