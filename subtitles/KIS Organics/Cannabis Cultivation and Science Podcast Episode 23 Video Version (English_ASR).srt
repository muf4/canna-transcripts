projects around the farm that I think

19
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,129
would be helpful to gardeners now this

20
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:39,689
week's podcast was a fun one some of my

21
00:00:38,128 --> 00:00:41,640
podcasts can get more technical or

22
00:00:39,689 --> 00:00:43,409
science focused however for this podcast

23
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,850
I want to talk too directly with a

24
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,679
grower to get some hands-on experience

25
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:49,079
and knowledge from someone in the

26
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:51,238
industry I had the honor of sitting down

27
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,698
with my good friend Nate Gibbs owner of

28
00:00:51,238 --> 00:00:56,189
goldleaf Gardens a tier 2 producer here

29
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:58,170
in Washington State this podcast was my

30
00:00:56,189 --> 00:00:59,640
first attempt to the video podcast so if

31
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,320
you're listening to the podcast and

32
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,189
would like to see the video version you

33
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,189
can go to youtube.com

34
00:01:05,478 --> 00:01:09,929
I will also have some extra content to

35
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:12,510
support some of the ideas we discussed

36
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,189
as well as more footage of origins the

37
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,259
dispensary next door to where we shot

38
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:18,179
the podcast and if you want to see more

39

instagram at at gold leaf gardens 420

42
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,729
now this podcast was a little bit

43
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:32,099
trickier to record because we did we

44
00:01:29,728 --> 00:01:33,840
shot the video in a coffee shop so it's

45
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:36,089
a little bit echoey but I did my best to

46
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,490
edit the audio and make it the best we

47
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,829
could but I apologize in advance for the

48
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:42,599
quality of the audio on this one however

49
00:01:40,828 --> 00:01:44,219
that being said Nate was a great guest

50
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,048
and I had a really fun time sitting down

51
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,530
with him so I hope you enjoy the content

52
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:52,649

76
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:51,100
bit about how you got into growing

77
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,330
cannabis originally um yeah I have to

78
00:02:51,099 --> 00:02:57,460
think about that the you know it's it's

79
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:59,350
you know we're grateful for for where

80
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,379
it's come to now you know just to being

81
00:02:59,349 --> 00:03:03,909
in a place like this you know out here

82
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:05,829
in public with it you know amazing

83
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,750
beautiful stores you know or our

84
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:11,350
products displayed on the shelves and

85
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:14,770
you know on TV screens and and you know

86
00:03:11,349 --> 00:03:17,349
just to have the sort of environment to

87
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,700
be able to showcase you know the work

88
00:03:17,349 --> 00:03:21,189
that we're doing at gold leaf gardens

89
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:25,079
and and polarised racks and lyric ana

90
00:03:21,189 --> 00:03:27,250
gars it's just it's a long long

91
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,969
unimaginable way away from from you know

92
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:32,889
the the dingy five foot high basements

93
00:03:30,969 --> 00:03:36,430
that we were starting off in you know a

94
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:40,029
decade ago but you know here we are so

95
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:42,250
now let's talk about when we met so when

96
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,680
I met you it was working in

97
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,219
collaboration on a potential project a

98
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,480
friend I was looking to set up and you

99
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:52,930
at the time

100
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:56,769
100 light facility yeah on the medical

101
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,300
side you were running and so I can you

102
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,969
talk a little bit about that probably

103
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:02,350
yeah you know I mean I'm gonna skip over

104
00:04:00,969 --> 00:04:05,560
a lot of details but you know kind of

105
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:08,579
starting from just the early grassroots

106
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,959
cooperative patient to patient care

107
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,300
provider model here in Washington State

108
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,909
you know one person growing for a couple

109
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:18,970
of patients in their basement we you

110
00:04:15,909 --> 00:04:20,560
know sort of moved from there into you

111
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,330
know opening our own dispensary where we

112
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,569
worked with a collective of growers and

113
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:28,839
a larger collective patients eventually

114
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:32,110
that we outgrew our home grow operations

115
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:34,000
and moved into our first warehouse which

116
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:36,520
like you said was about a hundred light

117
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,699
warehouse and that was a that was a big

118
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,109
step you know at the time you know

119
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,250
Washington state laws were still a

120
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:47,250
little bit ambiguous we were taking a

121
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:50,649
you know sort of progressive

122
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:54,759
interpretation of the laws and and you

123
00:04:50,649 --> 00:04:56,529
know that point you know nobody knew you

124
00:04:54,759 --> 00:04:59,228
know day in day out if you were gonna

125
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:00,759
get shut down and everything seized or

126
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:04,800
if you were positioning yourself to

127
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:07,329
become part of this burgeoning you know

128
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,780
legal markets that was uh that was

129
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:14,289
beginning to to become you know

130
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:16,359
legalized so so I think we met at that

131
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:18,819
time we were we were looking at how we

132
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:22,530
were going to transition from this the

133
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:26,550
medical days the medical model into the

134
00:05:22,529 --> 00:05:31,209
recreational model and and everybody was

135
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:34,870
ambitious and the future was you know

136
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:37,060
very optimistic and and there's a lot of

137
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:39,490
big money going around to finance very

138
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,050
large ambitious projects so we were I

139
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:43,360
think we were working on something that

140
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:45,850
you know was probably 10 times as big as

141
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,740
we ended up landing it with you know but

142
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:50,710
um the best thing that happened from

143
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:52,569
that was really meeting you we were

144
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:56,109
beginning to come into our own as

145
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:59,139
organic growers you know sort of

146
00:05:56,110 --> 00:06:01,210
following that path from just you know

147
00:05:59,139 --> 00:06:03,818
figuring it out on our own to

148
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:05,620
you know starting to realize that was

149
00:06:03,819 --> 00:06:07,840
the direction that produced the best

150
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:10,060
products and was most in line with our

151
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:12,728
values but we didn't really know what

152
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:15,250
we're doing all right so tell me a

153
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:17,258
little bit more about how you learn how

154
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:18,189
to grow yeah time you know back then

155
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:20,949
there wasn't a lot of information

156
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:22,660
available what was your what was your

157
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,340
source of information what is yeah well

158
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,189
there was not a lot of information and

159
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:28,538
there's a lot of misinformation you know

160
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:30,098
you know at the time we were you know

161
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:33,728
nervous about even logging on to

162
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:35,918
computers a search for for info I mean

163
00:06:33,728 --> 00:06:37,538
it all felt that illicit so we would go

164
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:39,579
I remember I'd go to the they used

165
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:41,918
bookstores and get these old tattered

166
00:06:39,579 --> 00:06:47,288
copies of you know and Rosenthal book

167
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:48,909
how to grow cannabis and we you know

168
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,769
there's a small network of people that

169
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,380
you know we would we would share ideas

170
00:06:50,769 --> 00:06:55,810
about what worked or what didn't and and

171
00:06:53,379 --> 00:06:57,848
then there was you know the the local

172
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:02,168
hydroponic store which was sort of this

173
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:05,408
you know hub of where growers would go

174
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:08,079
and and you know cross-pollinate ideas

175
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:09,370
and you know yeah ironically you

176
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:11,050
couldn't tell anybody what you were

177
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,280
growing but everybody knew and you sort

178
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:16,180
of had this little dance you had to play

179
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:18,459
but I mean I remember I would I was so

180
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,750
you know I would I try everything you

181
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:21,758
know I would literally if there was a

182
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:25,509
new product on the shelf that offered to

183
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:29,110
boost my yields or boost my my flavors

184
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:32,348
or or fix my mites or anything I mean we

185
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:33,009
I think I tried everything and that was

186
00:07:32,348 --> 00:07:36,129
about the time I

187
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:38,288
I ran to keep it simple which was the

188
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:39,819
exact opposite philosophy I had I was

189
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:41,800
keeping it complicated but well it's

190
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:44,079
because we had completely different

191
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,449
upbringings yeah in ways that we ended

192
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:48,158
up around cannabis so for me I had no

193
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:49,288
experience with the plant I grew up with

194
00:07:48,158 --> 00:07:51,118
my parents owning and

195
00:07:49,288 --> 00:07:53,848
in landscaping business so I was around

196
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:58,559
plants you know my entire life but never

197
00:07:53,848 --> 00:08:00,028
cannabis so for me I I'd never been to a

198
00:07:58,559 --> 00:08:01,619
hydro shop the first time I walked into

199
00:08:00,028 --> 00:08:03,329
Hydra shop I was like what are all these

200
00:08:01,619 --> 00:08:05,639
products and it was it was really

201
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:08,459
intimidating for me I had never seen you

202
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:10,710
know fertilizer was like a bag with a

203
00:08:08,459 --> 00:08:12,658
label there were no three numbers on it

204
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:14,489
yeah and three numbers there was no like

205
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:17,879
hot chick in a bikini

206
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:19,468
yeah these fake monster plants and I've

207
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,710
never seen the word bud so much in my

208
00:08:19,468 --> 00:08:23,879
life

209
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:27,299
yeah but I I was my dad's and my mom

210
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,819
sold their nursery and leased the land

211
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,408
out to the company they sold it to and

212
00:08:29,819 --> 00:08:32,969
when they did that my dad decide you

213
00:08:31,408 --> 00:08:35,968
want to start a compost tea business so

214
00:08:32,969 --> 00:08:37,979
this was like way back in like 1999 when

215
00:08:35,969 --> 00:08:41,699
that whole industry was just starting

216
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,319
out with dr. Ingham and so he had this

217
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:45,208
this compost tea business that was going

218
00:08:43,318 --> 00:08:46,559
and we I came back from Australia and

219
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:48,419
started helping him out and he'd get

220
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:50,969
these phone calls from guys to be like

221
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:54,389
yeah I got you know 20 tomato plants in

222
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:55,860
my basement and it took me a little

223
00:08:54,389 --> 00:08:57,778
while you know I was like how these guys

224
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:59,039
really like their pasta sauce so I

225
00:08:57,778 --> 00:09:00,809
figured out what they were actually

226
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:02,939
growing and I started googling compost

227
00:09:00,809 --> 00:09:04,919
tea and found some forums online but

228
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,850
even with the forums you know you're

229
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:08,549
right there was a lot of misinformation

230
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:12,000
I mean there still is but on top of that

231
00:09:08,549 --> 00:09:14,399
it did feel a little holistic it was a

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,870
little scary you know when yeah what

233
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,620
direction the industry was heading and

234
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:22,409
then like you said we met and at that

235
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:25,139
time I had been working and learning

236
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:27,899
about soils and just getting into

237
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:30,448
cannabis myself and started working with

238
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:32,188
giant Palmer you know you know in

239
00:09:30,448 --> 00:09:34,469
regards to testing out different soil

240
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:38,849
recipes and seeing how we could grow the

241
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:42,509
plant more organically and without all

242
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:43,870
of these other products and so Jaya was

243
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:46,059
really instrumental in that

244
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,980
and it was it was quite a journey you

245
00:09:46,059 --> 00:09:50,319
know it was it was a lot of fun getting

246
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,700
to learn about an entirely new plant and

247
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,690
learning how to grow indoors it's

248
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:56,770
totally different than growing outdoors

249
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:59,280
and and and the higher value of the crop

250
00:09:56,769 --> 00:10:01,990
sort of allows you to to really

251
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,459
experiment with inputs that I you know

252
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:04,899
just don't make sense if you're if

253
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,850
you're actually growing tomatoes or

254
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:08,799
you're growing you know cabbage or

255
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,899
something and so I think it kind of

256
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:12,969
opens up the whole of the realm of like

257
00:10:10,899 --> 00:10:15,279
you know well if we can absorb these

258
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,860
these input cause you know we know how

259
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:21,000
to really maximize this plant you know a

260
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:22,930
10% yield in a cannabis harvest you know

261
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,879
could be thousands and thousands of

262
00:10:22,929 --> 00:10:27,639
dollars right and so so you're think

263
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:31,570
that's part of what drives that the

264
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:34,919
cannabis nutrient market of you know

265
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:38,560
trying to always sell you more and more

266
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:42,729
some of which works and yeah what's does

267
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:44,169
it yeah it's right at all when we

268
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,639
originally were working on the soils

269
00:10:44,169 --> 00:10:48,549
that I thought was really interesting

270
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:51,189
was the goal initially was not a

271
00:10:48,549 --> 00:10:53,859
commercial application it was to create

272
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,360
a product where a cancer patient or a

273
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,039
medical patient could walk into a Hydra

274
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,870
shop and rather than getting hit with

275
00:10:57,039 --> 00:11:00,909
all of these you know bottles and

276
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:02,740
nutrient lines and this craziness they

277
00:11:00,909 --> 00:11:04,449
could just take a bag of soil and walk

278
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,700
out the door and water their plan and

279
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:08,440
then Jaya was able to start figuring out

280
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,670
some of these commercial applications on

281
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,020
scale which is sort of when we met you

282
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,939
and you were doing some of our first

283
00:11:11,019 --> 00:11:14,740
trials too with the product uh-huh and I

284
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,120
know there was a learning curve there

285
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,710
and like some you know it didn't work

286
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:21,450
quite as well as you wanted initially

287
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:24,730
yeah but well I mean we were skeptical

288
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:29,770
just because you know it was such a

289
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:32,710
different thought process than what we

290
00:11:29,769 --> 00:11:34,990
had been sort of accustomed to in terms

291
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,620
of buying a lot of bottles of you know

292
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,460
off the shelf we had a I think you you

293
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,669
know you remember we had a really

294
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:46,060
complicated recipe yeah you had this

295
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:47,709
this piece of paper I remember yeah five

296
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:49,389
milliliters of this and three

297
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,920
milliliters at this on the fourth day

298
00:11:49,389 --> 00:11:53,338
and then

299
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:54,809
eight algorithm you know I was insane it

300
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:56,550
was the craziest nutrient I've ever seen

301
00:11:54,809 --> 00:11:58,679
and your plants look great like yeah you

302
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,879
know you guys were really good growers

303
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,649
and I think that's an important aspect

304
00:11:59,879 --> 00:12:03,689
of well I think you know what was

305
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:06,089
happening because it was you know we

306
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,800
were successful I mean at the time you

307
00:12:06,089 --> 00:12:09,920
know and you know you couldn't tell me

308
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:14,849
that I wasn't growing the best cannabis

309
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:19,649
then which I wasn't

310
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,000
but yeah the you know we had so many

311
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,259
things going I mean I would talk to all

312
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,078
these people and they'd say oh that you

313
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:26,970
know the secret ingredient is

314
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,219
you know roots accelerator the secret

315
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:32,220
ingredient is this bud booster or this

316
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,899
and that so I would you know my logic

317
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:35,670
was well if I take everybody secret

318
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:40,019
ingredients and it's just gonna have to

319
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:42,028
be awesome right yeah and and but it's

320
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:44,100
you end up coming out with like you know

321
00:12:42,028 --> 00:12:45,240
pretty good results but because we

322
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,430
weren't very scientific about it we

323
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,440
couldn't tell you what it was that was

324
00:12:47,429 --> 00:12:51,569
leading to that right and what was just

325
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,459
more things we're buying I know I was

326
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,890
spending a lot of money I had a very

327
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:59,069
complicated recipe well there's a lot of

328
00:12:55,889 --> 00:13:01,259
redundancy and as you taught me

329
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:03,930
there's a lot of bottles of things I was

330
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:06,120
greatly overpaying for because you know

331
00:13:03,929 --> 00:13:08,669
it might have been them now now I look

332
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,169
back it's you know guano's suspended in

333
00:13:08,669 --> 00:13:11,578
water but it's you know fifty dollars a

334
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:13,469
bottle instead of you know the dry

335
00:13:11,578 --> 00:13:15,208
inputs you give I four dollars of

336
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:17,040
dollars of at least five of the bottles

337
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:22,169
you had had the same seaweed product and

338
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:25,159
right yeah yeah for sure so let's talk a

339
00:13:22,169 --> 00:13:29,559
little bit about that transition so you

340
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:32,240
did some trials with living soils and

341
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:34,669
decided to commit your new facility to

342
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,159
that method of growing with the goal of

343
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:39,409
reusing the soil you know cycle after

344
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:41,449
cycle with minimal amending amending

345
00:13:39,409 --> 00:13:43,069
yeah can you talk a little bit about

346
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:44,450
what your facility looks like now and

347
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,100
how you set it up yeah

348
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,379
well I remember when I was you know kind

349
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,420
of modeling out the the new facility

350
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:53,990
which was you know more than twice as

351
00:13:50,419 --> 00:13:56,689
large you know just taking our nutrient

352
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,480
costs and putting on paper taking the

353
00:13:56,690 --> 00:14:02,390
way we were doing things you know ended

354
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,759
up being very expensive and I was

355
00:14:02,389 --> 00:14:08,179
starting to have to think about you know

356
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:09,379
the scalability of our processes and and

357
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:11,569
it was really opportune you know when I

358
00:14:09,379 --> 00:14:14,409
met you and Jaya and and you said you

359
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:16,850
know here's this you know here's this

360
00:14:14,409 --> 00:14:19,909
way of growing plants which is going to

361
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,440
require you know which is gonna let the

362
00:14:19,909 --> 00:14:25,159
plants dictate what they need and

363
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:26,630
instead of as much you know you know as

364
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:28,100
much of the growers you know

365
00:14:26,629 --> 00:14:31,309
manipulation of the of the you know

366
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,430
nutrient systems and and then that would

367
00:14:31,309 --> 00:14:36,500
allow us to you know 10 mm of plants

368
00:14:34,429 --> 00:14:37,879
right because you know we're you know in

369
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,379
a short period of time in a few years we

370
00:14:37,879 --> 00:14:41,720
went from you know a few dozen in our

371
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:43,549
basement to you know we have four or

372
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,100
five thousand in our garden anytime so

373
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:48,109
you know you can't do the same things

374
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,389
you can't give each plant that seemed to

375
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,279
have retention so so I think that's that

376
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,659
was you know you know we're the light

377
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:54,919
bulb started to go off but also as we

378
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,309
were going through these trials with

379
00:14:54,919 --> 00:15:00,349
sort of that as the end goal you know we

380
00:14:57,309 --> 00:15:02,159
realized we're growing some of the best

381
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:04,379
product better than we had been

382
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:06,389
you know and your yield wasn't

383
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:09,120
necessarily any larger at that time was

384
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:13,620
it you know I don't think it was you

385
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:15,240
know significantly larger but it wasn't

386
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:19,578
it wasn't worse

387
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:23,278
I would say the quality was was better

388
00:15:19,578 --> 00:15:25,729
and also to you know we just found the

389
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:28,318
overall health of our gardens began to

390
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,870
kind of just tack in a different

391
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:34,500
direction part of you know being very

392
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,480
hands-on with the nutrient regimen also

393
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,078
meant we're really hands-on with our

394
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:42,329
sort of our IPM program you know we're

395
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:45,059
using a lot of we're spraying a lot of

396
00:15:42,328 --> 00:15:47,719
things and treating the soils and

397
00:15:45,059 --> 00:15:49,768
treating things above the ground and and

398
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,879
running to a lot of problems you know

399
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,948
we'd have a you know I have a lot of

400
00:15:50,879 --> 00:15:55,528
issues and and once we sort of you know

401
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:57,299
really let the you know built a good

402
00:15:55,528 --> 00:16:00,318
living soil environment the plants

403
00:15:57,299 --> 00:16:03,359
became happier and I think their natural

404
00:16:00,318 --> 00:16:06,028
immunities began to be come fully

405
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:09,000
actualized and we just found ourselves

406
00:16:06,028 --> 00:16:11,639
fighting a lot less problems so I get a

407
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,129
lot of emails about blog post I put up

408
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,329
with actually a photo from your facility

409
00:16:14,129 --> 00:16:20,669
Rhian reusing soil so you use you've got

410
00:16:18,328 --> 00:16:22,919
you got a bunch of plastic pallets in it

411
00:16:20,669 --> 00:16:24,088
like blue plastic pallets which is great

412
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:25,889
because they're a lot easier to clean

413
00:16:24,089 --> 00:16:29,040
and you know they're not gonna harbor

414
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:31,740
disease like a wood pallet wood and then

415
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:33,688
you had a custom-built fabric pot I

416
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,730
believe made specifically for the

417
00:16:33,688 --> 00:16:37,349
pallets with the ID and then they're on

418
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,970
racks so they're raised up so you're not

419
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:40,259
bending over the whole time you talked a

420
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,850
little bit about like what because you

421
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:45,028
how many rooms how you have them set up

422
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:47,490
yeah so you know we have so our soil

423
00:16:45,028 --> 00:16:49,318
beds you know which might be kind of a

424
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,990
modified version of you know what you

425
00:16:49,318 --> 00:16:54,028
know you and I have kind of designed

426
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:56,339
there they sit on food-grade pallets and

427
00:16:54,028 --> 00:17:00,389
then on top of that we had a geo pot

428
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:02,459
design us a fabric bed that fits exactly

429
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:03,629
on that pallet you know part of a great

430
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,788
thing about pallets for anybody

431
00:17:03,629 --> 00:17:07,890
designing a large facility is there you

432
00:17:05,788 --> 00:17:11,109
know a lot of material handling options

433
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,980
you know warehouses house pallets

434
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:14,719
forklifts everything certain knows how

435
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,009
to their affordable you're not eating

436
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,630
the wheel you're not recreating the

437
00:17:16,009 --> 00:17:22,068
wheel exactly so we kind of use that as

438
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:26,089
our standard you know unit and from

439
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:28,188
there we have a soil bed with with with

440
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:31,279
you know kiss soil that we reimagine

441
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:33,919
we'd ever throw it out and and in each

442
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,418
bed we'll plant six plants and then

443
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:39,500
they'll have sort of a independent

444
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:42,440
trellis system per bed so we'll we'll

445
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:45,230
use you know sort of a scrog type of

446
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:47,659
training - for those same six plants

447
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,038
that share that bed and that trellis so

448
00:17:47,659 --> 00:17:50,780
you're you that's just for your flower

449
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:52,429
room so your vegging in a separate room

450
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:54,379
in smaller containers yes and

451
00:17:52,429 --> 00:17:57,350
transplanting into the beds for their

452
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:59,270
final yeah so so we have one room that's

453
00:17:57,349 --> 00:18:00,649
you know one the four hundred square

454
00:17:59,269 --> 00:18:03,048
foot room that's dedicated to all of our

455
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:05,720
propagation they'll spend a couple weeks

456
00:18:03,048 --> 00:18:07,730
in there in smaller plastic pots and

457
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:10,100
then they'll move into one of our seven

458
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:14,960
production rooms each room has 50 beds

459
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:17,480
and we'll plant six plants per bed and

460
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,130
then from you know sir well 300 plants

461
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,659
and then um and then they'll live the

462
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:23,330
rest of their life cycle in that room

463
00:18:20,659 --> 00:18:25,010
for about we'll give it about a week of

464
00:18:23,329 --> 00:18:26,538
transition time in that room just

465
00:18:25,009 --> 00:18:28,579
because they're going under something

466
00:18:26,538 --> 00:18:31,548
more intense lighting we found that

467
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:34,639
that's a good amount of time and also

468
00:18:31,548 --> 00:18:36,710
when we harvest we try to turn that room

469
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,809
over and get plants in there within a

470
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,610
day okay so for for reusing soil you

471
00:18:41,808 --> 00:18:46,129
know we had to really figure out how we

472
00:18:43,609 --> 00:18:48,229
can thread the needle harvest our plants

473
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,450
get our inputs back into the soil

474
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:52,460
transplant in there within 24 hours

475
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,870
I remember move it into the next floor

476
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,429
so you're first doing that yeah we have

477
00:18:53,869 --> 00:18:56,629
to play around out a lot you know we

478
00:18:55,429 --> 00:18:57,830
were trying to put all the nutrients

479
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:59,510
back in right at the beginning of the

480
00:18:57,829 --> 00:19:01,460
cycle and it was just causing this tool

481
00:18:59,509 --> 00:19:04,548
to heat up from the amount of microbial

482
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,288
activity was going on so what you guys

483
00:19:04,548 --> 00:19:08,470
sort of figured out was okay we can put

484
00:19:06,288 --> 00:19:10,730
some nutrients back in then and some

485
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,829
organic matter but then we'll also top

486
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:15,679
dress nutrients yeah throughout the

487
00:19:12,829 --> 00:19:18,589
cycle and to to allow that to allow you

488
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,909
to get that immediate 24 hour return

489
00:19:18,589 --> 00:19:22,139
when you could start planting back in

490
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,180
yeah it's really you know

491
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,670
you know if you have that downtime to

492
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,529
let that those nutrients you know heat

493
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:31,740
up and cook in there you know you lose

494
00:19:28,529 --> 00:19:33,690
that production time so you know and and

495
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,099
if we sort of load it up the soil all

496
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:36,509
the way and transplanted we notice

497
00:19:35,099 --> 00:19:38,699
there's a lot of transplants stress so

498
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,170
we found you know we we re amend a

499
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,809
little lighter and then we'll use top

500
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:44,220
dressings and water in a few things and

501
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,899
you know put some things into the

502
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:49,110
compost tea as we brew them so that they

503
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:50,160
can be integrated into the plants life

504
00:19:49,109 --> 00:19:51,869
cycle throughout so you're not just

505
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,250
doing water you're doing other things we

506
00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:56,309
do other things yeah a lot of compost

507
00:19:53,250 --> 00:20:00,029
tea some some foliar applications you

508
00:19:56,309 --> 00:20:01,559
know you know micronutrients and and

509
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:04,259
some you know like some top dressing as

510
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,639
well and you're always experimenting

511
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,319
with new things that's one of the things

512
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,300
that I really like to encourage with

513
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:10,589
growers and one thing that you and I you

514
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,450
always tell me too is you're always

515
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:14,039
trying out new things and seeing how

516
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:15,720
they do with a control and I think

517
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:18,659
that's the important aspect of it yeah

518
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:21,299
you can actually see is this one change

519
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:23,430
making an improvement or is it making

520
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:24,809
things worse is it worth the amount of

521
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,310
time and money I'm gonna spend on yeah

522
00:20:24,809 --> 00:20:29,129
and that and you know one nice things

523
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:32,669
about you know growing at scale with a

524
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:34,590
lot more plants a lot more beds

525
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:38,250
everything being uniform the rooms all

526
00:20:34,589 --> 00:20:41,250
being uniform is that it allows you to

527
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:43,049
dedicate you know small amount of you

528
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:45,720
know your canopy to these experiments

529
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:47,430
without really impacting your overall

530
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:50,039
production as much you know if you're

531
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,810
you know when we only had you know when

532
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,509
I was only growing 15 plants if I wanted

533
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,220
to try something 2 to 5 plants you know

534
00:20:54,509 --> 00:20:57,509
enough for a decent sample size and it

535
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,980
didn't work out you know it really

536
00:20:57,509 --> 00:21:01,799
impacts you now if we wanted to try and

537
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:04,349
experiment to one or two beds you know

538
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,509
if they maybe don't get quite the

539
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:08,539
returns or the the results we wanted you

540
00:21:06,509 --> 00:21:10,920
know we're still able to absorb that so

541
00:21:08,539 --> 00:21:13,099
you know it's hopefully leading to

542
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:16,920
improvement year over year I think yeah

543
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:18,629
so one of the so one of the challenges

544
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,930
with the style of growing they're doing

545
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,510
with reusing the soil is the fact that

546
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:26,299
you're not able to

547
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:30,529
fully sterilized the soil or clean the

548
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:32,480
media and so insects and diseases are I

549
00:21:30,529 --> 00:21:33,500
think you're at higher risk for some of

550
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,110
these things and that's one of the

551
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,789
criticisms that I hear from traditional

552
00:21:36,109 --> 00:21:39,859
agriculture and horticulture with the

553
00:21:37,789 --> 00:21:41,509
style of growing can you talk a little

554
00:21:39,859 --> 00:21:43,490
bit about some of the ways that you guys

555
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:47,599
deal with that and what you've you know

556
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:50,140
some of your experiences um I actually I

557
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:52,969
want to ask you a question about that

558
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:54,590
but the you know so I mean you know an

559
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,079
outdoor farm you know in a greenhouse

560
00:21:54,589 --> 00:22:00,319
per se unless they're in containers you

561
00:21:57,079 --> 00:22:02,929
know they're also not you know removing

562
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:06,799
the entire field right I mean this seems

563
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:11,860
to be something in respects to a you

564
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:15,079
know a container type of system indoors

565
00:22:11,859 --> 00:22:16,699
you know I guess you know overwintering

566
00:22:15,079 --> 00:22:18,529
outside we don't have that going on

567
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:23,000
indoors so yes there is definitely that

568
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:28,160
issue but yeah that is a challenge you

569
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:29,539
know I think that we don't have the we

570
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,100
don't wipe the slate clean in between

571
00:22:29,539 --> 00:22:33,500
rounds where everything's removed and

572
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,089
sterilized and started over that being

573
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,599
said you do keep your facility very

574
00:22:35,089 --> 00:22:41,539
clean yeah absolutely yeah you're you

575
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:43,669
know disinfecting the room just not the

576
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:45,500
soil and the beds themselves right I

577
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,450
think that's important it's not it's not

578
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,099
messy when you go into gold leaf you

579
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:50,690
know yeah I mean as much as you know

580
00:22:49,099 --> 00:22:53,629
being able to have soil you know it's

581
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:55,130
not like a laboratory level hydroponics

582
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:58,970
facility like some of them I I've been

583
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:02,210
into we still have we're still trying to

584
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:04,430
promote a very you know environment that

585
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,680
or you know life is proliferated and and

586
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,450
you know encouraged you know on the soil

587
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:12,860
level

588
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:14,240
you know robust you know microbial

589
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:17,689
environments you know around the leaf

590
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,299
surfaces as well so you know sterile is

591
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:22,720
definitely not our end goal at any point

592
00:23:20,299 --> 00:23:24,909
but but cleanliness is is important

593
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,920
absolutely

594
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:30,880
but with with you know with you know

595
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:34,460
perpetually you reusing your soil

596
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:37,130
it does force you to you know really

597
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:40,370
think about your environment the

598
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:41,929
sustainability of it over time and your

599
00:23:40,369 --> 00:23:45,079
modes of your modes of pest management

600
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:48,740
you know you can't you know you can't

601
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:51,500
apply any type of product that's also

602
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,960
going to damage the the beneficial

603
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,909
you know microbes and insects in your

604
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,548
environment so you know we use a lot of

605
00:23:55,909 --> 00:24:01,580
beneficial insects for example and you

606
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:05,119
know a horticultural spray that's meant

607
00:24:01,579 --> 00:24:06,678
to knock knock out pathogenic insects is

608
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:09,168
also going to kill our good guys and so

609
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:11,690
we have to you know you know what I

610
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:16,009
think you know we're ultimately working

611
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:22,130
towards is is just the the right balance

612
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:23,480
of you know biology and our rooms you

613
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:25,159
know you're never going to eradicate

614
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:27,399
something all the way but you're gonna

615
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:29,028
you're gonna keep it under under control

616
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:32,750
to where there's a good economic

617
00:24:29,028 --> 00:24:33,919
threshold and you know and when you kind

618
00:24:32,750 --> 00:24:35,480
of have the right pieces in place you

619
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,038
find that you know the gardens would

620
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,880
sort of tend to themself and do is

621
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:39,980
Mother Nature

622
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:41,899
you know intended well when you compare

623
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,940
it to outdoor so the thing about being

624
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:47,329
outdoors in the field is you can still

625
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,038
get you know this these pathogens where

626
00:24:47,329 --> 00:24:51,139
they you know overpopulate they're

627
00:24:49,038 --> 00:24:52,759
always around just like they are in an

628
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,679
indoor facility people that say there

629
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:56,960
might free over there I just I don't

630
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,840
believe in you I think that's really

631
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:02,120
really hard to achieve and maintain but

632
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:05,778
I think you are able to maintain them at

633
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:07,158
a low enough level through a good IPM

634
00:25:05,778 --> 00:25:09,470
program to where they are very

635
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:11,750
manageable yeah and having those

636
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:13,429
beneficial insects there I think is huge

637
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:15,710
in protecting the plant and having good

638
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:18,000
microbiology in the soil you know on the

639
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,829
leaf surface and

640
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,690
the thing about outdoors that's so nice

641
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:23,699
is you have that diversity of predators

642
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:25,200
that already are naturalized to that

643
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,509
environment and indoors you just don't

644
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,160
have that so I think the ability for

645
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:31,170
these pests are really proliferate

646
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:33,180
across a mono crop in an indoor

647
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:35,310
environment is a lot greater and when we

648
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:36,810
talk about greenhouses or like

649
00:25:35,309 --> 00:25:37,950
horticultural operations I've gotten to

650
00:25:36,809 --> 00:25:41,369
see more and more of those over the

651
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:43,710
years they are running you know they may

652
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:45,419
have a thousand different you know a

653
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,220
different varieties of plants and things

654
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:49,080
that all have different insects and pest

655
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:50,940
problems so they feel like the only

656
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:54,779
solution is to spray some pretty heavy

657
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:56,430
pesticides and sterilize everything but

658
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,930
well yeah with the been you know whether

659
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,840
like for example our beneficial insects

660
00:25:57,930 --> 00:26:01,980
and we found you know I think

661
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,750
everybody's still trying to learn how to

662
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:05,400
you know these worlds converge mean

663
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:06,809
cannabis is so you so new but you know

664
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,640
we found that some things that work on

665
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,740
you know other crops for that same path

666
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,570
just aren't really taking hold you know

667
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,180
developing breeding populations and

668
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:18,509
things in in our rooms and so it becomes

669
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:19,980
sort of economically unviable they keep

670
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:22,799
using them yeah I found other things

671
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:24,809
that just sort of take root and get

672
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,250
established and just become part of the

673
00:26:24,809 --> 00:26:30,299
you know the environment and you know so

674
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:32,190
that's that's just been a lot of

675
00:26:30,299 --> 00:26:36,089
experimentation you know yeah well do

676
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:37,680
you have a favorite a favorite insect or

677
00:26:36,089 --> 00:26:39,240
what I like to add your room that you

678
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:43,140
wanted to share with listeners you know

679
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:45,180
I mean I the Rove beetles right you know

680
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:48,090
they're a little expensive on the front

681
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,740
end but we you know III don't know

682
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:52,619
remember the last time we reintroduced

683
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:54,180
them but if you scooped up a handful of

684
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:55,709
our soil or I mean they even crawl they

685
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,299
crawl everywhere you find them you know

686
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:59,610
all over your facility well you have

687
00:26:57,299 --> 00:27:01,079
them in the in the only compost - how

688
00:26:59,609 --> 00:27:04,439
are they coming in for lowly compos okay

689
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,539
so yeah yeah and so you know those you

690
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:09,150
know they seem like apex predators as

691
00:27:06,539 --> 00:27:11,099
far as you know that you know bugs go

692
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:12,390
and so you know I think you know

693
00:27:11,099 --> 00:27:15,119
definitely if you don't have those

694
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:17,430
established in your organic soil

695
00:27:15,119 --> 00:27:18,099
facility you know those those are those

696
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:22,779
are

697
00:27:18,099 --> 00:27:25,919
good partners that have in there but but

698
00:27:22,779 --> 00:27:30,399
yeah and and just being very

699
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:31,779
prophylactic and proactive right I think

700
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,259
kind of wheeling it back to those early

701
00:27:31,779 --> 00:27:39,069
days it was get a problem look for a

702
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:40,629
solution try it doesn't work go to a

703
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:44,079
bigger gun until your present the

704
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:46,540
nuclear option and and and now you know

705
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:49,599
you have to be extremely cognizant about

706
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:51,700
not letting a problem you know flare-up

707
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:53,619
so you're constantly screening your

708
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:55,690
rooms are looking constantly screening

709
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:58,389
your rooms and you know one of the

710
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:00,940
hardest disciplines I think is to for

711
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:03,670
example spend money on on IPM for

712
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:05,980
problems you don't have right and yet

713
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,570
it's you know when you go back and study

714
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:09,549
all of you know I'm you know your notes

715
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:10,899
you realize you spend much more once you

716
00:28:09,549 --> 00:28:12,909
have a problem and you have to fight it

717
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,980
that's a really good point and so and

718
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:16,360
then you you don't even think twice

719
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,400
about staying the money you have to do

720
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:20,169
it it's crop loss or it's been you know

721
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,780
hundreds or thousands of dollars on a

722
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:24,610
solution so you know when things are

723
00:28:22,779 --> 00:28:26,889
going well you know it seems a little

724
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:28,899
hard to say oh I really have to you know

725
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:30,850
be disciplined in order my you know

726
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,320
hundreds of dollars of beneficial

727
00:28:30,849 --> 00:28:34,359
insects and keep introducing them in the

728
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:37,149
room but then you realize we haven't had

729
00:28:34,359 --> 00:28:39,759
a problem in six months or three months

730
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:42,160
and and and so you know I need to keep

731
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:45,759
up with that you know and I think that

732
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:47,800
once you're able to get from a you know

733
00:28:45,759 --> 00:28:50,319
sort of a knockdown or a combative you

734
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:52,539
know yeah cycle into more of a

735
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:55,089
maintenance cycle that's when you know

736
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:59,589
again it actually does get much easier

737
00:28:55,089 --> 00:29:01,000
and you know so less stressful less

738
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:02,679
stressful yes you got you got to keep

739
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,700
you got to keep investing in that part

740
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,720
of your Gardens if you're if you're

741
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,460
gonna especially are going to be you

742
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:10,660
know uh reusing soil you know keeping

743
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,700
some other plans that are you know never

744
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,750
never clearing out your mother room so

745
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:16,900
you're always gonna have you know some

746
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:18,849
some plant there so so there's there's

747
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:22,269
so many aspects to cultivation besides

748
00:29:18,849 --> 00:29:23,619
just growing the plants one of the

749
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:26,440
things that you and I have talked about

750
00:29:23,619 --> 00:29:27,129
more recently is the whole idea around

751
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,190
lean far

752
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:32,230
oh yeah and I know you have a lot of

753
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:36,120
experience with lean manufacturing and

754
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:38,349
then I was like read this book yeah and

755
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:39,699
you've sort of embraced that and your

756
00:29:38,349 --> 00:29:41,439
facility Lobeck he talked a little bit

757
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,910
about that experience well yeah I

758
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,259
wouldn't I don't know if I would he

759
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:45,519
might be giving me too much credit I've

760
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:46,839
always been you know interested in the

761
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:48,339
subject and you know just always

762
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:50,918
thinking about you know running running

763
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:53,819
a production business you know looking

764
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:56,440
for for the right strategies you know I

765
00:29:53,819 --> 00:29:59,950
I've always you know been very

766
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:02,890
interested in how how to sort of take

767
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:04,298
that these methods that work you know

768
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:06,700
I've given you know like Toyota this

769
00:30:04,298 --> 00:30:09,099
great advantage over its rivals and yeah

770
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,450
and apply that but I always had a hard

771
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,548
time connecting the dots you know it

772
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:14,409
always kind of thought the ideas made

773
00:30:12,548 --> 00:30:16,960
sense on paper and so when he gave me

774
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:18,850
that book by Ben Artman I was like there

775
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,409
it is you know somebody somebody smarter

776
00:30:18,849 --> 00:30:22,480
than me finally connected the dots and

777
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:23,860
I've been you know so we've been going

778
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:27,940
through a process at our place of

779
00:30:23,859 --> 00:30:31,149
removing waste you know and then just

780
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:35,519
really analyzing doing a lot of deep

781
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:39,009
reflection on on every step every touch

782
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,139
is it necessary does it add value or

783
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:42,548
does it not and it's amazing once you

784
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,870
sort of take inventory of that you know

785
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:45,639
how many things you do in a day that

786
00:30:43,869 --> 00:30:47,389
aren't adding value to you know to your

787
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,190
customer at the end of the day

788
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:52,490
and you say why are you doing it you

789
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:54,350
know and so it's it's a transfer

790
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,150
transformation process that I think is

791
00:30:54,349 --> 00:30:58,669
gonna be going on for a long time but I

792
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:01,940
you know I think it's it's really the

793
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:05,330
right direction especially as this

794
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:08,090
industry becomes highly competitive you

795
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:09,798
know now you know the the prices of

796
00:31:08,089 --> 00:31:11,269
cannabis here in Washington State and

797
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:16,160
you know from what we've seen in other

798
00:31:11,269 --> 00:31:18,470
states you know are falling getting much

799
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:21,710
closer to you know representing their

800
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:25,490
manufacturing costs not you know this

801
00:31:21,710 --> 00:31:27,289
sort of artifact of what they used to

802
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:30,440
cost in the medical market or on the

803
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:34,190
street before yeah you know I mean we

804
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,200
grow some of the you know highest in

805
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:39,019
cannabis in this market but you know an

806
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,819
eighth of our flour doesn't cost much

807
00:31:39,019 --> 00:31:43,519
more than what I was paying for you know

808
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:45,500
in college 20 years ago oh my god is

809
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:48,200
that work you know so you have to be

810
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,539
efficient and there's no rolling of fat

811
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:52,548
you're not taking that money home it's

812
00:31:50,539 --> 00:31:54,259
the government that's even worse that's

813
00:31:52,548 --> 00:31:56,750
the customers paying the same thing we

814
00:31:54,259 --> 00:32:00,169
were 20 years ago you know we get we get

815
00:31:56,750 --> 00:32:02,690
rid of that so yeah you know it's you

816
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:05,900
know it really you know I think if

817
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:09,200
you're not running a lean operation a

818
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,480
very smart operation then it's hard to

819
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,450
make money right now and I think I think

820
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:17,360
you know that's just the reality and so

821
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:19,759
yeah it is a slow process I've been

822
00:32:17,359 --> 00:32:22,909
doing it at my on my farm you know

823
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:24,319
getting the employees to work on paying

824
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,669
attention to what they're seeing around

825
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,399
you know how we can keep the property

826
00:32:25,669 --> 00:32:30,230
cleaner and how we can improve the our

827
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:32,030
processes because a lot of what we do is

828
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,980
just so time-consuming yeah and I know

829
00:32:32,029 --> 00:32:35,298
we I know we can do a better job and I

830
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,710
know we haven't even thought of all the

831
00:32:35,298 --> 00:32:38,900
ways we can do a better job so it's one

832
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,669
of those things it's not it's not so

833
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,530
much an end goal as it is just a journey

834
00:32:40,669 --> 00:32:45,020
right and I'm really I'm really enjoying

835
00:32:42,529 --> 00:32:48,230
it it's definitely changed the way we

836
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:49,730
run our farm and my and our business

837
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:52,579
and I'm glad that it's you know yeah

838
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:54,139
it's a Kaizen it's that that improvement

839
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:56,028
you know that 1% improvement you know

840
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:58,219
it's not you're never gonna get there

841
00:32:56,028 --> 00:33:00,138
they're just gonna try to constantly you

842
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:02,358
know carve away at what doesn't need to

843
00:33:00,138 --> 00:33:05,358
be there and aim towards this this

844
00:33:02,358 --> 00:33:08,599
purity of you know pure value right

845
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:10,099
which is more of a you know something to

846
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:13,128
aspire to then probably something you've

847
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:15,589
ever actually achieve but you know in

848
00:33:13,128 --> 00:33:17,269
that pursuit you end up becoming you

849
00:33:15,589 --> 00:33:20,808
know becoming better at what you do and

850
00:33:17,269 --> 00:33:22,548
yeah you know and and you know one of

851
00:33:20,808 --> 00:33:24,678
the one of the traps I think we've seen

852
00:33:22,548 --> 00:33:26,989
like in you know probably all farming

853
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:29,538
and it's starting to apply to cannabis

854
00:33:26,989 --> 00:33:31,249
is that you know one direction people

855
00:33:29,538 --> 00:33:34,569
take it is to just grow larger and

856
00:33:31,249 --> 00:33:36,919
larger yeah and yet you'll see

857
00:33:34,569 --> 00:33:40,339
large-scale operations that have taken

858
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,759
on a ton of debt to get there not

859
00:33:40,339 --> 00:33:46,368
necessarily being more profitable right

860
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:48,440
and that seems that seemed interesting

861
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:54,099
right where's that economy of scale but

862
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:56,509
I think you know these type of lean

863
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:59,599
methods can be applied to a very small

864
00:33:56,509 --> 00:34:00,798
operation or a large operation yeah but

865
00:33:59,599 --> 00:34:02,148
either way you need to you know you need

866
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:04,429
to be very disciplined about how you're

867
00:34:02,148 --> 00:34:06,378
running know for sure and I know for me

868
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:07,759
I've been a lot happier since we started

869
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:10,460
implementing this stuff because the

870
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:11,990
mental cost of all of this waste was

871
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:13,849
just weighing me down like walking

872
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:15,558
around and seeing project after project

873
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:17,838
that need to be completed or just mess

874
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:19,669
after mess that we left behind it's like

875
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:21,588
it was exhausting

876
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:24,440
yeah so just getting the stuff off the

877
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:27,078
property it was so nice yeah it's still

878
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,048
it's a constant battle yeah oh yeah it's

879
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:31,490
been great so changing directions we've

880
00:34:30,048 --> 00:34:34,909
been talking about cultivation so far

881
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:38,029
but as you well know that's just one one

882
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:40,369
aspect of cannabis cultivation I mean

883
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:42,200
there's you could be the best grower in

884
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:44,899
the world right now here in Washington

885
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:48,269
State and still be failing just because

886
00:34:44,898 --> 00:34:50,940
there's so much more to creating a brand

887
00:34:48,269 --> 00:34:53,369
and a market share and interest in your

888
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,490
product yeah and key I want to talk a

889
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:58,950
little bit about your sort of your

890
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:00,539
company philosophy and the morals that

891
00:34:58,949 --> 00:35:02,789
you guys stand for but before we do can

892
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:05,820
we talk a little bit about branding and

893
00:35:02,789 --> 00:35:08,550
marketing aspect of things right um yeah

894
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,140
you know I mean it's you know the if

895
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:11,760
everything's important now and you know

896
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:13,440
it's all tied together to those two

897
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,300
things are really close for you what you

898
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,710
guys are doing yeah absolutely you know

899
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,410
I mean I think we were a little bit

900
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:21,809
ahead of the curve in just realizing

901
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:23,879
that you know cannabis is gonna kind of

902
00:35:21,809 --> 00:35:28,019
turn from this sort of you know

903
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:30,030
anonymous you know anonymous commodity

904
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:32,340
to you know something that was gonna you

905
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:33,600
know look a lot more like like products

906
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:35,910
you see on the shelves in other

907
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,920
industries so you know kind of early on

908
00:35:35,909 --> 00:35:40,559
we stuck our neck out and came up with

909
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,320
the name gold leaf and started branding

910
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:44,549
our product and at the time and say the

911
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,369
Medical dispensaries you know you

912
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:49,470
usually go in it was kind of like a like

913
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:51,780
purchasing bulk supplies you know at you

914
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:54,000
know at an old general store you know

915
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:55,830
you have these jars and here's some some

916
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,500
strains you don't necessary know who

917
00:35:55,829 --> 00:36:01,108
grew them or anything like that yeah and

918
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:02,940
so we came out kind of with a jar with

919
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:04,769
our logo on it and it said you know this

920
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,059
is gold leaf weed you know this is you

921
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:09,030
know for better or worse this is this is

922
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:10,769
where it's coming from and um and so we

923
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,080
we kind of rode that into you know into

924
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:15,719
the the market and now of course that's

925
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,840
how all products are sold but it's it's

926
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:20,969
really important you know I think

927
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,440
because now in Washington for example

928
00:36:20,969 --> 00:36:24,569
you know all the products need to be

929
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:26,670
sealed and kept behind a you know

930
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:32,190
usually behind a glass counter behind

931
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:35,400
the bar so for the customers you need to

932
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:38,190
really develop a trust with them and and

933
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,510
so you know having strong you know

934
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,059
branding and marketing to kind of

935
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,940
reinforce that those company values is

936
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:46,690
is essential and

937
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:50,929
can be an incredible grower you can have

938
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:52,820
the most coveted strains and it can just

939
00:36:50,929 --> 00:36:56,389
fall flat for you because you don't have

940
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:57,980
that piece in place which yeah I know a

941
00:36:56,389 --> 00:36:59,539
lot of growers in Washington right now

942
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,179
our producer processors as they're

943
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:03,590
called here are struggling to get into

944
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:06,409
new stores and get their product so

945
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:08,210
whereas I know you guys can't even keep

946
00:37:06,409 --> 00:37:09,980
up right now with the number of stores

947
00:37:08,210 --> 00:37:11,720
and people that want you and want to

948
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:14,719
carry your product and a lot of that is

949
00:37:11,719 --> 00:37:18,049
due to customer demand people have come

950
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:21,439
this you know signify certain traits

951
00:37:18,050 --> 00:37:22,910
with the brand gold leaf and I think you

952
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:24,500
know I won't touch on that some more but

953
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:26,359
I think such a big part of that is

954
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,159
you're the culture you've created there

955
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,710
you know in the community that you guys

956
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:34,039
have and can you talk a little bit about

957
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:35,300
sort of so I know a little background

958
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:37,009
here it's kind of unfair but I know you

959
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:38,930
guys are for the started off like a

960
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:40,610
bunch of Hawaiian guys yeah coming out

961
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:42,889
of what Kauai I think you said yeah you

962
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:44,329
know I mean I'm from Oahu most of our

963
00:37:42,889 --> 00:37:48,049
you know all of our growers are from

964
00:37:44,329 --> 00:37:50,179
kawaii and okay yeah we you know we have

965
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,280
a we have a it's you know we kind of

966
00:37:50,179 --> 00:37:53,599
identify as a Hawaiian operation you

967
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,280
know obviously we have you know we have

968
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,239
all sorts of folks there but there's a

969
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,470
you know we embrace that spirit of Aloha

970
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:02,179
you know regardless of where you're born

971
00:38:00,469 --> 00:38:04,699
from or you know what your ethnicity is

972
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:08,119
it's it's that's our value at the end of

973
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,710
the day and you know you know what what

974
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,119
that what does that mean you know it the

975
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:14,990
word has a lot of different meanings but

976
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,869
it means love you know and and so just

977
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:19,369
from the love of the plant to you know

978

00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:26,840
and you know growing up in a you know

981
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:31,389
unique place like Hawaii you had a real

982
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:34,329
tight communities there was a social

983
00:38:31,389 --> 00:38:36,469
responsibility and that sort of you know

984
00:38:34,329 --> 00:38:40,130
manage how everybody interacted with

985
00:38:36,469 --> 00:38:41,239
each other and you know it just seems to

986
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:44,059
you know it's just how we live our life

987
00:38:41,239 --> 00:38:47,149
and and organic growing kind of falls in

988
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,889
line with that as well and so you know

989
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,410
that's that's sort of how we run our

990
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:53,420
think our company internally and it it

991
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,818
is struck a chord with with

992
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:57,920
pull up here you know yeah it sounds

993
00:38:55,818 --> 00:38:59,358
really you know it sounds cliche but you

994
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,909
know there's people want to know the

995
00:38:59,358 --> 00:39:03,889
story behind the brand and you know the

996
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:06,798
yeah I think it's important yeah it is

997
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:08,289
and it's not you know it I think there's

998
00:39:06,798 --> 00:39:12,079
substance to that you know I mean people

999
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:13,699
you know you you have this dollar in

1000
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,280
your wallet to spend and you can choose

1001
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:17,389
how you want to spend it you know

1002
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,849
there's some folks who hate give me the

1003
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:21,259
most potent weed for the cheapest amount

1004
00:39:19,849 --> 00:39:23,088
of money I can spend and we've you know

1005
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,740
there's nothing wrong with that but

1006
00:39:23,088 --> 00:39:26,599
that's not the customer that that seems

1007
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:28,189
to you know be supporting our business

1008
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,318
and you know there's other ones who say

1009
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:32,000
you know it's a good product but also

1010
00:39:30,318 --> 00:39:35,659
too I just love the way that you know

1011
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,969
you you guys you know run your business

1012
00:39:35,659 --> 00:39:41,118
you know are good responsible members of

1013
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:43,039
the community you give back you you grow

1014
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,869
things responsibly when you you know

1015
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:46,818
there's no rule that says you have to

1016
00:39:44,869 --> 00:39:49,338
but you know we know we trust we trust

1017
00:39:46,818 --> 00:39:52,929
your cultivation practices we know you

1018
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:55,279
take care of your your employees and and

1019
00:39:52,929 --> 00:39:57,588
so you know at the end of the day I mean

1020
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:59,750
that that adds up to to those those

1021
00:39:57,588 --> 00:40:02,029
those sales you know which is important

1022
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:05,000
so yeah and your guys are passionate

1023
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:07,190
about what they're doing I mean well you

1024
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,349
know so my growers you know and I got to

1025
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:11,150
give them credit because you know it it

1026
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:12,680
all starts with them I mean without them

1027
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,990
then the rest of business is you know

1028
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:16,399
there's no foundation and and they're

1029
00:40:14,989 --> 00:40:18,439
almost all you know brothers and cousins

1030
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,630
they grew up on this really you know on

1031
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:24,889
a farm in a really small town called

1032
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,990
Koloa an island of koi and you know they

1033
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:28,879
grew up growing vegetables you know

1034
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:30,229
sustenance farming they would sell there

1035
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,818
you know they go with their folks down

1036
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:33,289
to the farmers market and sell what they

1037
00:40:31,818 --> 00:40:34,489
didn't need and and you know that's

1038
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:36,679
that's where they came from where they

1039
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:38,239
were really relying on their land you

1040
00:40:36,679 --> 00:40:42,019
know to provide for their families and

1041
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:46,539
so you know now you know what they've

1042
00:40:42,019 --> 00:40:48,980
kind of you know migrated up here and

1043
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:50,690
you know the fact they're sort of able

1044
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,920
to do that but in this in this different

1045
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:55,670
market I think is something they're very

1046
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,108
very proud of and and it's and it you

1047
00:40:55,670 --> 00:40:58,789
know shows in the product you know but

1048
00:40:57,108 --> 00:41:02,659
but they take a certain pride in the

1049
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:04,750
gardens and I know this is a cultivation

1050
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:06,670
science podcast but you know

1051
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:09,429
just there's this one thing I haven't

1052
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:11,650
been able to to sort of like quantify

1053
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:13,690
scientifically and it's it's you know

1054
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:17,950
just as love and this passion for for

1055
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:20,920
being for your work and it just it it

1056
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:23,710
shows up in the flavor and it just shows

1057
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,420
up in in the the product at the end and

1058
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:26,650
so you know I don't know how to

1059
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,659
replicate that I just know we have

1060
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,950
something really special and and we're

1061
00:41:28,659 --> 00:41:32,109
just trying to let the world you know

1062
00:41:29,949 --> 00:41:34,109
kind of see it and you know decide if

1063
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:37,180
that's that's that's for them you know

1064
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:38,740
yeah I mean one thing we haven't

1065
00:41:37,179 --> 00:41:42,399
mentioned either is that your facility

1066
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:46,209
is fairly far south of Seattle so a lot

1067
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,519
of the guys live in Seattle even I think

1068
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:51,699
in North Seattle in some cases yeah yeah

1069
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:54,039
and are driving all the way down to the

1070
00:41:51,699 --> 00:41:56,109
facility which is you know how many

1071
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:58,420
miles is that well yeah it's in Olympia

1072
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:00,630
Washington and you know it's about a 60

1073
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,309
mile drive each way and I I mean we have

1074
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:05,230
most of our employees and they make that

1075
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:10,360
drive both ways every day you know in

1076
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:12,400
traffic you spend hours there getting up

1077
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:14,680
and you know crazy hours oh yeah

1078
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,150
definitely the opportunity to work a

1079
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:17,769
part of this community

1080
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,900
yeah and and you know everybody has a

1081
00:42:17,769 --> 00:42:22,360
shared shared you know sense that we're

1082
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:24,130
building something special and yeah you

1083
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:26,410
know you know to come from a small place

1084
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:29,050
and be able to make your mark and you

1085
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:30,969
know going to these stores and and and

1086
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,200
you know hear the stories that you know

1087
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:34,839
there was there was people that were you

1088
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,639
know genuinely had their their day or

1089
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:38,050
their lives improved by you know by your

1090
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:39,940
products I mean that that's the kind of

1091
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:43,330
thing that makes that drive worth it you

1092
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:44,769
know and so so yeah we're just blessed

1093
00:42:43,329 --> 00:42:46,869
and and you know wouldn't do anything

1094
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:50,769
else so what are some of the things that

1095
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:53,019
you do at goldleaf you know for or with

1096
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:57,329
your employees that helped build that

1097
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:59,518
sense of community yeah we

1098
00:42:57,329 --> 00:43:01,140
I mean even even something as simple as

1099
00:42:59,518 --> 00:43:03,208
you know on Friday we you know we all

1100
00:43:01,139 --> 00:43:06,719
stop work a few hours early and barbeque

1101
00:43:03,208 --> 00:43:07,978
and it's just become this tradition you

1102
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,769
know that I don't know how it started

1103
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:12,929
just as long as I can remember we've you

1104
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:16,548
know we break a little early on Friday

1105
00:43:12,929 --> 00:43:18,778
and we everybody has a potluck and and

1106
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:21,690
yeah that's kind of a Hawaiian thing you

1107
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:24,900
just you know everything you know kind

1108
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:28,108
of you know orbits around food and

1109
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:29,608
community and and it's just you know

1110
00:43:28,108 --> 00:43:32,518
it's a special time where we're able to

1111
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:34,139
you know just reflect and and you know

1112
00:43:32,518 --> 00:43:38,429
have your team together and something

1113
00:43:34,139 --> 00:43:39,900
that's not work-related but well yeah I

1114
00:43:38,429 --> 00:43:42,058
mean it's it you know it's the the

1115
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:44,160
barbecue everything you know it's it's

1116
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:46,048
such a small thing but yet I think it

1117
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:47,759
just helps everybody remember that like

1118
00:43:46,048 --> 00:43:50,038
yeah we're this you know it's this team

1119
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:51,059
we have a we have a greater goal and you

1120
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:55,650
know we're happy to work together so

1121
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:57,869
when I first started running kiss we

1122
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,309
would have staff meetings we're not all

1123
00:43:57,869 --> 00:44:00,690
working at the same time to where we can

1124
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:02,249
do these sorts of barbecues and things

1125
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:03,900
but we're working on more team-building

1126
00:44:02,248 --> 00:44:07,108
events and those opportunities to be

1127
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:08,430
together outside of the you know outside

1128
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:11,458
of the workplace and not talking about

1129
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:14,368
work like my farm managers birthday was

1130
00:44:11,458 --> 00:44:16,708
last night and you know over half the

1131
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,088
staff was there you know other people

1132
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:19,379
the guests we're leaving in like the

1133
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,150
staff was there hanging out because they

1134
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,619
enjoy each other's company and like some

1135
00:44:21,150 --> 00:44:24,568
of the some of the people have taken

1136
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:26,130
trips to Iceland together or live

1137
00:44:24,568 --> 00:44:28,829
together or have moved across the

1138
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:30,599
country and it's like those moments of

1139
00:44:28,829 --> 00:44:32,400
community I think are so amazing and

1140
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,869
when I first started looking staff

1141
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:35,639
meetings I was like oh my gosh this is

1142
00:44:33,869 --> 00:44:37,588
cut account I was calculating out how

1143
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:38,699
much this is costing me per hour that

1144
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:40,170
we're just sitting there and you know

1145
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:43,588
people are asking questions and I'm like

1146
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,239
20 man-hours I yeah like this is a lot

1147
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:49,170
of money that we could be spent doing

1148
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:50,880
other stuff but as I matured as the

1149
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:52,709
leader or as a business owner I realized

1150
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:53,640
just how important this aspect was that

1151
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:56,338
people feel like they're being heard

1152
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:58,828
that people have time together that's

1153
00:44:56,338 --> 00:45:01,380
not spent being you know stressed or

1154
00:44:58,829 --> 00:45:04,329
working and that everyone gets along and

1155
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:05,858
likes each other is so important

1156
00:45:04,329 --> 00:45:07,749
and work environments can go a lot of

1157
00:45:05,858 --> 00:45:08,978
different ways oh yeah I mean I know

1158
00:45:07,748 --> 00:45:10,238
there's a lot of places where it's like

1159
00:45:08,978 --> 00:45:12,009
I don't want to see you till Monday

1160
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:14,920
morning I can't get out of there fast

1161
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:17,798
enough um yeah but uh but but yeah you

1162
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:20,079
nailed it ed I mean it's it's um I think

1163
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:23,259
it comes down to a sense of purpose

1164
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:26,499
right and and like you know you have not

1165
00:45:23,259 --> 00:45:29,259
every job at gold leaf is you know is as

1166
00:45:26,498 --> 00:45:33,759
glamorous as the others but I think that

1167
00:45:29,259 --> 00:45:35,559
it's it's important to you know you know

1168
00:45:33,759 --> 00:45:38,639
sort of develop that and everybody that

1169
00:45:35,559 --> 00:45:42,910
says you know it's like there's this um

1170
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:45,358
you know quote for the stonemasons and

1171
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:48,818
it says you know we cut humble stone

1172
00:45:45,358 --> 00:45:52,659
must not forget we're building

1173
00:45:48,818 --> 00:45:54,489
cathedrals right and it's like you know

1174
00:45:52,659 --> 00:45:55,688
even if you're just trimming and I

1175
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,478
totally butcher that quote by the way

1176
00:45:55,688 --> 00:45:59,978
but you know the whether you're trimming

1177
00:45:58,478 --> 00:46:01,958
or you're packaging or you're delivering

1178
00:45:59,978 --> 00:46:03,818
you know everybody realizes that this is

1179
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:06,698
all part of that you know that that

1180
00:46:03,818 --> 00:46:08,170
customer experience and I think you know

1181
00:46:06,699 --> 00:46:09,789
there's so much to be learned from from

1182
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:12,519
every person who works there right like

1183
00:46:09,789 --> 00:46:15,369
you and I we both you know wear a lot of

1184
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:16,748
hats or running our businesses you know

1185
00:46:15,369 --> 00:46:18,160
we're not always down in the trenches

1186
00:46:16,748 --> 00:46:19,238
you know at least for myself I should

1187
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:21,278
say you know I can't you know I'm not

1188
00:46:19,239 --> 00:46:22,688
always you know and there's there's

1189
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,369
weeks I'm not even in the gardens as

1190
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:27,278
much anymore because I'm have other

1191
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:30,369
things to attend to and and you know

1192
00:46:27,278 --> 00:46:32,170
fine you know the person with you know

1193
00:46:30,369 --> 00:46:33,910
maybe one of the most homeless job you

1194
00:46:32,170 --> 00:46:36,298
know at our at our farm will have

1195
00:46:33,909 --> 00:46:38,768
insights into that part of the process

1196
00:46:36,298 --> 00:46:41,438
that I wouldn't be able to come up with

1197
00:46:38,768 --> 00:46:43,508
you know and allowing them empowering

1198
00:46:41,438 --> 00:46:44,920
them to say hey you know okay why don't

1199
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,509
you make this improvement this isn't

1200
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:47,769
about me telling you how to do a job

1201
00:46:46,509 --> 00:46:50,079
it's you know it's me finding the right

1202
00:46:47,768 --> 00:46:52,659
people who want to improve this company

1203
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,719
in any way they can and so giving them

1204
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:57,818
some some Liberty which he knows takes a

1205
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:59,259
certain amount of trust and but you find

1206
00:46:57,818 --> 00:47:01,119
I think you find overall that when

1207
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:02,858
people do that you know that gives them

1208
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,099
a sense of purpose say wow I've improved

1209
00:47:02,858 --> 00:47:08,150
this product I've helped my company

1210
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:10,430
everybody benefited from it

1211
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:12,380
I think that that sort of really yeah

1212
00:47:10,429 --> 00:47:13,969
you did told me another time we're

1213

1215
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,699

00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:52,760
this this you know desire this this how

1229
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:55,399

1230
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:56,750

1232
00:47:56,750 --> 00:48:00,409
little thing he does he takes his one

1233
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,180
job of trimming which you know if you

1234
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:04,460
you know trimming for the cannabis

1235
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:05,839
industry is you know some people think

1236
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,920
it's like dishwashing in the restaurant

1237
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:10,070
industry like it's where you got to

1238
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:12,320
start and yet you know he takes so much

1239
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:14,840
pride in in trimming a perfect flower

1240
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:16,880
and I think you know what he's told me

1241
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:20,210
is that you know I mean these growers

1242
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,280
they put in so much time and energy from

1243
00:48:20,210 --> 00:48:25,039
from taking a clone and and all the way

1244
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,810
through it's it's growing life and you

1245
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:29,989
know the harvesting and the the curing

1246
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:32,360
and you know he it's his job to give it

1247
00:48:29,989 --> 00:48:34,399
that final manicure that the you know

1248
00:48:32,360 --> 00:48:37,070

1249
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:39,680

1250
00:48:37,070 --> 00:48:41,600
simple task really embodies oh you know

1251
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,089

00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:46,250
everything we do so it's great and and

1253
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:47,840
you know he's I know he might be a

1254
00:48:46,250 --> 00:48:50,539
trimmer forever and and you know it's

1255
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:53,000
it's but he enjoys what he does you know

1256
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:56,300

1258
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,000
quite talented that he's good at what

1259
00:48:57,739 --> 00:49:01,009

1260
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:02,389
simple task and I pay him well to do it

1261
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:06,320
now I said you know I'm gonna continue

1262
00:49:02,389 --> 00:49:08,150
to promote you but you could still be a

1263
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:10,910
trimmer right because he's earned that I

1264
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:13,849
want to take care of folks but if his

1265
00:49:10,909 --> 00:49:15,859
you know calling is to do that one final

1266
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:17,420
detail it's like detailing a car before

1267
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:19,039
you put it on the lot you know it might

1268
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,460
not sound as cool as a guy engineering

1269
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,259
the car

1270
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,730
but you know at the other day that

1271
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:24,500
customer is gonna want to see a nice

1272
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:27,050
shiny car and that might be what makes

1273
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:29,179
him purchase it yeah and he understands

1274
00:49:27,050 --> 00:49:31,940
that and I think that's sort of that's

1275
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:34,639
that's definitely a you know an example

1276
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:37,309
for how we try to do everything there so

1277
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:39,799
let's talk a little bit about what where

1278
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:42,679

1287
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:06,130
sort of are thinking outside the box

1288
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:09,550
with how people are interacting with

1289
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:14,119
cannabis as a whole and with the brands

1290
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:15,710
in general you know and it's a it takes

1291
00:50:14,119 --> 00:50:18,500
a little bit of creative thinking to be

1292
00:50:15,710 --> 00:50:20,869

00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:37,579
consume the most of his coffee and

1300
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:41,150
cannabis picker as well get in

1301
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:42,380
businesses both but uh you know I was

1302
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:46,820
I've been thinking for a long time I

1303
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:49,130
mean I drink a lot of coffee and there's

1304
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:50,809
a lot of restrictions on how I can you

1305
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,220
know really market and advertise my

1306
00:50:50,809 --> 00:50:55,369
cannabis brand you know just sort of

1307
00:50:52,219 --> 00:50:57,919
what's socially responsible and and you

1308
00:50:55,369 --> 00:51:00,199
know it's it's an adult product and even

1309
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,980
the state sets some limitations on how

1310
00:51:00,199 --> 00:51:05,389
how and where we can advertise obviously

1311
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:07,099
you know I'm thinking about our brand

1312
00:51:05,389 --> 00:51:09,259
you know eventually moving into you know

1313
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:11,750
possibly other states and you know

1314
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:13,730
internationally one day so how do I

1315
00:51:11,750 --> 00:51:14,349
begin to export that you know if I can

1316
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:16,809
ship

1317
00:51:14,349 --> 00:51:19,420
my products across state lines you know

1318
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:21,039
and so the coffee just seemed to be

1319
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:26,528
something that sort of embodied a lot of

1320
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:29,650
you know similar similar values so we

1321
00:51:26,528 --> 00:51:32,739
partnered with a roastery on the Big

1322
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:36,729
Island and there they work with a

1323
00:51:32,739 --> 00:51:39,278
cooperative of Kona coffee farmers other

1324
00:51:36,728 --> 00:51:43,389
coffee farmers in Hawaii you know small

1325
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:46,719
farms small family farms organic same

1326
00:51:43,389 --> 00:51:49,208
values we have and so hopefully now you

1327
00:51:46,719 --> 00:51:52,150
know if you get a Buy or you know get a

1328
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:55,028
bag of cold gold leaf coffee and it's

1329
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:56,528
excellent too and you know we made sure

1330
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:57,849
that make sure hey if we're gonna put

1331
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:59,199
the name on it's got to be really good

1332
00:51:57,849 --> 00:52:01,869
you know and and so hopefully you know

1333
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,369
you maybe you try the coffee and you say

1334
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:05,440
wow you know what's behind this brand

1335
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:07,989
and it's like oh hey they also grow they

1336
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:10,479
also grow herb and maybe I'll check that

1337
00:52:07,989 --> 00:52:12,338
out so just just a different way of

1338
00:52:10,478 --> 00:52:13,778
thinking about the brand as a whole you

1339
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:15,338
know eventually perhaps it expands

1340
00:52:13,778 --> 00:52:19,028
beyond just cannabis into more of a

1341
00:52:15,338 --> 00:52:21,190
lifestyle and you know culture yeah and

1342
00:52:19,028 --> 00:52:24,630
then you guys are known for your flower

1343
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:27,429
yeah that's really what's you sort of

1344
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:30,969
staked your mark on but you also produce

1345
00:52:27,429 --> 00:52:32,649
other products as well yes so beyond the

1346
00:52:30,969 --> 00:52:34,568
flower you're also he talked a little

1347
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:35,829
bit about the lyric ana gars and some of

1348
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:38,048
the other products you created to sort

1349
00:52:35,829 --> 00:52:39,849
of diversify in this market yeah so we

1350
00:52:38,048 --> 00:52:43,059
you know we you know we start off pretty

1351
00:52:39,849 --> 00:52:45,068
much strictly selling flour we partnered

1352
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:47,079
eventually with concentrated maker polar

1353
00:52:45,068 --> 00:52:53,349
ice tracks and we do solvent free

1354
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:54,849
concentrates so hash rosin and that's

1355
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:57,369
been really great you know we've been

1356
00:52:54,849 --> 00:52:59,619
winning some awards for that it's just a

1357
00:52:57,369 --> 00:53:02,769
very pure process that involves no

1358
00:52:59,619 --> 00:53:04,660
chemistry and so we figure why are you

1359
00:53:02,768 --> 00:53:06,488
gonna grow your your your flowers

1360
00:53:04,659 --> 00:53:08,949
organically and then you know process it

1361
00:53:06,489 --> 00:53:12,278
with with you know hydrocarbons and you

1362
00:53:08,949 --> 00:53:15,759
know other solvent so it's a it's a

1363
00:53:12,278 --> 00:53:17,480
solvent free you know constant

1364
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,510
concentrated processing

1365
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,358
and then we put them all together into

1366
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:24,619
the categories and so this is actually

1367
00:53:23,358 --> 00:53:28,670
one of the smaller ones we call this the

1368
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:32,599
cannery low but it is a basica cannabis

1369
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:34,690
cigar and it it's it's our flower then

1370
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:36,980
it's wrapped in a layer of the

1371
00:53:34,690 --> 00:53:38,599
concentrate and then we take the fan

1372
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:40,909
leaves from the plant so instead of a

1373
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:43,760
tobacco wrap it's you know each leaf is

1374
00:53:40,909 --> 00:53:45,529
meticulously you know placed around that

1375
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:48,020
and cured and dried the whole process

1376
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:50,420
takes months and you end up with this

1377
00:53:48,019 --> 00:53:53,088
you know kind of work of art yeah

1378
00:53:50,420 --> 00:53:55,099
they're beautiful yeah yeah all I'll

1379
00:53:53,088 --> 00:53:58,159
post some photos and stuff for listeners

1380
00:53:55,099 --> 00:54:00,079
on the podcast page but then also I'll

1381
00:53:58,159 --> 00:54:01,730
show some of the videos that you've you

1382
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,079
shared with me because one of the things

1383
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,338
that I just want to mention while we're

1384
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:06,230
talking about marketing branding that's

1385
00:54:04,338 --> 00:54:09,078
so important is marketing branding is

1386
00:54:06,230 --> 00:54:12,769
not just a t-shirt or a hat or a coffee

1387
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:15,230
bag it's the sort of collection of all

1388
00:54:12,769 --> 00:54:17,900
these things to create identity and a

1389
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:20,000
culture around what you're doing it's so

1390
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:22,940
important I think that people have an

1391
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:25,849
idea of not just where these products

1392
00:54:22,940 --> 00:54:27,769
come from but how they're grown and you

1393
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:29,359
really have to marketing and branding is

1394
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:31,280
is a holistic thing and that's one thing

1395
00:54:29,358 --> 00:54:32,539
I'm learning you know it's not as easy

1396
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,670
it's just running out and buying a

1397
00:54:32,539 --> 00:54:36,588
hundred t-shirts yeah you have to create

1398
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:37,940
that social media presence you have to

1399
00:54:36,588 --> 00:54:40,039
create that understanding of what you're

1400
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:42,679
doing and that recognition so that so

1401
00:54:40,039 --> 00:54:45,619
when someone sees that t-shirt or that

1402
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:48,710
coffee or that hat they can say hey that

1403
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:50,660
signifies this you know quality

1404
00:54:48,710 --> 00:54:53,389
community you know Aloha

1405
00:54:50,659 --> 00:54:54,739
whatever whatever you're going for with

1406
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:56,659
your product I think that's important

1407
00:54:54,739 --> 00:54:58,239
yeah and that's something that I know

1408
00:54:56,659 --> 00:55:01,879
that origins has worked really hard on

1409
00:54:58,239 --> 00:55:03,588
too and so I will I will do a video tour

1410
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:04,818
and there that will have on YouTube as

1411
00:55:03,588 --> 00:55:06,559
well that we can share with people so

1412
00:55:04,818 --> 00:55:09,079
they can see how some of the more

1413
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:11,150
innovative reck shops are doing things

1414
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:14,990
here in Washington yeah

1415
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:17,780
you know it's I think all I can say

1416
00:55:14,989 --> 00:55:20,269
about its authenticity right if you you

1417
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:21,890
know have a strong sense of purpose in

1418
00:55:20,269 --> 00:55:23,570
what you know why you're doing what

1419
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:25,489
you're doing

1420
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:29,000
you kind of build your marketing around

1421
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:32,389
that it'll you know it'll it'll work out

1422
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:34,610
well for you I think if you're trying to

1423
00:55:32,389 --> 00:55:36,170
put out a message that doesn't truly

1424
00:55:34,610 --> 00:55:39,410
represent who you are then it's it's

1425
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:40,670
just gonna kind of fall apart and but

1426
00:55:39,409 --> 00:55:41,599
yeah you know you gotta you got to

1427
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,210
approach it from so many different

1428
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:45,679
angles and and you know it's exciting

1429
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,990
times because there's so many platforms

1430
00:55:45,679 --> 00:55:50,599
now to get your message out you don't

1431
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:52,729
have to throw a ton of money at it like

1432
00:55:50,599 --> 00:55:54,139
the hard dollars like you did before you

1433
00:55:52,730 --> 00:55:56,420
know taking out magazine ads and

1434
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:59,420
billboards and and all of these these

1435
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:01,519
cost you can be very creative and you

1436
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:05,030
can use people to to spread the message

1437
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:07,460
I think that nothing's better than you

1438
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:09,200
know like firsthand recommendation you

1439
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:10,400
know and and so those are those are

1440
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:12,529
things that you know you try to

1441
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,579
cultivate as much as possible yeah

1442
00:56:12,530 --> 00:56:15,920
that's a really good point about being

1443
00:56:13,579 --> 00:56:17,989
authentic because we nowadays we're just

1444
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,720
bombarded with messages all the time and

1445
00:56:17,989 --> 00:56:23,179
marketing and I think people even at a

1446
00:56:20,719 --> 00:56:25,369
subconscious level at the very least can

1447
00:56:23,179 --> 00:56:28,480
tell when a message is is fake or not

1448
00:56:25,369 --> 00:56:30,259
authentic so that's a really good point

1449
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:31,610
well is there anything else that you

1450
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:32,840
want to touch on today I really

1451
00:56:31,610 --> 00:56:35,960
appreciate you taking the time to chat

1452
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:37,760

always appreciate your your help with us

1455
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:47,389
sort of coming into our own as organic

1456
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:49,880
growers and you know we're you know I

1457
00:56:47,389 --> 00:56:52,759
think I definitely know we wouldn't be

1458
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:54,610
who we are and and and how we are if it

1459
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:57,140
wasn't first in over you know

1460
00:56:54,610 --> 00:56:59,210
opportunity to run into you at that

1461
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:00,889
transition time so so that's been great

1462
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:02,179
no it's been good and I think it's

1463
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:04,969
important to collaborate with people in

1464
00:57:02,179 --> 00:57:06,379
the industry and I know you and I are

1465
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:07,939
always learning new things and when I

1466
00:57:06,380 --> 00:57:09,440
learned something new related to soil I

1467
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,789
think matter would matter for you I'm

1468
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,389
calling you up and when you discover

1469
00:57:10,789 --> 00:57:15,000
something you know you're sharing with

1470
00:57:12,389 --> 00:57:17,548
and I think that's how we all stay

1471
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:19,500
competitive you know with absolutely you

1472
00:57:17,548 --> 00:57:20,880
know and I think I you know I can't

1473
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:23,730
stress that enough I think there is um

1474
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,250
you know there's there's there needs to

1475
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:27,480
be more unity you know the cannabis

1476
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,730
industry you know as things get

1477
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,690
competitive you know the the gloves come

1478
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:31,798
off and it can a key

1479
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,240
you know everybody's kind of fight for

1480
00:57:31,798 --> 00:57:34,889
their own but I don't think it has to be

1481
00:57:33,239 --> 00:57:39,058
like that you know you look at other

1482
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:42,420
industries and like-minded brands and

1483
00:57:39,059 --> 00:57:44,460
