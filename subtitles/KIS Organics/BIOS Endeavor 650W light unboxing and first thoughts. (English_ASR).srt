1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,259
foreign

2
00:00:09,419 --> 00:00:13,080
what's up guys Tad here with kiss

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,800
Organics and I'm excited to give you the

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,740
first look at the new bios endeavor

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,100
just open the box and I'm gonna get it

6
00:00:19,739 --> 00:00:22,099
out here

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,219
so we have some cords now cords are

8
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:30,479
going to be extra

9
00:00:28,219 --> 00:00:32,700
separate accessories when you buy the

10
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,179
actual light but it does come here's the

11
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,179
power supply

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:39,920
let's take it out and get a look at it

13
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:39,920
here

14
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,720
foreign

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,280
okay so this new light is foldable

16
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,439
as you can see here

17
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,060
the first thing I notice is that it's

18
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:35,519
really well built I love the sturdy

19
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,519
construction with the aluminum it is

20
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,859
much lighter than the other bios lights

21
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:43,379
and uh basically we have everything we

22
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:45,359
need here with a power cord

23
00:01:43,379 --> 00:01:47,459
here's a dimmer cable

24
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,319
and then we have the power supply which

25
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:51,059
I'll attach to the back and then the

26
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,158
light itself now all these things are

27
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,259
separate uh in the way that you purchase

28
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,040
the light

29
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,659
um

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,159
but it makes it really easy to get

31
00:01:57,659 --> 00:02:03,799
exactly what you need so you're not

32
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,799
buying unwanted cables or extra parts

33
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,699
so the power supply

34
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:14,539
has these nice little clamps

35
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:14,539
fold out

36
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,920
hearing this will just clamp right onto

37
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:21,919
the top of the light

38
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:26,120
and snap on

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,040
I have these easy Twist on connectors

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and then here's the optional dimmer

41
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,860
cable which I'm not going to install

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,439
right now

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:41,700
the light does have these clamps so it

44
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,979
makes it really easy if you want to

45
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:46,139
attach it directly to racking

46
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:50,959
these can extend out and that'll support

47
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:50,958
the light otherwise you can use

48
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,400
basically some hangers some clip hangers

49
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,340
which is what I'm going to do today

50
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:03,080
but let's go ahead and get this light

51
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,080
plugged in and set up

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:15,598
okay this is a broad spectrum light

53
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:18,179
with optimal photosynthesis and coverage

54
00:03:15,598 --> 00:03:22,079
for a 4x4 canopy area

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:24,980
it's going to have 1150 average ppfd at

56
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:29,099
a foot from the canopy and 2.7

57
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:33,658
micromoles per Joule Photon par efficacy

58
00:03:29,098 --> 00:03:35,699
it delivers a total of 1750 ppf

59
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,818
and can be used indoors in multi-tier

60
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:42,318
systems and for your veg to flower

61
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:42,318
growth you can use it full cycle

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,378
I love the glass over the diodes which

63
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:48,359
makes them really easy to clean it

64
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:49,798
protects them from dust and overspray

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,200
and will actually improve your

66
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,120
efficiency over time because of the

67
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:55,979
ability to clean the glass and keep this

68
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,439
clean in your facility or in your grow

69
00:03:55,979 --> 00:04:00,298
room so my favorite thing about this

70
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:03,180
light is the fact that it's really

71
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:05,340
robustly built I love science as you

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:07,799
guys know and the fact that bios is

73
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,479
founded by former NASA scientists I

74
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,099
think is really cool and it really shows

75
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:13,378
in the build quality compared to other

76
00:04:11,098 --> 00:04:14,818
lights on the market though I think my

77
00:04:13,378 --> 00:04:16,738
favorite thing about bios is the

78
00:04:14,818 --> 00:04:19,199
customer service it's been wonderful

79
00:04:16,738 --> 00:04:21,000
working with them and knowing that if I

80
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,639
have any issues or if I need something

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,839
right away they get it done in a timely

82
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,639
fashion that's the great thing about

83
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:30,258
working with a small business that's

84
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,259
focused on delivering for the customer
