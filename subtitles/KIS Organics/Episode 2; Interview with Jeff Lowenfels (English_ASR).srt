organic growing from a science-based

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,118
perspective and drawing top experts from

shorthand title is how plants eat and

26
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,359
what to feed them it is sure to make you

27
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,000
appreciate the beauty of how plants

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,200
operate as well as make you a better

released at the end of 2016 and is all

32
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:22,039
about micro risal fungus Jeff is an

garden riter can achieve in 2005 most

39
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,399
important Jeff is the founder of a now

40
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:41,319
National program that started as plant a

41
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,439
row for beans the soup kien and

42
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:45,718
Anchorage and is now plant a row for the

43
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,839
hungry the program is active in 48

44
00:01:45,718 --> 00:01:49,718
states and resulted in over a million

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:52,159
pounds of produce being donated to feed

46
00:01:49,718 --> 00:01:54,000
the hungry every year Jeff has been a

47
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,560
good friend now for over a decade and is

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,078
a wonderful advocate for organic

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,200
gardening compost tea and the microbes

50
00:01:58,078 --> 00:02:03,239
in our soil thanks for coming on the

51
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:07,439
Jeff sure I'd love to talk to you more

52
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:10,239
about um first off your books uh in

53
00:02:07,438 --> 00:02:11,799
terms of the amount of success that

54
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,680
you've had with this how how do you

55
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:16,879
recommend for users to make uh practical

56
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,080
applications for a lot of the

57
00:02:16,878 --> 00:02:20,479
information in you know teaming with

58
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:22,599
microbes teaming with nutrients and

59
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,439
teaming with fungi sure well I think

60
00:02:22,598 --> 00:02:27,639
each one has a different different sort

61
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:30,560
of indicator things that people you know

62
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:32,719
walk away with um you know for example

63
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,199
teeming with nutrients I hope people are

64
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:35,400
walking away with the idea they need to

65
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:39,158
test their

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,039
soil you know no one ever does uh and

67
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:43,519
and then they go buy any fertilizer they

68
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:45,318
think they need and put it on and you

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,000
know they have AB or micro food either

70
00:02:45,318 --> 00:02:49,079
way and they have absolutely no idea

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,400
whether or not their soil or their

72
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,120
plants need it and so I think that's

73
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,000
that's the important takeaway from from

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,000
that one in addition to maybe uh picking

75
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,598
up a little bit of wonder about what

76
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,639
goes on inside those 30 trillion cells

77
00:03:02,598 --> 00:03:06,560
that are in every individual tree you

78
00:03:04,639 --> 00:03:09,079
know that you're looking at etc etc te

79
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,959
with microbes I think is just is is is

80
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,760
something that the the takeaway is that

81
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:16,799
we've been doing things wrong we've been

82
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:19,199
we've been feeding the plants instead of

83
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:21,480
the microbes we've been concerned about

84
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:23,359
the fertilizer impact on the plant

85
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:25,000
instead of thinking about what

86
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,840
everything is doing to the environment

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,639
that the plant is growing in and what is

88
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:31,319
the impact on the soil and the soil

89
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:33,598
structure uh you know we've been really

90
00:03:31,318 --> 00:03:35,878
just looking at how we grow things the

91
00:03:33,598 --> 00:03:38,798
wrong way and I I don't think you can

92
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:41,560
read teaming with microbes and walk away

93
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,159
thinking that that oldfashioned post

94
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,000
World War II you know throw on Miracle

95
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:50,759
Grow kind of setup makes any sense

96
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,479
whatsoever so that's that that one and

97
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:57,719
then the third book teing with with h

98
00:03:53,479 --> 00:04:01,000
fungi uh is is really to

99
00:03:57,719 --> 00:04:04,239
me sort of Paving the way to the

100
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,959
future there is no question that when

101
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:11,039
you grow plants they need micro risal

102
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:13,479
fungus and and uh what what we're

103
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:15,438
learning about that is encapsulated in

104
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:17,199
that book we were just talking before

105
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:19,759
the show about some of the problems with

106
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,959
micro risal fungi products but but

107
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,319
there's no question as we move forward

108
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:26,720
we're going to solve a lot of those

109
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:29,478
problems and these are going to be uh

110
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,800
items that we use you know just like the

111
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:34,038
Aver average American uses Miracle Grow

112
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,439
today as far as I'm concerned they'll be

113
00:04:34,038 --> 00:04:38,439
applied to every plant no plants will be

114
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:40,918
sold without them being added to the

115
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:43,160
soil first all nurseries will be using

116
00:04:40,918 --> 00:04:45,758
them you know etc etc

117
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:47,639
etc well Monrovia Nursery is one of the

118
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:49,080
largest wholesale producers in the

119
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:50,918
country they've been using it for years

120
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:53,399
now isn't that right through M risal

121
00:04:50,918 --> 00:04:55,198
applications absolutely and and more and

122
00:04:53,399 --> 00:04:57,359
more uh nurseries are but but yeah

123
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,319
Monrovia has been a real Pioneer every

124
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,240
single plant they sells got got got a

125
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:04,959
micro Ral partner to it so yeah that's

126
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,079
it's the way to go I mean let's face it

127
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:12,638
96% of all plants have a micro risal

128
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:14,719
Association well if that's so then 96%

129
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,639
of what you're growing needs to have

130
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,560
that micro risal Association and we now

131
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,800
know that it's not necessarily there

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,000
naturally 15 years ago we would have

133
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,120
said well you know these things are

134
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,079
ubiquitous they're everywhere you don't

135
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:31,478
need to add them well if you're if

136
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:32,839
you're cloning a plant you know then uh

137
00:05:31,478 --> 00:05:34,959
there really isn't a chance for it to be

138
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:37,478
introduced naturally right well it's not

139
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:40,959
so much a clone situation but even in

140
00:05:37,478 --> 00:05:42,439
even in regular normal soil you know we

141
00:05:40,959 --> 00:05:45,359
we used to think that the spores would

142
00:05:42,439 --> 00:05:47,639
blow all around the earth okay you know

143
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,720
G after they're so small well you know

144
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,038
it turns out that the Ecto micro risal

145
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:54,520
which are the ones that you might find

146
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:57,719
in a you know in a big Conifer Forest

147
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:59,719
yeah they may blow three or four miles H

148
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:01,520
that's interesting so if you got a nurse

149
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,800
you're three or four miles away yeah you

150
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:06,240
don't need to use Ecto micro risal fungi

151
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,160
but if you're 15 miles away yeah maybe

152
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,720
you do we now know that rotor tilling

153
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,319
destroys the S the situation we know

154
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,520
that using fungicides certain fungicides

155
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,680
not all of them uh creates a situation

156
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:21,519
where you need to add them we know that

157
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:23,199
when you're planting seeds that it makes

158
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,240
sense to make sure that the roots are

159
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,280
infected uh instantly and so it makes

160
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,360
sense to put the micro risal uh fungus

161
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:35,079
or fungi on the seat itself so that you

162
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,000
get you get inoculation immediately

163
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,959
rather than have to wait you know so

164
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,918
that there there there any number and

165
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:43,959
and now we know that if you use too much

166
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:45,359
phosphorus or too much nitrogen you know

167
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:48,918
you've created a situation where the

168
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,879
plant won't won't signal for the

169
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,758
relationship to begin and so you you

170
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,639
begin to get a whole different view than

171
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,919
what we had 15 or 20 years ago which is

172
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:59,720
why I wrote the book frankly I mean uh

173
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:02,359
the the progression of knowledge that

174
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:05,000
we've had with regard to mecar reszel uh

175
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,639
fungi has been amazing absolutely

176
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,079
amazing uh and and so when I wrote team

177
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:11,918
with microbes the F the first edition of

178
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:14,478
teaming with microbes you know had a

179
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:16,198
paragraph on them uh I had to revise

180
00:07:14,478 --> 00:07:18,839
teaming with microbes in order to add a

181
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,439
chapter on them and then finally I think

182
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:23,399
things changed so much that that it just

183
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:26,240
made sense to write the whole book so so

184
00:07:23,399 --> 00:07:29,079
because really it's an area just like

185
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,879
the soil food web subject matter and and

186
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:33,000
really even even with with with how

187
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:35,280
plants eat we don't learn how we don't

188
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,519
learn these things in

189
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:40,839
school and you know we should we learn

190
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:42,959
the names of dinosaurs but we don't

191
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,399
learn the names of you know what I'm

192
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:46,680
saying I mean it's sort of interesting

193
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:50,120
but uh it is important stuff and if

194
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,360
you're a gardener uh I believe and you

195
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,199
know that's just sort of my my opinion I

196
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:57,120
believe you have to know the science

197
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,879
behind what you're doing so let's let's

198
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,800
back up just a second for people who may

199
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,520
not be as familiar with micro isal

200
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,639
fungus as as you or I sure you mentioned

201
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:09,279
Ecto microa which uh as as you know

202
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:11,400
forms a relationship with conifers most

203
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:14,878
of our gardeners and Growers are going

204
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:17,000
to be wanting um Endo micro isal fungus

205
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,479
can you just give a quick right a quick

206
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,839
background on some of the benefits of

207
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:22,279
micro isal fungus sure well first of all

208
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:24,279
you know there's seven or eight

209
00:08:22,279 --> 00:08:26,959
different kinds of micro risal Fung and

210
00:08:24,279 --> 00:08:30,399
they're all defined based based upon how

211
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:33,278
they enter the plant uh and how they

212
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:35,879
relate uh inside the the the plant root

213
00:08:33,278 --> 00:08:39,599
they as you know they don't these fungus

214
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,958
don't invade the cells of the plant they

215
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,879
are invaginated there's a

216
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:46,439
little an area formed around them and

217
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,919
then there's a transfer between the two

218
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,200
membranes between the fungus and the

219
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:53,000
plant ET so anyway depending how they

220
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,720
how they do that uh they get a different

221
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,240
name so there's an orchid micro risal

222
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,040
fungi and then there's the endom micro

223
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:03,039
risal fungi which are are invisible they

224
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:05,519
have to be stained in order to be seen

225
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,120
they have relatively large spores which

226
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,278
can be seen with a magnifying glass

227
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,480
quite easily and you can even C them out

228
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:15,679
of soil and then there's the Ecto which

229
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:17,800
have very small spores uh you know we've

230
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:20,679
all seen those little mushroom sport

231
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:23,719
prints they are Ecto micro risal fungi

232
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:26,278
are are visible you can see them uh as

233
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,000
they wrap around roots and you can you

234
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:30,679
can generally see their fruiting bodies

235
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,120
which are normally mushrooms or or or uh

236
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:37,639
you know underground mushroom like

237
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:40,679
structures now the Endo you're right are

238
00:09:37,639 --> 00:09:44,480
generally for things that uh we would

239
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:46,919
grow in a garden row crops uh cannabis

240
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,600
those are all those would all be Ecto

241
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:53,360
crops and Endo endoc crops I I'm so

242
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:55,879
sorry yes thank you very much uh endoc

243
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,639
crops and there

244
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:02,320
are these two basic devides the endo and

245
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:05,679
the Ecto the Ecto were the were the fun

246
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:08,399
fungus it was the fungus that it made uh

247
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:11,958
you know plants able to grow on Earth

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,000
terrestrial land and uh they were 400

249
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:17,359
million years old or so the Endo are a

250
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,240
little bit later they're about 200

251
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:23,200
million years old and you know we've

252
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,079
really discovered that that even though

253
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,519
they're many many of them there's about

254
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:29,838
350 Endo Ecto mecar risal Fung that

255
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,278
we're aware of now we can only breed

256
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:35,639
about 8 to 15 of them in the laboratory

257
00:10:33,278 --> 00:10:39,120
conditions and and fortunately for us

258
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:42,720
the endom micro risal fun fungi sleep

259
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:45,879
around with different plants so that

260
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:49,240
they can uh those same one that will uh

261
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:52,039
inoculate a cannabis plant will also

262
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,519
inoculate a carrot or a potato I hope

263
00:10:52,039 --> 00:10:54,958
I'm right on that one I I I should

264
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,519
really go look that up before I say that

265
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:59,838
but so we're lucky that these eight or

266
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:03,560
nine ones that we're able to to produce

267
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:05,600
are able to to associate with a bunch of

268
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:08,239
different kinds of plants and if you

269
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,720
know the right one to use then you're

270
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,839
going to be golden so for example uh if

271
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,959
we may speak about cannabis since it's

272
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,279
legal in many states the the Endo micro

273
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:22,159
risal fungi for cannabis uh is readily

274
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:24,879
identifiable and very available and when

275
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:27,480
you pick up a package you can see

276
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:31,240
whether or not that package contains it

277
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:31,240
uh it's riseof fagus

278
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:36,039
irregularis that's one of the names

279
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,120
unfortunately because of the uh

280
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:41,039
inability to really be able to to

281
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,440
identify what they are up until the past

282
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:46,679
year or two uh they these things have

283
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,040
had various different names uh and now

284
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:51,799
what we've been able to do because we

285
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:53,639
can now do RNA and DNA testing on them

286
00:11:51,799 --> 00:11:55,759
uh to give them their proper names now

287
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:57,320
we know exactly what to call them and so

288
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:58,399
over the next five or six years people

289
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:01,560
are going to have to change all their

290
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,320
labels uh but right now uh you know if

291
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,278
you buy the book for example you'll see

292
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,760
certain names and four or five years

293
00:12:05,278 --> 00:12:08,600
from now those names won't be in use

294
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:11,200
anymore because now we're we're doing

295
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,759
DNA stuff so but in any case you can

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,560
look up on the web and find out what

297
00:12:13,759 --> 00:12:21,278
micral fungi or Fung fungus your

298
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,559
individual plants might need and then

299
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:26,360
you can see if they have them on the

300
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:28,239
label and and put it down now when you

301
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,000
say put it down let's talk about best

302
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,000
practice in terms of a applying so you'd

303
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,399
mentioned applying it to seeds right

304
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,198
yeah I like to roll my seeds in them

305
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,440
well first of all let's back up a second

306
00:12:36,198 --> 00:12:38,599
when you read the book of course I'm

307
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,160
giving all the great little Trade

308
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,399
Secrets away it's the plant that sends

309
00:12:42,159 --> 00:12:47,559
the signal out to make the association

310
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:51,759
and the and the plant won't send that

311
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:54,559
signal out if it's already getting what

312
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:56,360
the micro isal Fung I will bring back to

313
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:59,838
the plant so if you're giving the plant

314
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,320
too much phosphorus or enough phosphorus

315
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,399
it's not going to make that signal if

316
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,680
you give the plant too much nitrogen

317
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,240
it's not going to send out that signal

318
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:11,319
so you got to make sure first of all

319
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,278
that you're not overdoing the the stuff

320
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,040
that you're already using once once you

321
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:16,639
make that determination and again really

322
00:13:15,039 --> 00:13:18,719
you got to test your soil see what's in

323
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,198
it see what kind of levels you have Etc

324
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,480
everybody should be doing that again

325
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:24,039
that's the take-home for the second book

326
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,680
uh once you do that then there are

327
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,120
several different ways that you can

328
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:30,479
inoculate your uh your plants which is

329
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,480
is sort of a funny word because you're

330
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,600
really not inoculating your plant the

331
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,480
plant is calling for the fungus to come

332
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,519
and infect it but but we use the word

333
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,800
inoculation so rolling the seeds is one

334
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:44,799
way uh and certain plants for example

335
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:47,838
Orchids with their particular kind of

336
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:49,599
micro risal F fungi won't even germinate

337
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,440
unless they're in the presence of that

338
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,199
fungus not so with with cannabis and

339
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,199
carrots and you know tomatoes and that

340
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:58,000
kind of stuff but if you roll it on the

341
00:13:56,198 --> 00:13:59,758
seeds it's right there so that as soon

342
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,440
as you get germination

343
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,639
the seed can send the seed root can send

344
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:07,800
that signal out you want to get early

345
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:09,240
early early inoculation yes so so tell

346
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:11,278
me what you think of this of this

347
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,159
procedure so yeah the way I look at

348
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:17,958
micro isal fungus is as a insurance plan

349
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:20,399
essentially so if my plant isn't getting

350
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:22,159
enough phosphorus uh I I'll know that

351
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,759
that micro isal fungus is in there as a

352
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:27,078
way to make sure that that happens and

353
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:30,240
fully realize that micro isal fungus has

354
00:14:27,078 --> 00:14:32,159
a lot more benefit than just phosphorus

355
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,959
uptake right the way I look at it's a

356
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:36,159
it's a you know one or two time

357
00:14:33,958 --> 00:14:38,679
application when I'm transplanting

358
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:40,799
directly to the root zone right I roll

359
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:42,758
the roots in them if I can or sprinkle

360
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:44,078
it right on the root yeah and I think

361
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:46,320
when we're talking about a high value

362
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:48,599
crop like a tomato or or a cannabis

363
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,759
plant that this seems like a a really

364
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:53,440
great option um and also another reason

365
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:56,278
to use maybe a little bit less nutrient

366
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,920
Rich initial propagation media

367
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,720
absolutely so that we aren't applying

368
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:01,679
too much phosphorus potentially

369
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,800
that's right yeah that's exactly right

370
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:05,519
your attitude is is a good attitude you

371
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:07,799
know if that's if that's your approach

372
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,399
to to the way you farm and garden and

373
00:15:07,799 --> 00:15:12,559
and that is a good approach which is I'm

374
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,198
taking care of the plants I'm here I

375
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,439
want a little extra insurance okay some

376
00:15:15,198 --> 00:15:19,359
people's approach is I really don't want

377
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,079
to I don't really want to do anything I

378
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,480
want the plant to do it all

379
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:25,078
itself you know and that's that's a

380
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:27,320
slightly different approach but I think

381
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:29,599
they're they both start the same way you

382
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,839
you have to inoculate the plant sure

383
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,879
make sure that that that it's impacted

384
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:36,759
uh or not infected so that you can do

385
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:38,679
either way the challenge I find is that

386
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:39,879
gardeners and Growers are all alike they

387
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,318
can't leave well enough alone they want

388
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,720
to Tinker and they want to keep they

389
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:44,958
want to feel like they're in control

390
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,839
it's that whole Miracle Grow right

391
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:49,359
Paradigm that you talk about in your in

392
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,959
your talks and in your book so uh right

393
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,759
knowing that just adding it just in case

394
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,879
and then giving the plant what 10 to 14

395
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,440
days for micro isal colonization before

396
00:15:56,879 --> 00:16:01,838
you start doing any sorts of phosphorous

397
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,639
application as a good rule or what well

398
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,040
as long as as long as you can I mean it

399
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,360
can it can take you know up to two

400
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,879
months for for Sometimes some of these

401
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,000
things to work so you want to do it as

402
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,720
early as possible and you want to wait

403
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,519
wait as long as you possibly can but

404
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,278
you're but you're right I mean we we

405
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:18,919
have a tendency to think that we're in

406
00:16:16,278 --> 00:16:20,480
control and and and that's okay there's

407
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:21,879
nothing wrong with that but it's but

408
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,360
it's one of the things that you know you

409
00:16:21,879 --> 00:16:24,519
have to temper and it's and again it's

410
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,519
one of the reasons why I wrote the

411
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:29,039
second book teaming with nutrients which

412
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,120
is a book I wrote for myself not

413
00:16:29,039 --> 00:16:32,679
necessarily for the general readership

414
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,039
and the reason why I wrote it is I

415
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:38,000
really didn't know how plants ate how

416
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:40,519
did they take stuff in how do they use

417
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,799
the food that the micro risal fungi

418
00:16:40,519 --> 00:16:45,078
brings back to them you know what

419
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:49,399
happens inside those individual cells

420
00:16:45,078 --> 00:16:51,198
and I was dumbfounded by the complexity

421
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,440
of what goes on inside cells I was

422
00:16:51,198 --> 00:16:57,519
dumbfounded by the similarity of what

423
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,639
goes on inside the cell versus what goes

424
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,480
on in our universe and the the old

425
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,640
Horton hear a who kind of thinking

426
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,679
pattern is what I come away from after I

427
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:12,480
read that book uh and and it's the

428
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:14,519
reason why I'm sort of waxing about this

429
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,720
a little bit is because as you think

430
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,519
about your approach to gardening as you

431
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:21,880
think about what these micral fungi are

432
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:23,480
doing and when to put them on and and

433
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:26,480
how you want to use them and what you

434
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:30,519
want them to do your appreciation for

435
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,480
that can only multiply once you fully

436
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,160
understand the internal functionings of

437
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,519
a plant and I'm not talking about botney

438
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,160
you know I'm not talking about learning

439
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:40,480
pistols and stams and all that kind of

440
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,480
stuff I'm talking about you know how

441
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,240
what do they do with the stuff that you

442
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,519
give

443
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,359
them you know when that Michael risal

444
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:50,720
brings that phosphorus back what is the

445
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:52,678
what what does the plant do with it and

446
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,240
once you get that you you get an

447
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,440
appreciation of how the plant operates

448
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,000
then when you decide gee I'm going to

449
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,519
give the plant everything it can I want

450
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,919
a little bit of insurance or gee I'm

451
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,720
going to let the plant just do its own

452
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:07,280
thing you get a rationale for why you're

453
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
doing what you're doing does that make

454
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,240
any sense yeah no that makes a lot of

455
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,919
sense I think that's great what I find

456
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:17,519
interesting about that is you and I when

457
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,960
we met oh yeah decade almost um yeah

458
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,918
yeah on the compost T side well fact I I

459
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:25,120
I I probably changed your

460
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:27,360
diapers no no that's not true but I knew

461
00:18:25,119 --> 00:18:29,759
your parents yeah so uh all those years

462
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:31,798
ago when we met yeah I had no

463
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:35,558
understanding of you know plant

464
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:38,400
physiology or or how how a plant uptakes

465
00:18:35,558 --> 00:18:41,158
you uptakes nutrients and we were so

466
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:43,798
focused on the biological aspects in

467
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:45,240
nutrient cycling right and I I'd be

468
00:18:43,798 --> 00:18:47,639
curious to hear now that you've written

469
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,558
team with nutrients it seems like you've

470
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,759
sort of broadened your approach to to

471
00:18:49,558 --> 00:18:55,359
reincom some things like soil testing

472
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:58,240
for example yeah yeah I mean yeah I mean

473
00:18:55,359 --> 00:19:00,519
you and I both know that uh uh you know

474
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,359
that you could you can most probably get

475
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:07,240
anything to grow in soil if you you know

476
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:08,959
but you know what's if you change the

477
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,759
biology we that's that's what that that

478
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,319
was our approach you know it was all

479
00:19:10,759 --> 00:19:15,119
biology microbiology was the base and

480
00:19:13,319 --> 00:19:17,759
etc etc and you moved on up that's

481
00:19:15,119 --> 00:19:19,119
that's teaming with microbes and and you

482
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:20,720
didn't need to test the soil you just

483
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:23,319
needed to make sure that the biology was

484
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,240
good but if you do test the soil you can

485
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:28,918
not only adjust the biology you can you

486
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,798
can adjust what's in the soil for the

487
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,799
biology you know I mean it's uh you know

488
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,158
when I when when when I got on a a list

489
00:19:32,798 --> 00:19:36,839
where once that was wrun by Steve

490
00:19:34,159 --> 00:19:39,280
Solomon who wrote uh a series of books

491
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:41,918
that basically are Al brick oriented

492
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:43,519
balancing the minerals in the soil you

493
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,400
know he he he didn't really read the

494
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:47,720
book and he just s he gave me a lot of

495
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,960
grief uh because he says you know this

496
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,880
this doesn't work you gotta you got to

497
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,720
feed the soil you know and and he kept

498
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,679
beating up on Dr elain Ingam who he kept

499
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,319
saying uh you know he heard on numerous

500
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,440
occasions and whether whether she said

501
00:19:57,319 --> 00:20:00,439
this or not I'm not putting words in

502
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,640
herth I'm just saying this is what he

503
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:05,000
heard uh you know that you don't need to

504
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:07,240
add any fertilizer you can you can grow

505
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,319
a plant in any kind of soil uh based

506
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,440
upon the biology and he didn't believe

507
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:14,678
that well you know I still think it's

508
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:17,720
true but I think it's easier if you can

509
00:20:14,679 --> 00:20:19,000
also adjust the nutrients in the soil as

510
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,000
well you know what I'm saying I mean in

511
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,038
other words I I think I think yeah you I

512
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,880
don't think you really need to add

513
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:25,839
anything to no one ever fertilizes the

514
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,760
Redwoods as I always say but on the

515
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:29,599
other hand if you get a redwood and

516
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:31,119
you're growing it and you give it the

517
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:33,519
right biology but you also give it a

518
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:38,359
little bit of you know biology plant

519
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:40,119
food things do pretty darn good so yeah

520
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:41,399
I've changed my attitude a little bit

521
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:43,279
you know what's interesting about that

522
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,440
so just to give you a little background

523
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:47,918
I actually interviewed Steve uh I joined

524
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,600
his Forum a while back out after reading

525
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,799
the intelligent Gardener yeah because I

526
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:54,119
found it I found it fascinating and I

527
00:20:51,798 --> 00:20:56,319
too had heard Dr Ingam claims

528
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:58,639
essentially that if you get the bio the

529
00:20:56,319 --> 00:21:02,480
proper biology in place there are

530
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,000
efficient minerals in all soils M so

531
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,240
that uh you don't necessarily need to be

532
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,359
adding minerals which was what I think

533
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,319
Steve Took a front to I guess and it's

534
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,000
unfortunate that these two camps take

535
00:21:11,319 --> 00:21:15,519
such opposing philosophies but I will

536
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,359
tell you in the last year uh I have had

537
00:21:15,519 --> 00:21:19,960
Steve using uh erated compost teas and

538
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:22,959
experimenting with it and actually

539
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:24,720
really liking the results so yeah I

540
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,480
think well and he also you know he also

541
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,640
asked me at one point in time to come

542
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,679
back on the Forum because he finally

543
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,000
read the book and and decided GE maybe

544
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,600
this isn't so bad so yeah we're getting

545
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,880
there you know me maybe you and I just

546
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:39,079
need to push a little bit more on some

547
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,080
of these folks but uh uh there's there's

548
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:44,000
no reason to be so dogmatic about these

549
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,480
things that you can't listen to somebody

550
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,798
else yeah so coming from the background

551
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,720
that we have I'm learning more about

552
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:52,119
soil testing and I'm definitely uh a big

553
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
proponent of it now I'm finding that

554
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:55,558
it's very helpful when we're especially

555
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,759
when we're looking at container soils or

556
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:59,200
re amending potting soils that don't

557
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:01,319
have everything that you're going to

558
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,038
find in a traditional garden soil um

559
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:04,960
because it's all man-made don't you find

560
00:22:03,038 --> 00:22:07,119
that the information is power I mean you

561
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,759
know if you've got information if you

562
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:12,038
don't use it you know what's going on in

563
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:14,079
your soil yes it's power and we know

564
00:22:12,038 --> 00:22:15,640
that and we and you know gardeners know

565
00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:17,038
that and every other aspect you know you

566
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,400
could be a stock broker and you're a

567
00:22:17,038 --> 00:22:19,919
gardener and when you're doing your

568
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
stock stuff you get information when

569
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,640
you're doing the gardening oh my mother

570
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,600
did this you know that's not information

571
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,520
that's myth and you're right so you got

572
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,639
to you got to study this stuff and what

573
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:33,440
you do is absolutely correct so we're

574
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:35,200
not just buying the bag of tomato

575
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,400
fertilizer because it has a tomato on it

576
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:40,038
or the Cannabis bottle of nutrient

577
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,600
because it's you know it's recommended

578
00:22:40,038 --> 00:22:42,960
but we're actually doing a little bit of

579
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:45,038
uh a little bit of research and have a

580
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:46,840
little more knowledge so that we can uh

581
00:22:45,038 --> 00:22:48,158
right we can make better decisions yeah

582
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:49,798
you're cutting through the marketing so

583
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:52,640
for example I know your one of your

584
00:22:49,798 --> 00:22:54,278
practices same my practice When I grow a

585
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,600
lot of different kinds of plants and

586
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:59,079
again I'll use cannabis as an example I

587
00:22:56,599 --> 00:23:02,199
don't throw my soil away I don't reuse

588
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:04,079
my soil every single new pot what why I

589
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,679
can't understand why people do that it's

590
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:08,240
because they don't understand they don't

591
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,559
test and they don't understand what's

592
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,278
going on in their soil for their plants

593
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:14,798
you know and the reason why they don't

594
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:18,038
is because marketing doesn't want them

595
00:23:14,798 --> 00:23:21,879
to sure you know they want you to buy

596
00:23:18,038 --> 00:23:23,879
new everything every time it's crazy so

597
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,360
so on that note in in terms of the the

598
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:28,120
biological aspects of the soil since

599
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,439
this is an area that you're you're

600
00:23:28,119 --> 00:23:32,519
really knowledgeable in uh can we talk a

601
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:34,640
little bit about uh compost teas and

602
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:37,079
nutrient cycling while I have you here

603
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,840
yeah sure yeah let's do it you know

604
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:40,359
again pretty controversial subject

605
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:41,720
Cooperative Extension Service would say

606
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,599
we're all you know we're crazy for even

607
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:47,159
talking about it uh any number of people

608
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:48,879
would think gee doesn't work etc etc etc

609
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:52,320
but why do you and I continue to use

610
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:55,760
compost tea are we C back when we

611
00:23:52,319 --> 00:23:58,000
started it was an aquarium pump with an

612
00:23:55,759 --> 00:24:00,440
AirStone yeah everyone did think you

613
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,679
know Dr Ingam was crazy and none of this

614
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,720
was was going to work and yet now

615
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:07,038
there's there's a ton of companies

616
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,000
selling compost te Brewers you see it at

617
00:24:07,038 --> 00:24:11,038
more and more nurseries it's definitely

618
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,440
catching on oh no question about it and

619
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:15,879
there's no question that the uh the

620
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,400
concept behind it is catching on the

621
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,799
biological people are coating seeds now

622
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,240
there are companies that do nothing but

623
00:24:19,798 --> 00:24:24,038
coat seeds with bacteria well you know I

624
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,640
mean the origins of that are compost tea

625
00:24:24,038 --> 00:24:26,879
as far as I'm concerned so yeah you're

626
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,640
right the compost tea Brewers have

627
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,480
changed they used to use the one that

628
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:32,759
you felt and had drunk yeah we we've

629
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,319
learned an awful lot about this stuff

630
00:24:32,759 --> 00:24:36,519
and a lot of it's because of guys like

631
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:39,879
you and Tim Wilson and and of course Dr

632
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:41,278
elain continues and you know carolan so

633
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,520
there's a lot of work continuing in the

634
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:46,960
area but yeah I love compost tea um and

635
00:24:44,519 --> 00:24:48,558
there's no question in my mind that it

636
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,919
works let's talk a little bit about some

637
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:53,440
of the reasonings behind it can we give

638
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,120
people some of the theory behind why why

639
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,240
we're making compost tea and what it

640
00:24:55,119 --> 00:25:00,119
does sure well yeah well let's start

641
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,359
with compost we know that compost is a

642
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:05,239
very effective growing uh Tool uh either

643
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:07,719
you grow directly in compost or you

644
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:09,679
amend your your soil media with compost

645
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:13,679
and we know the reasons why we know that

646
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:16,240
compost contains the fertilizer bags in

647
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,480
the soil food web which are the bacteria

648
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:20,558
and the fungus these are the bottom of

649
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:22,679
the soil food web and when they are

650
00:25:20,558 --> 00:25:25,359
eaten by the fertilizer spreaders

651
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,679
protozoa and nematodes which are also

652
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:31,639
plentiful in compost the resulting waste

653
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:34,360
products contain nutrients nitrogen in

654
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:36,759
particular uh that feed plants because

655
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,278
it's in plant usable form that's the

656
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:40,839
first part of it the second part we're

657
00:25:38,278 --> 00:25:45,599
beginning to understand is that when

658
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:48,918
these microbes die their bodies May in

659
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:50,879
fact and most probably are what create

660
00:25:48,919 --> 00:25:52,640
humus because it's one of those things

661
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:55,880
that people have always been you know

662
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,000
what is humis and it's most probably the

663
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,320
dead bodies of these microbes so compost

664
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,519
te

665
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:06,038
contains because it's compost with

666
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,119
energy supplied to it that strips out

667
00:26:06,038 --> 00:26:11,240
the bacteria in the fungus the nematodes

668
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:13,158
and the protozoa uh in some instances we

669
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:16,839
also feed them at the same time and

670
00:26:13,159 --> 00:26:19,159
multiply them uh so compost te contains

671
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:22,439
the fertilizer spreaders and the

672
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:24,520
fertilizer uh bags that are in compost

673
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,080
that's about as simple as I can I can

674
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,918
make it and if we're feeding it while

675
00:26:26,079 --> 00:26:33,359
we're making the compost tea uh getting

676
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:35,120
those to increase in numbers and or size

677
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,918
and so then when we apply the compost

678
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:40,000
teed to a plant either as a folar spray

679
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,000
or as a uh

680
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:47,038
drench those microbes then uh have an

681
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,919
opportunity to impact the soil food web

682
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:51,038
that feeds that plant perfect that

683
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:54,320
explains it well I I do want to clarify

684
00:26:51,038 --> 00:26:56,119
one thing that I think is important for

685
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:58,439
listeners is to realize that not all

686
00:26:56,119 --> 00:27:00,439
compost is created equal so that that

687
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,399
bag of compost that at Home Depot that

688
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,320
may have been sitting on the shelf for 6

689
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:06,639
months is probably not the same quality

690
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:10,038
as something uh you may pull out of your

691
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:11,480
your very own worm worm bin for example

692
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,759
um and that makes a huge difference when

693
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,558
we're making compost tea because yes a

694
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,278
good Brewer can only replicate The

695
00:27:15,558 --> 00:27:19,639
Beneficial microorganisms that we put

696
00:27:17,278 --> 00:27:21,440
into it that's right and there's

697
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:24,278
probably little question that what comes

698
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,840
out of your worm bin is better than yes

699
00:27:24,278 --> 00:27:27,640
what you buy you know at these other

700
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:29,959
stores and and then we'll go one step

701
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,038
further I think a lot of us we like the

702
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:34,399
idea although it's not it's it's not

703
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:35,720
from my perspective uh something that's

704
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:38,678
should be written as a law but I like

705
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,960
the idea of indigenous microbes to the

706
00:27:38,679 --> 00:27:42,480
extent possible I like I like to know

707
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,919
that the microbes that are brewing in

708
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:47,480
the tea come from my area because I know

709
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,038
that they're going to live now not all

710
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,640
of them have to be from there so when we

711
00:27:49,038 --> 00:27:53,000
talk about micro risal fungi yeah we're

712
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,759
bringing in you know etc etc and you use

713
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,398
Alaska humus you bring in you know a

714
00:27:54,759 --> 00:27:59,558
different set but by and large you want

715
00:27:56,398 --> 00:28:01,398
to use your own compost I think but

716
00:27:59,558 --> 00:28:03,798
that's just my opinion yeah no I I have

717
00:28:01,398 --> 00:28:07,398
heard that something like

718
00:28:03,798 --> 00:28:09,599
99.6% of so microbes are found pretty

719
00:28:07,398 --> 00:28:11,079
much worldwide but in I assume in

720
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:13,719
different concentrations in different

721
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:15,759
areas so right uh things may be more

722
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,278
successful in your soil up in Alaska

723
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:20,119
than my soil here in the Seattle area uh

724
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:22,359
so that that does make sense and I think

725
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:23,759
even if you're using you know let's say

726
00:28:22,359 --> 00:28:25,918
you don't have your own worm castings

727
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:28,158
and you know that you can Source those

728
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,720
commercially and they'll be you know you

729
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,360
know microbially active there's no

730
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,120
reason you couldn't add some of your own

731
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:36,719
compost or some of your own soil into

732
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:39,038
the brew as a way of uh inoculating your

733
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,399
your soil with that absolutely

734
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:43,119
absolutely I mean it it you know I guess

735
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,199
what we what what we're saying is if you

736
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:46,599
got to get compost from the store you

737
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,038
know make sure you get the best you

738
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,558
possibly can but if you can make your

739
00:28:48,038 --> 00:28:51,519
own boy that's the best way to go that

740
00:28:49,558 --> 00:28:54,240
sounds like a good rule I like that so

741
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,759
from that let's let's uh let's expand so

742
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,759
you have the you have the high quality

743
00:28:55,759 --> 00:29:00,000
compost and you're going to feed that

744
00:28:57,759 --> 00:29:01,798
with a food source whether it be

745
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,558
molasses fish

746
00:29:01,798 --> 00:29:06,599
hydrolysate um whatever whatever product

747
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,639
you add to feed those microbes that are

748
00:29:06,599 --> 00:29:12,119
in the compost we're putting it into a

749
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,919
brewer as a way to increase the

750
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:16,319
populations of those microbes and adding

751
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,240
oxygen and to strip out these guys

752
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:20,240
because they stick to the soil and so

753
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,079
you got to you got to strip them out and

754
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,679
you can't you know what I always tell

755
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:27,398
people is the stuff that's sticking soil

756
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:28,759
together starts with bacteria bacterial

757
00:29:27,398 --> 00:29:30,158
slime it's the same stuff you're

758
00:29:28,759 --> 00:29:31,798
brushing off your teeth in the morning

759
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,399
you don't get up in the morning and just

760
00:29:31,798 --> 00:29:34,918
you know whoosh water over your teeth

761
00:29:33,398 --> 00:29:38,199
you get up in the morning and you use

762
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:39,559
energy to strip that slime away from

763
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,519
your teeth and so that's what those

764
00:29:39,558 --> 00:29:44,839
Brewers do energy to strip that stuff

765
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:47,038
away also to keep the oxygen up yes

766
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:49,199
great so here's here's a question I have

767
00:29:47,038 --> 00:29:51,599
for you A lot of people see the plant

768
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,399
succession chart in your book and say

769
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:56,199
okay well I am growing yeah Tomatoes

770
00:29:54,398 --> 00:29:58,879
Tomatoes they're going to want a

771
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,600
bacterial dominant soil so so they get

772
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:03,320
focused on making bacterial teas but in

773
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,959
your book you also and when you talk you

774
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:07,240
talk about how the plant really controls

775
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,200
this process of what it needs based on

776
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:12,839
the exudates it's putting out into the

777
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,600
soil so right is there any reason not to

778
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,480
just make a a balanced tea with good

779
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:19,519
nutrient cycling every time and let the

780
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:21,000
plant control that yeah that makes a lot

781
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:22,278
of sense let me back up for a second

782
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,319
though because you picked the wrong

783
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:28,519
example okay it turns out uh you know

784
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:30,918
that you can keep a tomato growing for

785
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:32,399
years and years and years and years is

786
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,480
it really an

787
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,359
annual H haha I don't think it is I I

788
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,000
think tomatoes are perennials and I I

789
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,959
mulch them with brown mulch but that's

790
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,839
just

791
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,240
me okay so uh but I understand what

792
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:48,639
you're saying uh you know the plant puts

793
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,798
out its own exudate in nature it

794
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,480
attracts what it needs the plant has the

795
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:56,240
ability to change its exate to attract

796
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,519
uh different things that it needs and so

797
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,038
yeah I mean I love the idea of

798
00:30:58,519 --> 00:31:02,399
first of all when we talked about

799
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:06,038
reusing soil a lot of times I'll make my

800
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:08,119
tea out of a out of a soil that I or or

801
00:31:06,038 --> 00:31:10,558
compost that I get out of a pot that's

802
00:31:08,119 --> 00:31:13,759
grown a plant that I want to use the tea

803
00:31:10,558 --> 00:31:15,638
on makes sense doesn't it I think I like

804
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:17,558
that I see um looking under the

805
00:31:15,638 --> 00:31:20,359
microscope at at our different potting

806
00:31:17,558 --> 00:31:21,798
soils and such if you use good compost

807
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:24,119
your your potting soil can have quite

808
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:25,440
High biological activity and there's no

809
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:28,278
reason you couldn't increase that in a

810
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:30,320
compost T Brewer so I I love that idea

811
00:31:28,278 --> 00:31:32,720
yeah yeah well not only increase it in

812
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:35,439
Temple but but in theory again it's hard

813
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,399
to tell unless you get DNA testing you

814
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,080
know in theory you're multiply let's say

815
00:31:37,398 --> 00:31:41,518
you're growing a tomato plant you use

816
00:31:39,079 --> 00:31:43,918
soil from an old tomato plant in your

817
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,440
compost tea in theory you've got extra

818
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,519
dates from the tomato plant that

819
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,038
attracted the microbes that it wanted in

820
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:50,638
and so those microbes are in that stuff

821
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,000
you put in the microb tea and in theory

822
00:31:50,638 --> 00:31:56,158
that's what's being multiplied some of

823
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,519
so giving the plant back again the very

824
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,320
kinds of microbes that it wanted in the

825
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,798
first instance which makes its job a

826
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:03,119
little bit

827
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:05,440
easier so is there any time you would

828
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:07,079
brew a fungal dominant tea or a

829
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,558
bacterial dominant tea because I see a

830
00:32:07,079 --> 00:32:11,638
lot of these recipes online on various

831
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:13,519
forums and websites I haven't seen a lot

832
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:16,158
of microscope work to back a lot of

833
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:18,399
these recipes yeah yeah they're tough

834
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,159
and and uh I would you know if I was

835
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:24,759
trying to throw something on a tree

836
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:27,200
trunk that had a you know a weep on it

837
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:29,599
you know uh I would try to make it as

838
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,558
fungal as possible you know if I'm

839
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:34,519
throwing stuff down around perennials I

840
00:32:31,558 --> 00:32:37,240
try to make it as fungal as possible

841
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:40,759
whether I'm achieving the fungal ality I

842
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:42,638
I don't really think I am but I'm trying

843
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:45,319
and at least what I think I'm doing is

844
00:32:42,638 --> 00:32:48,638
I'm imparting into the tea the right

845
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:52,079
kind of substrate for fungus to be able

846
00:32:48,638 --> 00:32:54,719
to use once it's down in the soil or on

847
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,319
the leaf so maybe I'm helping it in that

848
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,480
regard does that make any sense I think

849
00:32:57,319 --> 00:33:01,558
so so we always want to try fungal teas

850
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:04,880
are are it's hard to get good fungal

851
00:33:01,558 --> 00:33:06,240
growth in tees in general but overall

852
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,639
right that doesn't mean we're we're

853
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,519
losing any bacteria I've yet to see a a

854
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:13,240
tea with good fungus that didn't also

855
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:15,278
have you know relatively good bacteria

856
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:17,038
levels yeah yeah I mean my thought is

857
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:19,440
the bacteria levels basically stay the

858
00:33:17,038 --> 00:33:23,278
same you know uh it's the fungus that

859
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:24,679
you increase so to speak the way not

860
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:26,159
just that's not really true I should

861
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:28,120
take that back but it's sort of what it

862
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,519
feels like yeah and ultimately it's a

863
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:34,398
shotgun approach so if we put out you

864
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:36,798
know a good diversity and and biomass of

865
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:38,398
uh right of beneficial microbes then the

866
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:40,200
plant can really control what it wants

867
00:33:38,398 --> 00:33:42,398
the others will die you're not going to

868
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,919
hurt a plant by putting a a fungal tea

869
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:48,278
on an annual crop like like cannabis

870
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:49,880
right oh heck no and and as you say what

871
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:51,480
what's not used will die and will either

872
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,919
turn into humor or get eaten up by

873
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:55,240
something else in the soil food web so

874
00:33:52,919 --> 00:33:57,200
it's all good you know all of those

875
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,679
little microbes whether they're used or

876
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,558
Not by the plant at least the microbes

877
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:04,519
themselves contain organic matter

878
00:34:01,558 --> 00:34:06,440
contain nutrients they are retained into

879
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:09,599
in the soil system right at the root

880
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:12,000
level and when they die all the goodies

881
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,359
that are in them go to somebody else

882
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,800
eventually it ends up in the plant so

883
00:34:14,358 --> 00:34:17,838
it's all good all right well while we're

884
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,280
on the subject of soil dominance I want

885
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:22,679
to kind of throw you a curveball

886
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:25,040
here let me just back up one other thing

887
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,280
I think ex extract is also something

888
00:34:25,039 --> 00:34:28,199
people might want to think about I mean

889
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,560
I obviously I like compost post heas

890
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:33,078
better uh but a lot of people just want

891
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,279
to you know a couple of times a year

892
00:34:33,079 --> 00:34:35,480
they don't want to make a they don't

893
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,200
want to they don't want to buy a kiss

894
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:39,000
Brewer you know they're crazy this is

895
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,960
the best thing in the world but you know

896
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,719
so so they take some cheesecloth and

897
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,280
they put compost in it and they just

898
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:47,158
knead it in water for 15 or 20 minutes

899
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,879
and they'll get good microbes in that

900
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:50,960
soup not they won't get the multiple

901
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,078
numbers that you get in a compost tea

902
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,199
but at least they'll get some of the

903
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,240
stuff out of the compost uh and they can

904
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,358
make sort of extract that that way so if

905
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,719
they want to just sort of fool around

906
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:00,639
with a a little bit they can try that

907
00:34:58,719 --> 00:35:02,358
instead that's a great point it doesn't

908
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:04,838
have to be expensive it you don't

909
00:35:02,358 --> 00:35:06,639
necessarily Tim Wilson on his microb

910
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,400
organic site has a stir method that he

911
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:11,000
lists that he's tested with a microscope

912
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,358
that people can use so right right right

913
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,159
right and people really need to go to

914
00:35:12,358 --> 00:35:16,799
his site it's it's a great Psy got he he

915
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:18,358
really knows this stuff but okay yeah

916
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:20,079
yeah he's on my list for an interview as

917
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:22,319
well here here's the question when we're

918
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:24,440
talking about microbial dominance in

919
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,920
soil and we look at that plant

920
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:29,000
succession chart and I know you're a big

921
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,119
proponent of no H for for a lot of

922
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,119
reasons right uh I see that taking off

923
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:35,079
in the Cannabis Community now a lot of a

924
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:37,079
lot of cannabis Growers are doing that

925
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:40,480
and I just recently published a blog

926
00:35:37,079 --> 00:35:42,839
post on the subject I am not completely

927
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,400
on board and I'll give you my reasoning

928
00:35:42,838 --> 00:35:47,320
and then you tell me what you think so

929
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,800
we know that cannabis is an annual crop

930
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:51,119
it's going to prefer a bacterial

931
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,280
dominant soil that's why tilling is

932
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,358
effective in a lot of cases it's

933
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,000
unfortunately why they're tilling the

934
00:35:54,358 --> 00:35:58,880
rainforest is to reset that soil and

935
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,358
Destroy some of that that soil structure

936
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,480
now the big problem I have with Rota

937
00:36:01,358 --> 00:36:06,039
tilling is as as you know it creates

938
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,440
that compaction Zone um at the depth of

939
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:11,480
the tiller and completely destroys you

940
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,400
know fungal H and all of that but when

941
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:15,599
we're talking about indoor cannabis

942
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,800
growers in beds and containers we're not

943
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,720
getting out a roto tiller we're not

944
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:22,359
actually doing we're not actually

945
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:25,118
tilling the soil if we were to dig that

946
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:27,119
soil to allow us to get more nutrients

947
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,079
back into the soil rather than just top

948
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,318
dressing

949
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,480
continually I found in side-by-side

950
00:36:30,318 --> 00:36:34,079
tests we seem to get better results

951
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,079
without the same levels of microbial

952
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:37,079
loss but I would love to get your

953
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:39,440
opinion on it yeah well again I mean

954
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:41,119
Roto tilling you're Absolut let's back

955
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,200
up for a second let me back for a second

956
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,838
you're absolutely right you want a

957
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:46,919
bacterially dominated uh uh situation

958
00:36:44,838 --> 00:36:49,599
when you're growing cannabis uh and most

959
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,559
of our row crops for that matter um so

960
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,559
so what you're saying in theory could

961
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:56,119
also apply to your carrots and your

962
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:57,679
parsley and not parsley because that's a

963
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,800
banial but you know what I'm saying

964
00:36:57,679 --> 00:37:00,399
apply to your row crops and things

965
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,560
you're on outside garden as well so what

966
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,358
you in the S what you're saying is Gee

967
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:07,759
is this no till make a lot of sense it's

968
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,559
not just what it does in terms of

969
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,839
bacterial versus fungal uh you know

970
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:13,719
there are other things going on in the

971
00:37:11,838 --> 00:37:15,920
soil food web that we got to balance out

972
00:37:13,719 --> 00:37:17,719
and I'm I'm you know this I'm just we're

973
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,760
just discussing it I'm not saying you

974
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:22,399
don't know this so for example when you

975
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,200
when you Roto till you chop up the micro

976
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,240
risal Network um and and destroy it and

977
00:37:26,199 --> 00:37:30,598
so it has to reestablish itself self

978
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,639
that impacts the carbon that gets put

979
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:34,960
into the soil uh because the endom

980
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:37,440
micral fungi are coated with glomalin

981
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,720
that's where about 30 35% of your carbon

982
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,599
comes from it comes from those micro

983
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:42,639
risal fungi and if you mess up the

984
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:44,920
system by Roto tilling you know then

985
00:37:42,639 --> 00:37:47,039
You' got a then you've got a diminution

986
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,720
in in carbon for example when you cut a

987
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,920
worm in half as I like to say you don't

988
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:53,318
get two worms you know unless you hit it

989
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:56,440
at the 18 segment you get two halves of

990
00:37:53,318 --> 00:37:59,199
a dead worm uh and and if you hit it at

991
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:01,679
the 18th segment the first half lives if

992
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:03,078
you can believe that so so yeah so there

993
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:05,000
are other things that you do to the soil

994
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:06,480
food web I I understand what you're

995
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,079
saying and when you're when you're

996
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:12,960
talking about a uh a container grown

997
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,359
plant or a small bed grown plant I mean

998
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,079
we're really not talking about Roto

999
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:19,799
tilling we're taking a shovel and maybe

1000
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:22,760
at Max double digging a a raised bed is

1001
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:24,880
what I'm comparing yeah which is a very

1002
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:29,160
different thing than Roto tilling you're

1003
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,760
you're not pulverizing the soil are you

1004
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,039
no you shouldn't be yeah you shouldn't

1005
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,400
be yeah yeah I mean what you're doing is

1006
00:38:33,039 --> 00:38:35,960
you're opening up the soil and you're

1007
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,639
adding in some amendments but basically

1008
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:40,599
you got big gigantic clumps of it so you

1009
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:43,759
know it goes under the rule of the least

1010
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:45,920
disturbance possible least disturbance

1011
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,400
possible would I would I Roto till if I

1012
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:51,358
was growing in big beds no but would I

1013
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,920
would I you know make sure that I had

1014
00:38:51,358 --> 00:38:54,598
the ability for my roots to be able to

1015
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,079
grow part yeah I would you know I mean

1016
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:58,640
I'd be I'd do a little bit of

1017
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,440
disturbance wouldn't serp the entire bed

1018
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,960
though and I certainly wouldn't throw

1019
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,318
the soil away that's the other thing

1020
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,639
sure I think we're both on board for

1021
00:39:03,318 --> 00:39:07,679
reusing the soil I just I find that it's

1022
00:39:05,639 --> 00:39:09,879
it's hard to provide because one of the

1023
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:11,559
other issues with with indoor cannabis

1024
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,800
or cannabis growing in these beds where

1025
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,960
they're reusing the soil with no till is

1026
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:19,079
that it's very hard to get in an organic

1027
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:20,920
system all the dry nutrients down into

1028
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:24,079
the the rizosphere

1029
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,800
with zero downtime you're reusing that

1030
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,560
soil you know 24 to 36 hours after you

1031
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,599
pull a crop out of it that's right and

1032
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:33,119
that's been the real challenge I think

1033
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:35,039
with you know strictly not tilling or

1034
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,960
disturbing the soil yeah and I think

1035
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:40,079
people also don't understand the full

1036
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:42,039
rationale behind the Edict of no till I

1037
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,839
mean it's not necessarily because you're

1038
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:48,679
screwing up let me correct myself it is

1039
00:39:45,838 --> 00:39:50,838
basically because we're losing our soil

1040
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:52,960
because of Roto tilling that's the real

1041
00:39:50,838 --> 00:39:55,960
reason why the Department of Agriculture

1042
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,559
says no till works and why it's so good

1043
00:39:55,960 --> 00:40:00,838
is because if you till in the middle

1044
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:02,719
West that soil ends up in the East you

1045
00:40:00,838 --> 00:40:06,000
know that we have dust bow situations

1046
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:08,239
and no till is we destroyed our soils by

1047
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,599
tilling during the during the dust bow

1048
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:13,199
and pre uh we created this situation

1049
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,559
which we lost tremendous amounts of soil

1050
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:16,759
so no till save soil so let's start

1051
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:19,000
right there that's the most important

1052
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,800
thing about it from a soil food Weare

1053
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,039
perspective no till prevents damage from

1054
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,480
from happening to the soil food Whip and

1055
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:30,358
the third thing is there's a general

1056
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,318
acknowledgement among organic people who

1057
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:36,519
grow things that it is difficult to get

1058
00:40:33,318 --> 00:40:38,480
the solid stuff down into the soil food

1059
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:40,318
web I like to I like to tell people gee

1060
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:42,519
you put the compost on the surface I

1061
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:44,838
think Elaine says the same thing uh you

1062
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:47,239
know and in uh you know 18 months it's

1063
00:40:44,838 --> 00:40:49,119
worked its way down 8 10 15 inches

1064
00:40:47,239 --> 00:40:50,799
because of the soil biology yes well

1065
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:52,318
that's fine that's fine if you want to

1066
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,640
put the stuff down in the

1067
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:57,480
fall and wait till Springtime but if

1068
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:59,799
you're doing as you say a crop every

1069
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,079
months blah blah blah you know maybe

1070
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:05,280
that doesn't work so well then you have

1071
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,599
to balance the the concept of loss of

1072
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:10,040
soil which doesn't happen indoors right

1073
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:12,318
sure uh so you don't have to worry about

1074
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,639
that from a rotor tiller perspective uh

1075
00:41:12,318 --> 00:41:16,318
versus you know it's balanced off with

1076
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:18,318
damage to the soil food web that you

1077
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:21,159
want to maintain when you're doing an

1078
00:41:18,318 --> 00:41:24,519
indoor grow most of the soil food web

1079
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,719
that you're really concerned about is

1080
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:30,358
microbiological uh you know and micro

1081
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:32,639
arthop as opposed to macro M would you

1082
00:41:30,358 --> 00:41:34,440
agree I would I mean I would I think

1083
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:37,239
that's true would you agree yeah

1084
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:41,318
definitely you know so so again the

1085
00:41:37,239 --> 00:41:43,078
concept of rotor tilling indoors doesn't

1086
00:41:41,318 --> 00:41:45,079
quite do the same amount of damage as it

1087
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:48,039
would Outdoors you're not cutting the

1088
00:41:45,079 --> 00:41:49,640
worm in half so to speak uh you know the

1089
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,639
the beetles that you want to make sure

1090
00:41:49,639 --> 00:41:54,118
are they making air holes and you know

1091
00:41:52,639 --> 00:41:56,838
you don't care about those on the indoor

1092
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:59,720
growth so yeah you can disturb the soil

1093
00:41:56,838 --> 00:42:01,119
but I still wouldn't pulverize it great

1094
00:41:59,719 --> 00:42:03,199
great no it's good to get your opinion

1095
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,358
on that now let let me let me just add

1096
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:05,838
one other thing and that is when you're

1097
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:08,639
ret teing with nutrients and again I

1098
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,159
hope everybody does a very to me it's a

1099
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:11,920
difficult book to read I mean the F the

1100
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:14,598
first and the third book those are easy

1101
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:16,920
books uh but but teaming with nutrients

1102
00:42:14,599 --> 00:42:19,280
required chemistry and nobody likes

1103
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,760
chemistry nobody nobody likes the idea

1104
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:23,440
of chemical formulas uh and then when

1105
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,920
you start to get the idea that not only

1106
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:26,280
you're going to have to know chemistry

1107
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:29,000
but you're going to have to know the

1108
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,599
photosynthetic formulas you know then

1109
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:34,679
people back off and I want to just

1110
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:36,318
assure everybody I did not ever want to

1111
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,759
write about the kreb cycle or

1112
00:42:36,318 --> 00:42:40,358
photosynthesis and so that you will not

1113
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,839
find that in teaming with nutrients but

1114
00:42:40,358 --> 00:42:43,000
it's a little bit thicker book to read

1115
00:42:41,838 --> 00:42:44,960
than the other two because it does

1116
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,838
involve a little bit of chemistry and so

1117
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,599
uh but I encourage people to read it

1118
00:42:46,838 --> 00:42:52,558
it's really important stuff and all

1119
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:55,599
three of the books fit together and and

1120
00:42:52,559 --> 00:42:57,760
so you know hold your nose and just take

1121
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,200
your time and read it

1122
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,680
uh I forget why I was even mentioning

1123
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,598
that something important you oh oh in

1124
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:07,919
that book uh you know when I what what I

1125
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:09,680
say is that when you start your systems

1126
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,880
uh and if you're planting in the fall

1127
00:43:09,679 --> 00:43:13,000
and I mean you're preparing your soils

1128
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,800
in the fall and getting ready in the

1129
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:19,000
springtime you put a band of those

1130
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:21,240
nutrients down just below the root

1131
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:23,039
system so the roots can grow into it so

1132
00:43:21,239 --> 00:43:25,078
you anticipate it you put it down

1133
00:43:23,039 --> 00:43:26,719
already you know and then you put the

1134
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:28,000
soil on top and then you don't rooto

1135
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,879
till for four or five years because

1136
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,280
you've got a nice layer of good Organics

1137
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,720
and good nutrients down there so so

1138
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,200
there are all sorts of ways to approach

1139
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:38,118
it you could you could at let's say

1140
00:43:36,199 --> 00:43:40,639
you're doing a bed indoors you could put

1141
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:42,318
your nutrients down at the bottom of the

1142
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:44,400
bed and you're good for three or four

1143
00:43:42,318 --> 00:43:46,000
grows I would imagine interesting

1144
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,280
interesting so that brought me to

1145
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,920
another question because it got me

1146
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:51,240
thinking about teaming with nutrients

1147
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,079
because uh I've I've read that book a

1148
00:43:51,239 --> 00:43:54,598
couple times and the the biggest

1149
00:43:53,079 --> 00:43:56,079
challenge for me is the vocabulary

1150
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:58,119
there's a lot of words that you're just

1151
00:43:56,079 --> 00:44:00,440
not used to hearing or pronouncing or

1152
00:43:58,119 --> 00:44:02,280
even remembering what goes with what so

1153
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,079
that's and and that's you know you did

1154
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,400
what you could with that but the the

1155
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,760
words are what they are there's no way

1156
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,800
you can change the vocabulary and what

1157
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:11,079
and again what a shame what a shame that

1158
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:13,200
we don't know those words because

1159
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:16,039
they're words about what about what

1160
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:18,078
happens inside plants you may not be a

1161
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:21,119
vegetarian you know but that cow you're

1162
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,039
eating is I mean everybody's the this is

1163
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:26,680
what runs our world from oil you know

1164
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:28,558
coal everything and we don't know the

1165
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:29,799
VOC abary because they didn't teach it

1166
00:44:28,559 --> 00:44:32,960
to us in school because they didn't

1167
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:35,720
think it was important it is and and for

1168
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,679
our hobby it's very important I I agree

1169
00:44:35,719 --> 00:44:39,679
I I think it's it's it's a challenging

1170
00:44:37,679 --> 00:44:42,199
book like you mentioned but it's well

1171
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,919
worth the time and I mean teaming with

1172
00:44:42,199 --> 00:44:47,000
microbes is sort of the the the Bible of

1173
00:44:44,920 --> 00:44:49,800
a lot of gardeners and Growers nowadays

1174
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:52,400
and I think it only covers one aspect

1175
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:54,640
like you mentioned of this whole process

1176
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,318
and and I think you've grown and learned

1177
00:44:54,639 --> 00:44:58,719
and changed your philosophies even since

1178
00:44:57,318 --> 00:45:00,719
you wrote it I mean that book when did

1179
00:44:58,719 --> 00:45:04,078
you write that book it had to be over

1180
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:06,000
what 10 15 years ago yeah 2006 is when

1181
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,960
the first edition came out and then the

1182
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,280
revised Edition came out

1183
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,318
201 11 I think and and you're right and

1184
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:16,400
and what I what I discovered and I hope

1185
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:18,000
everybody else discovers this as well

1186
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:21,519
because I don't want to write any more

1187
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:24,318
books uh uh you know when you write a

1188
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:25,880
book it's like yeah you know you go in

1189
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:27,880
this little teeny rabbit hole and you're

1190
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:31,039
down there and that's it you're down

1191
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:34,160
there till you're finished and so you

1192
00:45:31,039 --> 00:45:36,400
know what I got out of it was enough

1193
00:45:34,159 --> 00:45:38,118
tools between the three books because I

1194
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,480
learned I didn't know any of this stuff

1195
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,318
you know I mean I got enough tools I

1196
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,960
think to be able to sit down and be able

1197
00:45:42,318 --> 00:45:45,960
to piece together things and so when

1198
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:48,318
people ask a question for example and

1199
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,880
you're the same way now I can see well

1200
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,960
let's see under from a soil food web

1201
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,720
perspective this is part of the answer

1202
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,039
you know but from a nutrient perspective

1203
00:45:54,719 --> 00:45:58,039
that's part of the you know it's and and

1204
00:45:57,039 --> 00:45:59,880
I've got enough tools to be able to

1205
00:45:58,039 --> 00:46:02,920
figure out what I need to what I need to

1206
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:05,440
know and where to go when I don't know

1207
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,519
it's it's amazing Google folks is the

1208
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:10,000
best gardening tool there is I have to

1209
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:13,280
say yeah so one one thing from teia

1210
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:14,400
nutrients that I took away was that

1211
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,079
there's a few different ways that a

1212
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,318
plant can uptake nutrients right um and

1213
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:22,280
and the biological aspect is just is

1214
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:23,759
just one of those ways I what got me

1215
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,440
wondering a little bit more about humic

1216
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:27,480
and fulvic acids because a lot of

1217
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,358
gardeners and Growers are using them and

1218
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:32,960
swear by them as I understand it the

1219
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:37,000
hemic mo molecule is a little bit larger

1220
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,760
in keates or bonds with these minerals

1221
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,318
and then the fulvic molecule allows it

1222
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:43,359
to be taken directly through the

1223
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:46,599
cellular wall into the plant is that

1224
00:46:43,358 --> 00:46:48,078
correct yeah I think it can you explain

1225
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:50,160
that a little bit better than I just did

1226
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,839
I think it's well I I think it's broken

1227
00:46:50,159 --> 00:46:54,838
down so that it can be taken in uh I

1228
00:46:52,838 --> 00:46:56,480
don't think it goes in as fulvic acid

1229
00:46:54,838 --> 00:46:58,920
per se but I I could be wrong in that

1230
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,440
regard first of all let me let me

1231
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,159
suggest God I'm saying that an awful lot

1232
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,880
aren't I first of all let me back up

1233
00:47:02,159 --> 00:47:05,879
carbon in your soil is not coming from

1234
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:08,318
the umic acid the fulvic acid that's

1235
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:10,800
133% it's coming from the micro risal

1236
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:12,558
fungi it's coming from the glomalin that

1237
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,400
the micro risal fungi are putting out

1238
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,040
into the soil which is another reason

1239
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:20,559
why you don't necessarily want to

1240
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:23,960
disturb the soil too much that glomalin

1241
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,200
is there uh and and when the branches of

1242
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,760
the fungi die off of course I guess it

1243
00:47:26,199 --> 00:47:30,399
doesn't really matter fungi is dead

1244
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,680
anyway but um so if you're rotor tilling

1245
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,599
soil that's already you know been

1246
00:47:32,679 --> 00:47:35,879
harvested it probably doesn't make that

1247
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,559
much difference that's where your

1248
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,960
carbon's coming from but as far as the

1249
00:47:37,559 --> 00:47:43,359
acids are concerned the um the umic and

1250
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,920
fobic acids they go into the plant

1251
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:49,239
through the membranes and just I guess

1252
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:52,358
to make it easy the membrane your every

1253
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:56,159
cell in the plant has a membrane around

1254
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:59,679
it and the membrane has different little

1255
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:03,679
proteins in them and these proteins act

1256
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:06,239
like uh tunnels or pipes or revolving

1257
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:09,440
doors depending on what kind of protein

1258
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:12,479
they are to allow different kinds of

1259
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:17,920
nutrients and and substances to get into

1260
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:24,199
a plant and each individual protein will

1261
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:28,440
only allow one kind of molecule through

1262
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:31,519
it so a phosphorus well a phosphorus you

1263
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:34,358
know molecule will not be able to go

1264
00:48:31,519 --> 00:48:38,000
through the tunnel that's been designed

1265
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:40,000
for nitrogen and so uh Boron for example

1266
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
has its own tunnel yeah every one of the

1267
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,880
nutrients has its own individual way of

1268
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:48,679
tunneling into or getting into these

1269
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:51,640
individual and folic acid goes through

1270
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:54,960
one of those tunnels probably not as

1271
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:57,480
fulvic acid but but probably as as

1272
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:59,400
broken down and then it's constituted as

1273
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,519
fobic acid once it's inside but I could

1274
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,119
be wrong in that regard I'll have to

1275
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:05,719
look that up or think about that a

1276
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:07,039
little bit but so that that's why when

1277
00:49:05,719 --> 00:49:08,558
before we were talking on the show we

1278
00:49:07,039 --> 00:49:11,960
were talking about the idea that there

1279
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:14,880
are uh you know 62 different nutrients

1280
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:17,280
in kelp but your plant takes in 18

1281
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:19,039
different nutrients into those cells so

1282
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,640
what happens to the rest of that stuff

1283
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:26,759
well the rest of that stuff may be in

1284
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:29,598
the area that is between the cell walls

1285
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:34,040
so there's there's the ability for

1286
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:36,359
nutrients to get into a a a a root get

1287
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,318
into the actual cell itself so it's

1288
00:49:36,358 --> 00:49:42,078
swimming around in the cytoplasm in the

1289
00:49:38,318 --> 00:49:44,400
cell and it can go from one cell in the

1290
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:46,318
root all the way through the plant from

1291
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,960
cell to cell to cell to cell not going

1292
00:49:46,318 --> 00:49:50,199
through xylm or folm or any of that kind

1293
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,960
of stuff but just through the cells and

1294
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:55,239
it can go all the way up to the to the

1295
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:56,880
tip of the plant through the cells and

1296
00:49:55,239 --> 00:50:00,279
then there's the that's called the

1297
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:04,640
simplest then there's the apoplast which

1298
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:07,960
is the system of uh

1299
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:10,480
structure on of the cell walls so that

1300
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,960
if you got into a cell wall in the root

1301
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,159
of the plant in theory you could hike

1302
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:19,280
from cell wall to cell wall to cell wall

1303
00:50:17,159 --> 00:50:21,399
to cell wall never getting inside the

1304
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:23,559
cytoplasm inside the cell never going

1305
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:24,960
through that membrane and also find

1306
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,920
yourself all the way up at the tip of

1307
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:29,358
that plant so a lot of the things

1308
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:33,200
including folic acid and other things

1309
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:35,639
may in fact reside in those areas of the

1310
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,078
plant where they're useful and helpful

1311
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:39,679
for the microbiology that's you know

1312
00:50:38,079 --> 00:50:42,900
helping operate the plant and feed the

1313
00:50:39,679 --> 00:50:44,679
plant etc etc etc it's a Trippy

1314
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:47,160
[Applause]

1315
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:50,239
world so do you see a lot of benefits to

1316
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:52,118
say foler applications using fulvic acid

1317
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,358
in a particular nutrient I know Steve

1318
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:55,880
Solomon likes to say if your plant is if

1319
00:50:54,358 --> 00:50:58,480
you think your plant's deficient in

1320
00:50:55,880 --> 00:51:01,519
boron then do a foler application of of

1321
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:03,400
boron or copper or manganese or whatever

1322
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:06,559
particular micronutrient we're

1323
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:09,680
discussing yeah you know I'm not I'm I

1324
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:12,760
mean I I think they have their purpose

1325
00:51:09,679 --> 00:51:15,358
uh I am not a I'm not a big fan of

1326
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:17,640
feeding your plants Fuller and I I'm not

1327
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,679
I don't even Boron I'm not sure Boron

1328
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:22,358
even ah you know some of the nutrients

1329
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:23,798
are mobile some of them are not mobile

1330
00:51:22,358 --> 00:51:26,838
um and they're all listed in the book

1331
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:28,519
Etc you know it was a very complicated

1332
00:51:26,838 --> 00:51:30,798
what one of the hardest things I had to

1333
00:51:28,519 --> 00:51:32,880
do when I was researching the book was

1334
00:51:30,798 --> 00:51:34,559
which which which nutrients are mob are

1335
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,760
really mobile and which ones aren't

1336
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:39,480
mobile because some people think that

1337
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:41,319
you can put any nutrients on the leaves

1338
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,880
and all of them will travel to where

1339
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:46,838
they need to go in the plant and that's

1340
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,400
that not true and you know some people

1341
00:51:46,838 --> 00:51:50,719
think none of them travel Fuller other

1342
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:55,119
than you know three or four or five

1343
00:51:50,719 --> 00:51:57,039
cells away so it's you know um so I'm

1344
00:51:55,119 --> 00:51:58,680
not a big I'm not a real big opponent of

1345
00:51:57,039 --> 00:51:59,920
it in fact I got some stuff sitting here

1346
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,838
somebody wants me to test you know they

1347
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,680
sent me a bunch of stuff it's a foler

1348
00:52:01,838 --> 00:52:05,039
some kind of foler nutrient food okay

1349
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,558
I'll test it you know I don't I don't

1350
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:08,000
know why the science would change but

1351
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,160
I'll try it it's made in Holland so what

1352
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,318
the heck you

1353
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:14,480
know can it hurt the plant generally no

1354
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,880
and I and and I could very well be wrong

1355
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,559
because I usually am so maybe it'll even

1356
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,400
help the plant so I'm not I don't want

1357
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:22,040
to discourage people from trying but I

1358
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,720
think people have to test I think

1359
00:52:22,039 --> 00:52:25,279
testing is important too so when you

1360
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:27,838
talk about that you mean setting up an

1361
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:30,280
experiment and having a control and

1362
00:52:27,838 --> 00:52:32,838
making sure that you're comparing Apples

1363
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:34,880
to Apples yeah if you can or finding

1364
00:52:32,838 --> 00:52:37,558
somebody else who did you know again you

1365
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:39,599
can go on on Google Scholar and find

1366
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:41,960
tremendous amounts of information in

1367
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,079
tests and etc etc and then and then you

1368
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,720
can sometimes you can contact

1369
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:47,000
manufacturers and talk to them about how

1370
00:52:44,719 --> 00:52:48,199
they do their stuff you know or you find

1371
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,599
people like you I mean you're testing

1372
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:51,239
all the time you put your stuff up in

1373
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,079
blogs and things like that you know Tim

1374
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:55,798
Wilson he tests all the time and you

1375
00:52:53,079 --> 00:52:58,680
know people just people need to you know

1376
00:52:55,798 --> 00:53:00,920
pay attention little less of the lerve

1377
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:03,639
of uh you know you know people talking

1378
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:05,599
about how big their vegetables are and a

1379
00:53:03,639 --> 00:53:07,159
little bit more about how they got there

1380
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,838
well I think that the Cannabis industry

1381
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:10,480
has come a long way in that regard

1382
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:12,798
especially because it was such an

1383
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,079
underground industry in a lot of in a

1384
00:53:12,798 --> 00:53:17,519
lot of states there really wasn't a lot

1385
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:19,160
of research and testing and just shared

1386
00:53:17,519 --> 00:53:21,239
knowledge beyond what was going on in

1387
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:23,239
some of these some of these forums and

1388
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:25,798
that information was really all

1389
00:53:23,239 --> 00:53:27,598
speculation for the most part so it it

1390
00:53:25,798 --> 00:53:29,318
we're starting to a lot more research

1391
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:31,318
and testing coming out which I think is

1392
00:53:29,318 --> 00:53:33,759
is amazing well I think it's mandatory

1393
00:53:31,318 --> 00:53:35,159
it's so important uh and I and and one

1394
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,240
of the great things about the Cannabis

1395
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:42,480
industry is that it can only go one way

1396
00:53:38,239 --> 00:53:44,399
and that is organic using that I'll use

1397
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,798
quotes around that if if you want me to

1398
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:48,519
but no State

1399
00:53:45,798 --> 00:53:51,119
regulator you know wants their state

1400
00:53:48,519 --> 00:53:55,119
cannabis to be full of pesticides and

1401
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:56,960
bad things and so and no grower I think

1402
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:00,318
wants to to

1403
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:02,798
being bibing their own stuff full of bad

1404
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:04,798
things and so it's wonderful for for for

1405
00:54:02,798 --> 00:54:06,400
the soil food web business seems to me

1406
00:54:04,798 --> 00:54:08,920
and all the more reason why people need

1407
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:12,400
to understand what's going on so that

1408
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,880
they you know they can control if that's

1409
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:17,318
the proper word uh the environment so

1410
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:19,480
that they don't need to have bad things

1411
00:54:17,318 --> 00:54:21,199
and if you want to reuse your soil it's

1412
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,838
important that you're not putting a lot

1413
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:25,358
of you know mineral salts onto it that

1414
00:54:23,838 --> 00:54:26,719
would require a ton of leeching to

1415
00:54:25,358 --> 00:54:28,400
remove yeah oh absolutely absolutely I

1416
00:54:26,719 --> 00:54:31,598
mean again I I don't even think about it

1417
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:33,920
I mean I've I've always reused my

1418
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:36,318
soil I just don't understand why people

1419
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:39,240
would throw away good organic soil you

1420
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:41,358
know I guess the thought process is the

1421
00:54:39,239 --> 00:54:46,159
nutrients have been sucked out of this

1422
00:54:41,358 --> 00:54:49,960
soil really is that possible uh you know

1423
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:51,519
A and B so what you know it's everybody

1424
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:53,199
should understand and again this is one

1425
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:54,639
of the lessons out of the second book

1426
00:54:53,199 --> 00:54:56,000
there's so many lessons in that second

1427
00:54:54,639 --> 00:54:58,679
book even though God it's not my

1428
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,199
favorite of the three you know I mean

1429
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:03,838
the normal rule is called the law of

1430
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:06,279
return the law of return is what

1431
00:55:03,838 --> 00:55:08,798
operates in nature so the reason why

1432
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:11,200
nobody feed the Redwoods is because when

1433
00:55:08,798 --> 00:55:13,639
their needles drop they go through the

1434
00:55:11,199 --> 00:55:16,199
soil food web process they're recycled

1435
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:18,838
the nutrients that are in those leaves

1436
00:55:16,199 --> 00:55:21,960
uh you know are recycled and go back

1437
00:55:18,838 --> 00:55:24,880
into the plant nothing is lost between

1438
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:27,798
the lip and the cup when you're growing

1439
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,440
a crop you're you're breaking the law of

1440
00:55:27,798 --> 00:55:32,318
Return by removing the stuff that

1441
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:35,280
normally would go back into the soil and

1442
00:55:32,318 --> 00:55:36,798
put the nutrients back in again okay if

1443
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:40,319
you understand that you're breaking the

1444
00:55:36,798 --> 00:55:43,239
law of return then you put yourself on

1445
00:55:40,318 --> 00:55:46,279
parole and you you put this stuff back

1446
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:48,879
in some form or fashion either either by

1447
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:51,400
using a chemical fertilizer if you're a

1448
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:53,920
chemical head or by putting in

1449
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:56,559
substitute organic material if you're a

1450
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:59,639
soil food Webby and there there you go

1451
00:55:56,559 --> 00:56:01,920
simple as that it's it's the law of

1452
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:04,358
return it's the law of return and if

1453
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:05,519
you're broken it you know then it's

1454
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:06,598
nothing's going to work doesn't matter

1455
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,798
whether you're a chemical head or

1456
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:11,318
whether you're you know and so your soil

1457
00:56:08,798 --> 00:56:13,798
of course is great stuff it's just got

1458
00:56:11,318 --> 00:56:15,440
that little teeny missing piece put it

1459
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:17,038
back yeah so every time we harvest the

1460
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,760
plant we're pulling out organic matter

1461
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:21,520
we're pulling out nutrients we can

1462
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:23,039
replace those and the advantages if I

1463
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:25,480
understanding correctly of replacing

1464
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,799
these these nutrients and reusing the

1465
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:30,280
soil is that we get we get soil

1466
00:56:27,798 --> 00:56:32,920
structure in our in our old reused soil

1467
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,839
and we also get uh nutrient cycling and

1468
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:36,240
all these beneficial microbes working

1469
00:56:34,838 --> 00:56:38,679
together rather than starting from

1470
00:56:36,239 --> 00:56:40,399
scratch well I guess there's two other

1471
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:41,960
things I would add I hope I can remember

1472
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,358
the second one the first is of course is

1473
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:47,199
that you've got the microbes there in

1474
00:56:44,358 --> 00:56:49,239
that soil already they're dormant

1475
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:51,239
perhaps but you've got the makings of

1476
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:52,838
what the plant was using while it was

1477
00:56:51,239 --> 00:56:55,279
alive and so if you're planting the same

1478
00:56:52,838 --> 00:56:57,719
kind of plant in that soil again you

1479
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:59,240
know it doesn't have to try to attract

1480
00:56:57,719 --> 00:57:00,679
you know the French microbe that it

1481
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:03,318
needs all the way from France because

1482
00:57:00,679 --> 00:57:06,199
it's already in the pot or in that soil

1483
00:57:03,318 --> 00:57:09,960
bit and then the second thing of course

1484
00:57:06,199 --> 00:57:11,519
is that soil is if you do it right it's

1485
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:15,838
it's not only

1486
00:57:11,519 --> 00:57:18,199
structurally mature but it's got a setup

1487
00:57:15,838 --> 00:57:20,960
designed or a condominium already built

1488
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:24,000
for new Roots so for example if I was

1489
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:28,519
growing a tomato or cannabis in a you

1490
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:31,480
know pot when I har Harvest it I cut the

1491
00:57:28,519 --> 00:57:34,559
plant at the base I don't pull the roots

1492
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:37,639
out all the organic matter that's in

1493
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:40,920
that root is there all of the nutrients

1494
00:57:37,639 --> 00:57:43,318
and all of that have flown towards that

1495
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,880
root system as a result of mass flow one

1496
00:57:43,318 --> 00:57:49,199
of the ways that nutrients gets the all

1497
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:51,640
of the uh microbes in the rizosphere are

1498
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:56,239
still there

1499
00:57:51,639 --> 00:57:59,879
and when I plant the roots of the N

1500
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:02,879
plant will follow into the tunnels and

1501
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:05,000
byways and Pathways of the old plant

1502
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,160
because it's easier for it therefore it

1503
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,440
expends less energy so you get you get a

1504
00:58:07,159 --> 00:58:11,879
lot of benefits by reusing that soil not

1505
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,079
the least of which is you're saving

1506
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:15,880
money and of course on top of everything

1507
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:18,440
else you're being sustainable which is

1508
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:20,079
ultimately what we all need to be great

1509
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,798
so I I don't want to take up too much

1510
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,798
more of your time my last question would

1511
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:25,440
just be what's what what's probably the

1512
00:58:23,798 --> 00:58:26,838
most common question you ask with with

1513
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,480
all the talks that you're giving around

1514
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:31,920
the country and with the all all three

1515
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:34,159
books out now uh what what are Growers

1516
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:35,798
asking you can I get the book on Amazon

1517
00:58:34,159 --> 00:58:36,838
or do I have to buy it more expensive

1518
00:58:35,798 --> 00:58:39,159
from

1519
00:58:36,838 --> 00:58:42,119
you that's the question they ask me and

1520
00:58:39,159 --> 00:58:44,279
of course they get over uh it's not fair

1521
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:46,760
right no of course they can buy it from

1522
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,640
Amazon uh and should what what I don't

1523
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:50,960
care who who where you get it you should

1524
00:58:48,639 --> 00:58:54,558
just buy them I think the number one

1525
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:56,400
question I I get from Growers it's a

1526
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,680
tough one and I think you you know a way

1527
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,720
you sort of alluded to it and that is

1528
00:58:58,679 --> 00:59:06,318
it's awfully hard to be organic because

1529
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:08,358
you're using you're using solids versus

1530
00:59:06,318 --> 00:59:12,599
liquids I don't know if that makes any

1531
00:59:08,358 --> 00:59:14,078
sense but the there is a perception that

1532
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:15,920
using the chemicals because they're in

1533
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:17,960
liquid form they go right to the root

1534
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:20,480
system instantly it's easier and it's

1535
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,880
quicker and it's less mus and fuss and

1536
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,838
you know it's better for your plant

1537
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:26,838
because they get the stuff right

1538
00:59:23,838 --> 00:59:28,920
away versus gee you know if I'm putting

1539
00:59:26,838 --> 00:59:31,239
stuff down in my soil it takes so long

1540
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:33,358
for it to get there and you know unless

1541
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:35,598
it's bat guano the nitrogen is not going

1542
00:59:33,358 --> 00:59:37,078
to be available for six months and all

1543
00:59:35,599 --> 00:59:40,000
you know I think people are concerned

1544
00:59:37,079 --> 00:59:42,440
about the timing aspect of Organics and

1545
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:44,679
I always tell tell them just calm down

1546
00:59:42,440 --> 00:59:46,880
well so there are lot a lot of Growers

1547
00:59:44,679 --> 00:59:49,679
are making various types of nutrient

1548
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:52,318
teas now too um and certain things like

1549
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:56,239
fish hydrolate like you mentioned Banos

1550
00:59:52,318 --> 00:59:59,159
there are there are other organic

1551
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:00,959
liquid nutrients that are are a little

1552
00:59:59,159 --> 01:00:03,639
faster acting I I would say the big

1553
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:05,960
difference for me is ionic versus non-ic

1554
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:08,239
forms of nutrients so yeah like you

1555
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:10,318
alluded to is that nutrient immediately

1556
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:13,479
available in an organic in organic

1557
01:00:10,318 --> 01:00:16,440
growing system no you know we may be

1558
01:00:13,480 --> 01:00:18,318
waiting 7 to 14 days for that plant to

1559
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:20,079
respond well even biologically that

1560
01:00:18,318 --> 01:00:22,960
happens I mean it takes it takes 10 to

1561
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:24,920
14 days for those parium you know to

1562
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:26,519
start eating those bacteria down there

1563
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:28,480
you know going crazy so

1564
01:00:26,519 --> 01:00:30,480
yeah I mean it's uh there's no question

1565
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,920
there's a place for tea nutrients no

1566
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,000
question in my mind but if you you know

1567
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:38,119
you should be starting with great

1568
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:40,039
composted mixed soil or pure compost

1569
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:41,760
with good drainage if you start with

1570
01:00:40,039 --> 01:00:43,359
great stuff that's got great nutrients

1571
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:46,000
in it to start with because you've

1572
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:48,880
tested it you've fed it you've given it

1573
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:50,838
what it needs uh either either directly

1574
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:53,838
or or you know through the compost

1575
01:00:50,838 --> 01:00:56,318
system then you should be good to go as

1576
01:00:53,838 --> 01:00:58,519
long as you understand understand the

1577
01:00:56,318 --> 01:01:00,519
law of return and I think the other

1578
01:00:58,519 --> 01:01:01,759
thing where Growers get stuck is they

1579
01:01:00,519 --> 01:01:04,199
think that they can go with that

1580
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:06,640
chemical Paradigm of giant plant in a

1581
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:08,558
tiny pot which just doesn't work for

1582
01:01:06,639 --> 01:01:11,199
Organics you have to give the plant

1583
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:12,519
enough soil yeah if you want to grow it

1584
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:13,960
organically and that's been a big

1585
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:16,920
challenge I think for a lot of Growers

1586
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:19,358
that try and do a full cycle plant in a

1587
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,519
one or two gallon container and want to

1588
01:01:19,358 --> 01:01:22,960
know why they're unsuccessful yeah

1589
01:01:21,519 --> 01:01:25,239
because they're used to Hydroponics you

1590
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:27,039
know where they can it's just different

1591
01:01:25,239 --> 01:01:29,078
when you're using soil and again you

1592
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,799
have to understand how the plant

1593
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:32,359
operates you don't understand how the

1594
01:01:30,798 --> 01:01:33,599
plan operates unless you read about it

1595
01:01:32,358 --> 01:01:36,078
because they didn't ever teach us this

1596
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:38,559
stuff in B in botany and that's the down

1597
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,480
that's the downside I I I never really

1598
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:42,599
took formal botney courses I've looked

1599
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,440
at Botany books obviously they just

1600
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,720
didn't teach us this stuff how to think

1601
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,599
about this stuff and as more and more

1602
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:49,679
people are growing and coming back to

1603
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:53,039
Growing the thing about cannabis is it's

1604
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:54,558
it's it's the new tomato I think and the

1605
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,559
plant is becoming we were having a

1606
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:58,000
little blip now with Jeff sessions yeah

1607
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,720
yeah you know all that kind of stuff but

1608
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,278
but as the plant becomes legalized in

1609
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:04,519
all 50 states which it certainly will

1610
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:07,278
the idea growing these plants won't just

1611
01:02:04,519 --> 01:02:09,239
be for medicine or for the high they're

1612
01:02:07,278 --> 01:02:10,880
beautiful plants they're easy to grow

1613
01:02:09,239 --> 01:02:13,118
they're interesting plants they have

1614
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:14,838
different colors different Leaf shapes

1615
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:17,278
you know they're an ornamental plant and

1616
01:02:14,838 --> 01:02:18,798
they're bringing people back to growing

1617
01:02:17,278 --> 01:02:22,079
things again and you can't help but

1618
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:23,719
start to grow some you know basil you

1619
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,920

1622

this cannabis stuff but the best thing

1623
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:32,400
from my perspective is it's I think it's

1624
01:02:30,278 --> 01:02:34,960
altering how people are looking at

1625
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,400
botney it's got to include the roots as

1626
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:40,159
Dr Lane would like to say I think it's

1627
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:42,000
got to include the soil food web and and

1628
