00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,359
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:23,359
science podcast i'm your host tadd

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,199
hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,720
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:26,719 --> 00:00:30,320
perspective and draw top experts from

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,558
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,200
wisdom and knowledge my guest this week

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:37,199
is dr jack muns jack obtained a bachelor

11
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,040
of science in botany from colorado state

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,800
university while working as a lab

13
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:43,280
assistant facilitating the development

14
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:44,959
of genetic markers for invasive species

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,800
jack then earned a master of science

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,640
from illinois state university where he

17
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:50,238
worked towards increasing vegetable oils

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,640
and temperate grasses like corn for

19
00:00:50,238 --> 00:00:55,198
biodiesel production using targeted gene

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
expression he also has a phd in botany

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:58,479
from the university of british columbia

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,079
during which he worked to unravel the

23
00:00:58,479 --> 00:01:01,919
genetic regulation of nitrogen

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
starvation responses in plants with

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,000
next-gen sequencing technologies

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,080
jack is now applying his experience in

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,920
plant molecular genetics to diagnose

28
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:12,478
viruses and cannabis with three rivers

29
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,400
biotech based out of vancouver canada

30
00:01:12,478 --> 00:01:16,400
three rivers biotech also has a lab in

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,520
ferndale washington and a future lab in

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,880
california later this year

33
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,719
hey jack thanks for coming on the show

34
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:24,239
today

35
00:01:22,719 --> 00:01:25,599
thanks for having me it's a pleasure to

36
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:26,879
talk to you today

37
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:28,879
yeah let's start off telling listeners a

38
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:31,839
little bit about yourself

39
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:34,000
yeah so i have a doctorate in botany but

40
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,400
i've been working in uh plant molecular

41
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,920
genetics for a little over 10 years now

42
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,560
i've worked on a variety of different

43
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
projects but i have a really broad skill

44
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,920
set in the

45
00:01:42,078 --> 00:01:46,158
molecular genetics field and that's sort

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,079
of my core competency

47
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:49,200
so now i've been working on diagnosing

48
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:50,879
viruses

49
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,840
so the most sensitive way to do that

50
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,039
will be

51
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,240
using genetic diagnostics such as pcr so

52
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,880
i'm working

53
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,959
um with three rivers biotech to develop

54
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:03,280
a platform to help

55
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:06,239
uh specifically have their sorry hemp

56
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,759
and cannabis growers to diagnose viruses

57
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:08,799
and we're sort of expanding our platform

58
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,598
to

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,879
include other plants as well

60
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:14,799
yeah so the reason i want to have you on

61
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:16,799
the show today was to talk about your

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,080
experience with viruses that you're

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,520
seeing in cannabis and sort of

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,239
simplify

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:26,800
the the science behind uh not just the

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,560
testing process but also the um the

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,439
virus itself

68
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,000
or the viruses i guess i should say um

69
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,680
you know anecdotally a lot of people for

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,598
a while there it seems like you know if

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
i go back historically everyone the big

72
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,598
plant problem was spider mites and then

73
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:43,439
we moved on to like broad mites hemp

74
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:46,000
russet cannabis aphids and i'm hearing a

75
00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:48,239
lot more about viruses uh for a while

76
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
everything was being blamed on

77
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,519
tmz or tobacco mosaic virus but uh kind

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,519
of take me through a little bit about

79
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,640
about viruses in general and then a

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,400
little bit more about what you're seeing

81
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,799
in cannabis

82
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,879
absolutely yeah so the first thing is

83
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,040
it's one of those problems that you

84
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:06,479
can't

85
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,079
diagnose

86
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:10,158
just based on the symptoms alone so a

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,680
lot of viruses will have overlapping

88
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:13,519
symptoms

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,239
and so if you go into a field and you

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,760
see

91
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,280
something that's a virus like symptoms

92
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:20,878
such as leaf mosaic or chlorosis

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,479
or stunting

94
00:03:20,878 --> 00:03:24,798
you can you can easily mix them up just

95
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:26,959
on a visual diagnostics you have to rely

96
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,599
on molecular diagnostics which then sort

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,039
of

98
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:31,439
is part of the reason why it's taken a

99
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:32,560
while to catch up in the cannabis field

100
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,439
specifically

101
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,878
um so not having sort of the academic

102
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:38,318
researchers do some of the basic

103
00:03:36,878 --> 00:03:40,959
research to figure out what viruses

104
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:42,000
might be out there has sort of hampered

105
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,239
our

106
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,759
knowledge of what's been in cannabis

107
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,319
however there are some reports that go

108
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,079
back and help to the early 70s

109
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,919
um and then recently there's a big

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,159
pickup in that but i do expect there'll

111
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,399
be more uh viruses on the horizon that

112
00:03:54,158 --> 00:03:58,878
are found in cannabis as as researcher

113
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,120
or researchers are able to open the door

114
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:02,878
to that now with with the legalization

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,920
and regulate regulations being a little

116
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:07,120
easier

117
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:09,598
um so you mentioned tmv a lot of times

118
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,719
gets blamed and i think

119
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,798
so so

120
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:15,919
in in hemp and cannabis it's actually

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,918
been found to be symptomless regarding

122
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,798
morphological features

123
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:22,079
so

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:24,159
it was back in 1970

125
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,000
it's a paper by paulson at all who

126
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
basically

127
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,839
infected hemp with a variety of common

128
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
viruses and they basically studied to

129
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,319
see if hem displayed any symptoms

130
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,439
and they found that while tmv could

131
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:37,599
infect

132
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,399
the cannabis plant it didn't actually

133
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,639
cause any obvious morphological symptoms

134
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:44,159
and so they could then spread the virus

135
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,240
but

136
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
there weren't any any major uh

137
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,879
phenotypes associated with um or

138
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,319
passenger pathogenesis sorry

139
00:04:50,879 --> 00:04:55,918
pathogenesis associated with gmd um

140
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:58,240
it's something that i think deserves a

141
00:04:55,918 --> 00:04:59,680
little bit further study uh for example

142
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,879
a plant could be

143
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,280
symptomless

144
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:05,199
uh morphologically but may have uh

145
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:06,319
changes in in metabolites or something

146
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,840
like that

147
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:09,519
um so i think

148
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:12,000
one of the reasons this has sort of

149
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,240
become so prominent recently in in

150
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,160
cannabis specifically is the

151
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,519
um the findings of things like hop

152
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,960
latent thyroid which is pretty

153
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:19,758
widespread and we're seeing a lot of

154
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,519
that

155
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
in the pacific northwest it's sort of

156
00:05:21,519 --> 00:05:27,359
the main thing we diagnose

157
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,120
but then there's a lot of common viruses

158
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,879
that are known you know across

159
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,079
agricultural

160
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:34,800
platforms worldwide that have become

161
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,159
we

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,360
there are able to infect cannabis and

163
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,080
cause symptom

164
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:46,319
infections such as

165
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:50,079
leaf mosaics sclerosis necrosis dwarfing

166
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:51,199
of the plant and abnormal growth

167
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:53,120
so

168
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,759
it's definitely a

169
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,519
growing field for cannabis and it's

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,759
definitely a

171
00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:02,159
um a resource now that we have tools

172
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,000
that we we've developed here um and then

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,319
there's other tools available out in the

174
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,319
um the community for for growers to

175
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
begin actually figuring out whether or

176
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,520
not they're dealing with something that

177
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:12,478
is virus related

178
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:15,198
and so

179
00:06:12,478 --> 00:06:17,120
they're often introduced to facilities

180
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,120
via something like aphids that's sort of

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,800
the initial infection but most commonly

182
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,038
they're spread

183
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,360
through clonal propagation and pruning

184
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:26,879
that's just not been um

185
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:29,280
sterilization standards maybe maybe

186
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:31,439
you're a little wax so

187
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:34,159
typically they're spread via mechanical

188
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:36,079
transmission uh via from from one

189
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,439
facility to another off like a clone

190
00:06:36,079 --> 00:06:39,680
that came from an infected mother or

191
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:42,160
something like that um or or spread

192
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,000
within a facility uh if pruning tools

193
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,960
are not sterilized between

194
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,959
uh between plants

195
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
so what i'm hearing are the main vectors

196
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,839
are

197
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,560
uh insects

198
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,478
or potentially um

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,360
the sharing of clones what about the

200
00:06:56,478 --> 00:07:01,038
risk like i know with tmv in other crops

201
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,280
i've heard it's a big issue and like you

202
00:07:01,038 --> 00:07:04,800
can't even have a cigarette or be around

203
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:06,879
anything

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,038
related to the tobacco plant

205
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:12,159
just because of that risk

206
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:14,639
with certain crops so

207
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:17,439
how common is it for people to spread it

208
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,800
through clothing touching um things like

209
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,879
that

210
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:23,280
so it depends highly dependent on the

211
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:27,360
virus or viroid

212
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:29,359
but tmv is known to be perhaps

213
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,960
maybe the most stable of all the viruses

214
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,080
it's very very stable

215
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,918
and it can and just be dormant for

216
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,758
for a very long period of time such as

217
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:39,439
like you said cigarettes

218
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,038
now it's not the smoke from cigarettes

219
00:07:39,439 --> 00:07:41,839
but it's the touching of the cigarettes

220
00:07:41,038 --> 00:07:43,279
and so

221
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:46,159
there's no

222
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:48,559
main vector known for tmv per se it's

223
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,639
mostly by mechanical transmission so

224
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,199
touch based transmission

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,038
but it can also be spread on seed coats

226
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,478
so again it's sort of touching the seed

227
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,240
and so now that that seed when it

228
00:07:56,478 --> 00:07:59,680
germinates has sort of a reservoir or

229
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,960
tmv present

230
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,879
so yeah for tmv it's very stable but

231
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:07,359
then there's other viruses like cucumber

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:08,879
mosaic virus which is very unstable or

233
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,598
instable sorry

234
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,280
so cucumber mosaic virus really only

235
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,719
lasts for

236
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:16,638
i think it's that in vitro it's only

237
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,759
stable for for a matter of minutes to

238
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
hours

239
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,400
so that one's a virus that

240
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,639
when it's transmitted it's what's called

241
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:26,799
non-persistent so it's um

242
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
it's not circulating in the insect

243
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,680
but if it's sort of like you know i

244
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,800
guess sort of like an insect lipstick

245
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,959
you know if it goes from an infected

246
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
plant with cucumber mosaic virus it gets

247
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:36,399
it on its mouth part

248
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,200
um and then when it moves to another

249
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,038
plant within minutes hours um it can

250
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
transmit the uh actually i think it's

251
00:08:41,038 --> 00:08:45,439
within seconds to minutes for cucumber

252
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:47,200
mosaic it can spread it to another plant

253
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,279
um however there's other viruses that

254
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,759
are more stable and that are persistent

255
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,759
or semi-persistent in insects

256
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:56,720
and can either be in the insect for

257
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,399
hours or days or within the insect for

258
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
months to its entire lifetime so it

259
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:02,080
depends highly dependent on the virus so

260
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:03,278
each virus sort of has a different

261
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
stability

262
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,480
but going back to your original point

263
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:11,199
yet tmv is very very stable virus

264
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,720
so what so it does vary quite a bit one

265
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,640
question i had kind of relayed to this

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,879
then is you mentioned which i thought

267
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:19,278
was really interesting uh that

268
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:22,799
tmv doesn't display any morphological or

269
00:09:19,278 --> 00:09:26,639
so any you know noticeable physical

270
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:28,079
changes or structure in the plant itself

271
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:30,399
could you speculate then that most

272
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,920
plants potentially could have tmv i mean

273
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,360
there seems to be a high

274
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:38,079
overlap between smoking cigarettes and

275
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:41,278
smoking cannabis uh to a certain extent

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,600
and so would many plants be exposed but

277
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,879
if that was the case then i would think

278
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,879
um

279
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:49,278
you know if it had any effect my thought

280
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:50,480
would be when you did a tissue culture

281
00:09:49,278 --> 00:09:52,000
with plants

282
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,839
you would see a

283
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,759
improvement in yield or a change in

284
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,480
morphological structure

285
00:09:55,759 --> 00:09:59,838
due to the removal of tmv does that make

286
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,320
sense right

287
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:04,079
yeah so i think it's a little early

288
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,760
so when i say there's no morphological

289
00:10:04,078 --> 00:10:07,599
symptoms there's no obvious you know

290
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,799
there's no obvious leap mosaic that was

291
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,519
found with tmv regarding hemp when i was

292
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:15,519
back in the 70s again this is sort of a

293
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:17,839
burgeoning field of research that it

294
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,679
would be wonderful to enlist some more

295
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,120
you know i know i know of

296
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:24,000
quite a few professors that are working

297
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,799
on enhancing cannabis now um but yeah

298
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,720
it'll be great to have like you said a

299
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:30,719
tmv infected plant

300
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,639
that you can measure you know do a coa

301
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,399
and check all the metabolites and and

302
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,319
sort of get a real fine you know

303
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,039
granular detail of the plant and then

304
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,720
cure the plants of tmv whether

305
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:42,000
tissue culture is probably the best

306
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
because then you could have a

307
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
genetically identical version that you

308
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:47,039
could then compare clean versus not

309
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
clean and see if there's any significant

310
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:51,039
differences

311
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,879
um so yeah the the when i say it's not

312
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:54,879
symptomatic in in

313
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:56,320
hemp and cannabis right now the only

314
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:57,919
evidence would be anecdotal there's no

315
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,760
scientific literature that would say

316
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,120
that there's a morphological change from

317
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,078
tmz

318
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
um

319
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,599
but yeah i think the science it would

320
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,278
the science has been catching up to do

321
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
regarding um

322
00:11:07,278 --> 00:11:11,200
some of those those efforts but

323
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,240
yeah so tmv and then going to the other

324
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,120
point um would a lot of plants be having

325
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,600
you know non your asymptomatic tmv

326
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,000
infections circulating so far we haven't

327
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,680
seen a high incidence of that in in a

328
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,399
lot of our testing

329
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:28,479
that's not to say it isn't out there

330
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:30,240
however tnb is still going to need

331
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,240
um so while it is transmitted by touch

332
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,759
it's still going to need a wound or some

333
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:37,039
sort of entry into the plant um so

334
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:39,600
when insects

335
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:42,159
infect plants they cause a wound and

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,079
then the virus which is circulating

337
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:46,159
either in their gut or salivary glands

338
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,078
or on their mouth parts is then

339
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:48,799
inserted into that wound

340
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:50,399
so

341
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:52,479
when it's you know when we have these

342
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,919
spread of infections and facilities it's

343
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,159
often because of

344
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:57,519
poor sterilization practices with with

345
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,480
pruning tools

346
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,399
or

347
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,759
leaving

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:06,958
cut you know cut cut plant material

349
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:09,120
that might have phloem you know sap

350
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,559
that's available to then transmit to

351
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,799
another wound

352
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,078
so as far as like having tmb circulate

353
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:15,359
because of that

354
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:17,599
provided you know if you're if you go

355
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,879
for a smoke break touching a cigarette

356
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
come back so long as you're not touching

357
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,600
a wound on a plant that wouldn't

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,519
necessarily

359
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,600
confer an infection

360
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,320
but yeah so far we haven't had you know

361
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,519
i mean the overwhelming amount of

362
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,278
positives we've had have been for

363
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,519
hopliting thyroid and not necessarily

364
00:12:31,278 --> 00:12:35,439
for um so our tmp positives have been

365
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,919
relatively low

366
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,480
that's really interesting so if we um if

367
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:43,439
we table that discussion for now because

368
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,680
since there's not a lot more on tmv uh

369
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,079
you know you mentioned tops like hops

370
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:51,439
latent virus a couple times

371
00:12:48,078 --> 00:12:53,679
um yeah can you talk a little bit about

372
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:57,360
some of the symptoms associated with it

373
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:59,359
you talked about mode of transmission

374
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:02,399
one question i had then this seems to be

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:05,360
a good reason not to

376
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:07,519
keep any of your leaf matter or biomass

377
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:10,320
in the room itself and

378
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:12,879
also potentially avoid having other

379
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:15,360
plants that could be vectors for viruses

380
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:16,958
in the room too as in cover crops or and

381
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,680
just be very careful with banker plants

382
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:21,838
trap plants things like that

383
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:24,719
right yeah so yeah that's a great point

384
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
about trap plants and um it's a i mean

385
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
it's a good practice in theory but yeah

386
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:31,838
if you have to be careful with um with

387
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,278
the spread of possibly you know

388
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:35,040
you know an aphid going from a trap

389
00:13:33,278 --> 00:13:36,958
plant or something like that to uh to

390
00:13:35,039 --> 00:13:38,559
one of your your crop plants um so this

391
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,479
is something to be aware of um and

392
00:13:38,559 --> 00:13:42,719
regarding just the

393
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,399
the plant matter you know as clean as

394
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,320
you can keep it the better obviously i

395
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
know you know larger the facility is the

396
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,399
harder it can be to have all of the

397
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,320
floors swept routinely and they must get

398
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:54,399
pruned fairly frequently

399
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,600
but anything that has you know phloem

400
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,600
tap

401
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,278
could be a potential reservoir for a

402
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
virus infection

403
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:03,600
um so you have the hop blatant

404
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,920
so hobland's interesting it's not a

405
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,839
virus it's a viroid so there is a

406
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:10,000
hot-blatant virus but that's

407
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,320
not been found to infect cannabis it's a

408
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,320
specific i think to hops only but

409
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,560
the viroid is

410
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,160
they're unique from viruses

411
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:19,599
in that they don't

412
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:22,000
have any

413
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,399
protein coding regions of their genome

414
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,480
and their genome is is incredibly tiny

415
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,320
it's about 120th the size of a plant

416
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:32,159
virus so these are tiny pieces of rna

417
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,839
that's circular

418
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:35,679
they don't code for any proteins or

419
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:36,720
anything like that

420
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,919
and so

421
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,079
they're sort of

422
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,679
insidious in that regard is that they um

423
00:14:40,078 --> 00:14:43,838
they don't they they can they can get

424
00:14:41,679 --> 00:14:45,120
into a plant relatively easily because

425
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,800
there's a small

426
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,000
so any any sort of wound infection they

427
00:14:46,799 --> 00:14:52,000
can get in

428
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:54,320
um so far i don't

429
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,919
think that it's primarily by mechanical

430
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
injury that they're transmitted so

431
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,639
hopefully in thyroid and viroids in

432
00:14:57,679 --> 00:15:00,638
general

433
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,879
typically are primarily transmitted by

434
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,560
mechanical injury

435
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:09,278
so you know the exchange of phloem sap

436
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,879
however they can be transmitted through

437
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:12,480
seeds pollen

438
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:14,480
and

439
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,920
so hot blatant viroid this is the kind

440
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,560
of sort of academic study that i'd love

441
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:20,719
to see done in cannabis but in hops

442
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:23,599
um hoplaton thyroid

443
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,879
was very minimally transmitted by seed i

444
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
think it was less than

445
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,000
about eight percent in the publication

446
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,040
that was in 1990

447
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,198
um and so hoplane viroid is very low

448
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:35,120
seed transmission and hops

449
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:38,159
however that said the two ways to get

450
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,198
rid of it would be either either seed

451
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:42,639
or tissue culture and the seed method

452
00:15:41,198 --> 00:15:44,479
you should be aware that it's possible

453
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:46,399
that it's still there so you should just

454
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,360
carefully uh you know proceed with

455
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,799
caution if you're if you're going to try

456
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,759
and get rid of operations blatant virus

457
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,599
via

458
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,839
via breeding

459
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,759
as far as symptoms so the things that

460
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:57,279
you're looking for

461
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,519
are typically going to be stunted or

462
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:00,559
slow growth is sort of the main one and

463
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,120
so

464
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,239
we see a lot of horizontal growth and so

465
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,159
the the

466
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,360
shoot apical meristem seems to not grow

467
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:09,360
very much and you get this lateral

468
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
growth and so it kind of looks like

469
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,240
depending on how many branches you have

470
00:16:10,559 --> 00:16:13,758
sort of like a trident almost you have

471
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,320
two long branches on the side and one in

472
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,839
the middle uh just slow growth it's

473
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,360
really obvious when you compare

474
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,120
asymptomatic versus symptomatic

475
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,560
operating next to each other how slow

476
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,639
the growth is

477
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:25,679
and it's very horizontals or outward

478
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,399
growth

479
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,679
so stems are typically brittle

480
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,360
no that's really interesting are you

481
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:33,359
saying that you don't see the same level

482
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,720
of like phototropism as in the plant

483
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,800
growing towards the light or um

484
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,879
apical growth

485
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,719
right uh it still grows towards the

486
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,759
light it just sort of um the lateral

487
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,399
branches

488
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:48,079
grow upward and sort of overtake the the

489
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,759
the primary you know the shooting cool

490
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:52,000
oh

491
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,680
um so yeah it's sort of like this yeah

492
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,839
as i said sort of a

493
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:58,239
sort of a trident shape where the middle

494
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:00,800
one is is lower than the outer two but

495
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
they do still grow towards the light but

496
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,159
it is

497
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,318
so your secondary branches are growing

498
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,519
at a right faster rate i'm picturing

499
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:10,078
like uh

500
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:11,439
candelabra for people yeah that are

501
00:17:10,078 --> 00:17:13,759
listening because we can't really have

502
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:16,319
visuals here okay all right so i i get

503
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,199
what you're saying okay yeah

504
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:21,359
yeah so it's and i mean but overall the

505
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,480
plant is just much smaller than a

506
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,759
symptomatic infection too so um so it's

507
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,838
pretty it's pretty apparent when you

508
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,119
have a really symptomatic hop latent

509
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:31,279
infection

510
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:33,359
and then relief symptoms

511
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:35,839
yeah yeah so we also get

512
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:38,240
malformed or chlorotic leaves so it's

513
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:41,839
release sclerosis

514
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,880
yellowing or or pale leaves

515
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:45,839
and then

516
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,280
you have stems that are often brittle so

517
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:48,558
they can snap when you brush against

518
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:51,279
them

519
00:17:48,558 --> 00:17:53,200
and then as far as the flower you get

520
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,119
very reduced flower

521
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,440
mass so the the buds are going to be

522
00:17:55,119 --> 00:17:58,798
smaller and they're usually very really

523
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,360
leafy

524
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:03,759
so you get these loose uh loose buds

525
00:18:01,359 --> 00:18:05,839
that are it's a pain to trim so

526
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:08,000
um lots of leaves and then the buds

527
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:10,240
lower trichomes just sort of lower yield

528
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,240
in general

529
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,839
wow you just described

530
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,599
you just described like every symptom

531
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:18,319
related to anything from watering

532
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:19,918
environment nutrients yeah

533
00:18:18,319 --> 00:18:22,079
man none of those things are really

534
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,640
specific enough

535
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:26,879
and that's tricky about a lot of viruses

536
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,960
is they have really overlapping symptoms

537
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,640
some of them appear to be you know they

538
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,798
could be for all intents and purposes

539
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:35,440
look like a nutrient deficiency

540
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:36,720
um so chlorosis of leaves obviously

541
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,320
there's a lot of viruses that have like

542
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,720
intervenal chlorosis which could look

543
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:43,839
like a magnesium deficiency but

544
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,519
it's not and so one of the things

545
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:48,558
that you need to consider when you're

546
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:51,038
looking at your plants is is the

547
00:18:48,558 --> 00:18:52,319
distribution of the symptoms uniform

548
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,119
that is to say

549
00:18:52,319 --> 00:18:55,519
does

550
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:56,959
your entire crop look the exact same and

551
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:59,279
then you could maybe pinpoint something

552
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,200
like a nutrient deficiency or is it sort

553
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:03,200
of irregular you know sort of an

554
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,400
irregular distribution where one or two

555
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,400
plants are

556
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
showing the symptoms whereas the one

557
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
next to it may not so the plants won't

558
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
always show the symptoms if they have

559
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,640
the virus

560
00:19:11,599 --> 00:19:16,639
so we often get asymptomatic hoplite

561
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,320
viroid infections and so you'll have an

562
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,759
asymptomatic plant extra symptomatic

563
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:21,918
plant and will be a very clear

564
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:23,919
difference in the

565
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
size of the growth of the plant and then

566
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,600
one may have the chlorosis whereas the

567
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,919
others does not so

568
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,599
you're right it can be you know i mean

569
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,840
it's difficult to just walk in and see

570
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:36,240
like that's obviously a virus unless

571
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,279
it's sort of the one plant out of ten

572
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,960
and then you can be like okay it's

573
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:40,879
probably a virus because it's only

574
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,640
affecting this one plant

575
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:48,720
um and i don't see any obvious

576
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:50,640
insect or pathogen such as a fungi so

577
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,679
yeah it's um

578
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,520
challenging

579
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,480
sure and just to present a contrarian

580
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:57,918
view there um yeah it could also be you

581
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,000
know uh

582
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,440
essentially you know what you're saying

583
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,279
is if you see it

584
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,558
in one place in the room it's more

585
00:20:03,279 --> 00:20:06,000
likely to be a virus than something

586
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:07,359
that's affecting you know your whole

587
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,319
crop and that allows you to guess maybe

588
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:10,639
it's a

589
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,519
it's a virus uh it could also be you

590
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,600
know a fan your lighting the way the

591
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,038
airflow is through that space so there's

592
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:19,038
a bunch of things you still have to

593
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:21,279
check off

594
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:22,640
and it all because also could be uniform

595
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:25,599
in the sense that maybe all your plants

596
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:28,480
are infected it sounds like so yeah

597
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:30,158
um yeah so yeah so what do i do as a

598
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,558
grower you know i want to talk about

599
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:34,400
some of these other viruses but um you

600
00:20:32,558 --> 00:20:35,839
really got me thinking like okay

601
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,000
if i see something going in my room i

602
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:41,359
can't identify i want to check virus off

603
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,960
the list um or hops late in this case um

604
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:44,879
what do we do like what if we were if we

605
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,558
wanted to work directly with you guys at

606
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,400
uh three rivers um how would that work

607
00:20:48,558 --> 00:20:52,000
yeah so we have a testing kit that we

608
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,559
would send out to you

609
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,798
so the testing kit is a test tube

610
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:59,599
uh small testing filled with a

611
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:03,279
stabilization buffer so this

612
00:20:59,599 --> 00:21:05,599
the vast majority of plant viruses are

613
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,918
single stranded rna viruses and so

614
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:10,959
that's got i think approximately 75 of

615
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:12,960
known plant viruses are rna-based so rna

616
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,038
is not a particularly stable molecule as

617
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:18,400
i mentioned with cucumber mosaic virus

618
00:21:15,038 --> 00:21:19,679
it's very unstable so they're unstable

619
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,240
um so

620
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:25,200
this buffer helps preserve you know any

621
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:28,480
viruses that may be in the sample and so

622
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,880
when you do the sampling the

623
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,240
if you have symptomatic tissue

624
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,120
you would take

625
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,839
a small clip of that symptomatic tissue

626
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:40,479
so we only need 100 milligrams somewhere

627
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:42,079
between 50 and 100 milligrams so for

628
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,720
frame of reference that's roughly the

629
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:46,558
size of a penny a nickel you know so

630
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,759
sort of between a penny and a quarter i

631
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,639
guess would be the

632
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:53,440
range of a leaf that you would need to

633
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,960
chop up and the more you're able to chop

634
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,000
it up into little bits the better that

635
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,798
the

636
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,038
stabilization solution can penetrate the

637
00:21:58,798 --> 00:22:02,480
tissue and preserve any any virus that's

638
00:22:01,038 --> 00:22:03,759
there

639
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,440
you then put that in the fridge

640
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:09,279
overnight it allows for the the buffer

641
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,759
again the stabilization buffer to

642
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:13,918
penetrate the tissue and preserve any

643
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,119
rna viruses that might be there

644
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,559
so then after it's been in the fridge

645
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:17,599
overnight you would just mail it back to

646
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:19,678
us

647
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:20,879
at which point i would then run the the

648
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,720
pcr

649
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,320
so from there i just extract the rna

650
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,240
and we do an rt pcr to to test for for

651
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:31,839
the uh to detect any viruses that might

652
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,159
be present in that sample

653
00:22:31,839 --> 00:22:36,158
if you don't have symptomatic tissue but

654
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,919
you are concerned of an infection or

655
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,880
you're doing routine testing just to be

656
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,000
sure

657
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,159
um you would use young t lease tissue

658
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,919
so just an emerging leaf

659
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,520
same protocol from there 50 to 100

660
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:49,759
milligrams so about a penny to a quarter

661
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,359
size of the leaf close to the petiol is

662
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:52,720
also is also

663
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:55,439
better

664
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,839
so these viruses typically travel in the

665
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,720
phloem or the plasmodesmata between

666
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:59,918
cells

667
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,679
so they're pretty pretty much going

668
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,679
where the nutrients go so

669
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,679
oftentimes we find better diagnostics in

670
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,038
the young tissue that said i mean if

671
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:09,280
your symptomatic tissue is an older

672
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,079
tissue and that that we found that works

673
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,359
just fine as well so very small amount

674
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:15,918
of tissue

675
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:17,918
because it's from a leaf

676
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,720
and it's destroyed in this buffer so

677
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:22,480
there's very very it's considered hemp

678
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:24,400
for the purposes of delivery

679
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:26,960
because there's little to no thc and

680
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,480
it's a very small sample um so we don't

681
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:30,558
have any any um

682
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,159
we haven't had any troubles there

683
00:23:30,558 --> 00:23:33,119
i'm glad you touched on the mail aspect

684
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
because that was something that i

685
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:36,558
brought up with your colleagues and they

686
00:23:34,558 --> 00:23:38,240
mentioned that the sample is destroyed

687
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:40,399
essentially um

688
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,599
by the way it's a biological sample yeah

689
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
and uh

690
00:23:41,599 --> 00:23:46,719
so there's no real risk there as far as

691
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:48,240
you guys are concerned um

692
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,240
one question is what does this sort of

693
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,038
thing cost approximately i know there's

694
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,200
a range based on volume but

695
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,079
right yeah so we do offer bulk discounts

696
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,400
on orders over 10 but right now for an

697
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:03,439
individual hot latent test it's 75

698
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:05,919
canadian so that's about a 20

699
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,679
discount for u.s customers that's um

700
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,840
because yeah we are based

701
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:12,080
out of british columbia out of vancouver

702
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:14,000
british columbia but we have a facility

703
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:16,960
a testing facility in washington and

704
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,400
we're opening up one in california

705
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:23,360
um the

706
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:25,440
75 for the hop latent that's about 60 us

707
00:24:23,359 --> 00:24:27,119
if you want to do the full virus panel

708
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,320
which we test for eight viruses

709
00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:30,558
currently

710
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:32,000
and that's expanding sort of we've got

711
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:33,678
our ear to the ground regarding

712
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,679
professors working on finding more

713
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,159
viruses and we're looking into some of

714
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,840
our cells that that um appear to have

715
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:41,200
virus symptoms that don't appear to be

716
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:43,278
one of the major ones that we have so

717
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,798
far so um so it's expanding so we have

718
00:24:43,278 --> 00:24:46,558
about eight yes we have eight viruses

719
00:24:44,798 --> 00:24:49,359
now in the full panel

720
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:53,278
and that costs 150 canadian

721
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:53,278
which is approximately 120 us

722
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,360
okay and uh

723
00:24:55,759 --> 00:25:00,079
you know how many samples would i need

724
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,558
to send in to get a really good idea of

725
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:04,558
if my plants have

726
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:06,480
you know a particular virus can i send

727
00:25:04,558 --> 00:25:08,319
in one sample if i think i just see it

728
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,720
in one area or if i just want to test a

729
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:12,240
room i realize sending in one sample of

730
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:13,360
a room that's asymptomatic or

731
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,200
potentially

732
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:17,759
free isn't really going to

733
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:21,519
you know be statistically significant

734
00:25:17,759 --> 00:25:23,200
right right so it's it's um

735
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,798
so yeah if you have symptomatic plants

736
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,240
obviously the symptomatic plants should

737
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:29,440
be tested

738
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,960
from there uh typically

739
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,120
for statistically significant you'd have

740
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,360
to do a lot of testing to get sort of to

741
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:37,678
a 90 95 confidence interval you'd have

742
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:39,759
to do you know a significant amount of

743
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:41,919
testing so it's it's good to sort of

744
00:25:39,759 --> 00:25:43,359
identify where the possible entry points

745
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,200
of the infection might be so if you

746
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:46,959
think it came from a mother like if you

747
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,480
have a really widespread infection it

748
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,038
may be coming from your mother plant so

749
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,919
it's good a good place to test

750
00:25:51,038 --> 00:25:54,240
um

751
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,480
to see if you're spreading it through

752
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,240
through propagation if you think it came

753
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,079
in from

754
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,079
sort of an acid infection you know if

755
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:04,079
it's only in one part of the facility

756
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:07,199
plants sort of spread out around that

757
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:08,798
area are a great place to start

758
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,480
so if you have a few symptomatic plants

759
00:26:08,798 --> 00:26:12,558
you can start there and then if you get

760
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,480
some if we find positives you can then

761
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:16,399
expand the search to figure out the

762
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,798
extent of the infection

763
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,720
one thing that's important to note

764
00:26:18,798 --> 00:26:22,400
is that we

765
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,880
with it with a hot blatant thyroid

766
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,440
sometimes the virus tighter is too low

767
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,960
so the concentration of the virus is is

768
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,759
there but it's just too low to detect

769
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:33,679
with even with the most sensitive pcr

770
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,079
so we typically recommend

771
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,038
that you do multiple tests to ensure a

772
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,038
negative

773
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:40,798
so we have and it's it's sort of

774
00:26:39,038 --> 00:26:41,679
industry practice to do three to four

775
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:43,440
tests

776
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,720
um on a negative to ensure that it's

777
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,840
negative

778
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,360
and we try and you know you want to

779
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:49,759
spread those two

780
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:52,479
approximately two weeks apart

781
00:26:49,759 --> 00:26:55,440
so some viruses also are more prevalent

782
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,038
in certain stages of plant development

783
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,278
and so that's why we use the younger

784
00:26:57,038 --> 00:27:01,759
tissues the younger leaf tissues because

785
00:26:59,278 --> 00:27:04,880
it's sort of one of the best testing

786
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:06,798
locations just from from other crops

787
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,960
for uh for the development of the plant

788
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:10,079
but um so yeah so going back to your

789
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,000
question

790
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:13,678
it's gonna it just sort of depends on

791
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,919
whether you're seeing symptoms whether

792
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,480
you're just doing a confirmation to

793
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:20,480
assure your your facility is clean um

794
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,720
how big your facility is um but

795
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,399
obviously wherever your your your

796
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,480
cloning from your mother stocks those

797
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,759
will probably be your um if you have a

798
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,558
clean if you think your facility is

799
00:27:27,759 --> 00:27:32,158
clean um doing routine testing on those

800
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,000
mother stocks is a good idea just to

801
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,200
make sure that they are clean and then

802
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
if you have something like an aphid

803
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:39,519
infection you should definitely cons you

804
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,440
mean it's worth thinking about whether

805
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:42,558
or not those aphids may have brought in

806
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,080
a virus

807
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,918
and so so testing

808
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:48,798
uh around where the day if an infection

809
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,480
was first observed things like that

810
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,639
and then lastly if you're bringing new

811
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,319
genetics in um

812
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,960
it's really good practice to quarantine

813
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:58,398
those not put them straight next to your

814
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,079
you know not not put them straight into

815
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:01,359
production but quarantine any new

816
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,278
genetics

817
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:04,240
and test those you know multiple times

818
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:05,759
just to make sure that they come up

819
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,000
negative before putting those into

820
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,079
production um so you don't spread you

821
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,319
know from from from a new new or a new

822
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:13,759
variety that you bring in

823
00:28:12,319 --> 00:28:17,038
okay you guys are primarily testing

824
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:18,640
plants and veg too is that correct

825
00:28:17,038 --> 00:28:20,798
i'm sorry what's that you're primarily

826
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
testing plants that are still in their

827
00:28:20,798 --> 00:28:24,720
vegetative state um

828
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,640
right flower right yeah that's primarily

829
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,079
what's yeah that's right

830
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,960
yeah so this is yeah primarily for

831
00:28:28,079 --> 00:28:32,558
vegetative growth um yeah please please

832
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,519
don't try and send us anything from the

833
00:28:32,558 --> 00:28:36,960
flower um because yeah the uh

834
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:39,759
the fact that we're using leaf tissue

835
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,759
and uh tissue by the petiole it's very

836
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:42,879
it's it's little to no thc which which

837
00:28:41,759 --> 00:28:45,519
makes it

838
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,200
hemp for for regulatory purposes

839
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,558
so yeah right now we're not doing so we

840
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,319
do offer

841
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:52,398
beyond just virus testing we do offer

842
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:54,960
fungal testing too for for pcr or

843
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:56,798
identification of certain fungi but um

844
00:28:54,960 --> 00:29:00,640
we don't we only do that for vegetative

845
00:28:56,798 --> 00:29:02,079
tissues so root and root stem and leaf

846
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,600
okay yeah i asked that because you know

847
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:04,879
a lot of these things

848
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:06,480
i know it's really easy to have a

849
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,120
healthy looking veg plant and then a lot

850
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:11,360
of these issues seem to crop up in flour

851
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:13,199
uh especially late flower that's sort of

852
00:29:11,359 --> 00:29:15,918
like the test for how good of a grower

853
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,480
you are in a lot of ways i feel like so

854
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,720
you know are we is it pretty obvious

855
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,558
in veg or what like let's say i noticed

856
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,079
an issue in flower would i then go back

857
00:29:22,558 --> 00:29:26,000
to my next round of clones and that's

858
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:27,918
where i would want to test and just say

859
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,440
okay these these are done i'm not i'm

860
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,559
not trying to find out if the virus is

861
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,720
in these

862
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:35,599
my flowering crop for this cycle

863
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,519
um you know how would you approach that

864
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:38,879
got it um yeah so

865
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:40,960
you can yeah you approach it one two

866
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,960
ways and it's it's the the way that you

867
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,399
had mentioned is uh not a not a bad

868
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,558
method so if you think there's a virus

869
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,918
and you're you're at the flowering stage

870
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:52,319
and testing your next uh batch of clones

871
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,640
uh you can start there we can you know

872
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:56,398
we can still test uh leaf material from

873
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,840
a flowering crop

874
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:59,839
um

875
00:29:57,839 --> 00:30:01,119
it's yeah i mean i mean because we're

876
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:03,519
using you know

877
00:30:01,119 --> 00:30:06,158
as long as it's leaf you know far far

878
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,480
away from the flower and the thc content

879
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,240
should still be pretty low um but yeah

880
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,079
typically we prefer to test stuff from

881
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,519
vegetative plants so the next round of

882
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:14,398
plants would be would be a good place to

883
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:15,839
start

884
00:30:14,398 --> 00:30:17,759
um

885
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:20,480
regarding

886
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:21,839
the infection levels so oftentimes so so

887
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,960
for something like lettuce chlorosis

888
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,720
virus

889
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,319
they found that the

890
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,480
infected

891
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:31,038
the infected clones developed symptoms

892
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:33,120
much earlier than the

893
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:34,720
uh originally you know the patient zero

894
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:35,759
so to speak the originally infected

895
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
mother

896
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:38,879
so

897
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,640
when you are making the clones from

898
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,399
whatever plant you you

899
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,000
suspect as a virus

900
00:30:42,398 --> 00:30:47,519
you may actually see the symptoms

901
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,278
earlier in the next in the next batch so

902
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:50,798
that's sort of another

903
00:30:49,278 --> 00:30:52,640
test i guess you could say if you did

904
00:30:50,798 --> 00:30:54,480
see something virus-like towards the

905
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:56,399
flowering stage you may end up seeing

906
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,720
symptoms earlier in the next

907
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:00,959
growth cycle or or the one following

908
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,480
that so these these problems the level

909
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:05,278
of virus typically

910
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,200
compounds over time and so

911
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,519
yeah the uh as far as the testing goes

912
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,278
we can test either but um you know

913
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,359
before you go through a whole another

914
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:14,640
grow cycle it's uh it's probably a good

915
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:16,240
idea to try and test some of those those

916
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,679
early early plants from from the next

917
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,200
gem

918
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,798
okay and and i know your numbers are

919
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
probably skewed a little bit because

920
00:31:20,798 --> 00:31:24,720
people um

921
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,720
you know are more likely to reach out if

922
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:29,519
they if they have an issue

923
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,399
but yeah you know what approximately

924
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:34,720
what percentage do you think of the test

925
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,959
that you guys run come back with some

926
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,839
virus or viroid

927
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,440
so

928
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:41,599
you're right that our testing numbers

929
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
are skewed um towards people who think

930
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,240
they have symptoms and we are still sort

931
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,759
of early

932
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:47,359
in our commercial aspect so we started

933
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:49,679
selling tests back in march we've been

934
00:31:47,359 --> 00:31:50,479
three months in

935
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,240
and

936
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,240
for growers sending us in there's only

937
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:56,319
been one time where everything came up

938
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,640
negative um so we're typically finding

939
00:31:56,319 --> 00:32:00,398
hot blatant uh you know in a lot of

940
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,038
growers in the pacific northwest

941
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:04,959
regarding how many strains

942
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:06,319
um per

943
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,759
um

944
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,398
regarding how many strains per per

945
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:12,158
grower it's it sort of varies uh

946
00:32:10,398 --> 00:32:15,439
depending on whether or not they they

947
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:16,960
have a worse infection um or not and to

948
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,159
sort of by random sampling and sort of

949
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,519
our sampling numbers are probably too

950
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,200
small to get any sort of meaningful

951
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
numbers from there but yeah we are

952
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,880
seeing you know the people that send us

953
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,399
some symptomatic samples um all but one

954
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,120
so far has come up positive for

955
00:32:28,398 --> 00:32:33,759
something mostly hot blade

956
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:36,479
so it's pretty prevalent

957
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,240
that's really interesting um

958
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
that just that kind of surprises me a

959
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,919
little bit but um

960
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,360
yeah and i mean it really just go to

961
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,720
your point that it's sort of skewed at

962
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:46,000
this point because we are you know

963
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,919
mostly having people reach out with

964
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,278
something that's symptomatic sure but it

965
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,480
tells you there's a level of prevalence

966
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:54,798
that's higher than i would have

967
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,798
speculated before talking to you um

968
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:58,398
absolutely yeah in the northwest and i

969
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,080
mean it's it's known sort of in

970
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,158
california too it's the west coast i

971
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:04,558
guess and i mean hopley and viroid is

972
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,760
worldwide i mean it was found and i

973
00:33:04,558 --> 00:33:08,319
can't remember when it was originally i

974
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:11,038
beat and hops i think 70s or 80s but i

975
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,119
mean it has a worldwide distribution

976
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:15,440
um i think this reports populating

977
00:33:13,119 --> 00:33:17,439
positives and cannabis coming from

978
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,360
from uh i think it's new z12 so it's

979
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,519
it's and we're trying to start doing

980
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:24,158
some testing uh for for you know other

981
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,159
other areas um but it's uh it's

982
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:27,679
definitely there and i mean part of the

983
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,200
problem is that

984
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,798
it's not been

985
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,640
you know because because canada's

986
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:35,359
finally coming out of uh out of the

987
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:37,360
shadow so to speak um we now have the

988
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:39,199
ability to test for it so previously you

989
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:40,879
might have just assumed

990
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,159
some sort of variation

991
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,360
due to any number of other other

992
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,039
reasons you know we had mentioned

993
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,879
earlier how it can be

994
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,879
tricky to just walk in and point out a

995
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,559
plant say that one has a virus

996
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,799
because a lot of times the symptoms can

997
00:33:52,558 --> 00:33:57,038
overlap with other things

998
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:58,960
and also the the symptoms of a virus

999
00:33:57,038 --> 00:34:00,720
sometimes don't manifest until an

1000
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,919
environmental stress occurs so you may

1001
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,120
just chalk it up to the environmental

1002
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,120
stress and

1003
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,199
before you know before now when things

1004
00:34:05,119 --> 00:34:08,480
were sort of operating in the shadows it

1005
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,838
was easier to do that because you didn't

1006
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,199
even have the tools to test for the

1007
00:34:09,838 --> 00:34:12,239
viruses so

1008
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,039
um

1009
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,519
it's

1010
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:16,878
not uncommon i mean as other industries

1011
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:19,519
where especially with clonally

1012
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:20,960
propagated crops

1013
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:22,320
until you until they started looking for

1014
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,159
viruses they didn't realize how big the

1015
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,359
problem was so potato and strawberries

1016
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:29,039
or industries

1017
00:34:25,358 --> 00:34:30,319
um that had a lot of virus issues uh

1018
00:34:29,039 --> 00:34:31,279
prior to

1019
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,599
sort of

1020
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,200
industry-wide testing practices so it is

1021
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:40,240
somewhat alarming the first time you

1022
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,239
hear it but it's not really

1023
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,678
all that unsurprising when you sort of

1024
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:45,519
look at sort of the landscape of

1025
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,280
agriculture and just how

1026
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:49,519
sure how easy it is to accidentally

1027
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,800
spread these things and and how you know

1028
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:53,679
genetics were just sort of being passed

1029
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,839
around previously okay okay so if we see

1030
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,800
in a forum someone posted a photo uh

1031
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:58,639
which

1032
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
you know like facebook or instagram and

1033
00:34:58,639 --> 00:35:02,400
people start saying oh that's tmv oh

1034
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,240
that's hot blatant viroid

1035
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,519
you can pretty much uh

1036
00:35:04,239 --> 00:35:07,358
shut them down and tell them there's no

1037
00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,280
way they can possibly know that from a

1038
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:10,239
from a picture it actually takes genetic

1039
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
testing

1040
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:14,078
is that right yeah so you could yeah

1041
00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:16,799
some molecular testing so you can also

1042
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:18,960
do not for hot latent thyroid but for

1043
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,000
some viruses you can do protein testing

1044
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,119
it's less sensitive uh it's called elisa

1045
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,440
that's an enzyme linked immunoabsorbance

1046
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:29,838
i forget about the letter

1047
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,679
spectroscopy so it's a chlorometric

1048
00:35:29,838 --> 00:35:34,400
assay that basically measures

1049
00:35:31,679 --> 00:35:36,239
um the amount of protein virus viral

1050
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,160
protein present in a sample

1051
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:40,078
but essentially you have to send into a

1052
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:42,159
lab i guess is what i'm yeah what i want

1053
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,240
yeah out to people

1054
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:47,199
so that they don't uh they don't fall

1055
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:48,879
for that i guess in that regard um right

1056
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:51,598
there are i mean i think

1057
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,920
there's one sentence the least mosaicism

1058
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:56,320
that one's pretty

1059
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,720
i mean there's very few causes of sort

1060
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,640
of that kind of variegation and a leaf

1061
00:35:58,719 --> 00:36:02,639
other than a virus so that one but i

1062
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:04,639
mean then you don't know which virus

1063
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:05,759
because lots of viruses cause leaks

1064
00:36:04,639 --> 00:36:08,639
mosaics

1065
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,400
um and we don't see that we haven't have

1066
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:13,598
any scientific literature to see that in

1067
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:16,559
tmp yet can that be genetic though too

1068
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,680
or is that always viral related

1069
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:19,440
so

1070
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,838
there are tropical plants that are

1071
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,519
naturally variegated with sort of a

1072
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:28,078
mosaic-like leaf um but

1073
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:30,159
it's very rare for that to be you know

1074
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:32,000
as far as as far as cannabis goes

1075
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,399
there's no reports that i know of of a

1076
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,519
specific gene that if it gets you know

1077
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,440
mutated causes mosaicism so

1078
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:42,719
and even if there was it would only

1079
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,320
affect a small portion of the plant

1080
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:46,159
unless it happened very very very very

1081
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:49,920
early in that plant's development it

1082
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:52,159
also would only affect that one plant so

1083
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,280
to chalk it up to genetics is

1084
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:58,399
far less likely than the odds of a virus

1085
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,320
so okay and it's so it's so

1086
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,400
unlikely that you can you can almost

1087
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,640
rule it out but uh because i don't have

1088
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,639
any any scientific information regarding

1089
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,559
you know genes that cause leaf mosaics

1090
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:09,759
and cannabis i don't want to just

1091
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:12,480
just sort of

1092
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,040
rule it out completely but

1093
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,679
okay uh yeah another question i had for

1094
00:37:15,039 --> 00:37:20,159
you are you have you aware of any

1095
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:22,399
uh viruses that could possibly cause a

1096
00:37:20,159 --> 00:37:24,319
plant to hermaphrodite or produce seeds

1097
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,320
in a female plant

1098
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,720
that's a great question um so i don't

1099
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:30,720
know of any particular virus that would

1100
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:33,039
cause that however

1101
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:37,480
you know i mean hermaphroditis

1102
00:37:33,039 --> 00:37:37,480
or hermaphroditicism that's my food

1103
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,480
it's often

1104
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,880
triggered by

1105
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:46,480
environmental stressors

1106
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,680
um so

1107
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,480
you know i mean there's certain strains

1108
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:51,598
that are more predispos predispose oh

1109
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,719
man i'm struggling where it's

1110
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,559
predisposed to hermaphrodites than

1111
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,759
others sure

1112
00:37:56,559 --> 00:38:00,320
but still it usually takes an

1113
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,720
environmental cue to trigger that

1114
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,760
so the virus if you had a viral

1115
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:06,078
infection

1116
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,400
it could make the plant more stressed

1117
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,000
and result in that but at this point you

1118
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,200
know i don't have any scientific data to

1119
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,480
back that up

1120
00:38:11,199 --> 00:38:13,679
it's going to be

1121
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,440
i think that will be an interesting area

1122
00:38:13,679 --> 00:38:16,480
of study for for some of these academic

1123
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,838
institutions that are working on

1124
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,838
cannabis now

1125
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,119
yeah so uh you know we've talked a

1126
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:26,159
little bit about hops latent and

1127
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,079
uh

1128
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:30,480
tmv are there other

1129
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:31,680
viruses that you know you'd like are

1130
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,079
viroids that you think are worth

1131
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:35,679
highlighting

1132
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,640
uh yeah i mean

1133
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:38,719
so

1134
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:41,279
they

1135
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:44,078
i mean okay there's a whole group um of

1136
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:44,839
viruses the viroids so far there's no

1137
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:48,160
other

1138
00:38:44,838 --> 00:38:49,838
viroid found in cannabis as of yet

1139
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:52,639
there's only 40

1140
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:55,599
roughly 40 viroids worldwide it's sort

1141
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:56,799
of another area sort of growing now now

1142
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,039
that people are looking for it with

1143
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,960
next-gen sequencing

1144
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:04,559
but for viruses

1145
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,119
the ones that we know are symptomatic

1146
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:09,358
would be so alfalfa mosaic virus causes

1147
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
leaf mosaicism and stunting

1148
00:39:09,358 --> 00:39:14,319
it's a pretty common virus so you know

1149
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,639
agriculturally that one's relevant

1150
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:18,800
cucumber mosaic virus is another

1151
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:20,799
worldwide distribution virus very common

1152
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,880
in the agricultural field

1153
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:27,039
cucumber mosaic has been shown to cause

1154
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,400
weak mosaic and dwarfing in cannabis

1155
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,320
um

1156
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,320
these are you know alfalfa mosaic and

1157
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,559
cannabis or sorry alfalfa mosaic and

1158
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,880
cucumber mosaic uh

1159
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:40,159
both can be transmitted by aphids

1160
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,280
um but then also mechanical transmission

1161
00:39:40,159 --> 00:39:42,879
and so

1162
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,000
uh i think

1163
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,280
you know i mean that the the

1164
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,800
transmission

1165
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,400
mode is important here because if you

1166
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,400
have an aphid infection then you might

1167
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,160
have you know alfalfa mosaic or cucumber

1168
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:54,240
mosaic uh

1169
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:57,199
lettuce chlorosis virus has been found

1170
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:58,879
in cannabis recently in israel

1171
00:39:57,199 --> 00:40:00,399
so far we haven't had any positives here

1172
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,640
for lettuce sclerosis and i don't know

1173
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,119
of any north american lettuce corrosive

1174
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:07,358
virus in cannabis however lettuce

1175
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:09,680
clorosis virus was originally found in

1176
00:40:07,358 --> 00:40:11,598
lettuce in california

1177
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:12,639
so we're sort of just on the lookout for

1178
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,920
that one

1179
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:15,920
but the different

1180
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,318
lettuce chlorosis virus the initial

1181
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,680
infection the natural infection is by

1182
00:40:18,318 --> 00:40:22,480
white flies

1183
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:26,159
so that's sort of a less common vector

1184
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:28,719
for us in the cannabis field so that one

1185
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:30,399
um you know unless we we get

1186
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:32,639
uh i think it's in hotter climates

1187
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,160
tropical climates that have sort of more

1188
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,118
whitefly

1189
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,239
uh

1190
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:37,519
problems

1191
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:40,078
but in the greenhouse i don't know if

1192
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:41,679
that one's going to be

1193
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:43,760
you know we haven't seen it yet teletub

1194
00:40:41,679 --> 00:40:46,239
chlorosis virus is something that causes

1195
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:48,240
uh stunting in early development

1196
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:50,639
but if it's a later later infection then

1197
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:53,598
yellowing chlorosis

1198
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:55,838
some necrosis drooping foliage foliage

1199
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:57,039
there's sort of a fat plant

1200
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:58,639
um

1201
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:00,960
there's

1202
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:02,960
i think in the in the southwest

1203
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:04,880
they're starting to see more beet curly

1204
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,199
top virus so this one's a little

1205
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,039
different than most plant viruses this

1206
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:12,000
one's a dna

1207
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:14,559
based virus not an rna based one

1208
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,239
but that one's transmitted initially by

1209
00:41:14,559 --> 00:41:18,799
leaf hoppers so that's sort of a

1210
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:20,799
specific vector to sort of

1211
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,599
tropical regions also so they're hot

1212
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,519
drier drier areas of the southwest i

1213
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:28,960
think in colorado they have more be

1214
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:30,800
curly top virus than elsewhere

1215
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:33,519
to be curly top

1216
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,440
is going to cause symptoms that are

1217
00:41:33,519 --> 00:41:38,000
again sort of you know similar to most

1218
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:41,519
it's uh you know leaf colorosis leaf

1219
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,760
curling the yellowing of leaves necrosis

1220
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:45,519
um so yeah a lot of these viruses have

1221
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,520
sort of overlapping symptoms

1222
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:49,280
um

1223
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,440
there's there's some other major ones so

1224
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,000
tobacco streak virus tobacco ring spot

1225
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:55,280
virus they known to cause symptoms in

1226
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:57,280
cannabis

1227
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,640
but so far these other viruses we've

1228
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,319
seen a much lower positive rate for so

1229
00:42:00,639 --> 00:42:06,879
um they haven't been as prevalent

1230
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:08,960
but for tobacco ring spot virus that

1231
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,640
one's transmitted by nematodes so this

1232
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,760
will be soil

1233
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:15,358
soil based vector so it's not as likely

1234
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,200
in a greenhouse to get a natural

1235
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:20,480
infection for tobacco ring spot it's

1236
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:22,639
more of an outdoor grow problem

1237
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:24,480
but again all of these viruses can be

1238
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:25,199
transmitted mechanically so if you're if

1239
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,599
you're

1240
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:29,118
if you're not fairly sterilizing your

1241
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,599
pruning tools effectively you can

1242
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,480
transmit or spread it um

1243
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,480
if it already exists in a plant

1244
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,000
so this this means if you are working on

1245
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,760
one plant you want to sterilize your

1246
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,039
equipment before moving to the next

1247
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,280
plant um it's pretty common practice in

1248
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:47,838
a lot of horticultural situations that i

1249
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:48,880
don't see carried out as as prevalently

1250
00:42:47,838 --> 00:42:51,119
in um

1251
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,599
cannabis

1252
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,599
yeah so we definitely encourage uh

1253
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:58,400
strongly encourage our clients and

1254
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,318
growers to to sort of

1255
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,000
take on some of those common practices

1256
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,279
from other agricultural industries such

1257
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,159
as that um

1258
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,280
that's

1259
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:08,879
you know the the the lack of sort of um

1260
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:10,400
sterilization is probably how some of

1261
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:13,838
these things spread in the first place

1262
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:16,639
and and so doing sort of due diligence

1263
00:43:13,838 --> 00:43:18,159
to try and limit the spread um

1264
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:20,719
that way if you do get a natural

1265
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:22,399
infection which is less common you know

1266
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:23,759
the primary mode of infection we're

1267
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,559
seeing is mostly just from clonal

1268
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,040
propagation and spreading it around so

1269
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:31,358
the natural infection seems seem

1270
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,039
less common and so if you're doing the

1271
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:34,719
due diligence of sterilizing your tools

1272
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:35,358
between plants and you're not spreading

1273
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:37,279
it

1274
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:39,598
limiting the infection then

1275
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:41,040
then you stand a better chance of of

1276
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,800
keeping these things sort of out of your

1277
00:43:41,039 --> 00:43:44,639
facility and then once you're in once

1278
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,400
they are in your facility and it's

1279
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:48,719
relatively easy to manage once you sort

1280
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:51,440
of put in these sort of sterile

1281
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,879
practices to avoid spreading it

1282
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,800
and cleaning up your genetics either

1283
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,838
with tc or bringing in new clean

1284
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,280
genetics

1285
00:43:55,838 --> 00:43:59,039
um so

1286
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,240
they're totally manageable if you do end

1287
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,519
up getting a positive which is another

1288
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:02,879
thing i sort of like to mention with

1289
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:04,559
people who do

1290
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:06,640
end up having a positive is it's not you

1291
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,719
know it's not time to panic it's it's

1292
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:10,159
just it takes some time to clean things

1293
00:44:08,719 --> 00:44:12,959
up but um

1294
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:16,480
it's totally manageable

1295
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,720
now in other crops do you see

1296
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,960
resistance to viroids in specific

1297
00:44:18,719 --> 00:44:23,759
cultivars or varieties

1298
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,440
is that a possibility in cannabis

1299
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,599
yeah so so for viruses absolutely

1300
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,079
there are certain

1301
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:33,760
cultivars that may have higher levels of

1302
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,839
resistance to

1303
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,240
a natural

1304
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,239
infection um

1305
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:43,039
so the again this is i said this a lot

1306
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:44,559
but it's one of those areas that would

1307
00:44:43,039 --> 00:44:46,960
be it's going to be really really

1308
00:44:44,559 --> 00:44:48,838
wonderful to have academic institutions

1309
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:51,838
begin to take up some of this research

1310
00:44:48,838 --> 00:44:53,279
because um it is entirely possible but

1311
00:44:51,838 --> 00:44:55,759
it takes a lot of you know a lot of

1312
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:58,000
effort and research money to sort of

1313
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:00,400
hunt down any cultivars that might have

1314
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,000
improved resistance um so you can sort

1315
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
of see that as sort of a fishing

1316
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,440
expedition where you're going out in the

1317
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:07,599
world trying to find any any cultivar

1318
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:09,920
that might have improved resistance to a

1319
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,559
natural infection

1320
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,400
um the alternative which a lot of

1321
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,719
industries use is genetic you know

1322
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,800
modification to to just

1323
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:21,439
skip all the fishing and just improve

1324
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:23,599
resistance right away

1325
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
but obviously there's a lot of you know

1326
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,079
sort of

1327
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,039
backlash to that still

1328
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,680
so naturally finding strength resistant

1329
00:45:29,039 --> 00:45:33,838
i know there's efforts for fungal

1330
00:45:31,679 --> 00:45:36,078
pathogens i know of an effort

1331
00:45:33,838 --> 00:45:38,159
to find resistance for powdery mildew at

1332
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,200
a academic institution that's working on

1333
00:45:38,159 --> 00:45:41,279
that

1334
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:44,078
essentially what they do is they um they

1335
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,480
take a resistant cultivar that doesn't

1336
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:48,000
have as frequent of an infection

1337
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,760
uh and then they can do genome-wide

1338
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,920
association studies so they look at the

1339
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,359
genome and try and find the obvious

1340
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:56,880
similarities among those that are

1341
00:45:55,358 --> 00:45:58,960
resistant compared to those that are not

1342
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,519
and try and figure out you know gene or

1343
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:03,440
gene usually it's multiple genes but try

1344
00:46:01,519 --> 00:46:05,599
and find uh reasons why you know trade

1345
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:07,440
those traits are conferred

1346
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:10,079
so it's totally possible it's sort of a

1347
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,920
longer term you know hope and project

1348
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,200
that definitely requires sort of the

1349
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,800
enlistment of

1350
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:16,559
sort of academic institutions to do some

1351
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:19,280
of the basic research behind that

1352
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:20,719
uh to sort of speed it along

1353
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,800
but it's possible

1354
00:46:20,719 --> 00:46:25,279
um viroids

1355
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:28,079
the viruses viruses have you know sort

1356
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,560
of three steps to their infection you

1357
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
know it's the

1358
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,880
entry to the cell whether it be

1359
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,400
by an insect or other

1360
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:39,200
and then releasing their protein coat

1361
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:40,838
which releases the genome into the cell

1362
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:43,279
and then replication of that

1363
00:46:40,838 --> 00:46:46,480
genome by

1364
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,480
most often by plant proteins will

1365
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:51,199
replicate the genome

1366
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,440
by you know just by happenstance

1367
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,199
some some plant viruses can replicate

1368
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,358
their own genome

1369
00:46:55,199 --> 00:47:00,159
but it's it's fewer i believe and then

1370
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:02,239
from there it's it's trans it's moving

1371
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:04,879
itself from one cell to another and so

1372
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:07,679
those three steps you can you can have

1373
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:09,920
traits of the plant that are able to

1374
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:12,078
stop it in its tracks

1375
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,039
one of the main ways the plants do this

1376
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,318
is

1377
00:47:13,039 --> 00:47:18,159
by silencing the rna of the virus so so

1378
00:47:16,318 --> 00:47:21,199
they have

1379
00:47:18,159 --> 00:47:23,759
a way to recognize double-stranded rna

1380
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:26,078
and target it for either

1381
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:28,240
degradation or prevent it from being

1382
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,920
translated into a protein

1383
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,598
so that's sort of the method that's most

1384
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,559
commonly employed in genetic engineering

1385
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:35,280
is

1386
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,559
is improving the silencing specific to a

1387
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,319
virus

1388
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:40,160
so it depends on the virus and how it's

1389
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:42,239
being moved from cell to cell

1390
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,679
and things like that as to where you

1391
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:45,358
want to stop it in its tracks and how

1392
00:47:43,679 --> 00:47:46,719
there might be traits that you can

1393
00:47:45,358 --> 00:47:49,119
select for

1394
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:50,239
viroids a little different because they

1395
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,960
don't

1396
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:55,279
they're so tiny the viroids can enter

1397
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:57,838
small they can thyroids can travel sort

1398
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:59,440
of spell the cell via phloem and and

1399
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:01,519
plasma does not

1400
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,280
without the same problems that viruses

1401
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:05,679
incur because they're larger

1402
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,160
and then viroids typically reside in the

1403
00:48:05,679 --> 00:48:09,598
nucleus where the plant host just

1404
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:11,920
replicates it

1405
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,880
um and then it sort of just diffuses

1406
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,119
from there

1407
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,559
um there are some viroids that exist in

1408
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:17,920
the chloroblast and are replicated there

1409
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:21,760
but there's less of those mostly during

1410
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:23,920
the nucleus but um in order to stop the

1411
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:27,359
replication of a viroid you would need

1412
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:29,039
to have um the rna silencing mechanism

1413
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,358
of the plant

1414
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:33,358
tailored to target that viroid and

1415
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:34,480
prevent it from from from being

1416
00:48:33,358 --> 00:48:36,799
replicated

1417
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,480
so silence it essentially that's a part

1418
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:42,480
of what's called the rna interference

1419
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:44,400
program implants so they have proteins

1420
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,000
that can specifically recognize certain

1421
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,000
sequences

1422
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:50,079
and they and they can uh silence them

1423
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,599
from being replicated so

1424
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:54,079
that's sort of the method that you would

1425
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,359
do that for viroids and i i mean you

1426
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:56,318
could do with genetic engineering i

1427
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:57,759
don't know

1428
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:59,519
i have not come across and i could

1429
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,040
probably look i i think i haven't come

1430
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:03,280
off now i think you covered it that's

1431
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:04,239
getting a little beyond uh

1432
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,480
sorry

1433
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:08,639
my academic level um

1434
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:10,639
so just just to kind of cover some of

1435
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:12,000
the highlights uh you know from today

1436
00:49:10,639 --> 00:49:14,799
just to make sure

1437
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,480
uh people catch it um essentially these

1438
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,480
viruses do exist in cannabis

1439
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:22,640
they are mainly trans plant or

1440
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:25,039
transported by

1441
00:49:22,639 --> 00:49:27,118
pests as a vector and also

1442
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:28,880
mechanical through like pruners clippers

1443
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:30,559
humans things like that

1444
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,240
um

1445
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:34,240
if you want to get it tested you guys

1446
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,838
offer those the testing i'm hoping to

1447
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,719
work with you guys soon on that i was on

1448
00:49:35,838 --> 00:49:38,159
the phone with a couple of your other

1449
00:49:36,719 --> 00:49:39,679
guys there about getting it set up on

1450
00:49:38,159 --> 00:49:40,399
our website too so i'm excited about

1451
00:49:39,679 --> 00:49:41,440
that

1452
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,280
um

1453
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:47,440
to offer that to our our customers um

1454
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:50,240
if you do have

1455
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:52,159
uh a virus or viroid in on your plants

1456
00:49:50,239 --> 00:49:54,719
um your real options there are to take

1457
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:56,879
it to seed which may help but not is not

1458
00:49:54,719 --> 00:49:59,519
a foolproof option or do tissue culture

1459
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,599
which is a podcast that i also just

1460
00:49:59,519 --> 00:50:03,519
recently uh recorded

1461
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:06,000
with someone from your company as well

1462
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:09,119
um and that's really the only surefire

1463
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:11,838
way to get a clean plant

1464
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,599
correct did that cover unfortunately

1465
00:50:11,838 --> 00:50:15,358
you covered it all and then yeah just

1466
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,640
unfortunately there's just no chemical

1467
00:50:15,358 --> 00:50:18,000
or

1468
00:50:16,639 --> 00:50:20,239
you know there's no vaccines for plants

1469
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:22,000
so um so yeah tissue culture and seed

1470
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:24,078
are the only way and some viruses still

1471
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,440
are transmitted via seed so depending on

1472
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,519
what it is we can we can work with you

1473
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,760
there um that's the options but yeah

1474
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:31,519
that is that's that's the gist of it

1475
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:33,200
oh and that this is not necessarily

1476
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:35,039
something that can be visually diagnosed

1477
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,279
in a lot of cases

1478
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:39,199
yeah yeah you may have

1479
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:40,960
a strong

1480
00:50:39,199 --> 00:50:42,399
you may have some strong supporting

1481
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:44,000
evidence that it could be a virus but

1482
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,559
you have no idea which one unless you

1483
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:49,358
get it tested um because they often have

1484
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,040
very similar symptoms across the viruses

1485
00:50:49,358 --> 00:50:52,239
well how important if we know we have a

1486
00:50:51,039 --> 00:50:54,400
virus how important is it that we

1487
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:55,679
identify the virus i mean does it really

1488
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,358
matter at that point isn't the treatment

1489
00:50:55,679 --> 00:51:00,159
going to be the same

1490
00:50:57,358 --> 00:51:01,519
true um so

1491
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:03,920
you know immediately if you think you

1492
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,280
have a virus it's best practice to

1493
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:07,119
quarantine that plant so it's not

1494
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,640
spreading the infection to neighboring

1495
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:10,880
plants

1496
00:51:08,639 --> 00:51:13,519
however

1497
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,000
plants will often go asymptomatic so if

1498
00:51:13,519 --> 00:51:18,000
you just remove the symptomatic plant it

1499
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,559
doesn't necessarily mean you've removed

1500
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,159
the entire infection in your facility

1501
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:24,480
so getting a positive diagnosis would

1502
00:51:22,159 --> 00:51:27,039
tell you a yes it's definitely a virus

1503
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,199
and then b you should consider doing

1504
00:51:27,039 --> 00:51:31,679
some testing on on neighboring or other

1505
00:51:29,199 --> 00:51:33,919
plants in that facility um to see if you

1506
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:37,118
have asymptomatic plants there and try

1507
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,000
and get a handle on the spread so it is

1508
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:40,880
still a valuable tool um

1509
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,159
and then

1510
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,400
it does give you some information

1511
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:46,239
regarding whether or not you can use

1512
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,160
seed to get rid of it

1513
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:51,039
or you're stuck with tc because some of

1514
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:52,719
the viruses are transmitted via seed

1515
00:51:51,039 --> 00:51:54,159
yeah and i would i would add i wouldn't

1516
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:55,838
recommend anyone makes an assumption

1517
00:51:54,159 --> 00:51:58,480
they have a virus i mean identifying

1518
00:51:55,838 --> 00:51:59,599
your problem is something that is the

1519
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:00,960
most important thing in terms of

1520
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:02,960
figuring out your mode of action or

1521
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:05,119
treatment i mean i know with insects

1522
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:06,720
suzanne has drilled into my head that uh

1523
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:08,559
you really have to identify the insect

1524
00:52:06,719 --> 00:52:10,399
even know how you're going to approach

1525
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:13,920
uh you know solving the problem because

1526
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:15,039
the treatments vary so much um

1527
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:16,079
i would say the same with viruses

1528
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:17,519
because it could turn out to be some

1529
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,039
other form of plant stress that just

1530
00:52:17,519 --> 00:52:20,239
displays in a way that looks similar

1531
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,679
enough that you may be making the wrong

1532
00:52:20,239 --> 00:52:23,679
assumption

1533
00:52:21,679 --> 00:52:25,039
that's true it's true and obviously

1534
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:26,399
nutrient deficiencies are not really

1535
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,480
something that

1536
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,760
we expect you know i mean growers

1537
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,599
usually have a really strong handle on

1538
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,119
their nutrients and things like that but

1539
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:35,838
um

1540
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,000
yeah it would it would be

1541
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:39,920
unwise to just assume

1542
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,159
you have a virus without getting a

1543
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:44,240
positive diagnosis from a lab

1544
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:46,000
to then you know give you

1545
00:52:44,239 --> 00:52:47,118
full information that you can go forward

1546
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,559
making the right decisions for your

1547
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,680
facility

1548
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,680
great well was there anything else that

1549
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,679
you want to share regarding uh you know

1550
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:58,318
viruses with our listening audience

1551
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,679
