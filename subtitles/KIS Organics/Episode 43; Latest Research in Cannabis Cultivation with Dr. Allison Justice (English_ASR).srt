00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,820
welcome to the cannabis cultivation in

3
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,309
science podcast

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,920
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:24,689
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,849
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:28,618
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:26,849 --> 00:00:30,660
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:28,618 --> 00:00:32,939
share their wisdom and knowledge my

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,950
guest this week is dr. Allison justice

11
00:00:32,939 --> 00:00:37,079
Allison graduated from Clemson

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,420
University with a PhD in plant and

13
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:40,950
environmental science during her time at

14
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,629
Clemson Allison taught greenhouse

15
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,550
management to undergraduate students

16
00:00:42,628 --> 00:00:47,280
where they focused on organic methods

17
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:49,378
and production Allison's dissertation

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,859
involved investigating the effects of a

19
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:55,198
beneficial Michel type organism piriform

20
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:57,590
of spora India where she learned that

21
00:00:55,198 --> 00:00:59,128
organic sustainable growing can be easy

22
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,780
cost-effective that produced

23
00:00:59,128 --> 00:01:03,179
aesthetically pleasing plants when done

24
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:04,890
properly through research Allison is

25
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,599
elevating the standards of cannabis

26
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,760
cultivation both indoors and in

27
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:10,379
greenhouse settings allison has worked

28
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:12,630
for outcault a vertically integrated

29
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:13,649
cannabis company in San Diego for the

30
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:16,259
past three years

31
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,509
Alco was one of the first companies to

32
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,579
integrate LEDs on mobile racking systems

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:22,709
this decision was backed by rigorous

34
00:01:20,579 --> 00:01:25,200
experimentation conducted with fluence

35
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:27,030
bioengineering allison has made a recent

36
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,090
move from San Diego back to South

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:32,310
Carolina where she is focusing on hemp

38
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,040
allison is a co-founder of SC botanicals

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:37,049
large-scale CBD extraction facility in

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,500
South Carolina and the hemp mine

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,970
Allison's 40-acre family hemp farm dr.

42
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,099
justice has been appointed to the

43
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:46,649
California industrial hemp advisory

44
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:49,319
board through May of 2020 she was also

45
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:52,109
named one of the 40 under 40 in cannabis

46
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:53,548
by marijuana venture magazine I'm really

47
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:54,929
excited to get her on the show today and

48
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,100
share some of the research that she's

49
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,270
been doing in cannabis all right hey

50
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,649
Allison thanks for coming on the show

51
00:02:00,269 --> 00:02:05,640
today yes thanks so much for having me

52
00:02:03,649 --> 00:02:07,618
why don't we start off by giving

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,038
listeners a little bit of a background

54
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:13,729
into into your life and how you got to

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:16,829
the role that you have now

56
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:20,389
absolutely so I guess it all goes back

57
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:24,090
to being a child and kind of having

58
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:25,949
being born with a green thumb so my

59
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:30,000
grandparents are cotton farmers in South

60
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:33,239
Carolina I grew up on a large ball and

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,969
burlap tree farm in Georgia you know

62
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,159
every summer every holiday I was busy

63
00:02:35,969 --> 00:02:40,919
playing with plants or you know digging

64
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:43,979
holes picking vegetables that sort of

65
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:46,349
thing and when it came time to pick a

66
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:49,319
degree absolutely

67
00:02:46,349 --> 00:02:50,069
it had to be horticulture so I did go to

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,449
Clemson

69
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:56,099
I received bachelors in horticulture

70
00:02:53,449 --> 00:02:58,399
after that it took a couple years off to

71
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:01,439
kind of figure out what I wanted to do

72
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,719
and also worked for our family tree farm

73
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,150
I started out very quickly but I wanted

74
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:10,800
to get back into the science you know I

75
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:13,379
wanted to discover more and so I went to

76
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,680
grad school for a plant environmental

77
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:20,209
science at Clemson as well to see my PhD

78
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,530
and I actually did a direct doctorate

79
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:28,170
after my PhD I started a consulting

80
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:31,500
company where I was mainly consulting

81
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:34,169
for IPM for large greenhouses across the

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:39,150
US and you know my grad student studies

83
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:42,689
were mainly on looking at organic

84
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:45,299
methods mainly looking at a in the fight

85
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:47,549
performance for an indica and how it

86
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:50,549
helps ornamental greenhouse plants take

87
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,260
up nutrients you know how it has the

88
00:03:50,549 --> 00:03:55,379
potential to fight off disease and even

89
00:03:52,259 --> 00:04:01,019
promote oxen for Reformation and

90
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:03,180
cuttings so you know I decided I wanted

91
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:05,069
to do some consulting to help these

92
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,129
companies implement microbes of

93
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,259
different sorts and actually develop a

94
00:04:08,129 --> 00:04:16,189
system of rearing beneficial nematodes

95
00:04:10,259 --> 00:04:18,149
because the nematodes as an organism are

96
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:20,310
very very good you know there's

97
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,899
different sorts of nematodes you know

98
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,720
starting NEMA carpet KC

99
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:27,120
starting with OPI that all attack

100
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,810
different insect pests

101
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,110
and so you know the way that you're able

102
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,629
to get these nematodes today are

103
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:39,930
basically in a brood and dried

104
00:04:36,629 --> 00:04:42,839
concoction and what a lot of the studies

105
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:47,579
were showing is that nematodes reared

106
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:49,349
inside of hosts usually wax worms were

107
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:53,639
more effective at fighting off different

108
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:56,460
paths yeah so I was teaching farmers how

109
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:59,879
to rear their own nematodes versus

110
00:04:56,459 --> 00:05:03,089
buying them you know in a dormant frozen

111
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:06,649
basically form you know as I was

112
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:09,179
consulting I eventually started getting

113
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:11,039
asked to consult for cannabis companies

114
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:14,819
which at the time you know live in South

115
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:17,879
Carolina I didn't necessarily consider

116
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:20,728
cannabis as an option absolutely

117
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:23,610
supported it but I just the career path

118
00:05:20,728 --> 00:05:25,709
for it was not clear to me and still

119
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:28,650
isn't for a lot of people here in South

120
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:30,060
Carolina which is why I did develop an

121
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:33,509
internship program which we can talk

122
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,728
about later if you'd like but it started

123
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,620
getting you know questions from cannabis

124
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:41,000
growers started consulting and so very

125
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:43,590
quickly that you know it was a rising

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,810
industry and an industry that needed

127
00:05:43,589 --> 00:05:49,859
science and that was very very

128
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:53,399
interesting and so eventually I was

129
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:57,479
asked to come out and visit out Co in

130
00:05:53,399 --> 00:06:00,418
San Diego and was offered a job I really

131
00:05:57,478 --> 00:06:03,360
had no intentions to move but it was a

132
00:06:00,418 --> 00:06:07,620
good offer and just just the science

133
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:11,460
that I could I could achieve very

134
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:14,750
quickly with cannabis just seemed so fun

135
00:06:11,459 --> 00:06:18,750
honestly and so I did move to San Diego

136
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:19,439
I have actually just moved back to South

137
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,418
Carolina

138
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:25,379
but I was in San Diego for about three

139
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:27,538
years as a vp of cultivation there I I

140
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,060
still actually am vp of cultivation for

141
00:06:27,538 --> 00:06:32,449
outcault but in the meantime you know

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:36,089
during those three years about a year in

143
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:39,000
South Carolina passed the bill to grow

144
00:06:36,089 --> 00:06:40,709
him and so my family being all farmers

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,870
already having land and

146
00:06:40,709 --> 00:06:45,418
green houses I encourage them to apply

147
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:48,538
for a planet and they actually got one

148
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:52,379
of the first 20 licenses given in South

149
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:54,209
Carolina to grow hemp and so that was

150
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:57,779
exciting and you know we went down the

151
00:06:54,209 --> 00:07:00,569
road of cultivation but then you saw

152
00:06:57,779 --> 00:07:02,519
very quickly well there's no one here to

153
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:05,819
extract and the people that are coming

154
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:09,029
in state and offering extraction

155
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,728
services 99 percent of them were

156
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:14,159
basically shark and you know saying oh

157
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:15,598
we'll give you $5,000 an acre for your

158
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,550
crop you know we'll buy it right now

159
00:07:15,598 --> 00:07:20,279
when in reality they should be making

160
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:23,098
you know at least a hundred thousand

161
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:24,779
dollars an acre so outcode being

162
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:29,060
vertically integrated you know already

163
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:32,788
had dr. Marcus Rogan a brilliant chemist

164
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,978
we decided to build an extraction

165
00:07:32,788 --> 00:07:39,029
facility here in South Carolina for CBD

166
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:42,149
for hemp extraction and partnered with

167
00:07:39,029 --> 00:07:45,569
my family's company outcault and as well

168
00:07:42,149 --> 00:07:48,000
as an investor of course and Bill I see

169
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:50,069
botanicals and so we extract they're not

170
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,889
only my family but other farmers across

171
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:57,089
South Carolina and you know as a part of

172
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:59,098
that extraction service you know I'm

173
00:07:57,089 --> 00:08:00,569
here to help with a lot of the planting

174
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:04,860
because if we're growing good plants

175
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,990
with high potency everybody's wedding so

176
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:11,069
here I stand back in South Carolina and

177
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:14,158
now with a lot of different things going

178
00:08:11,069 --> 00:08:17,610
on it's it's absolutely been an

179
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,839
interesting three plus years but I can't

180
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,080
tell you how much I've learned what

181
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:24,359
would this point single plant that's

182
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:26,158
that's so interesting because I was just

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,639
recently at that soil scientist meeting

184
00:08:26,158 --> 00:08:32,639
I told you about and Ron Turco with

185
00:08:29,639 --> 00:08:33,629
Purdue University was talking and he was

186
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,879
talking about how everyone was getting

187
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:37,979
into hemp right now and his big question

188
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:39,418
to him was what are you gonna do after

189
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,908
you've grown the hemp like how are you

190
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:43,379
gonna extract it there's no there's no

191
00:08:41,908 --> 00:08:45,240
one there's no infrastructure for that

192
00:08:43,379 --> 00:08:46,980
in a lot of these states so I think

193
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,750
you're gonna be filling a really

194
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,409
important need there at SC botanicals

195
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:54,330
that's great absolutely yeah a lot of

196
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:55,769
the states where we stand at him

197
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:57,690
you know it's already been in production

198
00:08:55,769 --> 00:09:00,028
for a number of years now like Oregon

199
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:02,760
and Washington you know it is the

200
00:09:00,028 --> 00:09:04,769
starting plants and it is the extraction

201
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:07,100
that's the bottleneck you know there's a

202
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:09,060
lot of good farmers out there but

203
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:11,610
propagation specialists so our

204
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:13,799
extraction specialist is is kind of

205
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:16,139
where the need is and so building those

206
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:19,500
companies is I think important right now

207
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:21,838
I told Leah gree I think it's great what

208
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,000
you guys are doing and I have to say

209
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:27,149
I've been I big a big fan of your work

210
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,399
now for a few years I actually heard

211
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:31,440
about you long before I met you because

212
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:34,230
of an article that was published talking

213
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,310
about how you were able to reduce

214
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:38,459
outcodes

215
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:40,708
expenses on the nutrient side by moving

216
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:42,989
away from essentially what we're calling

217
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:46,859
bottled nutrients or you know a branded

218
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:48,750
marketed nutrient line that's specific

219
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,129
for the cannabis industry would you be

220
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,320
willing to talk a little bit about that

221
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:57,149
process when you came into outcault and

222
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:58,528
how you made those changes yeah so you

223
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:01,470
know when I first got to outcode they

224
00:09:58,528 --> 00:10:03,689
were already in operation and so the

225
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,879
good first few months in my time was

226
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:10,020
just simply investigating what they were

227
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:12,269
already doing and comparing to you know

228
00:10:10,019 --> 00:10:15,569
methods I had been using previously with

229
00:10:12,269 --> 00:10:17,429
non cannabis crops and the first one

230
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:21,540
that really stuck out to me was these

231
00:10:17,429 --> 00:10:23,458
giant vat of liquid nutrients you know

232
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:25,949
with names of company companies I'd

233
00:10:23,458 --> 00:10:33,088
never heard of with silly pictures on

234
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:35,550
the front and basically you know

235
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:38,850
fertilizer labels that didn't make a lot

236
00:10:35,549 --> 00:10:42,809
of sense so as I start digging through

237
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:46,920
it there's a lot of as you know there's

238
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:50,219
a lot of magic and special sauce that

239
00:10:46,919 --> 00:10:52,559
fertilizer companies like to put into

240
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:56,100
their bottles but at the end of the day

241
00:10:52,559 --> 00:11:01,409
you know the plant needs its essential

242
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:02,699
nutrients that's it so over time you

243
00:11:01,409 --> 00:11:07,169
know through experimentation through

244
00:11:02,698 --> 00:11:07,789
research you know I found that cannabis

245
00:11:07,169 --> 00:11:11,689
is

246
00:11:07,789 --> 00:11:14,539
a plant of course as we know but it is

247
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:17,540
it's a special plant but it's a plant

248
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:21,589
that also is a plant and needs it 16

249
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:24,949
essential nutrients and you know as I

250
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:26,899
developed our own fertilizer recipe you

251
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:30,400
know what I found is it's very similar

252
00:11:26,899 --> 00:11:34,759
to point-seven tomato with a few tweaks

253
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:41,720
and you know it took me about three

254
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:43,819
years to to decipher what's going on but

255
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,490
I think as of this week I've just kind

256
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:48,140
of put together all the facts so I'm

257
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:51,620
gonna I'm gonna give you a little bit of

258
00:11:48,139 --> 00:11:55,490
my conspiracy theory of what's going on

259
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:58,820
with my bottled nutrient and you know

260
00:11:55,490 --> 00:12:03,980
the idea of levels of nutrients that are

261
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:06,530
needed so first let me just say you know

262
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:08,779
I did run through an experiment where a

263
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,699
controlled experienced experiment where

264
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:13,100
I'm looking at two different commercial

265
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:17,000
fertilizers very popular one every

266
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,220
everyone listening has known or used or

267
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,120
at least heard of not learning mean

268
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:24,850
names because I don't want to be that

269
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:28,070
person but you know when you actually

270
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:31,820
look at when you're able to compare

271
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:35,330
their recommendations versus what's

272
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:40,280
actually in the bottle it's it's really

273
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:44,420
flatter gasping what they're having you

274
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:49,039
apply one what I found was in the bottle

275
00:12:44,419 --> 00:12:51,289
one didn't match the label and two you

276
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:54,319
know compared to other plants the amount

277
00:12:51,289 --> 00:12:57,559
of mineral nutrients we're putting on is

278
00:12:54,320 --> 00:13:01,910
just outrageous I mean it's it's just

279
00:12:57,559 --> 00:13:05,239
plain horrifying and you know because of

280
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:09,409
this I think I think the organic side

281
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,950
you know with what you're doing actually

282
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:14,870
has more knowledge and more even though

283
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:16,310
it is extremely complicated when you're

284
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:19,340
getting you know lots and lots of

285
00:13:16,309 --> 00:13:21,229
organisms involved it's it's complicated

286
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:23,420
because a lot of cycling but

287
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:25,460
I think you almost have a better grasp

288
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:27,169
on what's going on than a lot of the

289
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:32,060
people that are using mineral nutrients

290
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:35,209
which is kind of backwards but I think

291
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:39,199
it's a push from the fertilizer

292
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:41,060
companies so and then I'll get back to

293
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:46,840
that but you know looking at my

294
00:13:41,059 --> 00:13:51,139
experiments nitrogen for a regular plant

295
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:56,360
should be you know 50 to maxing out in

296
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:58,730
the low 200s well one of these companies

297
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,560
specifically during the you know week

298
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,830
six or so they're getting up to about

299
00:14:00,559 --> 00:14:08,359
400 parts per million nitrogen double of

300
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:10,520
what any other plants possibly sees all

301
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:13,190
right and then you know with these

302
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,159
results I'm correlating with leaf tissue

303
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:18,530
samples and so with a nitrogen even

304
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:21,379
though you're applying twice as much as

305
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,939
what normal plant needs when you look at

306
00:14:21,379 --> 00:14:25,189
the results the amount of nitrogen

307
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,990
nitrogen this took up in the plant is

308
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:33,260
not double it's absolutely the same as

309
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:35,180
our control fertilizer which is 150

310
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:38,029
parts per million it's exactly the same

311
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:40,359
so where is that fertilizer going at the

312
00:14:38,029 --> 00:14:40,360
bottom

313
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:47,059
same thing for potassium same thing for

314
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:49,820
phosphorus phosphorus specifically is

315
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:53,209
you know very very bad for the

316
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:57,260
environment absolutely great for the

317
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:59,840
plant but the amount we are applying I

318
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:01,580
would say at least eighty eighty five

319
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:07,850
percent is going right at the bottom of

320
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:11,240
the pot you know some of the ways that

321
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:16,070
growers deal with this high EC is by

322
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:18,740
flushing and it's just not necessary the

323
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:20,420
reason you're having to flush is because

324
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:22,279
you're applying so much nutrients and if

325
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:25,370
you didn't your plant would absolutely

326
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:27,079
die that's obviously I say that's really

327
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,690
it's really interesting because I know

328
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,610
when we talked at photo X at that time

329
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,040
you were thinking it was primarily

330
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,050
phosphates that was leaching which is a

331
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:36,610
huge issue

332
00:15:35,049 --> 00:15:39,699
like you mentioned and something we've

333
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,259
discussed on on this podcast before from

334
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,528
a sustainability perspective but now

335
00:15:41,259 --> 00:15:48,039
you're seeing nitrates and potassium as

336
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:49,539
well and it sounds like it's everything

337
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:52,899
it's everything to send these

338
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:56,500
fertilizers you know compared to what

339
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:59,409
our control plant needed and compared to

340
00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:02,379
other fertilizer recipes every single

341
00:15:59,409 --> 00:16:07,600
thing that's being applied is at least

342
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:11,078
three times too much and I think it's

343
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,240
twofold one the growers are putting

344
00:16:11,078 --> 00:16:14,859
themself in a bind because they have

345
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,509
this idea that they need more

346
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:19,930
phosphorous and so they're applying

347
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:21,939
phosphorous and once you get over about

348
00:16:19,929 --> 00:16:24,189
you know hundred parts per million

349
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:27,850
phosphorous you're also precipitating

350
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:31,360
out your iron link and possibly calcium

351
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:33,639
and so you know if you're if you're

352
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,320
increasing your P you're also having

353
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:38,169
increased those others and so it's this

354
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,450
back and forth you know increase of

355
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:42,069
nutrients that's just not necessary and

356
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,470
the whole reason being because you've

357
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:48,310
put too much and you're it's not being

358
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,690
able to be taken up by the plant yeah

359
00:16:48,309 --> 00:16:52,869
that's that's really interesting because

360
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:55,930
we have this perception as growers that

361
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:58,209
the more we put on the bigger our plant

362
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:02,139
will grow and so people have this

363
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:04,149
tendency to continue to add nutrients

364
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:06,549
and a lot of it dates back to this

365
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:10,269
concept that plant that cannabis plants

366
00:17:06,549 --> 00:17:12,399
need nitrogen for veg and phosphorus for

367
00:17:10,269 --> 00:17:14,769
bloom leading back to a really popular

368
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,589
cannabis book that came out I think in

369
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:21,009
the 80s and so this this sort of myth

370
00:17:17,588 --> 00:17:22,088
has carried on for years and I do see

371
00:17:21,009 --> 00:17:23,859
that what you're saying here around

372
00:17:22,088 --> 00:17:26,139
especially around phosphorus being over

373
00:17:23,859 --> 00:17:31,000
applied it's a really common problem

374
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:34,210
with cannabis absolutely and so you know

375
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,880
I was trying to figure out what is the

376
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:39,058
reason what is the reasoning growers

377
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,919
think that they need so much phosphorus

378
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:44,470
with any other plant you know the low

379
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,470
would be eight parts with the high being

380
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:48,940
maybe fifteen parts per million and you

381
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:50,970
know with looking

382
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:52,920
these commercial fertilizer

383
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:56,980
recommendations they're putting on

384
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:59,860
upwards of 200 and the plant literally

385
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:03,130
cannot take up that much and so it's

386
00:17:59,859 --> 00:18:05,919
just being wasted and so I'm not gonna

387
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:09,220
take claim of this find but you know

388
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,390
we're talking with dr. Roy Heinz brine

389
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:18,819
core and Jim Barrett they found a study

390
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:20,820
from 1977 which I have no idea how they

391
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:23,829
perform the study in the United States

392
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:27,129
but it's called responses of greenhouse

393
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:30,939
growing cannabis to nitrogen phosphorus

394
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:34,330
and potassium and so you know it's an

395
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,610
interesting study but I'm worried that

396
00:18:34,329 --> 00:18:39,639
this is what's fact this whole

397
00:18:36,609 --> 00:18:41,229
phosphorus push you know if you're

398
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,140
reading it quickly and not necessarily

399
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:48,819
doing the math it looks like okay well

400
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:53,680
you need 150 parts per million applied

401
00:18:48,819 --> 00:18:55,089
to your plants and you know the the

402
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,180
normal person would think okay well

403
00:18:55,089 --> 00:19:01,179
that's every watering well if you dig a

404
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:04,630
little deeper which their materials and

405
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:08,470
methods are are pretty inadequately hard

406
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:10,990
to follow but you know what it's

407
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:16,000
actually talking about 150 milligrams

408
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:19,180
per kilogram of soil not 150 parts per

409
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,009
million per watering and so if you do

410
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,640
the math further it's actually equaling

411
00:19:21,009 --> 00:19:28,210
about 15 parts per million each watering

412
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,910
and so looking at their study they're

413
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:33,190
going from 15 parts per million being

414
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:36,820
the high application rate and keep in

415
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:39,279
mind that cannabis liquid fertilizer

416
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:40,379
companies are recommending about 200

417
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:44,379
parts per million

418
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:46,750
phosphorus their medium range with five

419
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:49,750
parts per million and their low was zero

420
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,970
and so as you would imagine when you

421
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:55,900
look through the data yeah they're

422
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:57,880
getting higher higher yields and flower

423
00:19:55,900 --> 00:20:00,340
and biomass they're getting higher THC

424
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:02,040
content which was only points Arts

425
00:20:00,339 --> 00:20:03,559
Project but

426
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:07,200
know what strengths they're growing but

427
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:09,059
it's really low anyway but if you're not

428
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,590
doing this math you're thinking wow wow

429
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:11,639
it's a really really increasing on

430
00:20:10,589 --> 00:20:14,759
phosphorus I'm gonna get higher

431
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:19,950
everything but it's only 15 parts per

432
00:20:14,759 --> 00:20:21,660
million and so you know by by reading

433
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:24,269
that study was it being the only one out

434
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,040
at that time you know that could have

435
00:20:24,269 --> 00:20:28,069
started started this crazy and there's

436
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:31,759
no doubt phosphorus does increase

437
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:34,349
flowering and freedom but what you know

438
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:38,190
how much do you have to use to actually

439
00:20:34,349 --> 00:20:40,859
get that and then the next thought is a

440
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:43,799
lot of plants out there will turn purple

441
00:20:40,859 --> 00:20:46,409
when there's phosphorus restriction that

442
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:50,639
was one of my studies in grad school was

443
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:54,000
looking at some patients and saying okay

444
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,520
well instead of applying plant growth

445
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,900
regulators like fundamentals ornamental

446
00:20:56,519 --> 00:21:02,220
growers do very consistently instead of

447
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,430
using PG ours

448
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:08,700
can we just apply less phosphorus not

449
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:11,460
inhibit flowering and get a smaller more

450
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:14,549
compact plant and so what we found was

451
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:18,120
if we use three parts per million the

452
00:21:14,549 --> 00:21:19,769
plant would be very stout not you know

453
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:22,889
long gangly which is great for our

454
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:26,609
little plant it did not inhibit

455
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:28,410
flowering but it was very very purple

456
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:31,229
you know it supposed to be a green plant

457
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,950
it was very purple and so did that

458
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:35,579
matter

459
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:38,340
well once we applied adequate phosphorus

460
00:21:35,579 --> 00:21:40,289
that ten parts per million it green

461
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:44,759
right up and then it's flowered normally

462
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:46,529
and so I wonder if I've heard lots of

463
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:50,400
people say this you know when the stems

464
00:21:46,529 --> 00:21:52,379
are turning purple or yeah well

465
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,150
understand the turning purple so it's

466
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,420
got to be a phosphorus deficiency and

467
00:21:54,150 --> 00:22:01,800
they need to add more phosphorus when

468
00:21:56,420 --> 00:22:06,690
one that's probably not the deficiency

469
00:22:01,799 --> 00:22:08,759
sign and and so you're actually just

470
00:22:06,690 --> 00:22:11,580
adding more salt and probably making

471
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,920
your problem worse simply it just being

472
00:22:11,579 --> 00:22:16,490
a stress maybe a stress just responds I

473
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,869
think some just earned naturally for

474
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:21,509
well could that be also related to

475
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:24,449
temperature I've seen purpling stems

476
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:27,690
most common commonly correlated with

477
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:29,909
cold temperatures which would allow less

478
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:33,808
as I understood that less movement of

479
00:22:29,909 --> 00:22:35,909
phosphorous and that's what was sort of

480
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:39,690
making that show up but are you seeing

481
00:22:35,909 --> 00:22:43,139
other reasons for purpling and stems you

482
00:22:39,690 --> 00:22:46,110
know I've definitely seen purpling

483
00:22:43,138 --> 00:22:47,758
increase with cold temperatures me this

484
00:22:46,109 --> 00:22:50,248
is a flower of leaves of stems

485
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:55,200
everything I'm specifically talking

486
00:22:50,249 --> 00:22:59,579
about times when me that the plan is

487
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,470
just stressed in general and growers

488
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:03,449
will just automatically associate that

489
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:05,100
with a phosphorus deficiency because of

490
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:06,990
that purple color

491
00:23:05,099 --> 00:23:09,480
not necessarily with coal temperature

492
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:11,490
but yeah absolutely plant the plants do

493
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,038
turn purple one if you drop the

494
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:17,970
temperature the one I hear the most is

495
00:23:14,038 --> 00:23:19,888
any time you see any chlorosis in the in

496
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:21,118
the leaves like in travail no chlorosis

497
00:23:19,888 --> 00:23:22,740
or anything like that it's always calm

498
00:23:21,118 --> 00:23:25,249
egg and then they're always adding

499
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:27,899
cal-mag because that's what's causing it

500
00:23:25,249 --> 00:23:30,839
is that one that you've you've heard of

501
00:23:27,898 --> 00:23:32,459
or seen a lot of - or well the cow

502
00:23:30,839 --> 00:23:37,558
magazine kind of throws me off a little

503
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:40,649
um you know because cal-mag it's it's

504
00:23:37,558 --> 00:23:42,928
not one nutrient right it's it's usually

505
00:23:40,648 --> 00:23:47,668
maybe calcium chloride and magnesium

506
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:50,429
sulfate and so you know when I see in

507
00:23:47,669 --> 00:23:53,940
Trevino chlorosis yeah I think it's a

508
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:55,470
magnesium deficiency potentially and so

509
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,639
I would want to you know do some

510
00:23:55,470 --> 00:24:03,269
increase of epsom salts but yes I think

511
00:23:59,638 --> 00:24:06,240
the general term people throw around you

512
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:07,649
know if cow mag is something that we

513
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,118
should think about you know are you do

514
00:24:07,648 --> 00:24:12,209
you need to increase that calcium and

515
00:24:09,118 --> 00:24:15,378
you need to crease the magnesium and you

516
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:18,690
know we should be a little smarter and

517
00:24:15,378 --> 00:24:20,668
be able to diagnose that and imply apply

518
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:23,999
the right nutrient versus just some

519
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:27,028
bottle of you know to mixed different

520
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:29,069
molecules that's a good point it's

521
00:24:27,028 --> 00:24:31,740
probably not calcium and and Magni

522
00:24:29,069 --> 00:24:34,349
and as I understand it cal-mag isn't

523
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:36,150
even typically the right ratio for what

524
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:37,859
plants need at least from what we're

525
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:40,560
aiming for on the organic side is a

526
00:24:37,859 --> 00:24:42,059
ratio between calcium and magnesium so I

527
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,980
think that's exactly what I think that's

528
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:47,970
a great point but one thing I wanted to

529
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:50,099
get back to was when you created your

530
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:52,259
own fertilizer can you talk just really

531
00:24:50,099 --> 00:24:54,299
quickly on the economic benefits of that

532
00:24:52,259 --> 00:24:57,960
for outcault when you guys made the

533
00:24:54,299 --> 00:25:02,159
switch oh absolutely absolutely and so

534
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,009
when we originally switched we were

535
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:09,390
actually saving twenty four times the

536
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:12,390
cost which is this you know if anybody

537
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:16,440
knows you know one of the biggest costs

538
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:19,020
is fertilizer I mean so you know just

539
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,840
paying for a brand is absolutely

540
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:24,119
ridiculous when you can go down to the

541
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,220
local agriculture store and get you know

542
00:25:24,119 --> 00:25:28,829
all of your ingredients that are tested

543
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,750
for heavy metals and pesticides and

544
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:34,199
whatever else she might be worrisome for

545
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:38,700
for absolutely pennies and I guess my

546
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:40,080
skeptical scepticism comes from one grad

547
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,539
school when you know we're it we're

548
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:45,779
asked to question everything but also

549
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:47,759
you know being raised on a farm when you

550
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:50,129
know you don't have money extra money

551
00:25:47,759 --> 00:25:52,650
just to throw around because you know

552
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,820
it's this the crate you need to have

553
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:59,100
reasons behind all of your choices and

554
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:01,619
you know not that everybody has the

555
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:06,049
capability to you know to mix their own

556
00:26:01,619 --> 00:26:09,719
fertilizers but there are absolutely

557
00:26:06,049 --> 00:26:12,299
agricultural shops that can assist you

558
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:14,460
with making shorter decisions on on what

559
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:17,549
you're applying because at the end of

560
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,500
the day like I said the recipes aren't

561
00:26:17,549 --> 00:26:21,240
that much different than then what

562
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:24,690
tomato farmers and influence that

563
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:26,940
growers are using absolutely I agree

564
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:29,490
100% with this and it's something you

565
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,740
know I've I've been pushing as a

566
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:33,720
platform now for five or six years I

567
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:35,359
gave a talk at Kanak on one year on how

568
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,130
to get off bottled nutrients we're

569
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:40,379
essentially the my big push is look at

570
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:42,060
the ingredient list for starters so see

571
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,600
what what they're actually claiming on

572
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,639
the bottle

573
00:26:42,599 --> 00:26:46,589
and then look and see if this product is

574
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,809
being used outside of the cannabis

575
00:26:46,589 --> 00:26:50,819
industry that's a red flag if it if it

576
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:53,190
isn't and then lastly if they say

577
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:54,119
there's anything proprietary about what

578
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,160
they're doing

579
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:57,449
walk the other way even even if it's the

580
00:26:56,160 --> 00:27:00,570
most amazing product in the world

581
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:02,970
because it if we're gonna grow a plant

582
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:06,000
that's gonna be combusted or it's gonna

583
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:07,529
be consumed as an edible we need to know

584
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,538
everything we're putting on that plant

585
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:11,490
and if we can't trust these companies

586
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:13,919
they've already proven it there's been

587
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,409
too many stop sales and other issues

588
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:18,120
around the cannabis industry that we

589
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:21,960
just we should not be putting our trust

590
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:24,029
in a manufacturer it's just it's too

591
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,240
risky especially for a commercial

592
00:27:24,029 --> 00:27:29,308
facility so I love that you were able to

593
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:32,130
switch out Co off of a program like that

594
00:27:29,308 --> 00:27:33,690
onto one that in my opinion is not only

595
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:37,289
more affordable but a lot more

596
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:40,529
sustainable for for the plant itself

597
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:44,788
even so thank you for that yeah

598
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:48,899
absolutely absolutely and so you know

599
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:50,788
coming from grad school where I did

600
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:54,000
focus on basically microbes in the soil

601
00:27:50,788 --> 00:27:55,470
and how they can assist you know and

602
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,440
we're gonna sound like a skeptic here

603
00:27:55,470 --> 00:28:02,460
but at least talking about growers who

604
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:04,558
are growing hydroponically you know a

605
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,909
wine as we're talking about fertilizer

606
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:10,048
companies I questioned some of the

607
00:28:05,909 --> 00:28:13,380
microbe companies as well it's

608
00:28:10,048 --> 00:28:15,720
specifically growing hydroponically and

609
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:20,010
because this makes me think you know if

610
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:22,529
we're applying such high rates of salts

611
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:26,390
you know making your EC and your and

612
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:29,700
your root ball very very high are we

613
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:32,250
actually just adding one problem on top

614
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,919
of the other so your EC is very very

615
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:37,288
high and it's this microbe application

616
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:41,610
actually benefiting the plant because

617
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:44,279
you're applying one more set of watering

618
00:28:41,609 --> 00:28:47,399
which is actually it's not necessarily

619
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:50,099
the microbe that's helping the plant in

620
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,380
general it's the flushing its allusion

621
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:56,029
of that EC that you already have in your

622
00:28:52,380 --> 00:29:00,050
media that's helping

623
00:28:56,029 --> 00:29:02,599
or is it potentially you know you have

624
00:29:00,049 --> 00:29:06,500
such a high e C we know microbes help

625
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:08,539
mainly with phosphorus and zinc uptake

626
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:12,069
is it potentially helping you

627
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:16,789
during this high stress high salinity

628
00:29:12,069 --> 00:29:18,609
environment as microbes do but if we

629
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:21,470
were smarter about our fertilizer

630
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:23,719
applications from the get-go you know

631
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:26,240
would these microbes be showing that the

632
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:29,269
results that they sometimes do some

633
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,509
growers so just so I understand this

634
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:33,769
you're speculating that what we're doing

635
00:29:32,509 --> 00:29:36,109
with some of these microbial

636
00:29:33,769 --> 00:29:38,750
applications in a hydroponic environment

637
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:40,339
due to the salinity is is really just

638
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,769
putting a band-aid on a wound that we

639
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:46,220
created so in theory you could lower

640
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:48,650
your salinity levels and get your EC

641
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:50,509
down and maybe receive achieve the same

642
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:53,830
results that you're getting by over

643
00:29:50,509 --> 00:29:57,789
fertilizing and applying microbes

644
00:29:53,829 --> 00:30:00,349
absolutely that's really interesting and

645
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:03,470
it kind of brings up another another

646
00:30:00,349 --> 00:30:06,849
point that I wanted to touch on now you

647
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:10,730
and I have had discussions off air about

648
00:30:06,849 --> 00:30:12,829
organics versus let's chemicals or

649
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,829
synthetic or mineral salts whatever you

650
00:30:12,829 --> 00:30:19,309
want to call them as as two different

651
00:30:15,829 --> 00:30:22,220
methods for cultivation and you know I

652
00:30:19,309 --> 00:30:25,029
grew up being a hardcore Ganic guy my

653
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:27,829
parents were organic but as I've gotten

654
00:30:25,029 --> 00:30:31,069
as I've gotten older and learned more

655
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:33,049
about this industry I've kind of opened

656
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:34,909
my mind a little bit towards not so much

657
00:30:33,049 --> 00:30:37,159
organics versus conventional but more

658
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:38,960
about sustainability so it's very

659
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,870
possible to be organic and unsustainable

660
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,569
in terms of what you're adding in terms

661
00:30:41,869 --> 00:30:47,809
of heavy-metal levels and other issues

662
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:50,049
potentially with organics but I think it

663
00:30:47,809 --> 00:30:53,750
is possible to grow more sustainably

664
00:30:50,049 --> 00:30:56,089
using mineral salts and the added

665
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:58,039
benefit from a research perspective of

666
00:30:56,089 --> 00:30:59,629
reducing all the variability that you

667
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:01,579
see in organics I think it would be very

668
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:04,940
very difficult to perform a study on

669
00:31:01,579 --> 00:31:06,649
living soils versus using a hydroponic

670
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:08,240
setup where you can control all of those

671
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:09,740
aspects so you really only have one

672
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,288
variable that you're looking

673
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,878
can you I know you mentioned that

674
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:16,220
growers have giving you a hard time in

675
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:19,730
the past for being for not using

676
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:23,230
organics as your methodology can you

677
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:28,250
touch a little bit on that so I

678
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:32,528
absolutely believe that sustainable

679
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:35,419
growing is is the answer

680
00:31:32,528 --> 00:31:40,929
especially with not even having the

681
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:40,929
opportunity to V USDA certified organic

682
00:31:41,259 --> 00:31:50,509
there's many many scenarios where if you

683
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:53,509
were combining synthetics and organic

684
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:56,620
methods that you truly are being more

685
00:31:53,509 --> 00:32:00,048
sustainable than if you were only doing

686
00:31:56,619 --> 00:32:08,058
one or the other you know if you think

687
00:32:00,048 --> 00:32:10,908
about let's say silica and in calcium

688
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:12,710
chloride so if you're adding a lot of

689
00:32:10,909 --> 00:32:15,980
silica and calcium chloride to your

690
00:32:12,710 --> 00:32:21,889
foliar mixture to your to your nutrients

691
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:25,839
you know you are getting the benefit of

692
00:32:21,888 --> 00:32:32,058
pest control by adding those non organic

693
00:32:25,839 --> 00:32:35,359
inputs and you know one having a better

694
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:39,048
crop because of less insect damage but

695
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:40,729
to maybe not applying other pesticides

696
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:43,128
that could be a little more damaging and

697
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:45,470
like you said you know overdoing

698
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:48,230
anything is not a good thing over

699
00:32:45,470 --> 00:32:52,220
applying salt is not a good thing over

700
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:54,079
applying manure with lots of lots and

701
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,819
water on top of that you know that's

702
00:32:54,079 --> 00:33:03,349
still a pollutant so combining a lot of

703
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:06,950
these sustainable methods you know it is

704
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:09,048
absolutely in my mind okay you know

705
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:13,308
there's there's a downfall to each side

706
00:33:09,048 --> 00:33:15,940
absolutely but I think you have to

707
00:33:13,308 --> 00:33:19,418
combine them it's hard not to

708
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,190
specifically an indoor growing

709
00:33:19,419 --> 00:33:23,380
controlled environment growing you know

710
00:33:22,190 --> 00:33:27,850
if you're not able to

711
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:31,150
we use your your pots or or your soil

712
00:33:27,849 --> 00:33:35,559
mixtures or you know remediate each year

713
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:38,640
your outdoor crop soil environment you

714
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:42,059
know it's very hard to to do only

715
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,320
organic methods specifically fertilizers

716
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:47,129
and when we look at it from a plant

717
00:33:44,319 --> 00:33:49,720
perspective I mean the plant doesn't

718
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:52,960
doesn't care if the nitrate it's

719
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:55,420
receiving is from a mineral salt or from

720
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,519
a nutrient cycling process where it took

721
00:33:55,420 --> 00:34:00,039
something like fish meal and broke that

722
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,910
down into nitrate by the bacteria

723
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,559
archaea you know protozoa and everything

724
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:08,470
cycling that nutrient to the plant it

725
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:10,239
doesn't really make a difference which i

726
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:13,750
think is an important distinction that

727
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:16,209
we that we discuss now to be fair I am a

728
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:18,849
purely organic person and I see a lot of

729
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,440
issues with not just the cannabis

730
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:22,989
industry but conventional agriculture

731
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,079
around the concept of sustainability

732
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:29,259
like we discussed but I also realized

733
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:31,599
that not everyone is going to make that

734
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:33,940
choice or choose to grow organically and

735
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:35,799
what we really want is everyone to be

736
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,990
growing sustainably no matter what

737
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,610
methodology they choose and part of that

738
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,189
I think is what you mentioned here is

739
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,200
moving away from a lot of these bottle

740
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:46,690
of nutrient programs that have you over

741
00:34:44,199 --> 00:34:49,359
applying a lot of these macronutrients

742
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:51,909
and figuring out exactly what the plant

743
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,590
needs but for a lot of growers that's

744
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,840
really challenging I mean a lot of them

745
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:59,230
don't have access to leaf tissue

746
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,820
analysis or even basic soil testing and

747
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,740
the one advantage of these bottled

748
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:04,750
nutrient programs is they give you a

749
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:06,129
feeding chart and they give you a

750
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,340
product and you know you're going to get

751
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:11,260
a certain result so how would you

752
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:15,160
address that for someone who has less I

753
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:17,190
guess less educational background around

754
00:35:15,159 --> 00:35:22,960
horticulture and maybe less access to

755
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:25,510
testing facilities right so with the

756
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:30,220
hemp bill just passing I think our

757
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:31,540
opportunity to have the sample or you

758
00:35:30,219 --> 00:35:35,230
know leaf and that office done at

759
00:35:31,539 --> 00:35:37,250
university is gonna be here within the

760
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,490
next six months I know there's some

761
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:44,900
like here at Clemson that will already

762
00:35:40,489 --> 00:35:49,339
do it so that the specifically leaf

763
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:52,730
samples of hemp you know obviously if

764
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:55,070
you have a cannabis sample the leaves

765
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:57,440
aren't going to have the secondary

766
00:35:55,070 --> 00:36:03,170
metabolites that you might expect on the

767
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:06,280
same intent but it would be okay I think

768
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:09,530
the other thing to realize is that

769
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:12,349
you're not locked in to only working

770
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:14,960
with a hydro store anymore there's

771
00:36:12,349 --> 00:36:16,490
companies out there that have been in

772
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,030
production for a hundred years in

773
00:36:16,489 --> 00:36:22,549
agriculture that can help you develop a

774
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:27,710
fertilizer program that is sustainable

775
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:30,890
that does work for cannabis and you know

776
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:34,730
can guide you through that so for

777
00:36:30,889 --> 00:36:37,549
example in San Diego there's a company

778
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:40,608
that I work with called grungy toes you

779
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:44,420
know they for 50 years plus they've been

780
00:36:40,608 --> 00:36:47,449
working with avocado growers and other

781
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:49,849
fruit and vegetable growers and they

782
00:36:47,449 --> 00:36:52,639
have the capacity to make whatever you

783
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:54,920
want and so you know I was able to go to

784
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:57,559
them after singing out our recipe from

785
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:02,030
individual salts and they made you know

786
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:07,730
my mixture into you know a premix ready

787
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:09,440
to put under the dosatron slurry where

788
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:11,480
they weren't where my guys weren't

789
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,039
actually mixing the individual sauce

790
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:15,760
himself just because you know there can

791
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:18,440
be human error and not and whatnot and

792
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:23,030
did it in bulk did it in concentrated

793
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:25,329
form and it was still 23 times less

794
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:28,099
expensive than the bottled nutrients and

795
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:30,679
you know that was with me having a

796
00:37:28,099 --> 00:37:32,660
recipe ready but these companies I mean

797
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:35,210
they they already know what a canvas

798
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:36,829
plant needs and they're very this is

799
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:39,108
just in San Diego but there's our

800
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:41,960
culture of stores everywhere in every

801
00:37:39,108 --> 00:37:43,069
state and you know these are people that

802
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,679
have been working with plants their

803
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:47,990
whole life and they can help you figure

804
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:50,779
out what your plant needs just like a

805
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:53,329
grand Jace grand gee toasted

806
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,650
that's great I don't want to take away

807
00:37:53,329 --> 00:37:57,199
from the fact that we're still learning

808
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,690
a lot about camping about cannabis and

809
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:01,639
what optimal nutrient levels look like

810
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:03,710
in these crops because the research is

811
00:38:01,639 --> 00:38:04,879
just starting to starting to happen I

812
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,539
think we're gonna see a lot in the next

813
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:10,610
few years hopefully but I think I don't

814
00:38:08,539 --> 00:38:12,800
think we should count on the fact that

815
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,390
the nutrient companies that exist in the

816
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,039
cannabis industry have really figured it

817
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:17,329
out a lot of ways and I think that's

818
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:17,630
what a lot of people are counting on

819
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,849
that

820
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:21,829
you know the recipe from general

821
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:25,039
hydroponics or from botanic air is

822
00:38:21,829 --> 00:38:26,150
optimized for cannabis Wow we just I

823
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,460
think that's something that we need to

824
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:31,340
go back and revisit as we learn a lot

825
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:33,139
more about this plan I agree

826
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,010
all right well let's change subjects

827
00:38:33,139 --> 00:38:35,389
here because there's a lot of other

828
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:38,120
things I want to talk to you about in

829
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:40,579
terms of aspects around cultivation one

830
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:42,139
of the things that you mentioned to me

831
00:38:40,579 --> 00:38:44,989
was some work you've done around this

832
00:38:42,139 --> 00:38:48,829
concept of lolli popping can you talk a

833
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:52,969
little bit about that yes so when I

834
00:38:48,829 --> 00:38:55,610
joined outcault you know they they were

835
00:38:52,969 --> 00:38:58,579
stripping the bottoms of the plants and

836
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:00,260
you know week three they were stripping

837
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:03,650
almost all the leaves off the top of the

838
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:06,050
plants and I was just I was so confused

839
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:11,769
why did what's happening

840
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:16,070
and started doing some research and

841
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:17,900
found you know okay it does make some

842
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:21,519
sense you know it's the same idea of

843
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:25,099
what peach growers do you know they will

844
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:27,559
either spray some sub substance or have

845
00:39:25,099 --> 00:39:29,809
growers go out there and knock off half

846
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:34,279
of the peaches and so yes they have less

847
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:39,019
quantity but their peaches are bigger so

848
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:42,500
it's all about where are you wanting to

849
00:39:39,019 --> 00:39:46,699
allocate your resources and so you know

850
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:49,519
that concept made some sense the concept

851
00:39:46,699 --> 00:39:53,449
of better air flow made sense for

852
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:55,690
botrytis or powdery mildew but at the

853
00:39:53,449 --> 00:39:59,210
end of the day I still struggled with

854
00:39:55,690 --> 00:40:02,420
well yes these are further scepters and

855
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:05,030
are we actually hurting the planet by

856
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:10,079
doing this re lowering our yield

857
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:14,369
and so I had dr. Mike Jenkins come out

858
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:17,130
from Rubisco consulting and we've done

859
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:20,039
some work together before but he has an

860
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:24,180
actual like or meter and what this does

861
00:40:20,039 --> 00:40:26,039
is measure photosynthesis and so we said

862
00:40:24,179 --> 00:40:29,069
okay well let's let's put some numbers

863
00:40:26,039 --> 00:40:31,829
on all these theories that that growers

864
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:34,460
have and you know try to figure out and

865
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:38,098
understand why certain methods are done

866
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:42,269
well you know he spent a couple days and

867
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:43,859
grow room taking measurements and he

868
00:40:42,269 --> 00:40:45,719
he's actually coming out with a paper on

869
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:49,440
his saw but all the details hopefully

870
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:52,649
you'll be able to read shortly but long

871
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:57,210
story short what we found is that the

872
00:40:52,650 --> 00:41:00,420
leads that receiving less than 200 micro

873
00:40:57,210 --> 00:41:04,519
moles so the intensity of 200 micro

874
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:07,920
moles were not so to synthesizing

875
00:41:04,519 --> 00:41:11,489
efficiently basically those low release

876
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,849
and to give you an idea you know our top

877
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:18,949
leads we're reaching anywhere from 900

878
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:23,849
to 1100 micromoles so much much higher

879
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:27,838
so you know okay well the lower leaves

880
00:41:23,849 --> 00:41:31,650
are not doing anything meaning they are

881
00:41:27,838 --> 00:41:36,719
not creating food meaning they are a

882
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:39,690
sink more interesting than that what we

883
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:44,069
found was that they were transpiring and

884
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:45,179
so being an indoor grow double stack you

885
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,099
know one of the things we really

886
00:41:45,179 --> 00:41:47,789
struggle with is taking the humidity out

887
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:52,588
of there

888
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:56,159
well we have found with data every time

889
00:41:52,588 --> 00:41:58,380
we lollipop or even defoliate the lower

890
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:01,639
leaves it's easier to control that

891
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:04,410
humidity and you know this data point

892
00:42:01,639 --> 00:42:06,299
helped us make prints of that well

893
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:08,759
you're getting rid of these low releases

894
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm not photosynthesizing that are

895
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:15,359
taking nutrients from the other plants

896
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:18,480
and are just acting as a sprinkler

897
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:21,750
system and so what we learn

898
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:23,400
is there is absolutely sense and and

899
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:27,030
lolli popping and getting rid of the

900
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:30,420
leaves that are receiving less than 200

901
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:32,820
microlitre so in theory if a grower had

902
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:35,250
a light meter they could go around and

903
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,170
and sort of get an idea for what leaves

904
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:40,019
are getting approximately what light

905
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:43,650
levels in the canopy and then remove

906
00:42:40,019 --> 00:42:47,759
anything below that that 200 micromo

907
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:50,460
level yeah yeah and so we did not

908
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:53,160
correlate that with a yield but for us

909
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:56,849
it was an important point because we

910
00:42:53,159 --> 00:43:00,118
struggle with humidity control okay so

911
00:42:56,849 --> 00:43:02,220
your your research is is right now based

912
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,510
around humidity control you haven't I

913
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:05,129
think that's an important point you

914
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:11,190
haven't done the correlation with yield

915
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:15,510
yet what about in in relation to plant

916
00:43:11,190 --> 00:43:17,010
stress or or disease because I do

917
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:19,380
realize that you're talking about

918
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:21,470
essentially stressing the plant by

919
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:25,140
removing these leaves in a lot of ways

920
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:27,598
what would you say to that well this

921
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:31,049
plant is absolutely shown to have

922
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,700
positive results and whether that's just

923
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:35,789
positive results from increased

924
00:43:32,699 --> 00:43:41,219
secondary metabolite production from

925
00:43:35,789 --> 00:43:43,349
stresses so you know I I think if this

926
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:46,980
deformation happened specifically early

927
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:51,900
on just in theory I would say there's

928
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:55,740
not a negative effect on yield a flower

929
00:43:51,900 --> 00:44:00,150
it is so when when were you removing the

930
00:43:55,739 --> 00:44:03,539
leaves just just out of curiosity this

931
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:05,760
was at week four okay

932
00:44:03,539 --> 00:44:07,679
I'll be interested to see if other

933
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,290
people do more research around this to

934
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:12,868
see if there's a you know a different

935
00:44:10,289 --> 00:44:16,889
time point in the flowering cycle that

936
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:18,809
might be more optimal but I think that's

937
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:20,460
wonderful and I would like to see some

938
00:44:18,809 --> 00:44:22,529
more research around stress response

939
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:24,990
because like you mentioned cannabis does

940
00:44:22,530 --> 00:44:29,250
seem to be highly adaptable and able to

941
00:44:24,989 --> 00:44:32,309
deal with stress and there is plenty of

942
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:35,130
research in you know the plant world

943
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:38,460
showing that stress targeted stress

944
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:40,590
stressors can result in you know up

945
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:43,920
essentially a better tasting fruit or a

946
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:45,990
better fruiting response I haven't seen

947
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:47,730
anything around cannabis with that have

948
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:51,389
you have you seen research on that at

949
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:54,869
all own cannabis itself no I have

950
00:44:51,389 --> 00:44:57,659
absolutely seen in papers where water

951
00:44:54,869 --> 00:45:00,929
stress salinity stress can increase

952
00:44:57,659 --> 00:45:03,389
secondary metabolites with Basel but

953
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:06,719
cannabis not necessarily and that

954
00:45:03,389 --> 00:45:10,289
actually kind of brings me back to the

955
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:13,619
fertilizer input you know it's in

956
00:45:10,289 --> 00:45:16,349
general you're applying well over the

957
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:19,529
amount of phosphorus and potassium that

958
00:45:16,349 --> 00:45:21,929
is needed you know think about what a

959
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:25,650
lot of growers do at weeks five six and

960
00:45:21,929 --> 00:45:30,899
seven is they apply more PK on top of

961
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:34,740
that and so K controls your EC and so

962
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:38,130
you know is it the benefit of more

963
00:45:34,739 --> 00:45:41,309
phosphorus potassium or are we applying

964
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:44,700
a stress of salinity by increasing these

965
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:47,610
to increase potentially a cannabinoid

966
00:45:44,699 --> 00:45:49,559
content I like that that's really

967
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:51,030
interesting because a lot of people just

968
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:52,409
make these assumptions that it's the

969
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:54,570
nutrient but if you look at it from

970
00:45:52,409 --> 00:45:57,449
another perspective there are other

971
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:58,559
variables that could be causing the

972
00:45:57,449 --> 00:46:00,089
response we're getting and that's

973
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,719
something that that's why I think

974
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:04,110
science is so important so I really like

975
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,230
that

976
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:09,630
now just to change subjects again you

977
00:46:07,230 --> 00:46:11,219
would mentioned that well you presented

978
00:46:09,630 --> 00:46:13,769
research actually a photo X a couple

979
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:14,699
years ago around a lighting study is

980
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:19,679
that the lighting study you're

981
00:46:14,699 --> 00:46:20,730
referencing talking about today yeah do

982
00:46:19,679 --> 00:46:22,409
you want to go ahead and describe that I

983
00:46:20,730 --> 00:46:23,670
remember seeing that research when you

984
00:46:22,409 --> 00:46:25,679
presented it was I thought it was really

985
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:26,970
really interesting I've actually talked

986
00:46:25,679 --> 00:46:29,279
about it a little bit on this podcast

987
00:46:26,969 --> 00:46:30,869
before but I would love to hear hear it

988
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:33,630
in your words sort of what you found and

989
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:35,639
what you were testing so you know what

990
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:38,190
again when I started at outcault you

991
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:41,309
know one of the rumors that I was

992
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:44,400
hearing was we can't flower under LED

993
00:46:41,309 --> 00:46:46,239
and you know every person I would ask

994
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,710
why was

995
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,079
you know he didn't have a really good

996
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:50,740
answer for me or they tried it once and

997
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:56,259
it didn't work

998
00:46:50,739 --> 00:47:01,118
and you know I do agree you can't

999
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:03,790
necessarily give an answer off of one

1000
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,309
one time trying with LEDs it's the sort

1001
00:47:03,789 --> 00:47:08,619
of thing you have to change some of your

1002
00:47:06,309 --> 00:47:13,529
growing habits to produce a good crop

1003
00:47:08,619 --> 00:47:18,130
under but the blunt fact of it just not

1004
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:20,410
working is this very country and so Josh

1005
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:23,019
Arabic who was the plant scientist Sarah

1006
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:25,179
fluent at the time contacted me and said

1007
00:47:23,019 --> 00:47:27,730
hey do you want to do some lighting

1008
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:29,409
trials together and I said well

1009
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:30,849
absolutely you know what let's see

1010
00:47:29,409 --> 00:47:34,389
what's happening here

1011
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:37,269
what prove or disprove this and so we

1012
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:39,549
set up a study with one cultivar which

1013
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:41,259
you know I want to be very honest with

1014
00:47:39,550 --> 00:47:46,269
that it was one called cultivar and

1015
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:49,800
others could act very differently we

1016
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:54,099
looked at different light intensity so

1017
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,990
400 600 800 and 1,200 micro moles per

1018
00:47:54,099 --> 00:48:00,910
meter squared per second but then we

1019
00:47:55,989 --> 00:48:04,809
also had a HPS at 700 micro moles more

1020
00:48:00,909 --> 00:48:07,118
or less of the control and so we

1021
00:48:04,809 --> 00:48:09,599
collected a shoot fresh way shoot dry

1022
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,930
weight flour dry weight trim weight and

1023
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,950
secondary metabolites and I office you

1024
00:48:13,929 --> 00:48:20,858
know basically what we found is that

1025
00:48:16,949 --> 00:48:24,819
what one yes you absolutely can flower

1026
00:48:20,858 --> 00:48:27,460
under LEDs and to you know when you're

1027
00:48:24,820 --> 00:48:29,080
looking at this you have to dig deeper

1028
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:32,019
than just yield you have to look at

1029
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:38,259
potency you have to look at your ROI and

1030
00:48:32,019 --> 00:48:43,838
so that's what we did in a study you

1031
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:48,690
know so looking at basically pounds

1032
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:52,239
perlite there was a direct comparison or

1033
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:55,119
correlations between intensity and yield

1034
00:48:52,239 --> 00:48:57,939
and so we did receive the highest yield

1035
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,620
with the highest wattage and also

1036
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:02,940
highest ppfd and

1037
00:48:59,619 --> 00:49:05,769
we D at two and a half pounds per light

1038
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:12,280
and then the lowest obviously was the

1039
00:49:05,769 --> 00:49:16,030
400 you know it wasn't enough for myself

1040
00:49:12,280 --> 00:49:18,340
or for the owners of the company to just

1041
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:20,080
say okay higher yield let's go with it

1042
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,630
you know we had to dig a little deeper

1043
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:26,110
we had to say all right well if we're

1044
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:28,180
considering X amount per light if we're

1045
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,769
considering coverage of this light how

1046
00:49:28,179 --> 00:49:33,099
much were paying in power which in San

1047
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:37,090
Diego it's very expensive you know what

1048
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:44,589
is this far oh I'd look like and so you

1049
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:45,970
know what we found is that cost of you

1050
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:50,590
know the amount we were getting per

1051
00:49:45,969 --> 00:49:53,739
flower - power it's actually the LEDs

1052
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:57,280
that were winning and this was not even

1053
00:49:53,739 --> 00:49:58,689
considering HVAC or that thing which you

1054
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,390
know we talked a little bit more about

1055
00:49:58,690 --> 00:50:04,389
later but that was one of the biggest

1056
00:50:01,389 --> 00:50:07,750
issues changing to LEDs was was the HVAC

1057
00:50:04,389 --> 00:50:12,069
but you know end of the day what we

1058
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:16,449
found is that we were making a much

1059
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:20,350
greater roi from the LED lights than the

1060
00:50:16,449 --> 00:50:22,329
HPS lights considering power and also

1061
00:50:20,349 --> 00:50:25,420
cost a fixture because that's one of the

1062
00:50:22,329 --> 00:50:27,819
biggest problems with LEDs is that their

1063
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:30,220
price per fixture is just you know

1064
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:36,970
compared to the outrageous so if you're

1065
00:50:30,219 --> 00:50:39,009
looking at 800 I'm sorry at 660 what LED

1066
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:41,649
you're looking at 1,200 bucks maybe

1067
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:44,470
higher HPS you could probably get it

1068
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:46,809
under $400 and so you know especially

1069
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:49,599
when you're first designing a room you

1070
00:50:46,809 --> 00:50:52,239
have to think you know is this worth it

1071
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:56,250
and so in our study what we showed was

1072
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:59,619
that no under one year you're able to

1073
00:50:56,250 --> 00:51:04,630
pay back that investment simply because

1074
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:09,039
of the the power savings plus increase

1075
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:11,890
of yield plus increase of secondary

1076
00:51:09,039 --> 00:51:13,449
metabolites which was minimal but what's

1077
00:51:11,889 --> 00:51:15,190
there

1078
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:18,538
the other thing that was really big for

1079
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:22,119
outcault was that because of some of the

1080
00:51:18,539 --> 00:51:25,839
local walls we were not able to expand

1081
00:51:22,119 --> 00:51:28,990
like we had planned to and so we were

1082
00:51:25,838 --> 00:51:32,558
limited in space but we did have really

1083
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:35,379
high ceilings and so because they're

1084
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:39,278
LEDs you're able to stack and so we were

1085
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:41,950
able to immediately say r8 will can

1086
00:51:39,278 --> 00:51:44,889
flower under LEDs we need to also

1087
00:51:41,949 --> 00:51:49,210
increase our footprint let's stack and

1088
00:51:44,889 --> 00:51:51,098
so we partnered with tip and you know

1089
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:53,980
almost immediately doubled our our

1090
00:51:51,099 --> 00:51:56,650
footprint so that you know that's great

1091
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:59,949
in all that increased our overall yield

1092
00:51:56,650 --> 00:52:02,889
by two point eight times but you know

1093
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:07,689
it's not it's not perfect there were

1094
00:52:02,889 --> 00:52:10,500
other things we had to work through and

1095
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:13,358
so you know being one of the first that

1096
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:15,099
upgraded to the the double stack we had

1097
00:52:13,358 --> 00:52:18,298
to figure out alright well honey should

1098
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:20,829
get water up up to the top how do you

1099
00:52:18,298 --> 00:52:25,150
how are you able to move these benches

1100
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:28,990
with with getting water to them how do

1101
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:31,809
you use the air within these canopies

1102
00:52:28,989 --> 00:52:34,629
and so there were a lot of tricks we had

1103
00:52:31,809 --> 00:52:37,569
to figure out that was fun but also

1104
00:52:34,630 --> 00:52:41,410
frustrating at time one of the things

1105
00:52:37,568 --> 00:52:44,139
that we expected maybe not as much as it

1106
00:52:41,409 --> 00:52:46,719
is about being was the humidity control

1107
00:52:44,139 --> 00:52:51,250
and so you know because they are LEDs

1108
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:53,949
are cooling was enough but the humidity

1109
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:56,019
removal was not and so you know you have

1110
00:52:53,949 --> 00:52:59,199
twice as many plants your hat you have

1111
00:52:56,019 --> 00:53:02,710
twice as much transpiration and so you

1112
00:52:59,199 --> 00:53:04,449
have to remove twice as much water from

1113
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:10,690
the air and so we absolutely had to

1114
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:13,028
increase our dehumidification the other

1115
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:15,579
thing that I would just suggest all

1116
00:53:13,028 --> 00:53:19,619
growers do and they're using LEDs is

1117
00:53:15,579 --> 00:53:21,818
think about you know even though the

1118
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:24,730
temperature in the room might be the

1119
00:53:21,818 --> 00:53:26,588
same that does not mean that the leaf

1120
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:28,659
temperature is the same and

1121
00:53:26,588 --> 00:53:30,998
so I would highly encourage to get an

1122
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:36,608
infrared sensor to look at leaf

1123
00:53:30,998 --> 00:53:39,608
temperature compared to HBS which does

1124
00:53:36,608 --> 00:53:42,068
have a lot of radiant heating the least

1125
00:53:39,608 --> 00:53:45,759
in certain be up to five degrees cooler

1126
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:48,518
under LEDs and so if you have high

1127
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:51,789
humidity and you have much cooler leaf

1128
00:53:48,518 --> 00:53:55,838
temperature that's the special sauce for

1129
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:57,609
botrytis and so you know increasing room

1130
00:53:55,838 --> 00:54:01,210
temperature as well as something that we

1131
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:03,400
had to ultimately end up doing that's

1132
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:05,139
interesting so you the solution was to

1133
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:08,108
increase the room temperature to address

1134
00:54:05,139 --> 00:54:10,719
the lower leaf temperature relative to

1135
00:54:08,108 --> 00:54:13,119
LEDs exactly

1136
00:54:10,719 --> 00:54:15,219
okay and I want to go back a little bit

1137
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:17,200
on this this study that you did so just

1138
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:20,019
to clarify for listeners it was one

1139
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:23,798
cultivar and under a variety of

1140
00:54:20,018 --> 00:54:26,078
different light intensity and you were

1141
00:54:23,798 --> 00:54:27,248
looking at ROI so return on investment

1142
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:30,849
for people who aren't familiar with that

1143
00:54:27,248 --> 00:54:34,268
term but essentially what you found was

1144
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:36,278
that the 1200 micro moles was not the

1145
00:54:34,268 --> 00:54:40,449
most efficient use you had the highest

1146
00:54:36,278 --> 00:54:42,699
yield but relative to the amount of cost

1147
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:44,679
associated with running your electricity

1148
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:47,828
that high I believe you found one

1149
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:50,919
thousand was optimal for your facility

1150
00:54:47,829 --> 00:54:56,229
is that correct or is that that changed

1151
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:59,108
almost Ulmus so the 1200 PP SD fixture

1152
00:54:56,228 --> 00:55:02,308
which was the thousand watts so that was

1153
00:54:59,108 --> 00:55:08,380
actually just a prototype to achieve

1154
00:55:02,309 --> 00:55:12,278
ppfd that high but when considering the

1155
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:15,999
extra power input it and then the yield

1156
00:55:12,278 --> 00:55:19,449
and potency it was actually the 800 ppfd

1157
00:55:15,998 --> 00:55:22,929
and that's average of course but the 660

1158
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:26,710
was so it was the spider X that was

1159
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:29,018
optimal okay and that's going to vary in

1160
00:55:26,710 --> 00:55:30,699
terms of ROI based on your cost of

1161
00:55:29,018 --> 00:55:32,409
electricity so if you're in a different

1162
00:55:30,699 --> 00:55:35,379
area where electricity cost a lot less

1163
00:55:32,409 --> 00:55:37,509
or lost a lot more you may find that

1164
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:39,099
that number may change a little bit

1165
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:44,980
which i think is is something to

1166
00:55:39,099 --> 00:55:46,719
consider great well let's uh we have a

1167
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:50,139
kind of a wide variety of topics here

1168
00:55:46,719 --> 00:55:56,079
that you have listed talked about can we

1169
00:55:50,139 --> 00:55:59,920
move on to curing yes and so curing is

1170
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:03,069
something that I've especially became

1171
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:08,889
interested in because I think even more

1172
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:12,640
than chemistry or cultivation it's been

1173
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:15,339
a little bit ignored and I think in

1174
00:56:12,639 --> 00:56:19,150
terms of an art it's been figured out

1175
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:22,000
quite well but in terms of what's

1176
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:25,420
actually going on I don't think we know

1177
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,340
very much well you know this really

1178
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:29,050
isn't my area of expertise so I'd be

1179
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,600
curious to hear what you have to say

1180
00:56:29,050 --> 00:56:32,430
around around caring or what you found

1181
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:36,339
out

1182
00:56:32,429 --> 00:56:39,309
so dr. Marcus Rogan and I tag-team us

1183
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:43,000
because it is a combination of plant

1184
00:56:39,309 --> 00:56:46,539
science biochemistry and then of course

1185
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,780
just chemistry in general so we had a

1186
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:52,150
good time trying to guess what's going

1187
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:54,910
on and then comparing it to some of the

1188
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:57,639
industry guesses you know what is drying

1189
00:56:54,909 --> 00:57:00,879
hearing and so drying of course we have

1190
00:56:57,639 --> 00:57:02,500
to do it to prevent spoilage curing

1191
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,720
though you know when you stick it in the

1192
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:09,179
bucket what is that and why do you need

1193
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:12,959
to do it so we set forth trying to

1194
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:16,210
search the literature search other

1195
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:20,170
plants and figure out what might be

1196
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:21,099
going on and so when we're comparing it

1197
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:23,320
let's think

1198
00:57:21,099 --> 00:57:26,610
all right well fruits and vegetables you

1199
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:31,000
know they are plants that are picked and

1200
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:34,510
stored for a while cut flowers maybe

1201
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:36,309
even more so relevant they're picked and

1202
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,770
they're stored and the science behind

1203
00:57:36,309 --> 00:57:41,259
that is just out of this world compared

1204
00:57:38,769 --> 00:57:43,509
to what cannabis has right now and then

1205
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:46,750
there's the transportation of unrooted

1206
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:48,700
cuttings so instead of just fruits

1207
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:51,010
veggies and flowers that are meant to

1208
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:56,500
basically just be put

1209
00:57:51,010 --> 00:57:59,290
pause and then killed the transportation

1210
00:57:56,500 --> 00:58:01,989
of unrooted cutting is appalled but then

1211
00:57:59,289 --> 00:58:04,690
a continuation of growing and so looking

1212
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:07,509
through all this literature you know the

1213
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:11,309
big things we see are alright well we're

1214
00:58:07,510 --> 00:58:14,290
trying to delay death trying to preserve

1215
00:58:11,309 --> 00:58:18,759
we're trying to delay ripening but not

1216
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:20,230
yet do we want to speed up ripening you

1217
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:23,800
know in how's this done well cool

1218
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:26,260
temperatures inhibition of ethylene and

1219
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:29,200
I think ethylene has been very much

1220
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:31,690
under studied in cannabis because it is

1221
00:58:29,199 --> 00:58:36,039
you know a ripening agent that every

1222
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:38,349
other industry struggles with to remove

1223
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:42,519
or in case of ripening fruit maybe even

1224
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:44,949
use and then humidity and then of course

1225
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:47,619
we have to think all right well it's not

1226
00:58:44,949 --> 00:58:49,269
just this one organism cannabis that

1227
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:52,210
we're working with there's others that

1228
00:58:49,269 --> 00:58:54,219
like to creep in at certain optimum

1229
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:58,539
temperatures and humidity as well such

1230
00:58:54,219 --> 00:58:59,980
as botrytis so we looked into you know

1231
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:02,469
what's going on in the industry right

1232
00:58:59,980 --> 00:59:05,858
now anywhere from sixty to forty five

1233
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:10,569
Fahrenheit for for drying and forty to

1234
00:59:05,858 --> 00:59:13,929
sixty for humidity is about standard and

1235
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:16,390
then you know we we wonder go and this

1236
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:20,379
was of course at the beginning you know

1237
00:59:16,389 --> 00:59:23,279
how do you decide it's time to pull a

1238
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:26,079
plant from the dry read2go integer and

1239
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,210
you know when I started the answers I

1240
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:30,730
was getting was well there's a crack in

1241
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:35,980
the stem and at the time of very

1242
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:39,519
confused how that the metric that we're

1243
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,990
using is a crack because I wasn't

1244
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:43,059
familiar with what that crap was

1245
00:59:40,989 --> 00:59:46,750
supposed to sound like and I wasn't sure

1246
00:59:43,059 --> 00:59:49,449
how I was going to write a SP for other

1247
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:51,130
employees to be able to you know make

1248
00:59:49,449 --> 00:59:55,599
sure we're pulling the plant down at the

1249
00:59:51,130 --> 00:59:57,730
right time by a crack found and so you

1250
00:59:55,599 --> 00:59:59,858
know looking into what people in coffee

1251
00:59:57,730 --> 01:00:04,929
lets you know drying roasting coffee

1252
00:59:59,858 --> 01:00:07,690
looking into let's say beef jerky you

1253
01:00:04,929 --> 01:00:10,480
all of those are food items that has to

1254
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:13,900
be dried and you know there's a known

1255
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:17,380
stopping point well what what is that

1256
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:19,420
device used for knowing when it's time

1257
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:22,210
to stop drying well that's called a

1258
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:25,809
water activity meter and so this is not

1259
01:00:22,210 --> 01:00:28,720
actual moisture content of a food item

1260
01:00:25,809 --> 01:00:33,550
it's the actual available water for

1261
01:00:28,719 --> 01:00:35,338
microbial growth and so you know if you

1262
01:00:33,550 --> 01:00:38,859
look through the literature there are

1263
01:00:35,338 --> 01:00:41,068
set water activity numbers that will

1264
01:00:38,858 --> 01:00:44,230
tell you all right well this species

1265
01:00:41,068 --> 01:00:47,380
strain of bacteria yeast and mold will

1266
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:49,960
not grow under these certain water

1267
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:53,800
activities so we purchased a water

1268
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:56,230
activity meter and that is how we now

1269
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,930
determine when it's actually time to

1270
01:00:56,230 --> 01:01:02,199
pull the plants from the room and to go

1271
01:00:58,929 --> 01:01:04,269
to cure and so from that and from

1272
01:01:02,199 --> 01:01:07,000
looking at the literature where it is

1273
01:01:04,269 --> 01:01:11,259
shown that botrytis will not grow under

1274
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:15,780
a water activity of 0.8 we can be very

1275
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:18,549
comfortable with drying fast enough for

1276
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:22,329
botrytis and other microbes not to grow

1277
01:01:18,548 --> 01:01:24,639
but also slow enough where all of these

1278
01:01:22,329 --> 01:01:26,470
enzymatic activities which we don't

1279
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:29,588
actually know which ones are happening

1280
01:01:26,469 --> 01:01:31,868
now but we can postulate that it's the

1281
01:01:29,588 --> 01:01:37,259
conversion of starch to sugar the

1282
01:01:31,869 --> 01:01:40,720
breakdown of korah field etc so we can

1283
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:43,450
have the water activity high enough to

1284
01:01:40,719 --> 01:01:47,348
continue these enzymatic activities but

1285
01:01:43,449 --> 01:01:49,088
low enough to not grow botrytis so we

1286
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:51,940
wish I had the graph in front of you but

1287
01:01:49,088 --> 01:01:56,139
basically what we do is from day 1 to 3

1288
01:01:51,940 --> 01:01:59,829
we drop the the water activity very

1289
01:01:56,139 --> 01:02:03,250
quickly so down to 0.8 that way botrytis

1290
01:01:59,829 --> 01:02:08,289
is not growing and then it's a slow dry

1291
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:10,179
until 12 to 14 days at that point it's

1292
01:02:08,289 --> 01:02:12,608
dropped down to about point 6 which is

1293
01:02:10,179 --> 01:02:14,019
consumer preference but in between

1294
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,940
you're still a high enough water

1295
01:02:14,019 --> 01:02:18,420
activity to where a lot of these

1296
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:19,800
enzymatic processes can happen

1297
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:22,260
that nut is so cool that might be the

1298
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:23,519
most interesting science related

1299
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:27,150
cannabis thing I think that has been

1300
01:02:23,519 --> 01:02:28,980
shared on this podcast to date the fact

1301
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:31,349
that someone could take a concept that's

1302
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:33,900
been more art than science really around

1303
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:35,909
curing and set a quantifiable point

1304
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:37,680
using a meter so that growers can know

1305
01:02:35,909 --> 01:02:39,929
exactly when to harvest something or

1306
01:02:37,679 --> 01:02:41,309
when did I guess I said essentially when

1307
01:02:39,929 --> 01:02:43,199
did how you should be drying something I

1308
01:02:41,309 --> 01:02:46,559
think that's that's awesome thanks for

1309
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:48,210
sharing that completely so anything else

1310
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:51,799
around caring that you would touch on

1311
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:53,519
that you found by using this methodology

1312
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:55,500
absolutely and so once we were

1313
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:58,259
comfortable with our drying procedures

1314
01:02:55,500 --> 01:03:01,739
you know we just we just wanted to do

1315
01:02:58,260 --> 01:03:04,410
what was happening in the Cure in the

1316
01:03:01,739 --> 01:03:08,219
bucket and and what the heck was a

1317
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:12,529
burner and so we set up an experiment

1318
01:03:08,219 --> 01:03:15,599
with make controls and legacy they

1319
01:03:12,530 --> 01:03:19,980
actually made us small data loggers

1320
01:03:15,599 --> 01:03:22,440
which measured co2 relative humidity and

1321
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:25,019
temperature and so we were able to put

1322
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:26,400
these into five-gallon buckets just you

1323
01:03:25,019 --> 01:03:29,190
know the regular old food grade plastic

1324
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:32,519
ones but I would say most people use for

1325
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:34,789
curing and we had a control and so this

1326
01:03:32,519 --> 01:03:37,920
was a bucket that was kept for two weeks

1327
01:03:34,789 --> 01:03:39,989
with no burping so just stay close the

1328
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:42,180
entire time we had what we called the

1329
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:44,250
out cupboard and so this was for the

1330
01:03:42,179 --> 01:03:47,009
first three days the lids were removed

1331
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:49,380
for about 20 minutes so our turns and

1332
01:03:47,010 --> 01:03:51,960
then returned to their position and then

1333
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:54,780
industry births where we took the lid

1334
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:58,250
off daily for an hour and turn the flour

1335
01:03:54,780 --> 01:04:01,410
and so we were able to graphically see

1336
01:03:58,250 --> 01:04:04,010
what was happening with these different

1337
01:04:01,409 --> 01:04:08,569
metrics we looked at so looking at co2

1338
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:13,610
what we found is that in general over in

1339
01:04:08,570 --> 01:04:19,220
general over these two weeks do two rows

1340
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:22,500
okay and so somehow it's being produced

1341
01:04:19,219 --> 01:04:25,230
within the bucket no matter the type of

1342
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,960
birth all right the second thing that

1343
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:31,590
was interesting is that you zoom in to

1344
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:34,710
one specific day within those two weeks

1345
01:04:31,590 --> 01:04:38,910
no matter the burp style what you're

1346
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:42,329
seeing is a huge decrease in co2 after

1347
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:48,210
the birth which makes sense and then a

1348
01:04:42,329 --> 01:04:50,130
very fast increase and so when we looked

1349
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:50,730
at the times of when all this was

1350
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:53,160
happening

1351
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:55,110
well the birth would happen about 7:00

1352
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:57,929
a.m. when people would come in to work

1353
01:04:55,110 --> 01:05:00,930
and just keep in mind that these

1354
01:04:57,929 --> 01:05:02,339
containers were kept in a room where the

1355
01:05:00,929 --> 01:05:07,529
trimming was happening so there are a

1356
01:05:02,340 --> 01:05:10,650
lot of people coming in well the the co2

1357
01:05:07,530 --> 01:05:12,960
would increase until about 5:00 when

1358
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:16,340
everyone got off worked and then it

1359
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:24,389
would slowly decrease when I left work

1360
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:27,000
so he saw that obviously the co2 is well

1361
01:05:24,389 --> 01:05:30,089
the co2 that the humans are producing

1362
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:32,250
are is causing the increase in the

1363
01:05:30,090 --> 01:05:35,250
bucket so the buckets are not gas tied

1364
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:37,469
at least ok so just the amount of humans

1365
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:42,019
in the room was raising the co2 in the

1366
01:05:37,469 --> 01:05:45,299
bucket so what kind of I guess

1367
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:49,500
generalizations can you make based on on

1368
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:54,680
your findings here if any it's yeah it

1369
01:05:49,500 --> 01:05:57,599
it was very surprising honestly you know

1370
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:59,609
I'm these plants at such a low water

1371
01:05:57,599 --> 01:06:03,839
activity I just couldn't imagine any

1372
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:06,320
sort of respirations happening is there

1373
01:06:03,840 --> 01:06:08,730
any sort of fermentation happening I

1374
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:10,860
I've discussed this with a quite a

1375
01:06:08,730 --> 01:06:13,199
number of folks and it's still very

1376
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:16,650
confusing what's going on but at least

1377
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:19,919
having some data a little bit of insight

1378
01:06:16,650 --> 01:06:22,019
of you know what might be going on it's

1379
01:06:19,920 --> 01:06:24,150
a good start I mean there there's so

1380
01:06:22,019 --> 01:06:27,840
many follow-ups to these experiments we

1381
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:31,170
need to do but yeah that was just

1382
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:33,590
interesting to see as well but you know

1383
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:35,639
looking next that relative humidity

1384
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:37,320
because one of the answers I would

1385
01:06:35,639 --> 01:06:39,839
always get with you know what's

1386
01:06:37,320 --> 01:06:42,360
happening in the Cure is oh it's

1387
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:45,030
releasing moisture on what it was that

1388
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:51,358
mean releasing moisture

1389
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:54,960
and so this was regardless of the type

1390
01:06:51,358 --> 01:06:57,509
of bird - the control so you know the

1391
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,960
the out cupboard and the industry Birds

1392
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:04,859
what would happen is when it's closed

1393
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:07,199
it's a very stagnant line and you know

1394
01:07:04,858 --> 01:07:09,690
that about 50 percent humidity and then

1395
01:07:07,199 --> 01:07:13,379
when the burp happened the humidity

1396
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:17,130
would increase or decrease and this

1397
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:20,130
would happen in correlation to what was

1398
01:07:17,130 --> 01:07:23,220
in the range so if the room had 30%

1399
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:27,539
humidity and we did a bird it would drop

1400
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:29,939
for about 30 minutes to about 50 percent

1401
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:31,769
humidity and then go back to exactly

1402
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:33,450
where it was and then the same with the

1403
01:07:31,769 --> 01:07:35,789
inverse if it's very humid in the room

1404
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:38,719
it would pop up very quickly during the

1405
01:07:35,789 --> 01:07:43,858
bird and then go back to where it was so

1406
01:07:38,719 --> 01:07:46,980
there is no per se release of moisture

1407
01:07:43,858 --> 01:07:48,420
it's just it's accumulating whatever's

1408
01:07:46,980 --> 01:07:49,920
happened or not accumulating but it's

1409
01:07:48,420 --> 01:07:53,550
that it's acclimating to whatever is

1410
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:54,568
happening in the race so that was

1411
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:56,970
interesting

1412
01:07:54,568 --> 01:07:59,880
but I think I think the only thing we

1413
01:07:56,969 --> 01:08:01,318
truly proved in this study we did have

1414
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:04,380
interesting findings but the only thing

1415
01:08:01,318 --> 01:08:08,250
I think we truly found was that the cure

1416
01:08:04,380 --> 01:08:12,690
is a homogeneous ation and so the birds

1417
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:16,859
dry from the outside in meaning that the

1418
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:18,600
outside of the bud least their moisture

1419
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:21,690
first and then eventually it comes out

1420
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:25,880
the inside and so this was proven by at

1421
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:29,099
the beginning of curing taking lots of

1422
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:31,829
water activity samples and what we saw

1423
01:08:29,100 --> 01:08:33,810
is there was huge variance between the

1424
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:35,969
samples and this makes sense because

1425
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:38,789
there's big bugs big but big behind

1426
01:08:35,969 --> 01:08:41,069
small buds all sorts of buds and they

1427
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:45,329
had very different water activity all

1428
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:49,230
right once two weeks passed we took this

1429
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:51,329
water activity samples again and so what

1430
01:08:49,229 --> 01:08:53,849
we found with children to interesting

1431
01:08:51,329 --> 01:08:57,600
things one being the variance was much

1432
01:08:53,850 --> 01:08:58,889
smaller meaning whether it was a small

1433
01:08:57,600 --> 01:09:00,869
bud or a big boy

1434
01:08:58,889 --> 01:09:03,179
they were very similar in water activity

1435
01:09:00,868 --> 01:09:06,539
the other thing that was interesting is

1436
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:09,298
that overall the water activity

1437
01:09:06,539 --> 01:09:12,000
increased and so this doesn't mean that

1438
01:09:09,298 --> 01:09:14,338
the buds were getting more wet this

1439
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:17,009
means that the moisture that was inside

1440
01:09:14,338 --> 01:09:19,979
or the moisture that was you know within

1441
01:09:17,009 --> 01:09:22,048
the the deep crevices of the big bud was

1442
01:09:19,979 --> 01:09:24,899
going to the small bud and they're all

1443
01:09:22,048 --> 01:09:28,139
having a very similar water activity

1444
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:30,658
moisture content so it was homogenizing

1445
01:09:28,139 --> 01:09:33,029
so by putting it into a bucket or

1446
01:09:30,658 --> 01:09:35,698
container like that you're allowing all

1447
01:09:33,029 --> 01:09:37,259
of the moisture in all the buds to sort

1448
01:09:35,698 --> 01:09:40,009
of homogenized this is sort of what

1449
01:09:37,259 --> 01:09:42,210
you're getting it yeah exactly

1450
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,579
so there is the advantage to putting in

1451
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:47,368
these buckets to homogenize the moisture

1452
01:09:44,579 --> 01:09:49,679
but you couldn't draw any conclusions

1453
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:53,099
regarding - burping is in terms of it

1454
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:57,389
being beneficial or not no conclusions

1455
01:09:53,100 --> 01:10:00,690
we do know there is a a wild exchange of

1456
01:09:57,389 --> 01:10:04,529
gases you know we did have an ethylene

1457
01:10:00,689 --> 01:10:07,799
sensor but it was borrowed and it was

1458
01:10:04,529 --> 01:10:09,269
not working very well and so I really

1459
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:11,340
wanted to measure the ethylene that was

1460
01:10:09,270 --> 01:10:16,290
being produced and I wasn't able to

1461
01:10:11,340 --> 01:10:19,350
correlate it but I can conclude that the

1462
01:10:16,289 --> 01:10:21,269
amounts of ethylene was just out of this

1463
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:25,139
world I had never seen numbers that high

1464
01:10:21,270 --> 01:10:26,940
and so I can't tell you if that's good

1465
01:10:25,139 --> 01:10:29,130
and we want to increase uh saline or if

1466
01:10:26,939 --> 01:10:30,960
we want to decrease it but I can tell

1467
01:10:29,130 --> 01:10:34,139
you it's there and it's very very high

1468
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:37,829
and so so much more research needs to be

1469
01:10:34,139 --> 01:10:40,590
done but this was just kind of a first

1470
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:43,289
babble just trying to see what's

1471
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:46,529
happening in there but yeah like I said

1472
01:10:43,289 --> 01:10:48,479
lots more to be done yeah I didn't I

1473
01:10:46,529 --> 01:10:50,189
never really have thought about cannabis

1474
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,678
in relation to ethylene I mean when I

1475
01:10:50,189 --> 01:10:55,099
think of ethylene I think of bananas or

1476
01:10:52,679 --> 01:10:58,800
apples and like you mentioned how we use

1477
01:10:55,100 --> 01:11:00,840
ethylene or try and modulate ethylene in

1478
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,920
those industries because it does have

1479
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,730
such a ripening effect on fruit so

1480
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:07,649
essentially what you're getting at is

1481
01:11:05,729 --> 01:11:09,689
that we don't know if ethylene is good

1482
01:11:07,649 --> 01:11:11,129
or bad or if the burping by you know

1483
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:13,089
lowering the ethylene is going to

1484
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:15,850
improve the quality of the cure

1485
01:11:13,090 --> 01:11:18,579
or we want to not burp it all and raise

1486
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:21,370
ethylene levels sounds really

1487
01:11:18,579 --> 01:11:23,710
interesting I would speculate that we're

1488
01:11:21,369 --> 01:11:25,779
removing the ethylene when you burp and

1489
01:11:23,710 --> 01:11:27,779
that is potentially beneficial just

1490
01:11:25,779 --> 01:11:31,889
based on what the industry is sort of

1491
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:35,380
you know anecdotally moved towards but

1492
01:11:31,890 --> 01:11:37,329
we really don't know it sounds like yeah

1493
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,550
we really don't know or is it a good

1494
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:44,890
thing and is it is it helping to speed

1495
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:48,190
up the ripening process which you know

1496
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:50,560
is that is that making the bud sweeter

1497
01:11:48,189 --> 01:11:54,069
is that getting rid of the Corso or it's

1498
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:56,890
not the grassy I really can't say but I

1499
01:11:54,069 --> 01:11:59,619
think it is be investigated that's

1500
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:01,450
really interesting yeah I I can't wait

1501
01:11:59,619 --> 01:12:04,840
to see more research on that and thanks

1502
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:07,119
for sharing that so sure moving on from

1503
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:09,340
curing the last topic I wanted to cover

1504
01:12:07,119 --> 01:12:12,460
really quick was sort of this concept

1505
01:12:09,340 --> 01:12:15,550
around myths and I know we've kind of

1506
01:12:12,460 --> 01:12:17,020
touched on a few things already but is

1507
01:12:15,550 --> 01:12:19,270
there anything else that you've seen you

1508
01:12:17,020 --> 01:12:20,740
know coming out of your you know having

1509
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:23,110
this degree coming into the cannabis

1510
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:24,219
industry with your background is there

1511
01:12:23,109 --> 01:12:25,929
anything else you're noticing that

1512
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:31,240
really stood out to you is sort of a

1513
01:12:25,930 --> 01:12:32,829
sort of a crazy methodology or anything

1514
01:12:31,239 --> 01:12:34,269
that we're doing in this industry that's

1515
01:12:32,829 --> 01:12:37,779
just that's just really unique or

1516
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:40,000
different yeah you know a lot of it

1517
01:12:37,779 --> 01:12:43,899
always goes back to fertilizer for me

1518
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:47,590
but the concept of Flushing's that's one

1519
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:50,949
I'm still questioning you're the only

1520
01:12:47,590 --> 01:12:52,690
research I've seen put out is from I

1521
01:12:50,949 --> 01:12:57,489
can't remember the name it was from a

1522
01:12:52,689 --> 01:13:00,699
master's degree dissertation in Canada

1523
01:12:57,489 --> 01:13:03,039
where they were looking at Flushing but

1524
01:13:00,699 --> 01:13:07,899
all they really measured was the amount

1525
01:13:03,039 --> 01:13:11,260
of nutrients within the flower and so

1526
01:13:07,899 --> 01:13:14,019
not not form of nutrients but just

1527
01:13:11,260 --> 01:13:17,470
elementals basically and so what they

1528
01:13:14,020 --> 01:13:21,090
found is that with flushing whether it's

1529
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:23,949
one week two weeks that there was no

1530
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:26,679
decrease in elements which makes

1531
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:28,420
complete sense because you know you hear

1532
01:13:26,679 --> 01:13:30,190
you're flushing you're flushing the

1533
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:32,560
nutrients out of the plant well that's

1534
01:13:30,189 --> 01:13:36,969
not assignment possible you might

1535
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:40,090
manipulate the form that the nutrient is

1536
01:13:36,969 --> 01:13:42,189
in but you're not just gonna yeah for

1537
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:45,100
some remove parts that have developed

1538
01:13:42,189 --> 01:13:47,079
into the cells of these plants so you

1539
01:13:45,100 --> 01:13:49,179
know that that stays showed that no

1540
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:53,350
you're not removing nutrients you know

1541
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:56,440
fact but that doesn't mean that you're

1542
01:13:53,350 --> 01:14:02,320
not change that restricting nutrients is

1543
01:13:56,439 --> 01:14:07,119
not changing potentially you know the

1544
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:08,889
form and also you're not speeding up

1545
01:14:07,119 --> 01:14:11,679
some of those post-harvest processes

1546
01:14:08,890 --> 01:14:15,280
that are beneficial so you know maybe if

1547
01:14:11,679 --> 01:14:17,619
you are causing nutrient deficiency then

1548
01:14:15,279 --> 01:14:20,859
maybe the plant thinks it's time to be

1549
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:23,289
harvested it's the fall and you know

1550
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:25,829
speeding up some of these ripening

1551
01:14:23,289 --> 01:14:29,109
procedures like the starch to sugar or

1552
01:14:25,829 --> 01:14:32,738
core so degradation that could in fact

1553
01:14:29,109 --> 01:14:38,198
yield a better quality post-harvest

1554
01:14:32,738 --> 01:14:42,029
flower I'm not sure or you know it's

1555
01:14:38,198 --> 01:14:44,919
flushing beneficial because we are over

1556
01:14:42,029 --> 01:14:48,460
fertilizing the plants and this is

1557
01:14:44,920 --> 01:14:50,710
actually a break for the plants to you

1558
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:52,810
know to not be does not have salinity

1559
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:55,600
stress and it's actually an opposite

1560
01:14:52,810 --> 01:14:59,020
stress very quickly done to the plant

1561
01:14:55,600 --> 01:15:01,360
two weeks before I don't know and I

1562
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:03,219
don't have any of those answers but you

1563
01:15:01,359 --> 01:15:05,319
know I get frustrated when people just

1564
01:15:03,219 --> 01:15:06,969
generally say oh you're getting rid of

1565
01:15:05,319 --> 01:15:09,130
the nutrients and the planet you know

1566
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:11,529
it's it doesn't make sense I think we've

1567
01:15:09,130 --> 01:15:14,409
got to strive to ask more questions and

1568
01:15:11,529 --> 01:15:16,630
not be stuck on just carrying around the

1569
01:15:14,408 --> 01:15:18,789
myth that you know other growers have

1570
01:15:16,630 --> 01:15:21,250
said I think it's I think it's okay to

1571
01:15:18,789 --> 01:15:22,630
say we don't know I think it's okay to

1572
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:26,920
try these things on our own

1573
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:29,050
and and figure it out together yeah so

1574
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:30,880
essentially it's very well established

1575
01:15:29,050 --> 01:15:32,440
that you're not removing nutrients from

1576
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:36,520
the plant when you flush and that's just

1577
01:15:32,439 --> 01:15:38,979
basic plant science but possibly by

1578
01:15:36,520 --> 01:15:40,060
removing the nutrients from the media we

1579
01:15:38,979 --> 01:15:42,219
may be in

1580
01:15:40,060 --> 01:15:44,820
like speeding up senescence or creating

1581
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:48,640
a stress response that allows for

1582
01:15:44,819 --> 01:15:51,039
potentially altering the the quality or

1583
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:51,940
quantity of our final crop yeah

1584
01:15:51,039 --> 01:15:54,340
absolutely

1585
01:15:51,939 --> 01:15:55,389
okay that makes sense anything else

1586
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:59,470
around the myths that you wanted to

1587
01:15:55,390 --> 01:16:01,000
discuss or other concepts that you found

1588
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,659
don't just just haven't played out in

1589
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,880
real life

1590
01:16:01,659 --> 01:16:07,239
you know as I think we covered them

1591
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,859
mostly the main ones that I have in mind

1592
01:16:07,239 --> 01:16:11,679
and that you know I've been able to

1593
01:16:08,859 --> 01:16:14,920
touch on somehow through research even

1594
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:19,150
it says you know again those inclusions

1595
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:22,600
but at least the starts yeah I think

1596
01:16:19,149 --> 01:16:26,589
that cannabis has done a great job you

1597
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:28,600
know conducting throwing and and and

1598
01:16:26,590 --> 01:16:31,239
doing things without being able to go to

1599
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:34,840
your Extension agent or you know take a

1600
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:38,019
class it's it's pretty amazing how its

1601
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:40,140
progressed and it's just exciting to to

1602
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:42,580
help put some of those data points on

1603
01:16:40,140 --> 01:16:44,740
you know successful growing techniques

1604
01:16:42,579 --> 01:16:46,449
well I appreciate you sharing all this

1605
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:48,789
information I know that a lot of time

1606
01:16:46,449 --> 01:16:51,189
and money goes into creating these

1607
01:16:48,789 --> 01:16:52,869
experiments and the fact that you're so

1608
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:54,189
you're so willing to share this freely

1609
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:56,439
with other growers I think is quite

1610
01:16:54,189 --> 01:16:58,569
remarkable and I really appreciate that

1611
01:16:56,439 --> 01:16:59,979
and I really thank you for all the great

1612
01:16:58,569 --> 01:17:02,619
work you've done already in this

1613
01:16:59,979 --> 01:17:04,389
industry and sort of bringing science to

1614
01:17:02,619 --> 01:17:07,000
the forefront so that we can learn a lot

1615
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:08,950
more about this plant and really draw

1616
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:12,189
effective conclusions as to what's going

1617
01:17:08,949 --> 01:17:13,479
on absolutely it's my pleasure all right

1618
01:17:12,189 --> 01:17:16,419
well thanks for your time today Allison

1619
01:17:13,479 --> 01:17:18,309
I can't wait to hear what you what you

1620
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:20,079
learn and come up with next and I really

1621
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:25,330
appreciate you coming on the show today

1622
01:17:20,079 --> 01:17:28,029
that was Allison justice without co and
