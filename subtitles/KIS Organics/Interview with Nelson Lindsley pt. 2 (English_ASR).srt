welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,330
science podcast

4
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:16,609
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,379
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:16,609 --> 00:00:20,390
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:18,379 --> 00:00:22,309
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:24,289
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:22,309 --> 00:00:25,879
share their wisdom and knowledge don't

10
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,650

also sign up for our newsletters on our

13
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:33,800
website as it's the best way to find out

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,280
what new episodes of blogposts come out

15
00:00:33,799 --> 00:00:38,780
as well as any discounts or coupon codes

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,340
speaking of discounts I've gotten a lot

17
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,590
of feedback from people who are wanting

18
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:43,760
to try out this style of cultivation but

19
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:45,500
they live on the other side of the

20
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:47,119
country or in areas where it's hard to

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,490
source many of these ingredients in

22
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:52,549
order to get people started I'm offering

23
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:54,800
50% off on a bag of our biochar or water

24
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:56,569
only soils for this month only through a

25
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:58,309
one plant your grow room and just give

26
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,380
it water and see how it compares to your

27
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,600
current growing method then at the end

28
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,320
of the cycle just reinvent that soil and

29
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,689
use it again

30
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:08,118
typically we see even better results the

31
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:10,099
second cycle just put the code living

32
00:01:08,118 --> 00:01:12,799
soil when checking out on kiss organics

33
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:14,328
calm and let me know what you think this

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,280
is the second part of our interview with

35
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:18,559
Nelson Linsley of poetry of plants

36
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,030
Nelson is a cannabis consultant down in

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,129
California who has some unique

38
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:23,899
perspectives on cultivation as well as a

39
00:01:22,129 --> 00:01:26,420
vast amount of expertise regarding

40
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:28,968
lighting technologies we pick up right

41
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:30,530
where we left off last episode and start

42
00:01:28,968 --> 00:01:33,048
talking about how he's getting some

43
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,599
massive yields in this garden alright

44
00:01:33,049 --> 00:01:37,460
let's let's change topics then yeah one

45
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:39,589
of the things I wanted to talk to you

46
00:01:37,459 --> 00:01:41,899
about then was you do a lot of

47
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:45,228
consulting and one thing I haven't

48
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:47,450
mentioned yet in this talk is the yields

49
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:50,539
that you're getting which is really huge

50
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:54,079
I heard from David you are at 90 grams

51
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:55,879
per square foot is that right yes which

52
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:59,809
doesn't that translate to over four

53
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:02,208
pounds per perlite approximately I don't

54
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,490
ever measure by light that's that's what

55
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:05,810
that we've got to stop doing I agree

56
00:02:04,489 --> 00:02:08,240
with you it's just that's the standard

57
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:11,030
the people know right it wouldn't be no

58
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:13,280
wouldn't be four pounds it was okay if

59
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:14,629
we're gonna look at it per spider it was

60
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,960
three point two five

61
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:20,799
five pounds per spider okay but it was

62
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,570
really three point two five pounds and a

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,490
4x4 a little bit less than a 4x4 because

64
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,889
it was a custom tray and the plants were

65
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,930
spilling out on the perimeter so we

66
00:02:27,889 --> 00:02:32,059
could even say that if we're you know

67
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:33,980
that the canopy measurements and heel

68
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,840
measurements are a little muddy and I

69
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:38,899
try and be as transparent as possible

70
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,229
about that so that that was the figure

71
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:44,990
that we measured based on the tray size

72
00:02:42,229 --> 00:02:47,449
at four by four okay but the plants were

73
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:48,770
definitely at that point falling and

74
00:02:47,449 --> 00:02:51,589
toppling all over the place

75
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:53,780
the highest I've seen with organics pure

76
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,450
organics is around sixty grams per

77
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:58,879
square foot yeah it's really good it is

78
00:02:56,449 --> 00:03:01,159
it's great you're obviously crushing it

79
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,590
on yield I just kind of wanted to get

80
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:04,969
into that a little bit in terms of some

81
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,310
of the methods that you're using there

82
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,780
you meant again we talked about this

83
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,939
hybrid method you're talking about the

84
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,289
lighting you've talked about a little

85
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,579
bit about temperature and humidity is

86
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:16,849
there anything else you want to touch on

87
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:19,100
there you got to have good genetics you

88
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:22,129
know I mean that's if you're if you're

89
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:24,289
taking a really beat genetic and trying

90
00:03:22,129 --> 00:03:25,549
to get high yields out of it you're not

91
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,189
gonna get high yields out of it I mean

92
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,410
that sure that's like a you know there's

93
00:03:28,189 --> 00:03:32,120
been a couple strains there's this such

94
00:03:30,409 --> 00:03:35,000
an egg company up in Washington called

95
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,000
exotic genetics that I've gotten some

96
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,659
some some funny plants from that are

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,259
awesome they grow totally crazy and they

98
00:03:41,659 --> 00:03:48,099
produce extremely high yields and then

99
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:52,099
I'll have a plant next to it that is a

100
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:55,519
fraction of that so a lot of the key is

101
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:57,979
really learning the plant having a

102
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,810
high-quality cultivar that's bred for

103
00:03:57,979 --> 00:04:01,159
high yields right because not all

104
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,650
strains are bred for high yields you're

105
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,829
not going to get 90 grams per square

106
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,520
foot from you know San Fernando Valley

107
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,900
og plant you know or a Girl Scout cookie

108
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,610
or a Candyland I've never gotten that

109
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:16,280
and I don't believe anybody that says

110
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:18,170
they have because I know the plants

111
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:21,349
morphology so there's certain strands

112
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:23,000
where they've been bred in a way to

113
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:26,960
produce those high yields if the

114
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,790
environment is is is dialed in for it

115
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:33,019
and also plant second hand

116
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:35,210
very high light levels are gonna explode

117
00:04:33,019 --> 00:04:37,069
be explosive and that's one of things we

118
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:38,599
can do with the LED lighting is when you

119
00:04:37,069 --> 00:04:40,670
have that plant you create that

120
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,760
environment and you can just feed it

121
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:44,930
photons it you know I you know I don't

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,219
know where the ceiling is yet but I

123
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:48,980
don't think I've reached it I think I

124
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,470
can do even more but that's that is a

125
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,720
genetic genetics are you know I can't

126
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,070
take a lot of credit for it because you

127
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,810
know I think the plant does most of the

128
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:58,909
work you know to be honest with you as

129
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,410
long as you give the plant the right you

130
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,260
know stage to get going

131
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:06,470
and I'd never gotten those yields with

132
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:08,329
high pressure sodium or heli seeds I've

133
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:12,230
only got those yields with with like

134
00:05:08,329 --> 00:05:14,810
really high high high ppfd LEDs just to

135
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:16,220
be clear on that with the one run where

136
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,620
that first happened because when I first

137
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:20,090
started growing under LEDs I was not

138
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:22,699
getting great yields but I was doing

139
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:24,079
things wrong and started making

140
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:25,599
adjustments to the environment the

141
00:05:24,079 --> 00:05:28,099
number one thing was the vapor pressure

142
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,290
differential I would say that's a big

143
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,410
key that people miss is that they run

144
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,910
too low of a humidity and people are

145
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:37,100
scared to run high humidity of course

146
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:39,530
because of powdery mildew but if you can

147
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:41,210
find you can also test to see if a plant

148
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:43,939
is powdery mildew resistant there's a

149
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:45,139
company out of Boston called medicinal

150
00:05:43,939 --> 00:05:46,759
genomics I'm going to put this down for

151
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:49,219
everybody if you're paying attention and

152
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:52,039
they sell a little device that you can

153
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:54,260
take you know some leaf sap or a leaf

154
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,840
tissue and it tests the DNA of the plant

155
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,779
and tells you if the plan has powdery

156
00:05:56,839 --> 00:06:02,000
mildew in it and it tells you if the

157
00:05:59,779 --> 00:06:04,759
plant is pad it has it has the powdery

158
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,550
mildew resistant genome and if it has

159
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:09,529
that gene so if you can find plants that

160
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:11,180
are powdery mildew resistant that don't

161
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:13,579
have powdery mildew in them that haven't

162
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:15,560
been expressed yet then you're not gonna

163
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:18,259
have any problems running a higher

164
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,060
humidity in those first three weeks so

165
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,500
that's something that's really key so if

166
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,600
you've got a plant that's got powdery

167
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,670
mildew in it you're gonna have that

168
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,010
powdery mildew probably is it's going to

169
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,840
express itself if you start to kind of

170
00:06:28,009 --> 00:06:31,789
crank it and do any stress to the plant

171
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:33,289
so that's also something important for

172
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,550
people to know and there's technology

173
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,560
out there to tell you whether you have

174
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,829
powdery mildew in the plant which is a

175
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:42,439
systemic systemic issue so that that

176
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:44,300
that's the key for that and then running

177
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:46,369
or fertilization levels again some of

178
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:47,749
this stuff I've covered because you're

179
00:06:46,369 --> 00:06:50,689
gonna have higher transpiration rates

180
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:53,539
and then gradually ramping up the light

181
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:56,778
and not going full-tilt right off the

182
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:58,459
bat so someone wanted to transition

183
00:06:56,778 --> 00:07:00,558
let's say we have a grower that's been

184
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:02,389
using general hydroponics or advanced

185
00:07:00,559 --> 00:07:03,649
nutrients and they hear this talk and

186
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:06,259
they say okay I want to start

187
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:09,050
transitioning over and considering

188
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,999
organics and considering getting off of

189
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:12,348
these bottle of nutrients where would

190
00:07:10,999 --> 00:07:14,838
they where do you recommend they would

191
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:18,168
start sourcing some of these mineral

192
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:21,228
salts at a more affordable level Peters

193
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:24,829
and grow more are two companies that

194
00:07:21,228 --> 00:07:27,139
make mineral salt blends that that you

195
00:07:24,829 --> 00:07:30,348
can source and get bags of this

196
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:33,408
gnarly-looking blue powder that is has a

197
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:35,149
solid mineral salt formulation that can

198
00:07:33,408 --> 00:07:38,778
be a basis for getting into it now I

199
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:40,968
still use the amended peat moss so I

200
00:07:38,778 --> 00:07:44,959
really use those mineral salts as a way

201
00:07:40,968 --> 00:07:47,058
to give it what I think it needs those

202
00:07:44,959 --> 00:07:50,088
all those high yields I never went above

203
00:07:47,059 --> 00:07:50,769
one point to EC that was it just to be

204
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,449
clear on that

205
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:55,459
and I've tried ramping it up and all

206
00:07:53,449 --> 00:07:56,929
I've seen is negative results so I've

207
00:07:55,459 --> 00:07:59,509
gotten the best results with a lightly

208
00:07:56,928 --> 00:08:01,908
amended peat moss and with a grow more

209
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:03,860
people on our grow more in Peters blend

210
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:05,360
so when you say peat moss you're going

211
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,999
out getting spanked in peat moss like a

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,278
bale of it then and then yes bagmen peat

213
00:08:07,999 --> 00:08:12,139
moss sorry to be clear it's [ __ ] no mitts

214
00:08:10,278 --> 00:08:14,838
I was listening you guys talk about that

215
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:17,809
but it's it's the sunshine mix or Sun

216
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:20,509
grill okay you know it's got some

217
00:08:17,809 --> 00:08:22,159
dolomite in it and some perlite and then

218
00:08:20,509 --> 00:08:23,778
do you it sounds I'm guessing you iCal

219
00:08:22,158 --> 00:08:27,618
to that it sounds like you're a big help

220
00:08:23,778 --> 00:08:30,110
fan yeah I do add kelp I add a began ik

221
00:08:27,619 --> 00:08:32,870
worm castings so there's no you know I'm

222
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,259
not using any animal products in the

223
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:34,818
soil

224
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:36,318
I haven't had good results with that yet

225
00:08:34,818 --> 00:08:37,578
I know some people have good results

226
00:08:36,318 --> 00:08:39,918
with bone meal and other kinds of things

227
00:08:37,578 --> 00:08:42,578
I've just had better results not doing

228
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,929
that and using vegetable compost

229
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,370
interesting interesting yeah I

230
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:49,849
personally don't have any issues with

231
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:51,139
animal by-products but I understand that

232
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:53,959
some people do which is where this hold

233
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:55,339
fig anak industry came out of I don't I

234
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:56,389
don't have an issue with it either I

235
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:58,610
just

236
00:08:56,389 --> 00:09:01,789
I've tried it and I've gotten better

237
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,610
results with the with the hybrid blend

238
00:09:01,789 --> 00:09:05,959
right so okay that's that's what I'm

239
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:07,399
saying so I mean I don't think there's

240
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,620
anything wrong with it and I think it's

241
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:12,529
actually could be part of sustainable

242
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:15,080
agriculture it is now but I just gotten

243
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:20,269
the best results using that type of

244
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:22,490
amendment kelp what else some some some

245
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:25,579
mineral some of the glacial rock dust as

246
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:30,769
well a little bit of that yeah and just

247
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:32,450
keeping it simple right great so I just

248
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:33,529
wanted to give someone an idea of what

249
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:36,320
they could do if they wanted to start

250
00:09:33,529 --> 00:09:37,879
experimenting with this sort of thing Oh

251
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,710
in silica that's the other thing I

252
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:43,490
forgot to talk about that and I see that

253
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:46,759
you guys offer a potassium silicon yeah

254
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,289
the potassium silicon thing is it's the

255
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:50,299
same no matter where you buy it it's

256
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:53,299
it's what's in dyna-gro protect it's all

257
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:54,709
coming from one company they're a lot of

258
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:57,829
the silica blast and all that they're

259
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:59,900
just adding water to it exactly so the

260
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:02,060
egg still 16h we carry it a lot of

261
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:03,529
people carry it there's nothing unique

262
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:07,399
about it but that is a good way to pick

263
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:08,929
up silica it's not fully organic well

264
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,569
where where it's so a quick question

265
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:13,909
work and this is something that I

266
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:16,580
haven't done enough research on but

267
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:18,439
where is silica where can we not I mean

268
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,910
silica sand right are we adding are you

269
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,400
if you're gonna go straight organic and

270
00:10:19,909 --> 00:10:24,319
you don't want to use an ionic nutrient

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,789
or the potassium silicon how do you

272
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,200
provide silica to the plant and how

273
00:10:25,789 --> 00:10:28,819
would you foliar feed that because

274
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,550
that's another strategy that I use as

275
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,530
well is I like to foliar feed potassium

276
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:34,969
so look at that that seems to do very

277
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,169
what the planet seems to do very well

278
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:37,970
respond very well with that

279
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,689
and interchanging that with the kelp

280
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,610
full foliar spray as well so we're

281
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:45,560
getting a little bit outside of just my

282
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:49,039
knowledge in my head here when I have

283
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:50,989
offhand in terms of the silica I know

284
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:52,849
diatomaceous earth is really high in

285
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,279
silica you mentioned silica sand I

286
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:58,610
believe those are in the form of silicon

287
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:01,309
dioxide okay which takes a little bit

288
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,019
longer to break down and I was asking at

289
00:11:01,309 --> 00:11:05,059
this last trade shows at us asking some

290
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:06,379
of these guys you know that do this to

291
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,929
make the sand and the diatomaceous earth

292
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:10,159
how long it takes for the silica become

293
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:11,929
available and they couldn't really

294
00:11:10,159 --> 00:11:12,860
me an answer yeah I haven't gotten I

295
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:16,399
haven't found an answer to that either

296
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:18,350
and that and that you know that's why I

297
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,870
haven't I stopped using it you know and

298
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,519
I went back to the potassium silicon

299
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:26,089
well I think it's gonna vary based on

300
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:28,429
how how much biological activity you

301
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:30,350
have in your soils so it is fair to say

302
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:31,489
that you can't just give a given number

303
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:34,100
but we could say that maybe it's

304
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:36,980
available within you know month to three

305
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,389
months or some sort of timeline is sort

306
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,250
of what I was looking for just a general

307
00:11:38,389 --> 00:11:41,899
idea you know if this isn't gonna be

308
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,720
available for five years it's probably

309
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:48,350
not something a many use yes in my soil

310
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,300
so that's that's one aspect of it work

311
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,610
it artwork getting decent silica levels

312
00:11:50,299 --> 00:11:54,198
just from the various combination of

313
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:56,600
amendments that we're using in our soils

314
00:11:54,198 --> 00:11:58,758
but as you know silica has so many

315
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,589
benefits I'll actually attach a silica

316
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:01,669
article to this podcast so people can

317
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,129
read it

318
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:06,229
it's called silica the strange medium

319
00:12:04,129 --> 00:12:08,060
element and it talks about all the

320
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:11,149
benefits of silica from drought stress

321
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:13,309
to actually mitigating trace mineral

322
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,620
excesses so if you have in the leaf

323
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:19,879
itself so it doesn't make that extra

324
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:21,259
manganese ore copper unable to be taken

325
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:24,139
up by the plant but what it does is it

326
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:25,789
actually spreads it more evenly through

327
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:29,810
the leaf tissue Wow so that you have

328
00:12:25,789 --> 00:12:32,299
less toxicity effects from the excess

329
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:34,729
micronutrient it's really cool stuff so

330
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:37,278
well that big fan so yeah yeah cuz so

331
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:38,600
when I've been pushing the light levels

332
00:12:37,278 --> 00:12:42,169
to see where the threshold is for

333
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,439
strains a lot of times I you know well

334
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:47,208
every time I'm spraying silica and that

335
00:12:45,438 --> 00:12:49,610
always seems to mitigate any kind of

336
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:52,338
light stress if it's gradually coming on

337
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,568
if it's if it's gone full-tilt then

338
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:55,639
there's not a whole heck of a lot I can

339
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:57,649
do to bring it back but the silica is

340
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:59,120
something that I use in conjunction with

341
00:12:57,649 --> 00:13:01,159
ramping up the light so that's something

342
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:03,620
I should mention I mean that's and and I

343
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:05,870
play around with dilution ratios you

344
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,269
know so I also sometimes go you know

345
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:09,620
three X on the dosage just to see what

346
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:12,049
happens and I haven't seen any negative

347
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,389
results yet by going a high on the

348
00:13:12,049 --> 00:13:15,799
silica well you say three X are you

349
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:18,049
going off of the rates that say they

350
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:21,828
recommend with dyna-gro yes yes yeah

351
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:22,899
okay so just for people listening if you

352
00:13:21,828 --> 00:13:25,239
do go out and

353
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:27,549
excel 16h well we do carry it on our

354
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:29,948
website when you go to mix it be sure to

355
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:32,109
add water to the container first before

356
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:33,159
you pour the powder in it's a exothermic

357
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:35,079
reaction

358
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:36,368
you'll get Heat you don't want to burn

359
00:13:35,078 --> 00:13:39,308
through the bottom of that bucket we're

360
00:13:36,369 --> 00:13:40,540
al aspirator wear gloves you know you

361
00:13:39,308 --> 00:13:44,588
don't want to come in contact with this

362
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:47,318
material but you can mix your own you

363
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:48,910
know your own protect for a quarter of

364
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:52,058
the cost yeah so it's a really

365
00:13:48,909 --> 00:13:54,278
affordable way of using using silicone

366
00:13:52,058 --> 00:13:55,958
your garden absolutely absolutely and

367
00:13:54,278 --> 00:13:57,909
you know and I would say if you're if

368
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:59,169
you're trying to scale your garden you

369
00:13:57,909 --> 00:14:03,789
shouldn't be scaling it with bottled

370
00:13:59,169 --> 00:14:06,128
nutrients that's one thing just a side

371
00:14:03,789 --> 00:14:07,748
note so learn learn all those those

372
00:14:06,129 --> 00:14:10,389
safety practices when it comes to mixing

373
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:12,819
your own fertilizers regardless of what

374
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,799
it is I mean you're gonna be if with

375
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:17,198
micro cores I and or micro eyes'll and

376
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:18,519
other other kinds of bacteria I mean I

377
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:19,748
don't know if all of that bacteria you

378
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,308
should be breathing in so you should be

379
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:23,050
wearing a mask you know you should be

380
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:26,019
taking safety precautions I mean maybe

381
00:14:23,049 --> 00:14:27,669
you have a couple notes on that as well

382
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:29,709
tat as far as how people should be

383
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:32,349
blending their mediums blending their

384
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,729
fertilizers and you know being safe with

385
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:35,290
it because there isn't like necessarily

386
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,909
a you know with the pesticide industry

387
00:14:35,289 --> 00:14:38,769
the label is the law and they give you

388
00:14:36,909 --> 00:14:40,870
specific instructions but there isn't

389
00:14:38,769 --> 00:14:43,480
really a lot of instructions on people

390
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:45,068
how people should be you know making

391
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,920
their soils making their fertilizers all

392
00:14:45,068 --> 00:14:50,229
those kinds of things on on a bag or a

393
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,039
bottle yet yeah that's a really good

394
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,480
point you know I am a cooperative having

395
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:59,139
mixed soils without wearing a mask and

396
00:14:55,480 --> 00:15:00,670
so am i you know i you're young you feel

397
00:14:59,139 --> 00:15:02,860
indestructible you don't think about

398
00:15:00,669 --> 00:15:05,318
that kind of thing as I've gotten older

399
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,610
now I start thinking about how to take

400
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:08,769
care of my body and what I'm breathing

401
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,959
in and I think it is important to wear a

402
00:15:08,769 --> 00:15:13,990
mask just to keep the dust particles

403
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:15,278
yeah at the very least I mean a lot of

404
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:17,169
the stuff we're using in organics it's

405
00:15:15,278 --> 00:15:18,370
not inherently dangerous per se but I

406
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:20,198
don't want to get into your lungs so

407
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:22,089
yeah that's totally agree with you yeah

408
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,198
it's not it's not it's not any you know

409
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:24,970
but you just don't want to be blowing

410
00:15:23,198 --> 00:15:26,708
out smegma for like four days which I

411
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:30,519
definitely have had happen or I'm like

412
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:34,268
ah man why did I do that you know so a

413
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:35,269
funny story I actually we have a feed

414
00:15:34,269 --> 00:15:38,299
store at

415
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:39,649
farm and we got dust mites which are

416
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:40,939
crazy it looks like this and you look

417
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:43,789
really really close and you can see him

418
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,630
moving around and they came in on some

419
00:15:43,789 --> 00:15:49,429
feed and we had I kid you not 55,000

420
00:15:47,629 --> 00:15:51,230
pounds worth of feed in this container I

421
00:15:49,429 --> 00:15:54,139
know because I was counting as I had to

422
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,730
move it all out of the container and in

423
00:15:54,139 --> 00:15:58,399
at night I was up to like three in the

424
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,050
morning moving feed and move it back

425
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,699
into the shipping container but in

426
00:16:00,049 --> 00:16:03,469
between that what I did was I took

427
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,879
everything out and then I just blew the

428
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:07,070
dust out and I wore a respirator and

429
00:16:04,879 --> 00:16:10,189
then I threw diatomaceous earth down and

430
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,510
then I blew that out again you know help

431
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:15,650
kill any dust mites and things like that

432
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:19,549
I didn't wear goggles and my eyes were

433
00:16:15,649 --> 00:16:22,039
bloodshot for like four days what did I

434
00:16:19,549 --> 00:16:24,289
do to myself so I you got it you got it

435
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:26,000
really think about what's in the air

436
00:16:24,289 --> 00:16:28,279
around you when you're growing and just

437
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,960
be really careful because looking back I

438
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,850
was like yeah I should know better I

439
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:34,340
mean this is diatomaceous earth why am i

440
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,620
letting this get in my eyes yeah or oh

441
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:38,720
isn't isn't diatomaceous earth also not

442
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,820
something you want to breathe in oh yeah

443
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,410
no I definitely had a respirator on but

444
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:45,350
I've and then it wasn't enough

445
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:48,199
precaution yeah yeah enemies oh these

446
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,639
are so that's this is goes back to like

447
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,200
well that's that's a good thing to

448
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:52,580
regulate right that would be a good

449
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:55,670
thing because we want people to be safe

450
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:58,100
in the garden so there should be we

451
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:59,539
should have good safety practices in the

452
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,580
garden because we want to be healthy we

453
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:04,069
want to have a lot of energy and we

454
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:05,480
don't want to be sick you know you know

455
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,039
lugging plants around because we'll make

456
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,930
more mistakes you know that's that's

457
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,440
what I know and I'm not healthy in the

458
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,690
garden

459
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,920
usually the garden is a reflection of my

460
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,480
health when my Gardens healthy I'm

461
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:18,410
healthy when I'm not healthy my garden

462
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,519
suffers so you know yeah that reminds me

463
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,190
of something I wanted to mention earlier

464
00:17:19,519 --> 00:17:25,279
when you're talking about protecting

465
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:27,320
yourself from bacteria and yes I do

466
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:28,849
agree with you on that when we're

467
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,679
talking about mixing things but when we

468
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:32,859
talk about getting in the garden and

469
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:35,810
using your hands and getting into soil

470
00:17:32,859 --> 00:17:38,240
there's studies that show that there's

471
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:41,450
bacteria in the soil that actually helps

472
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:44,690
create and stimulate serotonin and

473
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:46,430
happiness and it can actually help with

474
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:49,100
depression and problems like that so

475
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,650
alright I try to get out there

476
00:17:49,099 --> 00:17:53,599
my vegetable garden and let my hands get

477
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,620
dirty and experience that you know and I

478
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:57,609
think it really does it's very

479
00:17:54,619 --> 00:18:01,159
meditative oh I hunted percent agree

480
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:03,349
that that is uh that's what I'm mixing

481
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,150
my soil so what we're talking about as a

482
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:06,829
couple things make sure that your mucous

483
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,070
membranes are protected like your eyes

484
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:11,449
and your nose but yeah man you got to

485
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:12,439
get your hands in the dirt if you're not

486
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,120
getting your hands in the dirt you're

487
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:17,210
missing out because it first of all it

488
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:18,918
just feels awesome you know and as long

489
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:20,569
as it's not the only times I've had

490
00:18:18,919 --> 00:18:22,580
issues with my hands in the dirt is when

491
00:18:20,569 --> 00:18:24,678
I've used like with that with the cow

492
00:18:22,579 --> 00:18:26,509
with the cow manure compost because I've

493
00:18:24,679 --> 00:18:31,940
had a lot of oil in it and it kind of

494
00:18:26,509 --> 00:18:34,509
aid away part of my finger so yeah so

495
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:36,980
there's certain things like if you're

496
00:18:34,509 --> 00:18:38,240
moving to the vegetable earthworms you

497
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:39,860
know castings and all that I've never

498
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,929
had that problem when I don't when I was

499
00:18:39,859 --> 00:18:44,479
using specific types of animal compost

500
00:18:41,929 --> 00:18:48,500
there was definitely some kind of oil in

501
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,298
it that was no good and you just have to

502
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,288
I'm not saying don't put your hands in

503
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:52,369
the dirt I think you need to put your

504
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:53,690
hands in the dirt I think that's

505
00:18:52,369 --> 00:18:56,418
something that everyone on this planet

506
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:58,519
needs to be doing more but just just

507
00:18:56,419 --> 00:19:00,140
just do a little research on when you're

508
00:18:58,519 --> 00:19:03,019
mixing things that's because you're

509
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,220
dealing with higher concentrations yeah

510
00:19:03,019 --> 00:19:06,589
I don't want people to get to take away

511
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,179
that all animal composts are bad I just

512
00:19:06,589 --> 00:19:10,399
to be clear and I know you're not saying

513
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,960
I'm not saying that yeah we use a two to

514
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,509
three year aged fish compost that I'm

515
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:17,779
really pretty happy with for the most

516
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:19,970
part with our soils and I've seen some

517
00:19:17,779 --> 00:19:21,769
great you know soils that were from

518
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:23,690
horse manure and things like that I'm

519
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:25,730
not a big fan of camp cal manure like

520
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:26,779
you mentioned for a variety reasons but

521
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,250
I don't really want to get into that

522
00:19:26,779 --> 00:19:31,279
yeah I mean that much and that's the

523
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:33,288
only that's the only compost that I had

524
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:37,490
I've ever had an issue with and I do use

525
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:39,769
I do use fish comp I do use fish compost

526
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:41,029
as well so that's the oso and I'm

527
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:42,529
thinking animal I'm thinking of

528
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:44,480
terrestrial and I'm all I'm not thinking

529
00:19:42,529 --> 00:19:45,440
about things from the sea thanks I've

530
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,870
never had a problem with anything from

531
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,130
the sea that's uh you know I don't know

532
00:19:47,869 --> 00:19:54,439
why that is maybe it's just me but I

533
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:57,169
love kelp I love fish emulsion all those

534
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:58,340
kinds of things are great all right so

535
00:19:57,169 --> 00:19:59,659
I'm probably gonna have to have you back

536
00:19:58,339 --> 00:20:00,019
on cuz I feel like I could talk to you

537
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:02,840
for hours

538
00:20:00,019 --> 00:20:04,878
yeah that's fine I love it

539
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:06,949
before we go I know you wanted to talk

540
00:20:04,878 --> 00:20:09,019
pesticides let's let's knock that one

541
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:12,319
out because I think you have a really

542
00:20:09,019 --> 00:20:14,028
unique perspective and yeah I kind of

543
00:20:12,319 --> 00:20:17,839
want to come on get that out there sure

544
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:20,450
um so I said there's okay there's some

545
00:20:17,839 --> 00:20:22,158
things out there there's some really bad

546
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,769
pesticide practices that have been going

547
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:27,289
on in the gray and black market for

548
00:20:24,769 --> 00:20:29,210
because it hasn't been regulated and the

549
00:20:27,288 --> 00:20:30,970
best place to find those practices is if

550
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:33,710
you just go on some of these forums and

551
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:36,710
they give you these dilution ratios that

552
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:40,490
are out of this world for pesticides

553
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:42,139
that are labeled for ornamental plants

554
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,999
alright and there's a reason why there

555
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:45,138
have been labeled for ornamental plants

556
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:48,618
because they've done a considerable

557
00:20:45,138 --> 00:20:50,269
amount of research on those pesticides

558
00:20:48,618 --> 00:20:52,490
and that those are pesticides that we

559
00:20:50,269 --> 00:20:54,169
shouldn't be putting into our body for

560
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:57,169
particular reasons you know they could

561
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,629
have a long-term effect on our

562
00:20:57,169 --> 00:21:01,429
mitochondria they could have other kinds

563
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:03,019
of effect on our body that we just want

564
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,419
to stay away from and a little bit of a

565
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:06,888
backstory my brother is a brain cancer

566
00:21:05,419 --> 00:21:08,809
survivor and this is what kind of leads

567
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:10,459
into this little bit but my brother's a

568
00:21:08,808 --> 00:21:12,440
brain cancer survivor and when he was

569
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,179
very I guess he was like three or four

570
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:15,980
years old his cannons brain cancer came

571
00:21:14,179 --> 00:21:18,409
on when he was six he was three or four

572
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,878
years old he had this crazy seizure out

573
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:23,509
in our backyard well they had just

574
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:25,189
applied this organophosphate which most

575
00:21:23,509 --> 00:21:27,769
of those are now been banned but they

576
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,149
had apply to an organophosphate to all

577
00:21:27,769 --> 00:21:30,798
the trees in our backyard because there

578
00:21:29,148 --> 00:21:34,038
had been some African beetle that was

579
00:21:30,798 --> 00:21:35,868
destroying the trees so my brother had a

580
00:21:34,038 --> 00:21:40,009
crazy reaction from it at a crazy

581
00:21:35,868 --> 00:21:41,778
seizure and without any study and now I

582
00:21:40,009 --> 00:21:44,149
don't we don't know I mean there's more

583
00:21:41,778 --> 00:21:45,648
research coming out about why we have

584
00:21:44,148 --> 00:21:47,388
cancer and a lot of thats leaning

585
00:21:45,648 --> 00:21:50,628
towards it's a genetic thing that's

586
00:21:47,388 --> 00:21:52,248
going on and I don't know if it

587
00:21:50,628 --> 00:21:54,798
necessarily correlated with my brother's

588
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:57,139
brain cancer but you know my mother

589
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:59,028
bless her heart total environmentalist

590
00:21:57,138 --> 00:22:02,388
you know went on a campaign against

591
00:21:59,028 --> 00:22:03,950
these pesticides and the good thing was

592
00:22:02,388 --> 00:22:06,439
she ended up working with Cesar Chavez

593
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,048
and was on Geraldo and also the kind of

594
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:11,509
stuff because all of the migrant workers

595
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:13,398
and that were picking all the grapes

596
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:15,048
were getting sprayed every day by

597
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:16,549
organophosphates and getting very sick

598
00:22:15,048 --> 00:22:19,660
and having real

599
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:23,180
like bad issues because of that well

600
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:26,600
when I look at that now and spending a

601
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:28,310
little time in the chemical pest control

602
00:22:26,599 --> 00:22:30,619
world and learning a little bit about it

603
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:33,769
I look at that there was like a lot of

604
00:22:30,619 --> 00:22:37,299
really bad practices with the chemicals

605
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:40,910
all right and organophosphates are

606
00:22:37,299 --> 00:22:43,069
primarily banned there's like one DeVoe

607
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:45,650
clavos which is the most hot pest strips

608
00:22:43,069 --> 00:22:47,659
I don't know if you've seen those before

609
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:48,890
but those you can still get but most all

610
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,750
organophosphates have been banned

611
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:53,540
because they have the way that they

612
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:54,740
absorb into water all right so there's

613
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:56,779
certain kinds of pests sighs certain

614
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:58,400
kind of reactions and you don't want the

615
00:22:56,779 --> 00:22:59,960
ones that kind of absorb into water

616
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:02,030
because that'll kill the amphibians and

617
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:03,470
if you live on stalks if you live in a

618
00:23:02,029 --> 00:23:05,779
healthy land you're gonna hear the frogs

619
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:07,069
right if you don't hear the frogs then

620
00:23:05,779 --> 00:23:08,389
you should go get your water tucked

621
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:09,740
because there could be some kind of

622
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,850
chemical in it because frogs and

623
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:12,589
amphibians they breathe through their

624
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,659
skin so they're gonna be the first thing

625
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:16,819
that dies if there's a pesticide problem

626
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:18,680
well when I look at this I look at is

627
00:23:16,819 --> 00:23:22,069
like a methodology and a practice issue

628
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:22,940
not necessarily how do I say this all

629
00:23:22,069 --> 00:23:25,220
right this is a tough conversation

630
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:28,549
navigate because there's a lot of

631
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:30,110
overzealous anti pesticide anti chemical

632
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:33,980
and what I want to say is we should have

633
00:23:30,109 --> 00:23:36,259
an open mind to some of the progress

634
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,170
that science has made when it comes to

635
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:41,089
agriculture and also analyze the

636
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:43,370
methodology and the practices that are

637
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:45,379
being used and separate that from the

638
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:48,469
science all right because there's some

639
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:50,120
you know we one of the reasons why we're

640
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,039
using pesticides is because we're mono

641
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,049
cropping alright mono cropping isn't

642
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:56,839
really natural as it is but that's what

643
00:23:54,049 --> 00:23:58,279
we've stirred out as of now on how to

644
00:23:56,839 --> 00:24:00,079
feed all these people that have

645
00:23:58,279 --> 00:24:02,930
populated this earth and the population

646
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:05,899
of the earth is expanding and then when

647
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,150
you go mono cropping outdoors and you've

648
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,140
got still the UV of the Sun it's helping

649
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,100
you out here and there and you've got

650
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,420
some other things that are helping you

651
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,809
out and then you bring that in your mono

652
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:17,570
cropping indoors it gets extremely

653
00:24:13,809 --> 00:24:21,500
challenging to control pests and bad

654
00:24:17,569 --> 00:24:23,750
fungals and there is and I'm not

655
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,160
advocating people go out and spray their

656
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:27,710
plants with pesticides it's not all what

657
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:30,050
I'm saying I'm more speaking towards the

658
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:33,350
community of people that are

659
00:24:30,049 --> 00:24:36,919
anteye chemical everything alright and I

660
00:24:33,349 --> 00:24:39,169
would just implore them to really do the

661
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,660
due diligence and do the research on

662
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:43,460
what's out there where the progress is

663
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:45,310
now and where it needs to go because

664
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:47,779
there's different kinds of biological

665
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:51,679
insecticides and biological fungicides

666
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:54,109
that are naturally produced like what is

667
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,850
it that chitin the chitin producing back

668
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:57,679
or the kinase bacteria that then

669
00:24:55,849 --> 00:24:59,689
produces an enzyme that can be used to

670
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:01,130
actually destroy fungal pathogens I mean

671
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:03,470
this is a that would be considered a

672
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:06,740
biological pesticide and a lot of people

673
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:09,589
get locked into a language battle when

674
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:12,980
they don't understand that anything

675
00:25:09,589 --> 00:25:15,259
that's used to kill a bug is going to be

676
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:18,860
called a pesticide I mean I have a buddy

677
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:20,240
that was spraying compost tea on trees

678
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:21,859
to bring them back to health and to get

679
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,559
rid of another beetle because he found

680
00:25:21,859 --> 00:25:26,000
that this worked and he got shut down

681
00:25:23,559 --> 00:25:27,649
because what they said he was doing was

682
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,650
applying a pesticide without an Ag

683
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,330
license well that got labeled by the

684
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:35,450
courts as a pesticide and that's a

685
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:40,399
compost tea so what people don't

686
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:42,289
understand is that we've got to take the

687
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,420
emotional emotionality out of the

688
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:47,299
conversation and look at all the tools

689
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:49,550
that we have do the scientific research

690
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:52,250
on how those tools can be applied to

691
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:54,319
cannabis in a safe way without jumping

692
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:56,329
into conclusions and without going crazy

693
00:25:54,319 --> 00:25:59,839
about it because we might need some kind

694
00:25:56,329 --> 00:26:02,299
of you know biological control or

695
00:25:59,839 --> 00:26:04,849
chemical control to sustainably produce

696
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:07,279
some of these plants and doors now we

697
00:26:04,849 --> 00:26:08,779
get into a whole other topic where we

698
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,089
don't need pesticides if we're

699
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:12,829
genetically modifying the plant now

700
00:26:11,089 --> 00:26:14,539
people freak out about genetically

701
00:26:12,829 --> 00:26:18,319
modified food again that's another

702
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:20,180
buzzword that I think has been misused

703
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:21,799
and I'm not talking about you know

704
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,110
glyphosate or whatever it's called and

705
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:27,980
mixing all that in but I would be

706
00:26:24,109 --> 00:26:30,199
completely for splicing powdery mildew a

707
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:31,759
gene from a powdery resist powdery

708
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,039
mildew resistant cannabis plant and

709
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:36,289
splicing it into a plant that doesn't

710
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,549
have that resistance you know and I and

711
00:26:36,289 --> 00:26:39,349
there are people that I've brought that

712
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,419
up too and they want to crucify me on a

713
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:43,099
cross for saying that and I don't

714
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:43,650
understand why because now we're not

715
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,299
having too

716
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:49,320
why those chemicals that are

717
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:52,200
questionably safe but there's just this

718
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,490
whole thought process that to me feels a

719
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,920
little archaic from where we're at right

720
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:59,460
now with the tools that we have in our

721
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:02,910
tool chest to create better crops and I

722
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:05,850
think that if certain it what happens

723
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:09,450
then is that the public perception gets

724
00:27:05,849 --> 00:27:12,240
changed and then there then those

725
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:15,539
processes get shut down and we could be

726
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,240
missing a solution by pushing back on

727
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:21,000
that without having a pragmatic and

728
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:22,349
logical conversation about it analogical

729
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,640
study about it and and I don't think

730
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,139
those studies should be funded by the

731
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:26,280
people that are against those groups

732
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,390
because that's usually what happens

733
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,970
you've got people that are anti

734
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:31,620
pesticide they already have a bias and

735
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:34,500
they're gonna do a study and it's gonna

736
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:35,909
lean towards their their theory or their

737
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,289
a hypothesis and then you've got the

738
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:38,370
chemical companies that are doing the

739
00:27:37,289 --> 00:27:40,319
study and they have a more rigorous

740
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:42,809
process of testing all of it but it's

741
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:44,490
still coming from them so people aren't

742
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:46,710
going to trust them because they don't

743
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:48,480
trust them already and people are gonna

744
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:51,569
trust the people that have a bias well

745
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,640
to me that whole process is completely

746
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,289
broken and we need to look at it

747
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,110
completely differently because I know

748
00:27:55,289 --> 00:28:00,240
there's some really epic scientists out

749
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:02,189
there they're doing a lot of work so

750
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,539
people can get the mint minerals and

751
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:06,420
nutrition that they need from their food

752
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:10,349
and they're getting stymied by this

753
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:12,930
perception and I don't you know I would

754
00:28:10,349 --> 00:28:15,000
say that if we can be charged it a

755
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:16,500
little bit not to the point where we're

756
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,269
not questioning it not to the point

757
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,359
we're not engaging with it not the point

758
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:23,819
where we're really looking into it but

759
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:26,759
understand that there's a reason why we

760
00:28:23,819 --> 00:28:28,980
have pesticides now and we before we had

761
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:32,160
pesticides we had famines where people

762
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,920
were starving alright and now people are

763
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:36,210
like all pesticides are bad you know and

764
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:38,009
what they don't understand is when if

765
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:39,600
you eliminate the pesticide well first

766
00:28:38,009 --> 00:28:41,250
of all and I know you've probably talked

767
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,139
about this a little bit they're still

768
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:44,730
spraying stuff or we call it organic

769
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:46,410
plant doesn't mean that it doesn't have

770
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:48,089
pesticides on it just means they can't

771
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:50,519
use specific pesticides and they can't

772
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:54,929
use specific inputs but they're having

773
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:56,069
to spray it more because from what from

774
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:57,360
what I've seen and what I've learned

775
00:28:56,069 --> 00:28:59,189
they're having to do

776
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:00,689
more work and apply more chemicals to

777
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:02,130
that plant to keep the bugs from

778
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,620
proliferating especially when they're

779
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:06,000
mono cropping so there's two ways we can

780
00:29:04,619 --> 00:29:09,479
go if we're going to continue to do this

781
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,548
large-scale food cultivation that we're

782
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:13,380
doing right now on this planet we're

783
00:29:11,548 --> 00:29:15,230
gonna have to figure out a better way of

784
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,799
applying these chemicals or use

785
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:18,029
biologicals that are in some of these

786
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,259
bacteria some of these things that we're

787
00:29:18,029 --> 00:29:21,000
giving in our compost tea that we don't

788
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,379
even understand yet right we're getting

789
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,599
accomplished tea and it's like solving

790
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,580
problems but the science isn't totally

791
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:28,859
there yet you know that look we don't

792
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:30,599
again we talked about the soil biology

793
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:32,819
and it's like this world that we're just

794
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,709
beginning to tap into well we need to do

795
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:36,839
more research on that that needs to be

796
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:38,579
coming from the system quote-unquote the

797
00:29:36,839 --> 00:29:40,949
matrix we need to be working with them

798
00:29:38,579 --> 00:29:42,689
so that can move out of the hippie

799
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:44,069
folklore move out of the esoteric and

800
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:46,259
move into the tangible move into the

801
00:29:44,069 --> 00:29:48,149
practical and be used on a large scale

802
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:49,619
level and we need be looking at the

803
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:51,210
pesticide practice that are going on

804
00:29:49,619 --> 00:29:54,239
right now and identify which ones are

805
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:55,769
really causing the problems and we need

806
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,569
to do that well we need to do that

807
00:29:55,769 --> 00:29:59,609
without emotionality I mean that's my

808
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:01,349
whole thought on it because I think if

809
00:29:59,609 --> 00:30:04,439
we can do that then we can find better

810
00:30:01,349 --> 00:30:06,719
products better solutions if we're doing

811
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:10,380
this large-scale mono cropping model the

812
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,808
other solution is for local communities

813
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,970
start growing their own food and doing

814
00:30:12,808 --> 00:30:17,190
that in a biodiverse atmosphere I mean

815
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:19,048
there's guys like Ron Finley in LA that

816
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,820
are gardening in the thoroughfare you

817
00:30:19,048 --> 00:30:23,639
know in doing all kinds of work to feed

818
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:25,980
their their their local communities and

819
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:29,730
I really think that's the best solution

820
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:31,470
all right but people are lazy people are

821
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,410
accustomed to just getting what they

822
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:38,490
want when they want it and I don't know

823
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:40,019
how we turn that corner yet to get

824
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,789
people to be actually growing their own

825
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:44,160
food and cultivating it maybe on a local

826
00:30:41,789 --> 00:30:45,690
level I mean I think that's because then

827
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,429
you can have a biodiverse amount of

828
00:30:45,690 --> 00:30:48,929
crops there and they're all working

829
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,640
together and all this knowledge that

830
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:52,320
we're learning about the fungal Network

831
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,910
in soil the bacterial network all this

832
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:56,159
communication can be going well I've got

833
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,110
high quality food we'll be producing it

834
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,900
there and probably needing very little

835
00:30:58,109 --> 00:31:03,209
pesticides I mean I have you know these

836
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:05,370
massive outdoor cannabis plants in my

837
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:08,970
backyard and I have not needed to apply

838
00:31:05,369 --> 00:31:11,129
neem I have not needed to apply any any

839
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,110
kind of fungal control or

840
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:15,450
anything on it there in a biodiverse

841
00:31:13,109 --> 00:31:17,129
space sometimes it'll be a bug here and

842
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,140
there I land on it and then I come the

843
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:21,720
next morning and there's a spiderweb in

844
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,910
between the branches eating all the bugs

845
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,980
that were chowing on it I mean we just

846
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:28,460
you just don't get that in a mono

847
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,049
cropping system so for mono cropping

848
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:32,819
that has to be coupled with some kind of

849
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:34,740
chemical control for it to be successful

850
00:31:32,819 --> 00:31:36,899
I don't know any other way if we can

851
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:38,430
move out a mono cropping then we can

852
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:39,960
move away from some of these chemical

853
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,360
controls and we can use more of these

854
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,710
things that we're seeing that David

855
00:31:42,359 --> 00:31:46,859
talks a lot about with the biological

856
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:49,529
controls and things like that with you

857
00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:52,679
know predatorial insects which i think

858
00:31:49,529 --> 00:31:56,759
is really fascinating so I just I'm

859
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:59,190
imploring the community to I love the

860
00:31:56,759 --> 00:32:01,769
heart I love the passion but you you

861
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:03,690
have to couple that that heart and that

862
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:05,759
passion with knowledge and you can't

863
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:08,160
just read something on Google and assume

864
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:09,930
that it's true you've got to look at it

865
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:13,350
you've got to prequalify it because if

866
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:15,299
we don't do that we get lost we get lost

867
00:32:13,349 --> 00:32:19,859
and we have to understand what's data

868
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:21,899
and what's a what's an agenda all right

869
00:32:19,859 --> 00:32:24,809
we have to be able to to parse those two

870
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,759
things and and not all all am I saying

871
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:28,740
go ahead spray pesticides not amal am i

872
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,960
saying don't go spray pesticides what

873
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:32,849
I'm saying is that we need to have an

874
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,220
intelligent conversation about it and

875
00:32:32,849 --> 00:32:40,139
it's extremely upsetting to see how the

876
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,150
pesticide and the pest thing in this

877
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:44,520
industry right now like all these guys

878
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:45,840
in social media if they've got if

879
00:32:44,519 --> 00:32:46,889
they're dealing with some powdery mildew

880
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:49,529
if they're dealing with some spider

881
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:52,590
mites right everyone's afraid to be

882
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:54,899
honest about it because people will go

883
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:56,879
after them like vultures they're afraid

884
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:59,550
to talk about what they're doing so the

885
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:01,770
practices get hidden right so people

886
00:32:59,549 --> 00:33:03,779
start doing bad practices again they

887
00:33:01,769 --> 00:33:06,750
start spraying ornamental pesticides and

888
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:08,490
fungal controls to keep their problems a

889
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:10,529
secret well guess what if I have a

890
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:12,329
problem I post it and I show everybody

891
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:14,220
and I said look I screwed the pooch

892
00:33:12,329 --> 00:33:15,779
you know I did I did something went

893
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,100
wrong here or this plant isn't a great

894
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:20,009
plant and I'll talk about it with people

895
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:21,929
and I haven't gotten any hate from doing

896
00:33:20,009 --> 00:33:23,819
that all right I haven't gotten anybody

897
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,870
to come back at me like I'm saying look

898
00:33:23,819 --> 00:33:26,308
let's be honest about

899
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,049
issues were having so we can work on

900
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:30,539
solving them together in an intelligent

901
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:32,279
way but not let's not pretend that were

902
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:34,170
that we're not spraying pesticides

903
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,430
anymore all right and I'm not saying I'm

904
00:33:34,170 --> 00:33:36,870
spraying pesticides and I'm not spitting

905
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,430
they're spraying pesticides but I know a

906
00:33:36,869 --> 00:33:39,839
lot of people are pretending that

907
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:42,660
they're not spraying these things and

908
00:33:39,839 --> 00:33:45,299
they are I know it I've seen it all

909
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,980
right I can I know what's going on

910
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,289
there's there's a perception and there's

911
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:50,700
a reality and if we can be honest about

912
00:33:49,289 --> 00:33:53,279
the struggles we're having I think we

913
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,190
can find a better solution faster

914
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,940
without poisoning people all right and

915
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,519
that's something that I feel very

916
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,049
passionate about I love what you had to

917
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:02,910
say there I don't totally agree with

918
00:34:01,049 --> 00:34:05,490
everything you had to say okay which is

919
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:07,830
which is okay yeah that's great

920
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:10,019
that's what makes this such an amazing

921
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:12,269
world to live on the first thing I would

922
00:34:10,019 --> 00:34:15,300
say is one you are totally right people

923
00:34:12,269 --> 00:34:18,719
are spraying pesticides and there is

924
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:20,129
this fear that if they show any wear on

925
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,349
their social media or with other people

926
00:34:20,128 --> 00:34:25,199
that their plants don't look perfect and

927
00:34:22,349 --> 00:34:26,759
all their buds aren't amazing that the

928
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,339
perception of them as growers is that

929
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,620
they're not good growers and you're

930
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,269
right that's crap I mean I think people

931
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,589
should be putting that forward in my

932
00:34:33,269 --> 00:34:35,759
vegetable garden right now I have some

933
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:37,050
plants they're doing a lot better than

934
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,230
others and that's just always the way

935
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:42,169
it's going to be yeah and that's part of

936
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:44,369
that process and when it comes to

937
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:47,809
pesticides though this is where I have

938
00:34:44,369 --> 00:34:50,909
to have to disagree a little bit is I

939
00:34:47,809 --> 00:34:54,690
feel like I've been burned too many

940
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:56,730
times by the cannabis industry and by

941
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,349
the pesticide institute industry to

942
00:34:56,730 --> 00:35:00,570
where I don't feel like I can trust them

943
00:34:58,349 --> 00:35:03,420
anymore I mean right the other day like

944
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:05,490
I was down at Home Depot well I guess

945
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,829
this was a few years ago now looking at

946
00:35:05,489 --> 00:35:09,119
blueberry plants and they had signs on

947
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:12,150
them that said they's have been sprayed

948
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,859
with knio knio conoid so i don't know

949
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:15,780
how to pronounce your nicotine neo

950
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:19,019
nicotine or you go yeah neo nicotine

951
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:20,190
thank you and this is something that's

952
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:21,900
known to kill honeybees that are

953
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,970
supposed to pollinate the blueberries oh

954
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,450
yeah big problem I'm supposed to eat big

955
00:35:23,969 --> 00:35:30,480
bran we don't know the effects of all of

956
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:32,460
these pesticides long term we talked

957
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,139
about cancer a little bit you mentioned

958
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:36,929
DDT and Rachel Carson's book Silent

959
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:38,730
Spring it's a great example of that like

960
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:42,118
it's why we don't have condors

961
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:43,980
you know yeah it's crazy to me so when

962
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,510
you when you say you know let's do the

963
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,369
science I agree with you but the same

964
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,660
time like there's companies that are

965
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:50,039
gonna take advantage of that we already

966
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:51,690
have seen that with Guardian might spray

967
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:54,179
in the cannabis industry that was a huge

968
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:55,500
one on the organic side because if

969
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,819
you're in a Gant grower you're probably

970
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,260
giving a sample at some time and you

971
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,269
probably spray it on your crop not

972
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:03,000
knowing what was in there

973
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:05,730
we've seen it you know outside of the

974
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,739
cannabis industry with roundup or

975
00:36:05,730 --> 00:36:09,000
glyphosate and some of the research

976
00:36:07,739 --> 00:36:11,339
that's coming out on that right now and

977
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,929
I know I know that's a big issue that

978
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:15,090
hasn't totally been settled in terms of

979
00:36:12,929 --> 00:36:18,089
its effects on human development on kids

980
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:21,539
on pets on people's sensitivities to it

981
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:23,550
so I almost feel and I'm I'm in the

982
00:36:21,539 --> 00:36:25,889
other camp there where like a fool me

983
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:28,920
once I just can't trust you because all

984
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:30,690
these pesticides are coming from big big

985
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:35,579
egg or big companies like Scott's

986
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:38,220
Monsanto Bayer Dow dad yeah and you know

987
00:36:35,579 --> 00:36:40,949
honestly I don't trust them with the

988
00:36:38,219 --> 00:36:43,139
future of my seed production the future

989
00:36:40,949 --> 00:36:44,519
of what pesticides I can use I mean

990
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:47,250
Roundup Ready crops have been destroyed

991
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:49,920
India yeah a lot of farmers over there

992
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:52,289
they've been you know completely you

993
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,300
know burned into poverty because they've

994
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,608
had they're forced to buy seed every

995
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:00,050
year the the crop they have a crop

996
00:36:56,608 --> 00:37:02,909
failure they're done I just I just

997
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:04,350
struggle so much with that know why I

998
00:37:02,909 --> 00:37:05,549
agree with you well I don't think I was

999
00:37:04,349 --> 00:37:07,650
being clear enough though

1000
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:10,350
then it because I I'm a hundred percent

1001
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:12,090
in agreeing agreement with you and I and

1002
00:37:10,349 --> 00:37:15,509
I think that goes back to the practice

1003
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:17,369
right it goes back to how they're how

1004
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:21,030
they're releasing these chemicals right

1005
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:22,950
they're not doing and and whether those

1006
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,170
chemicals should ever be released you

1007
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:27,509
know and and part of that problem is

1008
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,460
that they're trying to like find a quick

1009
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:31,230
fix for a long term solution but what

1010
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,510
does that do to the to the insects the

1011
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:35,219
insects have a very short life cycle and

1012
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:37,530
they evolve and now we have super

1013
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:39,389
insects right and that's a direct result

1014
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,990
of the pesticide use that's a bad

1015
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:43,108
practice

1016
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:44,699
all right that's a bad practice and I

1017
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:47,219
interrupted you so I apologize for that

1018
00:37:44,699 --> 00:37:51,239
but I just want to I I I'm what I'm

1019
00:37:47,219 --> 00:37:52,589
saying is that we don't know on the

1020
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:54,599
science end

1021
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:57,360
how much of that is a tool that we can

1022
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:59,099
use yet because of how bad the practices

1023
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:03,030
have been with it but instead of

1024
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:05,269
targeting the scientific research as

1025
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:08,880
well all I'm saying and studying it

1026
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:10,019
where we're glomming it all together is

1027
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,000
what I'm trying to say

1028
00:38:10,019 --> 00:38:14,880
does that make though yeah don't

1029
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,150
demonize the word pesticide rather

1030
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,349
deepen eyes bad practices and using some

1031
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,010
of these pesticides is what you're

1032
00:38:19,349 --> 00:38:25,409
getting at exactly because for me if and

1033
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:28,260
I know it's happening right now even in

1034
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:31,219
the 5:02 industry if you're using eagle

1035
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,870
20 if you're using Avid if you're using

1036
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:35,489
you know these sorts of products to me

1037
00:38:33,869 --> 00:38:38,639
you're just you're not a good grower you

1038
00:38:35,489 --> 00:38:39,899
know you you there are other ways and I

1039
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:41,609
know that's probably gonna offend some

1040
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:44,039
people but I hope it challenges people

1041
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:47,519
to to say hey I need to provide safe

1042
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:50,159
medicine I need to provide safe food for

1043
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:53,489
people that are that are consuming you

1044
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:55,589
know vegetables and stuff such so I just

1045
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:58,319
I believe that there are good biological

1046
00:38:55,590 --> 00:39:00,530
solutions yep like what David talked

1047
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,000
about absolutely I think there are

1048
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:05,730
botanical oils and sprays that you can

1049
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,130
use safely in the right concentrations

1050
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:09,780
so I don't hate the word pesticide I

1051
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:12,059
think it's a reality of mono cropping

1052
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:14,160
like you said and frankly pesticides is

1053
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:15,840
what saved the human race in a lot of

1054
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,210
ways because we wouldn't be able to have

1055
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:21,240
farmed on the scale that we have and fed

1056
00:39:18,210 --> 00:39:23,070
this many people without them yes die

1057
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:28,769
and I think that's that's the point I'm

1058
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:31,170
trying to make is that it's not it's and

1059
00:39:28,769 --> 00:39:33,989
I think it also comes back to the come

1060
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,030
back to how little we actually know like

1061
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:37,799
how we don't understand the butterfly

1062
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:39,480
effect of all these actions yet and

1063
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,210
sometimes they're gonna manifest a

1064
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:44,099
hundred years from now I mean when I was

1065
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:46,289
studying different pesticides one of the

1066
00:39:44,099 --> 00:39:49,469
things with DDT that was so bad about it

1067
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:52,139
was that it had such a long half-life so

1068
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:54,449
if you sprayed you know a crawlspace of

1069
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,190
a home with DDT and you come back 30

1070
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:59,159
years later there's still no bugs down

1071
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,559
there I mean that's not probably a good

1072
00:39:59,159 --> 00:40:03,599
idea to be using something like that

1073
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:06,389
because it's gonna affect things on a

1074
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,929
very long-term level and

1075
00:40:06,389 --> 00:40:11,730
it's just the god it's such a sticky

1076
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:14,518
conversation that's the problem with it

1077
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:16,500
too because it's so charged and it's

1078
00:40:14,518 --> 00:40:19,709
it's more like we need to learn more we

1079
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:22,469
need to understand more what's going on

1080
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:24,900
we need to understand the insect biology

1081
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:28,558
more we need to understand the fungal

1082
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:30,809
biology more we need to study how nature

1083
00:40:28,559 --> 00:40:32,700
handles that and we need to learn on how

1084
00:40:30,809 --> 00:40:34,589
to apply that a more efficient rate and

1085
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:36,778
that might come down to chemically

1086
00:40:34,588 --> 00:40:39,900
extracting some biological right and

1087
00:40:36,778 --> 00:40:41,849
then applying it and that could be

1088
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:44,190
considered a pesticide and there it

1089
00:40:41,849 --> 00:40:46,380
could get to a point where things are so

1090
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,000
charged around the wording on all of it

1091
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,710
there's that there's really safe

1092
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,039
solutions that are coming from the right

1093
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:53,460
place

1094
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:56,880
that gets thrown out B or they get

1095
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,130
banned or not used just because of the

1096
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,809
realm that they're in without the full

1097
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:03,028
understanding of what it is and what

1098
00:41:00,809 --> 00:41:05,430
it's doing and if that makes any sense I

1099
00:41:03,028 --> 00:41:07,619
mean like what is and maybe you have the

1100
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:09,690
answer for me for that but like what is

1101
00:41:07,619 --> 00:41:11,490
what is the heat and I don't know this

1102
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:13,528
but I've used spinosad before for

1103
00:41:11,489 --> 00:41:15,449
controlling threats and I've looked into

1104
00:41:13,528 --> 00:41:17,400
the process of how spinosad were

1105
00:41:15,449 --> 00:41:18,750
discovered and how it's how it's been

1106
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:20,960
made is there any study showing that

1107
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:24,329
spinosad is harmful to human beings I

1108
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:26,880
haven't seen any I've moved away from it

1109
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:29,759
myself just because of the fact that

1110
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,309
it's made by I believe Bayer or Dow it's

1111
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:34,380
one of the two yeah and I just don't

1112
00:41:32,309 --> 00:41:36,539
trust those companies got it and I want

1113
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:37,858
to I want to vote with my money and you

1114
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:41,160
know I want to make economic decisions

1115
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:42,778
that support my values and for me those

1116
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,690
companies are not the companies that I

1117
00:41:42,778 --> 00:41:47,699
choose to support so but that's two

1118
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:49,440
different conversations right so it

1119
00:41:47,699 --> 00:41:51,328
totally is and that's that's that it's

1120
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,639
exactly what I'm saying like I don't

1121
00:41:51,329 --> 00:41:57,450
care about those companies that's not

1122
00:41:53,639 --> 00:41:58,920
like if those companies are I don't I I

1123
00:41:57,449 --> 00:42:01,798
can't make I don't know enough about

1124
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:03,568
those companies internally because

1125
00:42:01,798 --> 00:42:06,059
really like we have an our perception of

1126
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,798
what they've done but also I also know

1127
00:42:06,059 --> 00:42:11,819
that when companies get really really

1128
00:42:07,798 --> 00:42:14,159
big they tend to do bad things because

1129
00:42:11,818 --> 00:42:16,288
they can't see what the what the right

1130
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:18,058
hand is doing or the left hand is doing

1131
00:42:16,289 --> 00:42:19,349
and that's a problem that's a business

1132
00:42:18,059 --> 00:42:20,200
issue that we have in this country we

1133
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:24,250
have these mega

1134
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:26,739
corporations that we're then it the

1135
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,539
consumer or the customer is no longer

1136
00:42:26,739 --> 00:42:30,578
the priority it's the shareholders and

1137
00:42:28,539 --> 00:42:32,349
that's a that's a huge epidemic that we

1138
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:34,839
have in our system in general but what

1139
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:37,990
I'm saying is like that chemical now is

1140
00:42:34,838 --> 00:42:40,869
banned all right and where you can't use

1141
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:43,059
it in California and I don't where's the

1142
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:45,010
data showing that why we can't use that

1143
00:42:43,059 --> 00:42:47,769
that's what I'm saying like why did that

1144
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:49,210
get taken off the list is it because it

1145
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:51,579
came from that company or is it because

1146
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:53,260
it's actually damaging to us and it has

1147
00:42:51,579 --> 00:42:55,690
there been any long-term research on

1148
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,270
that well that's the problem I have so I

1149
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:59,829
I'm not saying that it's good or that I

1150
00:42:58,269 --> 00:43:01,358
don't know if it's good or bad and I

1151
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:03,579
don't know if anybody knows it's good or

1152
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:05,380
bad or if it has long-term effect on our

1153
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:06,700
environment and I would like to see that

1154
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:08,829
data and I would like the people that

1155
00:43:06,699 --> 00:43:10,929
are writing the regulations to have that

1156
00:43:08,829 --> 00:43:13,180
data to make assumptions because we

1157
00:43:10,929 --> 00:43:15,940
really need is as many tools in the tool

1158
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:17,469
chest as we can when when you're growing

1159
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:19,929
at an indoor controlled environmental

1160
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:23,500
space because problems compound and go

1161
00:43:19,929 --> 00:43:25,210
crazy now that that's my little segment

1162
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:27,730
on the whole thing it's just where's the

1163
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:30,190
data where's the data you know where is

1164
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,179
the information on it and where who in

1165
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,889
the people that are making these

1166
00:43:31,179 --> 00:43:34,929
decisions what are those decisions based

1167
00:43:32,889 --> 00:43:37,539
on if they're based on public perception

1168
00:43:34,929 --> 00:43:39,730
that's a problem to me all right that

1169
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:41,108
public perception might be accurate but

1170
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:44,440
most of the time I mean Nietzsche has a

1171
00:43:41,108 --> 00:43:47,588
famous quote like madness is uncommon in

1172
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:49,599
individuals but proliferate in crowds

1173
00:43:47,588 --> 00:43:50,828
and masses you know so I want to make

1174
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:53,050
sure that we're not steering towards

1175
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:54,369
madness with all of this all right

1176
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:56,829
I want to make sure that we're steering

1177
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:58,329
towards knowledge and so if there's

1178
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:00,789
something that's taken off I mean they

1179
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,109
could say you know there could be

1180
00:44:00,789 --> 00:44:03,639
something that people are using on an

1181
00:44:02,108 --> 00:44:05,199
organic level it could be banned for

1182
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:06,848
some reason and then maybe that would

1183
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:08,769
take that would change the perception

1184
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:10,869
and people will be like wait a minute

1185
00:44:08,769 --> 00:44:12,309
who's making decisions where's the data

1186
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,619
behind it that's all I want to know and

1187
00:44:12,309 --> 00:44:16,630
that's really the point of me wanting to

1188
00:44:14,619 --> 00:44:19,180
talk about this is we need to know why

1189
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:21,550
we shouldn't use it you know we need to

1190
00:44:19,179 --> 00:44:23,230
understand that fair enough I mean you

1191
00:44:21,550 --> 00:44:24,970
make a good argument I don't think we're

1192
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:26,949
that far off in terms of our perception

1193
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:29,500
we're just slightly on other sides of

1194
00:44:26,949 --> 00:44:31,349
the center there yeah I just don't have

1195
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,510
enough trust in

1196
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:35,579
the research I would be given and I

1197
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:38,820
don't feel that we know these long-term

1198
00:44:35,579 --> 00:44:41,130
effects well enough to really know

1199
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:43,500
what's gonna happen two years from now

1200
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:45,539
five years from now you know are these

1201
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,539
things bio accumulating in our bodies we

1202
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:50,699
don't know so that's my whole thing is I

1203
00:44:48,539 --> 00:44:52,230
I'm all for research I'm all for data I

1204
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:53,460
just have to know that I can trust that

1205
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:55,440
data over time it needs to be

1206
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:59,610
independent he's becoming not from these

1207
00:44:55,440 --> 00:45:01,710
big companies and we just need to make

1208
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:03,030
intelligent decisions and I do I do see

1209
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:05,460
what you're saying about regulation it

1210
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,370
is it is a problem it is perception is a

1211
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:11,639
problem I would just suggest that people

1212
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:13,799
look into biological controls as a

1213
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:17,099
starting point for pesticides and things

1214
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:18,840
that are have been used for generations

1215
00:45:17,099 --> 00:45:22,889
like neem oil for example that we know

1216
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:24,990
to be generally safe compared to some of

1217
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:27,480
these new you know newer pesticides on

1218
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:29,639
the market I totally agree and and we're

1219
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,610
we don't have a choice anymore I mean

1220
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:35,460
that's the reality so it's this is where

1221
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:38,220
the law is going with it so that

1222
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,220
industry is going to blossom at this

1223
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:44,099
point and we have to sub and that is

1224
00:45:41,219 --> 00:45:46,529
where you know the the biological

1225
00:45:44,099 --> 00:45:47,880
controls is where we have to go to now

1226
00:45:46,530 --> 00:45:49,170
and we have to explore that and we have

1227
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,599
to work with guys like David who are

1228
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:53,820
doing that research and and make it as

1229
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,809
good as we can you know and be able to

1230
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:57,900
do that in a controlled environment

1231
00:45:54,809 --> 00:46:01,409
space but I just you know I'd like to

1232
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:02,099
see a lot more data that's all alright

1233
00:46:01,409 --> 00:46:03,989
fair enough

1234
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:06,299
