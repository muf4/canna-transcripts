people and I'll let a lot of really cool

71
00:02:29,939 --> 00:02:35,340
people of the years and uh just had this

72
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:37,019
crazy idea of growing a regenerative

73
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:40,140
cannabis business and kind of using that

74
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:42,060
to I guess make farming cool again was

75
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:44,818
kind of the idea

76
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,098
um ran into some old sponsors kind of

77
00:02:44,818 --> 00:02:49,139
got a self-funded a little small town

78
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:51,299
group of guys kind of funded us really

79
00:02:49,139 --> 00:02:52,799
small not a big corporate company even

80
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,239
though we kind of tend to play the role

81
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,500
online everybody things were bigger than

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,420
we are

83
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,280
um there's been real Grassroots

84
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:01,559
um just fighting a good fight from

85
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,199
from Nevada

86
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,539
yeah how big is your facility

87
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:10,199
um you know what what size is your uh

88
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:12,000
your veg space and your flower rooms

89
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:13,018
um the whole facility is about 12 000

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,658
square foot

91
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,759
um our our property is a is an old Ace

92
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:19,378
Hardware so we have about 30 000 square

93
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:21,299
foot on building in front that we're not

94
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:23,219
used utilizing um that's licensed that

95
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,319
we're just renting out to Goodwill on

96
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:26,519
the back half was the original um lumber

97
00:03:25,318 --> 00:03:28,799
yard of the Ace Hardware and that's

98
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:30,719
where we started so we completely gutted

99
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,519
this old lumber yard it was old rusty

100
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,900
old lumber yard and turned it into well

101
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,879
eight years ago what was the state of

102
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:38,640
the art cultivation facility now to me

103
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:39,899
it's like a Titanic it's like a dinosaur

104
00:03:38,639 --> 00:03:41,818
um considering you know it's been eight

105
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,039
years imagine what we've all as an

106
00:03:41,818 --> 00:03:46,979
industry learned in eight years

107
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:48,900
um but uh so at 12 000 square foot is

108
00:03:46,979 --> 00:03:49,500
what we're currently operating in

109
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,019
um

110
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,680
we have three flower rooms they're about

111
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:57,299
24 2500 square foot each uh our veg

112
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,920
space we have a kind of a unique

113
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,900
backspace I wouldn't repeat this model

114
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,878
again but we had like a a walking

115
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,900
through bed space to kind of save some

116
00:04:02,878 --> 00:04:05,340
space

117
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,959
um I can't I don't even know the square

118
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,519
footage

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:12,060
um very small probably about a thousand

120
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:14,219
square foot or 500 square foot

121
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:16,500
now you've you build up quite a

122
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:19,079
Following over the years

123
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,939
um because your facility is so unique

124
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:23,879
and you really take these regenerative

125
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:24,839
practice ideas really to like the next

126
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:26,519
level

127
00:04:24,839 --> 00:04:29,519
um and while you and I have some

128
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:30,839
philosophical differences on a few a few

129
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,159
topics which we'll definitely get into

130
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,959
because I think a lot of people want to

131
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,120
hear that conversation

132
00:04:33,959 --> 00:04:37,620
um let's just talk a little bit about it

133
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,478
first just share sort of your overall

134
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,639
philosophy and some of the things that

135
00:04:39,478 --> 00:04:44,579
you have brought into this facility that

136
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:46,860
are really unique to Green Life

137
00:04:44,579 --> 00:04:49,139
yes I mean it's what we're doing now is

138
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:50,400
is kind of trendy you know to be honest

139
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,319
we see a lot of it online a lot of

140
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:54,359
people are switching over trying you

141
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,759
know LEDs with living soil and raised

142
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,800
beds uh but man nine years ago when we

143
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:01,620
were building a facility you did not see

144
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,199
LED lights you know in a large scale

145
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,879
commercial facility hanging over

146
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,879
um raised beds full of living soil

147
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:12,540
indoors those are pretty much unheard of

148
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,120
eight nine years ago uh so I mean

149
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,819
at first I was more of a of a laughing

150
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,840
joke and uh the the end of a lot of

151
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:20,839
memes uh

152
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:25,620
um the internet is is very

153
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,300
um unrelenting sometimes uh but over the

154
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,519
years yes we just proven it through and

155
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:30,780
through um the whole idea is just nature

156
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,978
knows best

157
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:34,198
um you know I first started eight years

158
00:05:31,978 --> 00:05:35,939
ago I didn't have a huge college

159
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:37,800
background I didn't go to school for

160
00:05:35,939 --> 00:05:40,199
this I was just a medical patient

161
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,060
looking for a more sustainable way to

162
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:44,160
manage my pain I'm coming from anime

163
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:45,418
background so as I kind of went through

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,860
my own little journey I just kind of

165
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:48,120
started like looking at things

166
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,919
differently

167
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,019
um as far as synthetic versus Organics

168
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,698
and uh it kind of turned me on to a lot

169
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,680
of things as far as uh you know as a

170
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:56,939
professional fighter we we manage

171
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,439
everything that went into our body that

172
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,579
we literally had to report it before we

173
00:05:58,439 --> 00:06:00,478
fought like hey this is why I've been

174
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:03,240
taken

175
00:06:00,478 --> 00:06:05,279
um so I was very um big on inputs um

176
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,600
just as a professional athlete um then

177
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,939
we got to soil I started growing

178
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,139
cannabis and I remember it was purely

179
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:12,120
medicine

180
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,680
um and then one day I happened to tell

181
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,600
my coach and he was like hey well that

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,340
that medicine you're growing

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,080
um do you use chemicals and I was like

184
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:20,638
yeah of course I got nutrients that's

185
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,659
what plants you know use to grow it's

186
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,939
what they need

187
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:26,160
uh and he told me well they used they

188
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:27,959
used chemicals to make drugs and that

189
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,539
was his mindset on his whole little

190
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:33,359
crazy theory on it I was like as crazy

191
00:06:30,538 --> 00:06:34,500
as it was it made a little bit of sense

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,419
um so I started looking into more

193
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,860
organic methods I started off with

194
00:06:36,418 --> 00:06:39,779
bottle nutrients

195
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,740
um I immediately noted I noticed a

196
00:06:39,779 --> 00:06:41,579
little bit of flavor difference from

197
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,259
that

198
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,060
um then I got to more of a recycled

199
00:06:43,259 --> 00:06:46,680
organic living soil at the rolls I think

200
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,280
we used to call it

201
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,199
um

202
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,839
and that's why I met Matt Davenport and

203
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:54,240
uh on Instagram and uh got big into

204
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:55,138
permaculture and living soils uh and

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,360
then when I got introduced to

206
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,038
permaculture living soils I kind of seen

207
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,199
that as like what cannabis was for me it

208
00:06:59,038 --> 00:07:03,418
was it was the this medicine for me I

209
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,740
seen uh permaculture was like this this

210
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:06,779
medicine for the planet that's what the

211
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:08,038
planet needed to get healthy uh so I

212
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:09,739
thought man if I could connect these two

213
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:11,759
things if I could you know tie

214
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,400
permaculture sustainable agriculture

215
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,199
living soils to this cool cannabis scene

216
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:17,519
that's popping off

217
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,598
um maybe we can get that word out there

218
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:23,219
and uh use it cannabis as a gateway drug

219
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:25,079
to sustainable farming to sustainable

220
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,400
practices so that was kind of the goal

221
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:28,439
that was kind of my mindset going into

222
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:30,120
it and just over the years it's been

223
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,279
blessed the universe kind of connected

224
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,660
me to the right people at the right time

225
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:38,399
uh and uh overall just it just try to be

226
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:41,160
as organic as possible I try to rip off

227
00:07:38,399 --> 00:07:42,779
Mother Nature as much as possible but at

228
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,520
the same time I gotta be realistic and

229
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,959
be able to manage and run a business and

230
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:47,519
and in order to keep my business

231
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:48,839
sustainable and to keep it pretended it

232
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:50,159
has to be sustainable important to be

233
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,198
sustainable I have to pay the bills to

234
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
keep the lights on uh so I have to wear

235
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:56,038
a lot of different hats

236
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,660
um at the end of the day uh as long as

237
00:07:56,038 --> 00:08:01,439
the intentions are good the tensions are

238
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:03,960
pure it all kind of works itself out

239
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:05,459
yeah and I know social media is one of

240
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,120
those things where

241
00:08:05,459 --> 00:08:08,519
um

242
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,959
we all put our best foot forward in a

243
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:13,379
lot of cases

244
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:15,198
um have you ever had a really bad crop

245
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:17,219
or something that you did that led to

246
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,538
poor yields

247
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,580
um that maybe you haven't talked about

248
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:22,318
or shared I mean as a grower I've killed

249
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:24,300
thousands of plants I'll just throw that

250
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,639
out there and I think we learn a lot

251
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:28,680
from our failures

252
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,660
um you know I follow Greenlife fairly

253
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,918
closely but I may have missed it or or

254
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:34,080
maybe it's not something you've talked

255
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:35,338
about but yeah I'm just curious

256
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,658
yeah

257
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:39,300
um not something I'll talk about a lot

258
00:08:36,658 --> 00:08:40,200
is uh I failed the whole room once um

259
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,598
you know

260
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,899
150 pounds worth of weed down the drain

261
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,000
uh it was my second cycle room three so

262
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:49,860
it was my sixth room flipping

263
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,559
um we took some Cuts in

264
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,259
um from from a patient and uh apparently

265
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:58,259
they had PM we had a super healthy

266
00:08:55,259 --> 00:09:01,259
facility healthy soil healthy plants

267
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:03,120
um and I just watched his PM just wipe

268
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:05,700
out just go through my whole facility I

269
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,980
had never had Kim at that time so I

270
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,600
didn't really know much about it coming

271
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,839
from a home Garden coming from a you

272
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,940
know a six light home Garden into a 300

273
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:16,980
Light commercial facility

274
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:20,459
um it was kind of a game changer um I

275
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,740
made I made a mistake uh last minute uh

276
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:24,239
we decided to uh to try a space and

277
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:27,539
beneficial

278
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,339
um like a bacillus type products on uh

279
00:09:27,539 --> 00:09:30,539
on the plants hoping to counteract the

280
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:32,820
PM I figured it was better to smoke

281
00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:33,838
beneficial microbes and it would be

282
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:36,480
um PM

283
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,940
um was my kind of mindset early on

284
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,159
um but we sprayed some some uh some this

285
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,260
that other things I failed horribly my

286
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,360
first tests 150 pounds of some of the

287
00:09:43,259 --> 00:09:46,860
best looking we've ever grown I'm not

288
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
just gonna say that but decent looking

289
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,459
better than most Street weed

290
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:53,819
um had to throw it all away the state

291
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:56,099
came out filmed the whole thing uh and

292
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,899
then for I would say the whole third and

293
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,879
fourth cycle I was just chasing my tail

294
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:02,278
trying to control PM

295
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:04,500
um learned a lot about soil Health

296
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:07,200
um and and just overall how that

297
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,500
particular pathogen Works

298
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:13,080
um didn't use any crazy uh

299
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,179
no crazy fungicides or anything like

300
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,220
that everything we did was was natural

301
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:19,679
um I did things like H2O2 to control it

302
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:21,180
as far as Spring Leaf surfaces

303
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:23,338
um but for the most part I learned how

304
00:10:21,179 --> 00:10:25,439
to how to write some new Sops how to

305
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:27,959
better my IPM um half step my game up

306
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,019
going forward and I haven't seen a spot

307
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:33,479
of PM in over seven years

308
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:35,220
um in that pretty soon

309
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:37,740
yeah so did you have to make any

310
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:40,080
environmental changes to deal with the

311
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,278
powder mildew yeah we we set their game

312
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,839
up as far as because at first we didn't

313
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:44,278
know what the problem was so we were I

314
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:45,600
mean shooting in every direction you

315
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,759
know we were uh

316
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,220
up to our dehumidification

317
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:52,200
um we changed our our IPM regimen make

318
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:54,720
sure you know everyone's dressed now um

319
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,879
this that the other thing uh but

320
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,740
ultimately just what it would ultimately

321
00:10:56,879 --> 00:11:01,559
got me through it was I found strains

322
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,778
that weren't affected by it um I had to

323
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,219
call all the strains at work I put my

324
00:11:03,778 --> 00:11:06,480
strings like pure Sunshine a lot of

325
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,980
people out there love pure Sunshine

326
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,720
performance throwing it back in the day

327
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,920
because I grew a lot of it and the

328
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,959
reason I grew a lot of it is because

329
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:15,419
pure Sunshine didn't get powdery mildew

330
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,759
so I put pure San Antonio's rotation and

331
00:11:15,419 --> 00:11:19,139
and and she was able to hold her own and

332
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:21,179
then that got my that gave me the chance

333
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:23,819
to put all my genetics in veg where I

334
00:11:21,179 --> 00:11:25,019
can you know spraying with H2O2 and kind

335
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,120
of keep them clean

336
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:28,980
um long enough to get past that virus or

337
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,759
that pathogen

338
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,039
um

339
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:34,439
and then once once I did that I was able

340
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:36,120
to go through and clean out my facility

341
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,320
um because your facility gets pm2 I

342
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,600
don't think a lot of people realize that

343
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,640
if you can you can tissue culture all

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,860
you want and put the cleanest clones

345
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,319
into the sterile rooms or at least

346
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:48,060
sterile mediums but if you don't have a

347
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,519
you know a clean facility you just

348
00:11:48,059 --> 00:11:52,259
pushing a rock uphill uh so yeah if you

349
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:53,459
don't have green facility not welcome

350
00:11:52,259 --> 00:11:54,059
those things

351
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,919
um

352
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:57,539
and I feel like our plans being that we

353
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:58,919
did a more natural process to get rid of

354
00:11:57,539 --> 00:12:00,419
PM I think that's one of the reasons I

355
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:01,679
ain't seen PM in seven years because I

356
00:12:00,419 --> 00:12:03,240
feel like there's a little bit of

357
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:04,739
biological intelligence how those plans

358
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:06,120
gained from that battle

359
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,440
um that I didn't erase with the eagle

360
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,259
20.

361
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,120
um at least I like to think so but it

362
00:12:10,259 --> 00:12:14,578
was definitely a dark time someone more

363
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:16,320
stressed out times my life uh super glad

364
00:12:14,578 --> 00:12:18,120
to have gotten through it

365
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,278
yeah that's that's a really cool story

366
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,778
and I I appreciate you sharing it

367
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:24,480
um they've actually found the genetic

368
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:26,519
what some genetic markers uh in the

369
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,259
plant DNA 4 pm which you may have heard

370
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,480
of that which is pretty cool yeah

371
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:33,059
because eight seven years ago I sent

372
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,519
samples up here Sunshine two medicinal

373
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:37,859
geonomics to find out what that marker

374
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:39,000
was and never got a call back or email

375
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:41,100
back

376
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
um so I feel like they found out a lot

377
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,139
sooner

378
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,139
um just to be clear on that

379
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,879
yeah yeah and you have a different

380
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,559
environment I'm guessing in Nevada uh

381
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:56,299
than like someone like myself here in

382
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:56,299
the Pacific Northwest uh which is

383
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,260
and and I want to dive into that because

384
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:03,299
I think some of your practices are very

385
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,039
unique to your environment

386
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:06,419
um and they may not translate the same

387
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:08,278
and I'm not saying that that's wrong I'm

388
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,778
just saying that that I don't think we

389
00:13:08,278 --> 00:13:12,720
can take all of your Tech all of your

390
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:14,759
ideas and make and throw them into uh

391
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,500
you know an environment like Florida or

392
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,759
Washington or Maine and things like that

393
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,679
and that that I think is a really

394
00:13:17,759 --> 00:13:20,338
interesting conversation

395
00:13:19,679 --> 00:13:22,078
um

396
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:22,980
is there anything else on IPM that we

397
00:13:22,078 --> 00:13:24,299
should touch on though while we're

398
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,800
talking about it

399
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:27,599
um just like one thing about the

400
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,799
environment is a big part man like a lot

401
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,540
of the things I do I get people to

402
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:32,939
understand I live in a like a pretty

403
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:35,519
Barren desert uh there's not a whole lot

404
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:37,560
a whole lot of natural pest pressure

405
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,899
um around me don't get me wrong the hemp

406
00:13:37,559 --> 00:13:41,039
scene was huge out here there are farms

407
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:43,259
out here so it's not like there's no

408
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:46,019
pests but like you said I'm not living

409
00:13:43,259 --> 00:13:48,059
in a place like Florida or like Northern

410
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:50,100
California like Grass Valley where

411
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:52,619
everyone in their mom is farming within

412
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,480
you know two feet of each other uh so it

413
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:56,879
definitely limits the risks

414
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,159
um quite a bit and it's things I've had

415
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:00,958
to consider when consulting or helping

416
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,458
other farms in other states

417
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:04,018
um it's it's something I have to just

418
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:05,699
own and realize that yeah things that

419
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:07,799
have to be different

420
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,959
that that brings up a good point you

421
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:12,419
mentioned something in your talk that I

422
00:14:09,958 --> 00:14:13,559
thought was really important um and

423
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:15,419
Powerful

424
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:17,159
um you talked about the workers in your

425
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:18,599
facility and who gets into your flower

426
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:21,778
rooms can you talk about that real quick

427
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:24,778
yeah so uh and that's that was another

428
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:26,100
um Game Changer on the PM thing uh back

429
00:14:24,778 --> 00:14:27,720
in the PM day

430
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,940
um so

431
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,560
when we when I designed my facility I

432
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,579
was kicking it with a Matt Davenport and

433
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,500
he was going through his whole

434
00:14:32,578 --> 00:14:35,759
permaculture schools and stuff like that

435
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,320
I mean him are really feeding off each

436
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:39,480
other and one of the things that he was

437
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:41,699
real big on at the time was designing a

438
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,379
space to be like a bullseye

439
00:14:41,698 --> 00:14:45,359
um like your your highest traffic area

440
00:14:43,379 --> 00:14:47,100
being the the bullseye your second

441
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,620
highest traffic area being that the next

442
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,720
little lip out and so on and so forth

443
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:53,459
um and uh how you want to try to put

444
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:56,220
those the busier sections next to each

445
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:58,739
other to avoid the back and forth

446
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,899
um and so so in our facility our busiest

447
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,639
area is our office that's where we kind

448
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,778
of that's the home of the facility is

449
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,919
the office that's where everything kind

450
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:06,958
of everybody kind of goes back that spot

451
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:08,399
so that's the bullseye and then from

452
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,439
there we have our trim room that's the

453
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:12,659
second busiest spot uh and then from

454
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:14,459
there we have our our grow room uh it's

455
00:15:12,659 --> 00:15:16,740
our third busiest spot

456
00:15:14,458 --> 00:15:18,239
um and to get to our grow room our

457
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,919
Growers can walk through our trim room

458
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:22,139
but our trimmers have never been in our

459
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:24,179
Grow rooms there's no reason for them to

460
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:25,740
be there um so it's kind of a need to be

461
00:15:24,179 --> 00:15:28,859
basis if you don't need to be back big

462
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:30,000
or not so example when you walk in

463
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,500
everybody walks into the office

464
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,240
everybody gets dressed out into their

465
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:35,100
clean scrubs and then everybody goes to

466
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,180
their stations the trimmers go to the

467
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,240
trim room and then the Growers go

468
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,799
further into to the intactual grow uh I

469
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,659
keep separation and across all that

470
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:43,740
because you never know we're the biggest

471
00:15:42,659 --> 00:15:46,379
vectors

472
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,759
um I like to think we have a rule at GOP

473
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:50,698
um that didn't always allowed to grow at

474
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,958
home and we it's a hard it's a big rule

475
00:15:50,698 --> 00:15:54,719
um and I try to supply people with

476
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:56,219
cannabis and incentives like that but

477
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,540
you never know if someone's being honest

478
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:59,940
or not and they are growing at home so

479
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:02,399
it's it's a really big risk I can't risk

480
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:03,959
you know 35 jobs from one person to grow

481
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,519
a plant at home that has spider mites

482
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,859
and then you know I gotta send 35 people

483
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,659
home so I got PM or something

484
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,740
um so we definitely try to make sure no

485
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:13,559
one grows at home so that's that's

486
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:15,180
another big part people only go where

487
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:16,319
they need to go it's a need that need to

488
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:18,479
be placed

489
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:21,060
um and then we also have a room order

490
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,220
and this was designed within the PM days

491
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:25,018
I enter my rooms in a certain order

492
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,639
depending on you know what's going on

493
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,198
the the different stages of life that

494
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:30,120
the plants are in

495
00:16:28,198 --> 00:16:31,620
um or if there's an issue in one room so

496
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,179
like I have three rooms and the first

497
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:35,278
thing my Growers and I do every day we

498
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:37,078
walk in is we go to our board and we

499
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:38,278
look at the room order uh you know it

500
00:16:37,078 --> 00:16:40,258
might be one two three it might be three

501
00:16:38,278 --> 00:16:42,299
two one but whatever the case may be and

502
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,100
we do not break that order

503
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:45,719
um example if I go to room one and I

504
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,519
have powdery mildew and then I'm walking

505
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,259
around room one working room one and

506
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,060
then I walk into room two well now room

507
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:52,919
two has Cadre mildew

508
00:16:51,059 --> 00:16:54,778
um and same with pests you know pester

509
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,939
have different life cycles um different

510
00:16:54,778 --> 00:16:58,919
life stages so you know if I get an

511
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:00,839
early test stage in one room and I take

512
00:16:58,919 --> 00:17:02,759
that early pass into another room or

513
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:04,259
vice versa now I'm fighting the battles

514
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,818
everywhere now I'm fighting the soil

515
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:07,679
stage of the past I'm fighting the above

516
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:09,359
ground stage of the past I'm fighting it

517
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,699
everywhere and it gets more costly where

518
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:13,139
by having a room order if I do get a

519
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,818
pass at least I have it in a certain

520
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:16,559
area a certain stage like now it's at

521
00:17:14,818 --> 00:17:18,078
it's soil stage I can see that with

522
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:21,178
nematology

523
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:22,438
whatever the case may be but then as it

524
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:24,179
advances it starts to go before the

525
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:25,980
plants now have different strategies

526
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,179
different techniques um to try to handle

527
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,579
that plant but if I'm trying to do all

528
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:32,640
those things at once because it says

529
00:17:29,579 --> 00:17:33,720
costly and time consuming so room order

530
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,820
um and again the room where it's always

531
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,319
changing it's not a perfect cycle you

532
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,079
know sometimes when it runs perfect it

533
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:42,000
kind of stays in order unless the pestic

534
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,579
disease shows itself in a certain area

535
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,839
then we kind of work around it

536
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:47,159
that's a that's a really good

537
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:49,558
explanation and I think that's something

538
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:51,779
that's Universal across all facilities a

539
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:52,678
lot of a lot of IPM is is custom to a

540
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,480
facility

541
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:56,700
um you there's no perfect just IPM

542
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,019
program that I could write that would

543
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,460
work for every facility and I think

544
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,720
that's an important thing to recognize

545
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,419
but

546
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,980
um my buddy Justin describes it in a way

547
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,200
that really works for my brain and like

548
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,360
it's like a it's like a river running

549
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,980
down from the you know the beginning of

550
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:12,779
the river all the way down to the the

551
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,940
mouth where it enters the ocean and

552
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:16,319
things only move in One Direction so you

553
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,298
want to move from your areas of like

554
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:19,918
least pest pressure

555
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:22,859
um and most important which is your

556
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,720
mother room your veg plants and then

557
00:18:22,859 --> 00:18:27,119
work your way down into your flower

558
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:30,000
rooms all the way through to harvest

559
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:31,678
because if you have a problem you want

560
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,900
to keep it as far down the river as

561
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,720
possible is the way he describes it and

562
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:38,460
and that technology yeah that algae

563
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,140
works for me I like I like your Bullseye

564
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,640
idea too and and it's important to think

565
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:43,620
about that like where is your foot

566
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:46,140
traffic because we are huge vectors and

567
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:50,038
and how do we eliminate that um

568
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:52,860
you mentioned uh spraying uh hydrogen

569
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:56,720
peroxide is there anything else that you

570
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:56,719
have in like your spray regimen

571
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:03,840
on a breakdown when I clean my rooms um

572
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,140
that is one of the things I will spray

573
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:08,819
my walls um and things uh with a light

574
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:10,440
H2O2

575
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:12,659
um just that's just room breakdown I

576
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:14,400
don't I keep it off the plans I try to

577
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,259
keep as much off the plants as possible

578
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,640
I try not to spray

579
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:19,140
um you know obviously early spring when

580
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:21,240
things start warming up drips start

581
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:22,320
showing up um we'll bust out essential

582
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,599
oils

583
00:19:22,319 --> 00:19:26,639
um it may add a little bit need to it

584
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:29,000
um best spot as far as we go

585
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:32,038
um for the most part it's compost teas

586
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,319
uh and that's probably about it I mean

587
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:36,538
and for the most part when I spray I

588
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:38,460
spray the floors so like when I'll mix

589
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:40,500
up a strong neem or essential oil and

590
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:41,880
I'll bomb my floors with it

591
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:44,519
um before I ever hit my plants with it

592
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,840
it's a really huge surface space

593
00:19:44,519 --> 00:19:48,058
um a lot of things end up on the floor

594
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:50,220
and we have a lot of really good success

595
00:19:48,058 --> 00:19:51,839
spraying our floors

596
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:53,279
do you have to like come through and mop

597
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,798
right after or something because it's

598
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:57,538
slippery or yeah usually we'll do it at

599
00:19:55,798 --> 00:19:58,679
the end of the day on like a Friday when

600
00:19:57,538 --> 00:20:01,259
no one's gonna be in there during the

601
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:02,820
weekend uh to minimize any type but yes

602
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:05,038
then Monday morning we come in ice

603
00:20:02,819 --> 00:20:08,220
skating with a mop uh and clean up the

604
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:11,220
oil for sure okay okay

605
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,960
um cool all right well let's uh

606
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:14,519
okay I have one other question before we

607
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:17,038
really dive into it here

608
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:19,558
um heavy metals you mentioned being an

609
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,440
old Lumber facility I had a guy in

610
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,639
Oklahoma fail for arsenic because they

611
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,740
were doing construction on the building

612
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,320
and it was literally knocking arsenic

613
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,298
down dust because the building had been

614
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:32,700
a lumber yard a lumber treatment

615
00:20:30,298 --> 00:20:35,519
facility like onto the plants and he

616
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,860
failed for arsenic um

617
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:39,298
has that been an issue for you at all I

618
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:42,298
know you and I have had conversations

619
00:20:39,298 --> 00:20:44,879
offline years ago way before heavy

620
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:47,400
metals was even really such a Hot Topic

621
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,559
um how do you how do you manage that

622
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,660
I mean honestly we've been super blessed

623
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:52,558
to never really have to never be an

624
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,298
issue

625
00:20:52,558 --> 00:20:56,339
um we do have some some of the similar

626
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:58,859
heavy metal requirements as other states

627
00:20:56,339 --> 00:21:00,298
I see people it's one of the hot that

628
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:02,459
Nashville jealous I think are two of the

629
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:04,619
hottest tickets right now on aspergillus

630
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:06,660
testing but we've been blessed with

631
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,239
heavy metals um as far as you know never

632
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:11,759
being an issue uh I I can't really

633
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:13,079
account to what it's for early on when

634
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,519
we got our soil first tested before

635
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:18,119
planned for even in it yeah there were

636
00:21:14,519 --> 00:21:19,500
some acceptable levels of certain things

637
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:21,659
um and they've never

638
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,880
they've never exceeded you know we've

639
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:25,740
always been any time I've seen any like

640
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,660
arsenic or anything like that even you

641
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:30,058
know jump up slightly and we backed off

642
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,980
all ocean products um no no crustacean

643
00:21:30,058 --> 00:21:33,359
meals no Kelps things like that

644
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,980
um even when we do use things like help

645
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:36,479
circumstation you'll use them very

646
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,860
sparingly

647
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,759
um just to be you know considerate of

648
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:40,979
that

649
00:21:38,759 --> 00:21:42,900
um but I know it is an issue

650
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,279
um we've talked about some of the things

651
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,140
that could help I know I don't know if

652
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:47,819
it's bioremediation as far as some of

653
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,140
the mushrooms we use but we're not

654
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:50,700
pulling them out all the time so that

655
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,679
might not be it

656
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:53,600
um I I don't know we've talked about

657
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:56,100
um

658
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:58,439
uh yeah just a bunch of things I can't

659
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,658
really say to be honest uh start with a

660
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:03,538
good soil make sure that it's

661
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:05,820
biologically uh it's

662
00:22:03,538 --> 00:22:07,500
it's biologically active so your plants

663
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:09,899
are aren't basically

664
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,400
don't bypass the soil food web you know

665
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,740
I feel like that's a big thing is people

666
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,360
bypass a soil food web and then their

667
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,000
plants are forced to eat heavy metals in

668
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:19,259
some cases where my system my plants had

669
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,640
everything they want through the soil

670
00:22:19,259 --> 00:22:22,319
food web there's no reason for them to

671
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,940
chew tin cans

672
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,259
um but at the same time I don't know man

673
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,460
has there been a problem for me I wish I

674
00:22:25,259 --> 00:22:28,259
had an answer because it is a problem

675
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,700
for a lot of people get your soil

676
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:31,980
through kiss Organics that shouldn't be

677
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:35,279
a problem I guess

678
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:36,599
uh well thanks for the shout out um I've

679
00:22:35,279 --> 00:22:38,700
used your soil tune I've never had a

680
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:41,459
problem with it too so uh for anybody

681
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:43,558
out there who needs to hear that yeah oh

682
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,880
you have really I I know we talked about

683
00:22:43,558 --> 00:22:48,000
a big order at one point when you're

684
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:51,059
expanding but um you found a you know a

685
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,919
closer resource with and it was cool we

686
00:22:51,058 --> 00:22:54,480
never expanded uh covet hit we're doing

687
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,740
a big Greenhouse thing and then Kobe hit

688
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,599
so we kind of shut the whole apartment

689
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:59,579
half the time being but I ended up

690
00:22:57,599 --> 00:23:01,379
testing your soil uh we expanded our

691
00:22:59,579 --> 00:23:04,918
mother our bedroom I did a mother bed

692
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,320
and uh I put your soil in the mother bed

693
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:09,360
um and been using that for five years

694
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,099
now six years now well now it's

695
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:13,500
Greenlife soil it's not kiss organic

696
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:15,599
soil anymore right on man

697
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:17,159
um you mentioned the soil food web and I

698
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:18,500
absolutely want to talk about that

699
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,159
because we do have some slight

700
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:24,779
differences of opinion there but you do

701
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,400
soil test correct oh and we have to jump

702
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,960
back to aspergillus at some point I

703
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,419
don't want to forget that um we'll write

704
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,700
that one down yeah absolutely don't let

705
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,038
me forget aspergillus um because people

706
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:37,798
are gonna give me a hard time if I don't

707
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:40,558
bring it up yeah

708
00:23:37,798 --> 00:23:41,460
um shoot okay so getting back to it

709
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,058
though

710
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,880
um

711
00:23:42,058 --> 00:23:47,339
you do soil test right yes

712
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,020
so you you your soul food web person but

713
00:23:47,339 --> 00:23:50,279
then you also do believe in managing

714
00:23:49,019 --> 00:23:51,119
fertility

715
00:23:50,279 --> 00:23:53,399
um

716
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:56,459
out of curiosity what is the PH range of

717
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:58,140
your soils on on average

718
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:01,380
um pretty high like six eight to seven

719
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,400
one uh on average yeah so do I I love

720
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:04,440
that

721
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,519
um that's the range I like to be in

722
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,100
actually

723
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:11,460
um that's good to hear uh how do you

724
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:14,158
manage fertility then with these beds

725
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:15,720
so uh you know and like you've already

726
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,340
pointed out I've gone through different

727
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:19,259
stages in my career

728
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:21,240
um different techniques and and it's

729
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:22,440
always been involving uh early on I

730
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,700
didn't know a whole lot what I was doing

731
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,500
I was just swinging for the fence at

732
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,700
everything just trying a little bit of

733
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,640
this a little bit of that it was getting

734
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:31,798
crazy uh then uh then I had a what's the

735
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,700
name uh Scott scanners scam something

736
00:24:31,798 --> 00:24:34,200
like that

737
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:36,179
um came out here and reintroduced me to

738
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,558
the soil food web and Elena and gum I

739
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:38,460
got signed up to the wholesale food web

740
00:24:37,558 --> 00:24:40,379
course

741
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:42,360
um went through that whole stage

742
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:46,140
um and then I went hardcore soil food

743
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:47,519
web like biology driven compost only

744
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,400
um and I ran it like I'm talking

745
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:52,679
hardcore no amendments anything just

746
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,059
like all biological just whatever my

747
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,380
plans whatever you're gonna use went

748
00:24:54,058 --> 00:24:57,599
back to the soil

749
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,820
um I did that for about a little over a

750
00:24:57,599 --> 00:25:01,500
year and then uh

751
00:24:59,819 --> 00:25:03,240
then when we switched our lights to

752
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:05,099
those lights I fell on my face we had

753
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,079
the best Harvest ever the first harvest

754
00:25:05,099 --> 00:25:09,240
and then uh then the soil couldn't keep

755
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:11,639
up after that no matter how many compost

756
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,319
teas I did no matter how much biological

757
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:15,120
inputs whatever

758
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:16,918
um it just couldn't keep up and then uh

759
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,359
then I had to go back to the soil

760
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:21,360
testing um and kind of looking at my

761
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:23,038
soil and Logan Labs uh I work with soil

762
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:25,678
doctor Bryant quite a bit

763
00:25:23,038 --> 00:25:27,419
um awesome dude uh but then we had to

764
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,798
realize that yeah there's you gotta you

765
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:30,720
gotta put back what you take out you

766
00:25:28,798 --> 00:25:32,158
can't just take out you know can't be

767
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,500
cropping out 200 pounds of room every

768
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,100
month and expect it you know just to

769
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:40,319
come from thin air uh so uh I feel like

770
00:25:38,099 --> 00:25:42,658
there's a combination between

771
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:43,798
um soil testing and soil food web type

772
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,059
techniques

773
00:25:43,798 --> 00:25:46,319
um and we put them both together get the

774
00:25:45,058 --> 00:25:48,178
best of both worlds make it super

775
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:49,319
efficient for your for your microbes to

776
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,240
do their job give me everything they

777
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:53,700
need to do their job

778
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:55,679
um I think is the key so I test my soil

779
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,340
two to three times a year

780
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,278
um

781
00:25:56,339 --> 00:26:00,778
my saturated Pace test is uh is is

782
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,298
usually where I have to do my work on

783
00:26:00,778 --> 00:26:06,298
because we're primarily you know uh uh

784
00:26:03,298 --> 00:26:07,980
feed the soil driven so my my standard

785
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:10,379
test is always I almost aced that thing

786
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,179
every time but it's a saturated Pace

787
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:15,120
test where the work is found

788
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:17,640
um but yeah you just over time you start

789
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:19,558
to see these Trends kind of form uh

790
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,419
everything that we've ever done in GOP

791
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,918
uh I track on a board at the end of

792
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:25,200
every week that board gets recorded into

793
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,759
a notebook onto a

794
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,019
um

795
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:30,298
what do you call it yeah a little

796
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,099
notebook deal I have eight years of data

797
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,839
literally every single thing that's

798
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:36,000
going into my soil um every single

799
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,439
measurement amount for eight years has

800
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,240
been recorded

801
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,259
um and you can start to see these trends

802
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,359
when you start to look at you know what

803
00:26:40,259 --> 00:26:45,000
you did that cycle uh and I have three

804
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:47,879
rooms that I keep about a month apart so

805
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,859
I run the same exact Sops for a cycle

806
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:51,778
even if it even if I trip on the first

807
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:53,219
room I'm gonna repeat the second and

808
00:26:51,778 --> 00:26:55,380
third room to keep the rooms consistent

809
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,940
I know that sounds crazy

810
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,140
um but it's just I can't taste too many

811
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,659
different problems all over the place so

812
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,000
we repeat the same thing every cycle

813
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,980
um and then when I test my soil I see

814
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,419
the first room that there's finished a

815
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,558
cycle I see the room that's middle of

816
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:08,880
the cycle and I see the room at the

817
00:27:07,558 --> 00:27:11,339
beginning of the cycle I get a full

818
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,559
picture of what my soil looks like based

819
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,879
off of that Cycles Sops

820
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:16,500
um and then from there because hard to

821
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,000
track Trends I can see you know what's

822
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,798
going up and what's going down faster

823
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,419
than I can fix it and we start to kind

824
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:23,038
of design our well we need to top dress

825
00:27:21,419 --> 00:27:25,080
what we need to put back into the soil

826
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:27,480
going into that next cycle

827
00:27:25,079 --> 00:27:28,740
um now when I top dress uh that's a

828
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,940
really big one I think you heard me talk

829
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,579
about it for the first time with that

830
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:34,440
that talk in California recently

831
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:36,839
um but the way we run our systems is

832
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,298
when I replant the room I have about

833
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:40,859
three weeks before I flip the flower so

834
00:27:39,298 --> 00:27:42,599
about four weeks before the flower shows

835
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,678
up so I have about four weeks of top

836
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:45,538
dressing

837
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,340
um to get my soil back to where I needed

838
00:27:45,538 --> 00:27:50,278
to be and it's not even for that cycle

839
00:27:47,339 --> 00:27:51,599
it's for the next cycle honestly so I'll

840
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:53,460
go into a room

841
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:55,439
um every week we do a white top dressing

842
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:56,700
and how I measure my top dressing is

843
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,980
based off an old technique I learned

844
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,480
from Lane inghams first of course where

845
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:02,940
there was a lady talking about worm

846
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,620
farming and she had mentioned that you

847
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:06,058
don't want to feed your worm farm more

848
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:09,119
than your worms could eat in three days

849
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:12,058
because then you know if a say fungus

850
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:13,739
gnat comes in lays an egg that egg has

851
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,200
you know hatches in two to three days

852
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,000
then it goes to Nest life cycle and so

853
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,500
on and so forth but if you only feed

854
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,599
your worms what they can eat in three

855
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:23,640
days it's gonna eat whatever food source

856
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,558
that Lake just guys uh that fly just

857
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,700
lays egg in is to get eaten it's a

858
00:28:25,558 --> 00:28:28,678
passive the digestive system of the worm

859
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,000
it's not going to make it out so it's

860
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:31,320
going to keep the pest pressure down as

861
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,278
far as flies and things of that nature

862
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:34,079
go

863
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:36,538
um so with that being said when I top

864
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:39,720
dress my soil when I feed my soil I only

865
00:28:36,538 --> 00:28:41,879
top dress but my soil with my worms

866
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,400
um could eat or shred in three to five

867
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:45,840
days in one week so if I come in if I

868
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,519
come in on Monday and I top dress my

869
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,959
beds usually it's about two cups on

870
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:50,579
average there's about two cups of

871
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,259
whatever part mix we want to do if it's

872
00:28:50,579 --> 00:28:53,699
nitrogen obviously like a soybean meal

873
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:54,720
or an alfalfa

874
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,940
um and

875
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,919
fill in the blanks for everything else

876
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:00,960
um we'll mix we're a two-part three-part

877
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:02,640
mix I'll put about two cups of bed on

878
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,200
average is what our guys can take what

879
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:07,679
they can how big how big are your beds

880
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,480
eight by four good question okay um so

881
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,980
so and we do that every beginning of the

882
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,900
week now if I come in uh the next week

883
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,240
and I still see the top dressing from

884
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,620
the prior week I'm either gonna wait a

885
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,700
little bit longer I'm gonna back off my

886
00:29:16,619 --> 00:29:19,019
amounts

887
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,519
um I'm gonna make sure that you know the

888
00:29:19,019 --> 00:29:21,960
worms and the rollie pollies whatever

889
00:29:20,519 --> 00:29:23,819
whatever Critters you have rolling

890
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,558
around are shredding and working it into

891
00:29:23,819 --> 00:29:27,538
the soil you don't want to leave a food

892
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:29,579
source for pests to lay its eggs and

893
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:30,960
make attack next to the stage

894
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:32,339
um so that's kind of a big problem just

895
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,440
becoming every week we do a light top

896
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:36,720
dressing and based off a top dressing

897
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:39,000
mix that we we designed that's always

898
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,140
changing based off of our Logan lab soil

899
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,759
Resorts where we're just kind of

900
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,440
tracking those Trends

901
00:29:41,759 --> 00:29:45,179
um and what we find for the most part is

902
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,798
potassium is a hard one we're always

903
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,940
kind of trying to catch up with

904
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,220
potassium

905
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,659
um and then obviously nitrogen nitrogen

906
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,460
is is one that we're trying constantly

907
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,140
trying to find The Sweet Spot we don't

908
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,360
want too little you don't want too much

909
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:59,159
either so it's kind of tricky

910
00:29:57,359 --> 00:30:02,339
yeah and those are the two most mobile

911
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:04,320
nutrients besides sodium in soils so

912
00:30:02,339 --> 00:30:05,278
that that makes sense and I see the same

913
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:08,519
thing

914
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:10,798
um how do you top dress with I've seen

915
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,179
some plan I've seen some photos where at

916
00:30:10,798 --> 00:30:13,079
certain times and we should talk about

917
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:15,600
this

918
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:18,418
um you have uh quite a bit of cover

919
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,278
crops in there and biomass how are you

920
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:22,620
top dressing a bed like that

921
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,898
so when we first come into a room

922
00:30:22,619 --> 00:30:26,398
um I chop and drop all my cover crops I

923
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,678
don't remove anything as far as cover

924
00:30:26,398 --> 00:30:30,898
crop goes but I I said I set a clean

925
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,399
slate God forbid I had to pass pressure

926
00:30:30,898 --> 00:30:34,678
to last for a while I don't need things

927
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:38,339
lingering in my cover crops um so we

928
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:40,259
reset the room completely early on and

929
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:41,879
then we top draw top dress from there so

930
00:30:40,259 --> 00:30:44,158
I'm not really top dressing on top of

931
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:46,320
heavy cover cops typically and then we

932
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,640
water it in so it's dry amendments that

933
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:49,859
aren't you know typically aren't really

934
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,659
uh available to the plant

935
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:54,839
um trying to feed the soil not Pat um

936
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:55,799
you know soil food web Paradigm anyways

937
00:30:54,839 --> 00:30:58,019
um

938
00:30:55,798 --> 00:30:59,940
so the whole idea is yeah

939
00:30:58,019 --> 00:31:01,798
um chop and drop early get the cover

940
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,538
crops knocked down and start start

941
00:31:01,798 --> 00:31:05,759
amending your soil slowly but surely if

942
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:08,038
you do have cover crops we water it in

943
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:09,599
um I do I and I know we this is another

944
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:11,158
topic over the go where is the cover

945
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:13,019
crops one so I'm not sure if this is the

946
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:14,760
starting point for that well we haven't

947
00:31:13,019 --> 00:31:17,278
really gotten into soul food web yet so

948
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:18,778
let's let's save cover crops

949
00:31:17,278 --> 00:31:20,220
because I okay I want to hear your

950
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:23,819
thoughts on this regarding the soul food

951
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:26,339
web so uh you know my dad was one of the

952
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:28,980
first selfie webadvisors big compost tea

953
00:31:26,339 --> 00:31:30,959
in fact our company was founded on uh

954
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:33,240
being the first company to have

955
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,759
um like a a lane Ingham certified

956
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:37,679
12-hour compost tea five gallon Brewer

957
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:40,319
so that's that's where we started in the

958
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:42,778
industry when I came into everything and

959
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:44,519
um in more recent years and that's when

960
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:47,579
I say in more recent years you know

961
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:50,398
we're I'm old now this was like uh we

962
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:51,658
started this in 1999 maybe it's been

963
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:52,619
over 20 years

964
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,659
um

965
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:57,000
in more recent years some of the claims

966
00:31:54,659 --> 00:31:58,200
from the soul web community and some of

967
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,880
the things that I've learned don't

968
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,679
always align and I'd love to hear your

969
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,020
thoughts on that so

970
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,179
I've heard Dr Ingram say that all soils

971
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:07,440
have sufficient minerals for plant

972
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:10,500
growth

973
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,419
um in in my experience when we manage

974
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,519
fertility sort of like you are we get a

975
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:17,600
better outcome than

976
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:20,519
um just relying on microbes

977
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:22,918
to make nutrients available that may not

978
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:24,960
be insufficient levels I I don't believe

979
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:26,340
soul food web can fully it can buffer

980
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,798
things but I don't believe it corrects

981
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,898
pH I don't think it corrects a Calcium

982
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:33,839
deficiency or a nitrogen or what some

983
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:34,558
sort of mineral issue or toxicity

984
00:32:33,839 --> 00:32:36,178
um

985
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:38,038
why don't we start there what are your

986
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:40,559
thoughts on that

987
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:42,240
I I think uh you know I can only speak

988
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:45,359
from my perspective like I'm new to

989
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:47,940
outdoor farming I'm on my second year

990
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:49,500
um I think it takes time for for the

991
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:50,759
biology to do its job to make certain

992
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:52,259
things available

993
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:54,119
um and I know like a Kenneth facility

994
00:32:52,259 --> 00:32:57,179
time is money I'm turning these dreams

995
00:32:54,119 --> 00:32:59,759
over you know four times a year uh so I

996
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,278
don't really allow a lot of the time

997
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:04,919
needed um for these biological processes

998
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:06,000
to for to mine these minerals and all

999
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:07,500
these things

1000
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,339
um to take place

1001
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,740
um

1002
00:33:08,339 --> 00:33:12,359
so I I do think they're especially and

1003
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:14,819
when you're trying to run a business I I

1004
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,379
do see the advantage of being able to to

1005
00:33:14,819 --> 00:33:18,538
give your soil what it needs your your

1006
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,600
microbial Community what it needs I mean

1007
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:23,220
if if I give you you know calcium then

1008
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:25,139
you'll have to you know dig a mile into

1009
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:27,058
the Earth's surface to find it it's

1010
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,620
gonna be a lot more efficient way

1011
00:33:27,058 --> 00:33:31,259
um for the plant to get it you know so

1012
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:33,239
uh I think there's there's definitely

1013
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:36,480
some pros and cons there again like I

1014
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:38,880
said earlier I went hardcore food web uh

1015
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,220
with some really powerful lights and uh

1016
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,580
the food web indoors I mean I'm talking

1017
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,038
the best compost it's 100 good compost

1018
00:33:44,579 --> 00:33:48,298
tea nothing nothing crazy no crazy

1019
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:51,179
techniques

1020
00:33:48,298 --> 00:33:53,460
um it couldn't keep up over time it on

1021
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:54,360
engineer soil indoors it could not keep

1022
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,460
up

1023
00:33:54,359 --> 00:33:57,778
um I had to resort to feeding my soil I

1024
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,700
had a resort to putting those minerals

1025
00:33:57,778 --> 00:34:01,798
back in I mean and I've heard the story

1026
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,200
if you have rocks in your soil um you

1027
00:34:01,798 --> 00:34:05,700
have minerals and nutrients to take it

1028
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:07,259
takes to grow plants

1029
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,300
um I just I just think it takes a little

1030
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:11,699
more time for the better quality to make

1031
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,480
those value available to the plant that

1032
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,480
a lot of us allow

1033
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:22,679
cool and uh on that topic of soul food

1034
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:24,179
web I know that I've also heard

1035
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,260
um it said that if you have a pest

1036
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:27,539
problem

1037
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:29,339
that that's because you didn't have the

1038
00:34:27,539 --> 00:34:32,699
right soul food web in place you didn't

1039
00:34:29,338 --> 00:34:35,579
have the right you know bacteria and

1040
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:37,799
fungi and fungi and and fungal bacteria

1041
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:40,279
ratios to keep that pest from becoming

1042
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:43,619
successful at consuming that plant

1043
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,080
yeah if you have a good ft ratio and

1044
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,820
high risks pests don't exist that's

1045
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,679
sarcasm

1046
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:53,159
um oh okay I mean I know people believe

1047
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:56,220
that I I don't it freaks me out I've

1048
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:58,380
I I disagree um I guess they might help

1049
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,939
obviously a healthy plant is going to

1050
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:02,039
defend itself better a healthy person

1051
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,300
with a good immune system isn't defend

1052
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:05,219
itself better

1053
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,720
um but not gonna eliminate the risk

1054
00:35:05,219 --> 00:35:09,059
completely

1055
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:11,399
um so no I I don't really subscribe to

1056
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:13,559
that I haven't really obviously I've

1057
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:15,059
witnessed unhealthy soils with more

1058
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,338
press pressure and healthy soils with

1059
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:18,599
less pressure but I've never seen like I

1060
00:35:17,338 --> 00:35:20,219
heard people say

1061
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:22,140
um if you have a pest

1062
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:23,639
um because I use like a trap trap plants

1063
00:35:22,139 --> 00:35:24,779
and Banker plant type techniques well I

1064
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,219
heard people tell me I'll just put a

1065
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,839
sick plant in the center of your room

1066
00:35:26,219 --> 00:35:29,519
and all your pests will go to that sick

1067
00:35:27,838 --> 00:35:31,078
plant then you can just remove the sick

1068
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:32,219
plant and I get people on my page

1069
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:34,140
telling me this all the time like these

1070
00:35:32,219 --> 00:35:35,219
100 people have told me this it's not

1071
00:35:34,139 --> 00:35:37,019
the case

1072
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:39,659
um yes it will help to have healthy

1073
00:35:37,019 --> 00:35:43,139
soils obviously but it's not gonna

1074
00:35:39,659 --> 00:35:45,179
I'll all cure all for sure

1075
00:35:43,139 --> 00:35:47,759
okay I mean I I agree with you on that

1076
00:35:45,179 --> 00:35:50,219
like I I think if your pest pressure is

1077
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,660
sufficient you're gonna have pest damage

1078
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:53,759
they're gonna eat

1079
00:35:51,659 --> 00:35:56,098
um that's what they're ecologically and

1080
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:58,140
evolutionarily designed to do is consume

1081
00:35:56,099 --> 00:35:59,579
these plants so

1082
00:35:58,139 --> 00:36:01,019
um yeah there's just some things that

1083
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:02,339
I've struggled with that I've heard

1084
00:36:01,019 --> 00:36:03,960
coming out of the soul food web

1085
00:36:02,338 --> 00:36:06,299
community and that's not to say it's you

1086
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,920
directly or or anything like that

1087
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,599
um but there are some philosophical

1088
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,280
differences the the last thing on the

1089
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:14,280
soul food web topic is this idea of

1090
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,900
fungal to bacteria ratios so when I went

1091
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:17,460
to the and I mentioned this to you

1092
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:21,180
before when I went to this

1093
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,338
the soil science Society of America sssa

1094
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:25,739
conference the international one

1095
00:36:23,338 --> 00:36:28,199
actually it was in San Diego one year uh

1096
00:36:25,739 --> 00:36:30,179
I heard I saw some excellent research on

1097
00:36:28,199 --> 00:36:32,519
fungal to bacteria ratios and

1098
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:34,819
essentially it boiled down to this uh

1099
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:38,119
fungal bacteria ratios are are

1100
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:40,200
constantly changing in the soil

1101
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:43,079
they can measure them and they can

1102
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:44,519
measure what species of microbes you

1103
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:47,460
know various microbes you have in your

1104
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:50,460
soil but things like a rain event like

1105
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:51,358
hydrology or temperature

1106
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,338
um

1107
00:36:51,358 --> 00:36:56,159
disturbance all of these things will

1108
00:36:53,338 --> 00:36:58,799
impact your fungal bacteria ratios not

1109
00:36:56,159 --> 00:37:00,179
on like a cycle basis but actually or in

1110
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,820
terms of like a growing cycle but

1111
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:06,739
literally on an hourly basis so you'll

1112
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:10,200
see I mean these microbes live lifetimes

1113
00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:13,259
of of evolution just within one cycle of

1114
00:37:10,199 --> 00:37:15,960
your of your of your grow right so how

1115
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,660
do we make decisions based off of that

1116
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:20,760
knowing that that ratio is constantly

1117
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:24,179
going to be in flux

1118
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:26,820
yeah I'm gonna be honest and I love

1119
00:37:24,179 --> 00:37:29,098
Elaine I love I'm like

1120
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,500
so thankful for the work she's done and

1121
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:33,240
with the regulatory systems I'm going

1122
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,579
through now as far as from the battles I

1123
00:37:33,239 --> 00:37:36,659
see why she does some of the things she

1124
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:38,519
does instead of some of the things she

1125
00:37:36,659 --> 00:37:40,199
does makes more sense to me now

1126
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,358
um overall as far as like the f2b

1127
00:37:40,199 --> 00:37:45,179
subject goes uh

1128
00:37:42,358 --> 00:37:47,699
I quit chasing that a long time ago I

1129
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:49,858
think like every soil in the world could

1130
00:37:47,699 --> 00:37:51,539
use more fungus uh and I feel like it

1131
00:37:49,858 --> 00:37:53,039
she has a kind of a

1132
00:37:51,539 --> 00:37:54,779
it's like a point where like a

1133
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:56,639
consultant can really sell you some high

1134
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,619
quality compost that you may not need as

1135
00:37:56,639 --> 00:38:00,299
much as you think hey you need fungus

1136
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:01,858
you need more fungus in your soil well I

1137
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,599
just happen to have this fungal dominant

1138
00:38:01,858 --> 00:38:04,858
compost you could buy for a thousand

1139
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,119
dollars a yard

1140
00:38:04,858 --> 00:38:08,819
um so I don't really subscribe to that

1141
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,619
no more uh and I only say that because

1142
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:11,880
I'm working with an engineered soil

1143
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,380
indoors

1144
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:15,358
um that the primary plant that's been

1145
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:17,460
grown in this soil for the last eight

1146
00:38:15,358 --> 00:38:19,679
years is cannabis now for eight years

1147
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:21,000
I've added compost that is fungal

1148
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,139
dominant compost some of the best

1149
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,699
compost in the world shout out to

1150
00:38:22,139 --> 00:38:26,819
cannabis microbes

1151
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:29,219
um by our Catalyst bowel amendments um

1152
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,440
and I still grow a bacterial dominant

1153
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:32,819
soil whenever I scope my soil make an

1154
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,380
assessment it's without a doubt

1155
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:35,280
bacterially dominant that's not to say I

1156
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,720
don't have mushrooms everywhere that's

1157
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,460
not to say I don't have beneficial

1158
00:38:36,719 --> 00:38:40,319
fungus in my soil

1159
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,300
um it just seems to me like this plant

1160
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:43,980
which is in control

1161
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:46,320
um it prefers to grow a bacterial

1162
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,699
dominant soil and like you said to point

1163
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:50,099
to both things you said

1164
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:51,239
um both the life cycle of the plant has

1165
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,740
something to do with that I feel like

1166
00:38:51,239 --> 00:38:54,000
the plant in detective dates and how

1167
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:55,979
it's cycling

1168
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,079
um isn't also control that play a big

1169
00:38:55,980 --> 00:39:00,358
role in that then also a watering cycle

1170
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:01,920
you know I could I could jack up my

1171
00:39:00,358 --> 00:39:03,480
watering cycle miss a watering cycle

1172
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,920
over water underwater whatever the case

1173
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:07,920
may be and that's going to create a huge

1174
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,838
flux in the microbial Community too so I

1175
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,980
think there's a lot of variables that go

1176
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,338
into play

1177
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:16,679
um now as far as the f2b ratio on on

1178
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:18,599
unlike certain plants I do believe like

1179
00:39:16,679 --> 00:39:20,759
I hear some people say that like Jeff

1180
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:23,099
Longfellow I read his book and he's real

1181
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:24,480
big on uh ecological succession and he

1182
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:25,740
kind of like plays cannabis like kind of

1183
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,599
like in the middle more on the bacterial

1184
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:29,159
side and then you have people on like

1185
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:31,440
the soil food website they're like the

1186
00:39:29,159 --> 00:39:33,179
soul food web Consultants are like no it

1187
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,559
needs to be on a fungal side more fungus

1188
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:36,179
if you have this fungus you won't have

1189
00:39:34,559 --> 00:39:37,980
any passing disease and your plants will

1190
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:39,779
flourish and they'll produce CBD that

1191
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,858
never produce CBD before I've heard that

1192
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,460
one

1193
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:47,519
um they'll say all these crazy things

1194
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,740
um I disagree I I I'm more with Jeff

1195
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:51,539
longfellas and based off of what I've

1196
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:53,699
seen on a soil that's been grown that's

1197
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:55,619
been grown by cannabis for eight years

1198
00:39:53,699 --> 00:39:58,559
uh every time I look at bacterial

1199
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:01,079
dominated but not only that but anytime

1200
00:39:58,559 --> 00:40:05,279
I put a plant into my soil it flourishes

1201
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,320
except two times I put uh uh redwood

1202
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,119
trees I'm sorry sequoia trees in it I

1203
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,640
tried just for fun I find the sequoia

1204
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,420
trees both times they fell flat on their

1205
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,219
face

1206
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:16,380
different type of nutrients different

1207
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:17,939
type of whatever different type of soil

1208
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,320
um but it just showed me kind of back to

1209
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,358
like what Jeff longfell said in the

1210
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,880
ecological succession it kind of showed

1211
00:40:21,358 --> 00:40:25,199
me where my cannabis plan is in the soil

1212
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,000
that is growing

1213
00:40:25,199 --> 00:40:28,439
um and it's and I get constantly quoted

1214
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,420
as an old growth forest old growth

1215
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,519
forest but I'm my soil isn't like an old

1216
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:34,380
growth forest and it may look like it at

1217
00:40:32,519 --> 00:40:36,599
certain times but when you look at it

1218
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,579
under the microscope drastically

1219
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:40,559
different I assure you

1220
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:42,119
um so I don't know I have mixed opinions

1221
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,320
on it I'm still learning like he asked

1222
00:40:42,119 --> 00:40:45,300
me in 10 years I'll probably have a

1223
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:47,160
better opinion on it

1224
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,960
um but it's not something I taste my

1225
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:50,639
tail anymore I have to be ratio I try to

1226
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,559
always be conscious of making sure

1227
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:53,759
there's good fungus in there beneficial

1228
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,679
fungus in there

1229
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,300
um I'm more worried about nutrient

1230
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:59,219
cycling and the amount of water I put in

1231
00:40:57,300 --> 00:41:00,000
that you know you dry your soil out too

1232
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:01,379
much

1233
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,119
um your nutrient cycling is not fall on

1234
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:06,000
his face so being able to time your

1235
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,280
watering events I think is really key to

1236
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,099
maintaining a healthy soil system

1237
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:12,119
um but yeah that's my thing I lost a lot

1238
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:13,440
of friends in the solo food web

1239
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:15,000
Community saying [ __ ] like that but it

1240
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,760
is what it is

1241
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,858
uh no I appreciate that I think you said

1242
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,020
something I I think we kind of aligned

1243
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:24,059
pretty closely on that one actually

1244
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:25,199
um I know we were further off in the

1245
00:41:24,059 --> 00:41:27,119
past but

1246
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,139
um and I wonder if your Sequoia maybe

1247
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,880
just can't handle that level of

1248
00:41:28,139 --> 00:41:32,699
fertility too that you're putting in for

1249
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:35,280
cannabis um where I fell on my flat on

1250
00:41:32,699 --> 00:41:37,319
my face was with blueberries I threw

1251
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,500
some blueberries in my veggie mix and

1252
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:42,539
they just did not grow well my pH was

1253
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:44,460
way too high for blueberries

1254
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:45,779
um at the time so you know live and

1255
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,338
learn like you said

1256
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,019
um but some of the things that you said

1257
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,400
that I think are really interesting that

1258
00:41:49,019 --> 00:41:51,480
I want to highlight is one we're always

1259
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,980
learning

1260
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,659
um and we're always you know a good

1261
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:56,219
grower I think is really open-minded to

1262
00:41:54,659 --> 00:41:58,139
changing their practices as they learn

1263
00:41:56,219 --> 00:41:59,819
new things and I'm constantly learning

1264
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:02,879
new things I'm a much better grower than

1265
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:05,280
I was two years ago versus five years

1266
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:08,700
ago and a decade ago um

1267
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,800
and also that uh yeah if we can always

1268
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:12,239
keep in mind that the soul food web is

1269
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,460
absolutely important

1270
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:17,399
um I don't want to say that it doesn't

1271
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,079
matter but I think that the way that I

1272
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:20,820
choose personally to manage it is

1273
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:23,820
through like like you said this concept

1274
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:25,320
of nutrient cycling being important and

1275
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:28,380
thinking of is like how how can I keep

1276
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:30,720
my nutrient cycling up but also

1277
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:33,960
um what practices do I have that just

1278
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:35,639
encourage healthy diverse microbial

1279
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,900
activity in my soil because I'm going to

1280
00:42:35,639 --> 00:42:38,400
do those things anyway you mentioned

1281
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:40,858
compost you mentioned potentially

1282
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,660
compost tea you mentioned add in adding

1283
00:42:40,858 --> 00:42:44,880
minerals all of those things are going

1284
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,500
to feed microbes and when we do that I

1285
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:47,940
think we get a better outcome like you

1286
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,980
said so

1287
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,760
uh yeah I don't think we're really that

1288
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:52,760
far off on that one

1289
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:59,039
yeah so okay well let's just so I don't

1290
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,900
forget let's jump backwards to

1291
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:04,619
aspergillus and then let's dive into

1292
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:06,420
cover crops so aspergillus talk to me

1293
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:08,519
about it what are your experiences

1294
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:11,099
it's

1295
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:13,259
it's something we all need to get on the

1296
00:43:11,099 --> 00:43:15,480
same page about and start getting out

1297
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:17,880
there more about it it's definitely not

1298
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,960
designed to help organic Growers I don't

1299
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,280
think it's designed to help anybody in

1300
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,900
the industry at all

1301
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,420
um I definitely think it's a huge

1302
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:26,039
roadblock I don't know of anybody

1303
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,480
especially outside the Campus Community

1304
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:29,039
since they've been testing for

1305
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,500
aspergillus ever talked about

1306
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:33,239
aspergillosis or any type of

1307
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,440
um disease coming from aspergillus no

1308
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,639
one knows about that no one talks about

1309
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:37,559
it no one's ever concerned about it

1310
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:39,299
until cannabis came into legal canvas

1311
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:40,858
came into the seam um if you were to go

1312
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,359
to the grocery store and test your food

1313
00:43:40,858 --> 00:43:44,460
it would want it fail for every

1314
00:43:42,358 --> 00:43:45,239
pesticide fungus on the planet uh and

1315
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:47,099
then two yeah it's gonna have

1316
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:49,199
aspergillus and mold and yeast all over

1317
00:43:47,099 --> 00:43:52,140
it because these naturally occurring

1318
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:53,578
molds and yeast and and funguses are

1319
00:43:52,139 --> 00:43:56,279
everywhere so

1320
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:58,680
um to me it's kind of a silly thing I

1321
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:59,880
don't know I feel like it's a it's a

1322
00:43:58,679 --> 00:44:01,739
bigger problem kind of like what I'm

1323
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:03,000
facing nowadays as far as uh I think

1324
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:05,098
it's

1325
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,079
it's more of a political issue I feel

1326
00:44:05,099 --> 00:44:09,960
like people are lobbying for things like

1327
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:12,300
aspergillus for their own reasons that

1328
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,039
are not for the benefit of this plant or

1329
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,180
this industry or organic growers in

1330
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,219
general

1331
00:44:15,179 --> 00:44:19,259
um is basically what I feel like I feel

1332
00:44:17,219 --> 00:44:21,480
like it shouldn't be long it doesn't

1333
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:23,040
belong um if they are in an assist on

1334
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:24,719
testing for aspergillus they need to at

1335
00:44:23,039 --> 00:44:26,579
least put a count on it not a pass or

1336
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:27,358
fail alive or dead

1337
00:44:26,579 --> 00:44:28,859
um

1338
00:44:27,358 --> 00:44:30,719
and then

1339
00:44:28,858 --> 00:44:32,940
yeah I feel like it just needs to be

1340
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:34,858
more understood I feel like there's more

1341
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:36,900
inconsistencies with Labs that like

1342
00:44:34,858 --> 00:44:38,639
example I can send 10 Lots out let's

1343
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,680
just say for for fun

1344
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:41,879
um two of them fail from aspergillus and

1345
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,440
that's the only thing I ever fail for

1346
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,880
when I do fail a test it'll fail for I

1347
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,500
ask for deals here and there

1348
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,940
um and it's inconsistent now again 10

1349
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:49,139
lots of the same strain growing the same

1350
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,159
room the same time

1351
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:52,679
um two of them will pop pop for

1352
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:54,059
astragalus I'll ask for a retest but

1353
00:44:52,679 --> 00:44:55,559
based off the other eight they'll give

1354
00:44:54,059 --> 00:44:57,420
me they'll approve a retest and then

1355
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:59,639
those two pass to the next Lab

1356
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:01,500
so there's not even a consistency on the

1357
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:03,239
lab side whatever essays are using to

1358
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,579
determine if it has aspergillus or not

1359
00:45:03,239 --> 00:45:07,078
so it's a super

1360
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:10,500
it's super frustrating for my

1361
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:13,380
perspective because an example is a or

1362
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:15,179
um good data is valuable all right so if

1363
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:17,519
you have good data it's valuable but bad

1364
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,899
data is very costly

1365
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,519
um we put a lot of responsibility on

1366
00:45:18,900 --> 00:45:22,440
these labs and we'd like to think that

1367
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:24,179
they're the the word of God that they're

1368
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:25,740
perfect but they're run by humans and

1369
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,358
they make mistakes too

1370
00:45:25,739 --> 00:45:29,219
um so I feel like the actualist testing

1371
00:45:27,358 --> 00:45:31,440
needs to be more consistent um is making

1372
00:45:29,219 --> 00:45:33,598
more sense um and orgs need to go away

1373
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,220
uh I think people need to quit arguing

1374
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,420
with each other online and I think we

1375
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:38,459
all need to kind of get together maybe

1376
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,539
pay some lobbyists pay some

1377
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:41,338
um some people who can write some things

1378
00:45:39,539 --> 00:45:43,139
into law and start getting those things

1379
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:44,578
taken off the docket because

1380
00:45:43,139 --> 00:45:45,900
um that's the only way people ask me all

1381
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:47,460
the time how do I help ask you just how

1382
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:49,260
do I stop failing passages what do I

1383
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:51,480
gotta do to pass fast food deals

1384
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:53,160
we gotta stop testing for aspergillus if

1385
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,500
you want to be profitable

1386
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:56,639
um it is efficiently or as much as

1387
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,199
possible

1388
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:59,879
um now as far as aspergillus some of the

1389
00:45:58,199 --> 00:46:01,199
things I have learned that can help

1390
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,039
people

1391
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:06,439
um

1392
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:09,300
one uh cover crops okay uh cover crops

1393
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:11,400
barrier over your soil all right so I

1394
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:13,680
think of like a clone dome in the Dome

1395
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:15,240
on the clone a dome so that they kind of

1396
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:16,919
cover your soil to keep it from gassing

1397
00:46:15,239 --> 00:46:19,139
out from spoilating it's not a perfect

1398
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:21,240
science it's not that it's 100 to keep

1399
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:22,920
everything in but it keeps sub down and

1400
00:46:21,239 --> 00:46:24,479
I say that because

1401
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,519
um really based off this last month I'll

1402
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:27,539
be honest um I seem to the for the

1403
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:29,159
eighth time

1404
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:31,199
um every time this time of year I tend

1405
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:33,000
to pop hot occasionally and this is the

1406
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,739
time of year I cut my cover cost back I

1407
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,900
talk about this um Every Spring I come

1408
00:46:34,739 --> 00:46:39,598
to cover across black back to minute to

1409
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:40,920
minimize any potential uh pest pressure

1410
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,300
getting in

1411
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:45,300
um but when I cut my cover crop back

1412
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:47,339
every time this year my fail rates go up

1413
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,200
um and things like after jail so I

1414
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:50,099
highly believe that your cover crops are

1415
00:46:49,199 --> 00:46:51,480
going to kind of do what they're

1416
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:53,160
supposed to do then create that mulch

1417
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,079
where all those living organisms could

1418
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:57,239
be sheltered and live happily

1419
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:00,300
um not blow up all over the place

1420
00:46:57,239 --> 00:47:01,979
um now Steve you're you're you're a hand

1421
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,099
watering guy I know this because we've

1422
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:07,139
talked about it do you think that the

1423
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:09,059
cover crop and there's definitely Pros

1424
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:10,259
to cover crops too so we're going to get

1425
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,699
into that but do you think the cover

1426
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:14,579
crop helps eliminate some of the

1427
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:16,739
splashing caused by hand watering that

1428
00:47:14,579 --> 00:47:19,740
might kick up more dust or kick up more

1429
00:47:16,739 --> 00:47:21,779
uh aspergillus onto the plant itself

1430
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:23,159
well I mean potentially like you think

1431
00:47:21,780 --> 00:47:25,380
about just like erosions it's going to

1432
00:47:23,159 --> 00:47:27,118
help protect from I mean erosion indoor

1433
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:29,160
erosion I guess so it's going to help

1434
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,920
protect the soil of surface

1435
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:33,480
um but the other thing is is being uh is

1436
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,000
good cleaning practices like we dress

1437
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:38,519
out I have I run sealed rooms with with

1438
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:39,539
with heavy filtration

1439
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:41,460
um

1440
00:47:39,539 --> 00:47:44,400
I make sure every breakdown I clean my

1441
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:46,079
room from top to bottom uh there's and

1442
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,180
then there's strange you can grow now I

1443
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,400
know it's past or fail

1444
00:47:48,179 --> 00:47:52,139
um for live or dead or whatever it's

1445
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,818
past or fail uh if you if you get caught

1446
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:55,078
with it but you gotta understand there's

1447
00:47:53,818 --> 00:47:56,699
certain strains that won't grow it

1448
00:47:55,079 --> 00:47:58,560
there's certain strains with certain

1449
00:47:56,699 --> 00:48:01,739
chirping profiles that are more

1450
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:04,799
anti-fungal um that do years of data

1451
00:48:01,739 --> 00:48:06,539
that we have little to uh almost no

1452
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,060
fails for certain chains anything with

1453
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:10,199
the limonene dominant profile is going

1454
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:13,858
to be your favorite thing to grow

1455
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:15,480
indoors uh it's far less likely to have

1456
00:48:13,858 --> 00:48:16,858
fail for molding yeast and or

1457
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:20,039
aspergillus

1458
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:22,199
um boom there you go you can have it uh

1459
00:48:20,039 --> 00:48:25,199
a lot of people all right guys you heard

1460
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:27,239
it here first before these Labs come out

1461
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:29,879
with the data to support this marker

1462
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:32,159
Steve just listed it on the podcast so

1463
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,059
we'll throw that out there it's one of

1464
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:35,279
the things that we look for when I'm

1465
00:48:33,059 --> 00:48:37,619
doing athenohana if I see laminating in

1466
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,180
the top three terpenes I know I have a

1467
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:41,818
higher probability of that strain

1468
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:44,519
getting it to Market again it's not

1469
00:48:41,818 --> 00:48:46,559
bulletproof but I could show you years

1470
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,019
of data like for example I miss X she's

1471
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:51,119
leads in limonene she has zero almost

1472
00:48:49,019 --> 00:48:52,380
like no fails compared to something like

1473
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,760
our lavender

1474
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:55,260
um that doesn't have any limousine in it

1475
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,540
that I can't even grow no more because I

1476
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:58,980
can't pass a mortgages test for it

1477
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,779
um so

1478
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,159
that's really interesting

1479
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:04,680
um and I love that you change out your

1480
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:06,480
cultivars based on how they perform from

1481
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:08,639
an IPM perspective because I think a lot

1482
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:11,460
of people chase these like high strains

1483
00:49:08,639 --> 00:49:13,440
and we'll keep growing them even though

1484
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:16,679
they don't have the environment to

1485
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:19,318
really successfully grow it so it's

1486
00:49:16,679 --> 00:49:22,139
possible it cost me a lot of money to to

1487
00:49:19,318 --> 00:49:24,000
learn those things I share yeah I tried

1488
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,920
growing lavender for years before I

1489
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:28,800
realized this this ain't the strength

1490
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,260
for indoor you know microbial tested

1491
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:33,839
products

1492
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:35,099
yeah and I do hear that there are some I

1493
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:37,679
mean what you listed were some of the

1494
00:49:35,099 --> 00:49:39,119
best cultural practices for reducing

1495
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:41,039
aspergillus because it's going to be

1496
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,660
everywhere if you're using compost

1497
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:43,858
you're going to have if you don't have a

1498
00:49:42,659 --> 00:49:46,259
sterile media you're going to have

1499
00:49:43,858 --> 00:49:48,119
aspergillus pretty much so it's just

1500
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:50,640
about keeping it off of the leaf surface

1501
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:53,338
and keeping the levels low enough that

1502
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:55,078
it's not it's not causing a problem

1503
00:49:53,338 --> 00:49:57,659
um and you listed a lot of really great

1504
00:49:55,079 --> 00:49:59,339
practices for that uh I will just add

1505
00:49:57,659 --> 00:50:01,559
there are certain products I believe

1506
00:49:59,338 --> 00:50:03,000
like uh trichoderm certain trichodermas

1507
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:05,818
like root Shield they can help with this

1508
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,260
too so that's another option for folks

1509
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:11,400
that are dealing with it as a problem

1510
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:13,680
but another product yeah for other like

1511
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,960
fungal pathogens like uh

1512
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,940
um you know I can't think anything right

1513
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:20,338
now but um never never for aspergillus

1514
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,920
that's a kind of a good thought

1515
00:50:20,338 --> 00:50:24,480
yeah yeah I was talking with uh Dr

1516
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:27,119
Michael brownbridge who I've had on the

1517
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:29,039
podcast and um he we had a separate

1518
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,420
email chain where he was listing some a

1519
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,338
lot of things that you said just some

1520
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:34,380
good cultural practices and then what

1521
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:37,920
products can we use to potentially lower

1522
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:40,260
it in our uh in our room so another one

1523
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:41,818
is looking at like food look at the food

1524
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,980
industry uh like a lot of the

1525
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:45,300
regulations that we face is based off of

1526
00:50:43,980 --> 00:50:47,159
the food industry it's been going on a

1527
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:49,440
lot longer than cannabis cultivation has

1528
00:50:47,159 --> 00:50:51,420
and uh a lot of the things that keeps

1529
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,159
food fresh and keeps food from spoiling

1530
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:56,099
and we'll also keep a cannabis from

1531
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:58,489
spoiling uh so cold temperatures at the

1532
00:50:56,099 --> 00:51:07,818
right time um is also really key

1533
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:10,199
