welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:18,750
science podcast

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,910
I'm your host tad hussy of kiss organics

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,710
this is the podcast where we discussed

6
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,689
the cutting edge of organic growing from

7
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:26,580
a science-based perspective and drawn

8
00:00:24,689 --> 00:00:27,990
top experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:30,928
share their wisdom and knowledge our

10
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,879
guest today is Ron Wallace Ron is a two

11
00:00:30,928 --> 00:00:34,769
time world record holder three-time

12
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,050
world champion and was the first grower

13
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:40,680
in the world to grow a pumpkin over 1500

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:43,169
pounds in 2006 and in 2012 he was the

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:46,500
first to eclipse the 2000 pound barrier

16
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:48,300
at 2009 pounds today he is regarded as

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,280
one of the world's premier giant pumpkin

18
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:52,409
growers he has appeared on many local

19
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,750
and national TV shows and been the

20
00:00:52,409 --> 00:00:58,729
subject of numerous books newspaper and

21
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,729
nationally recognized magazine articles

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:04,500
hey Ron thanks for coming on the show

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,228
today I really appreciate it it's great

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,969
to get to chat with you over the air hi

25
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,950
Ted yeah great to be on the show looking

26
00:01:08,969 --> 00:01:13,019
forward to it well let's start off

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,760
giving listeners a little bit of your

28
00:01:13,019 --> 00:01:18,959
personal history and how you got into

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,719
growing giant pumpkins sure well my dad

30
00:01:18,959 --> 00:01:25,228
was I believe the first person in New

31
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:27,420
England to grow giant pumpkins you know

32
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:29,609
and start talking about it competitively

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,579
and that was back in the in the early

34
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,590
80s he started doing it in his you know

35
00:01:32,578 --> 00:01:36,839
small backyard in West walk Rhode Island

36
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,570
back in those days there wasn't much

37
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,189
information on giant pumpkins out that

38
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:42,449
matter of fact it was none you had to

39
00:01:41,188 --> 00:01:44,879
get on the phone and try to call

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,719
somebody or write somebody a letter and

41
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:51,060
you know so he did it you know close to

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:54,780
10 years and then never really achieved

43
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,478
any success that he was looking for so

44
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,629
he kind of got out of them get out of

45
00:01:57,478 --> 00:02:04,140
the hobby at the time and I remember

46
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:06,539
back in 1992 and 93 I was at my parents

47
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,649
home for Christmas and somebody had

48
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,840
bought him a book how to grow

49
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:13,020
world-class giant pumpkins by dawn

50
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:14,879
Langevin so I read the whole book

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,560
the cover on Christmas Day and I said

52
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,479
you know we got to give this another

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,810
shot because now we have some

54
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:26,069
information that we can we can try to

55
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:29,159
use in a garden so since the early 90s

56
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:31,409
it's kind of been obsessive-compulsive

57
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:33,509
and education and knowledge trying to

58
00:02:31,409 --> 00:02:35,669
grow the world's biggest pumpkin so it's

59
00:02:33,509 --> 00:02:39,629
it's been a wild ride since the early

60
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:42,059
90s and you've actually had some success

61
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:44,039
in the giant pumpkin world can you talk

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,539
a little bit about where you started in

63
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:48,269
terms of what size your pumpkins were

64
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:50,429
and the genetics and how that sort of

65
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:53,670
evolved into eventually getting

66
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:57,689
literally the world record sure

67
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:59,989
well the genetics is what separates you

68
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:02,819
know this hobby and the networking

69
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:04,980
amongst the giant pumpkin community is

70
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:07,379
incredible it's like no other community

71
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:11,879
I've ever witnessed that's the reason

72
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:14,250
why we can take on 900 anywhere from 800

73
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,439
to a thousand square foot we're growing

74
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:19,860
pumpkins on the verge of heading towards

75
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:23,159
3,000 pounds I mean well records at 26

76
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,110
24 so it's been the genetics and a

77
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:27,000
sharing of knowledge and information and

78
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:29,820
all the genetic crosses that have taken

79
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,370
place since those early days that have

80
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,530
put us to this point and I was fortunate

81
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,120
to get a couple of really good you know

82
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,400
what you call hot seed stocks that

83
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:41,400
everybody everybody wanted in their day

84
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,960
and it enabled me to you know set a

85
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,939
couple of Guinness World Records and

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,830
some North American Championships but

87
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:49,560
it's it's been the work of the whole

88
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,360
community and when the internet evolved

89
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,969
in the early 90s and that's where I got

90
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,430
all my information from back then after

91
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:59,099
Don's books was getting on the internet

92
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,840
and talking to soil scientist if they

93
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,370
would talk to you know many would kind

94
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,080
of just hang up and brush me off if they

95
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:06,390
heard Ron Wallace was on the phone but

96
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,640
that kind of changed years later because

97
00:04:06,389 --> 00:04:10,289
a lot of those people seek us out now in

98
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:12,779
the community to see what we're doing

99
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:15,569
and how we're fertilizing and things

100
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,129
like that so it's pretty much been you

101
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:18,839
know the networking of the community the

102
00:04:17,129 --> 00:04:20,819
sharing of information the genetics

103
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:22,978
being a big one you know pruning

104
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:25,949
techniques you know being another one

105
00:04:22,978 --> 00:04:26,819
and you know right soil biology and

106
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:28,860
mycorrhizal on

107
00:04:26,819 --> 00:04:31,170
killings which have you know put parking

108
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,569
growing on the verge where if you don't

109
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:34,740
have 2,000 pound pumpkin you're probably

110
00:04:33,569 --> 00:04:36,659
not going to win the way off you're

111
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:39,150
going to and that's incredible thinking

112
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,960
that when we started out to be a member

113
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:45,269
of the 500 pound Club was something

114
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:48,089
everybody strobe you know scribe for and

115
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,919
then it was you know the 700 pound club

116
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:51,810
then it was oh my god a thousand pound

117
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,360
club and at the seminars that they had

118
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,250
in Canada at the time I used to get up

119
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,170
there and be one of two people or three

120
00:04:56,250 --> 00:05:00,060
people who grew a thousand-pound pumpkin

121
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,129
to be like oh my god I I really want to

122
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:05,670
be on that stage someday growing our

123
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:07,560
thousand pound pumpkin and now you know

124
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:10,890
with the right genetics and the right

125
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,870
system going on you know forty five

126
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:15,029
fifty days after you pollinate your

127
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,040
pumpkin there's a lot of pumpkins on the

128
00:05:15,029 --> 00:05:20,549
verge of a thousand pounds or more and

129
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:23,100
that's just incredible that's amazing I

130
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,829
so I've been trying my hand at it for

131
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:28,200
the last few years I've been fortunate

132
00:05:25,829 --> 00:05:30,300
enough to know Dona Geneva Emmons their

133
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,420
local to me and wonderful people and

134
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,160
then Ryan Ewing has been really generous

135
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:36,930
and sharing some of the genetics from

136
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,810
his squash and pumpkins and some of the

137
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:43,410
seeds that he has and I think a couple

138
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:46,379
years ago my record is 725 pounds but

139
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,390
I'm not doing all of the bearing all the

140
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:50,100
vines and doing all the training and

141
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:53,669
everything that really needs to be done

142
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:55,830
to really grow a huge giant but 725

143
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,230
pounds was a huge hit with the preschool

144
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:00,029
kids on the property and everyone that

145
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:02,160
came to the farm which is so blown away

146
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,779
by the pumpkin and I know it's not that

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,480
big compared to what you guys do but it

148
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:10,139
still was pretty pretty amazing for us

149
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:13,259
it was it was great well not everybody

150
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:16,110
gets involved in the Hobby is to try to

151
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:18,480
set set records I really wish I wasn't

152
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:21,090
so competitive you know I want all my

153
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,710
friends to do well and the network of

154
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,649
the family and the friends that we've

155
00:06:22,709 --> 00:06:28,620
made over the you know 25 plus years has

156
00:06:25,649 --> 00:06:31,169
been incredible but you know I swing for

157
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:33,149
the fences and a lot of people do and

158
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:34,740
Irish I wish I really wasn't that way

159
00:06:33,149 --> 00:06:36,539
it'd be a lot less pressure growing to

160
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,699
be honest with you but the majority the

161
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:39,960
people get involved in the hobby is to

162
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:41,879
get something

163
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:43,649
oh that they can be proud of put her out

164
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:45,659
in front of their house I get emails

165
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:48,299
pretty much every day I get somebody who

166
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:50,099
call me the other day in it it moves me

167
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,020
when he said that he was making memories

168
00:06:50,098 --> 00:06:55,379
with his grandson that are gonna last a

169
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:57,568
lifetime growing his giant pumpkin so

170
00:06:55,379 --> 00:07:00,240
there's there's far more people who you

171
00:06:57,569 --> 00:07:02,520
know still 700 pounds is a heck of an

172
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,910
accomplishment to grow something that

173
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:07,649
that big I bet people emailed me so it's

174
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,360
my first year I I didn't do that great

175
00:07:07,649 --> 00:07:12,359
I'd only had a thousand pounds I said

176
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,430
well that took us you know almost twelve

177
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,229
years and thousands of thousands of

178
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:19,050
dollars and hundreds and hundreds of

179
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:20,939
hours of back-breaking work to try to

180
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,530
achieve those results to let the

181
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,149
information the information is out there

182
00:07:22,529 --> 00:07:26,668
now and how to grow these giant pumpkins

183
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,929
there's no more secrets so there's a lot

184
00:07:26,668 --> 00:07:29,909
of people who went before other people

185
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,800
nowadays to put the information out

186
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:34,259
there on the internet but that there's

187
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,478
far more growing just to enjoy it and

188
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,120
have you know a pumpkin for their family

189
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:41,098
than it is somebody who's trying to set

190
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,860
a record and you'll notice you'll never

191
00:07:41,098 --> 00:07:45,930
hear me mention about winning money yes

192
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,210
there's money to be won if you went away

193
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:52,139
off and I've been fortunate to win some

194
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:54,870
but nobody grows giant pumpkins to has a

195
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:58,348
I set on winning cash prizes because

196
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:59,579
those are few and far between can you

197
00:07:58,348 --> 00:08:01,139
give a little bit about sort of the

198
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:03,000
history of the giant pumpkin community

199
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,780
in terms of where you guys started and

200
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,490
where you are now

201
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,739
I mean you've thrown a few numbers out

202
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:11,009
there but I don't know if listeners

203
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:13,978
realize how much how rapidly the

204
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:16,139
industry has evolved over the last even

205
00:08:13,978 --> 00:08:17,430
just the last decade and sort of how

206
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:21,569
your techniques have changed over that

207
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:23,699
time - sure well Howard dill a farmer in

208
00:08:21,569 --> 00:08:26,038
Nova Scotia is the one that we can

209
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:29,158
credit for coming up with the Dill's the

210
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:33,479
Dill's Atlantic giant you know so and

211
00:08:29,158 --> 00:08:37,250
how it was a he's a four-time four-time

212
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:41,669
world world champion and you know in the

213
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:43,620
late 70s and early 80's he was doing the

214
00:08:41,668 --> 00:08:46,919
painstaking work I'm making the genetic

215
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,690
crosses you know that we still enjoy

216
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,919
today they all all of these genes

217
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,410
although they're different they all

218
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:54,750
revert back to Howard dill in his early

219
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:56,279
and his early work you know once again

220
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:01,649
back at the time I think his world

221
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:05,970
record was 400 pounds somewhere in the

222
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:08,490
1980s early eighties somewhere and you

223
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,620
know like I said once the Internet you

224
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:12,029
know came upon you know people start to

225
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,490
figure out that you have to bury these

226
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:16,019
vines in order to get a double root

227
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,940
system because with him where the vines

228
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:19,980
run wherever there's a leaf stalk

229
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:21,540
there's a root that will that will pop

230
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,269
up through the top and you have to

231
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:26,610
stabilize the plant so where we've made

232
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:29,730
the biggest advances is the technique of

233
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:31,710
pruning and anybody who knows anything

234
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:34,230
knows pruning alters the state of a

235
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:36,720
plant and generally for good

236
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:39,629
it forces growth in different areas and

237
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,340
so we only let the side vines go so long

238
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:44,610
now now we kind of know what's between

239
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:47,850
12 and 15 feet on the side vine we we

240
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,800
pretty much have figured out that to try

241
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:52,139
to be a contender you need a plant in

242
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:53,879
the square foot range of probably seven

243
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:57,240
hundred to a thousand maybe even a

244
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:59,460
maximum a 1200 square foot so the vine

245
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:02,190
burying you know became one of the big

246
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,560
keys and the pruning and along with that

247
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,630
is you know how much kelp meal you know

248
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:08,399
grow has put about 15 pounds of kelp

249
00:10:06,629 --> 00:10:10,830
meal per thousand square foot in the

250
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,970
spring to offer a lot of micronutrients

251
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:17,340
and things like that the internet was

252
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:20,310
the first big push of the hobby in the

253
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:24,560
early 90s and then mycorrhizal fungi

254
00:10:20,309 --> 00:10:29,339
took giant pumpkins to a different level

255
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:31,259
you know back in around 2006 when I set

256
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:35,430
my first world record I started studying

257
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:39,080
mycorrhizae around 2003 2004 I started

258
00:10:35,429 --> 00:10:42,149
making phone calls and you know I found

259
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:44,730
Bob Linderman that I believe is Oregon

260
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:46,769
State University at the time when we

261
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:49,409
started educating me more on the

262
00:10:46,769 --> 00:10:55,789
benefits of it so I started studying it

263
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:58,319
I it and set a world record in 2006 and

264
00:10:55,789 --> 00:11:00,990
pretty much everybody today who's

265
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,480
growing competitively uses you know

266
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,509
mycorrhizal fungi either benefits

267
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,759
the benefits of it are endless and it

268
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:11,919
really helps us do what we got to do as

269
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:13,750
far as bringing water back to the hosts

270
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:15,129
and nutrients and people think

271
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,679
mycorrhizae is just about phosphorus

272
00:11:15,129 --> 00:11:19,629
it's not it's about water it's about

273
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:24,009
nutrients it's about a healthy root

274
00:11:19,629 --> 00:11:25,539
system so those have been the big the

275
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:27,100
big advancements and you know another

276
00:11:25,539 --> 00:11:31,269
one that goes in there as a sharing of

277
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:33,639
the seeds and the education of it is

278
00:11:31,269 --> 00:11:36,940
free because once again back in the day

279
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:38,350
people who were winning weren't letting

280
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,579
people know what they were doing and

281
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,620
back in the day the people who were

282
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:45,250
winning you know they were adding a lot

283
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,659
of compost and cow manure and yeah there

284
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,639
wasn't as many people growing as

285
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:50,289
nowadays not taking anything away from

286
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:51,850
him you know they were innovators they

287
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:55,659
had certain techniques that we still use

288
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:57,100
today but the internet took giant

289
00:11:55,659 --> 00:11:58,600
pumpkin grow into a whole different

290
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:01,120
level as far as the sharing and

291
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:06,579
knowledge and education and and all for

292
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:08,698
free so for a while there weren't giant

293
00:12:06,578 --> 00:12:11,289
pumpkin growers primarily growing

294
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:13,750
conventionally so using you know

295
00:12:11,289 --> 00:12:16,809
chemical nutrients mineral salts and

296
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:19,059
then started reincorporated in back some

297
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,979
of these biological additives you

298
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:25,299
mentioned mycorrhizal fungus I know some

299
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:27,370
people use compost teas and compost what

300
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,439
what that what was that point in time

301
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,799
and how did that transition sort of

302
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,949
increase the ability of the pumpkin of

303
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:38,139
the yields of these pumpkins well and

304
00:12:35,948 --> 00:12:40,809
that's a very good question because you

305
00:12:38,139 --> 00:12:43,208
know compost teas certainly is used you

306
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:45,189
know essentially I still find compost

307
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:47,859
tea requires a little bit more education

308
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:50,260
on our pot because there's a lot of

309
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,940
snake oil as you know out there so a lot

310
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:55,120
of a lot of people need to be educated

311
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:57,010
on compost teas but there's a very big

312
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,190
percentage of growers who are either

313
00:12:57,009 --> 00:13:02,470
using someone's or making their own so

314
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:04,360
that helps specifically but back in the

315
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:07,028
day all farming was was kind of

316
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:09,610
synthetics and you laid it down and and

317
00:13:07,028 --> 00:13:12,789
that was it so even major farming now

318
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:14,350
has changed whether you find that you

319
00:13:12,789 --> 00:13:16,719
know those fertilizers we will use him

320
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:18,279
we're killing the soil microbes and

321
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,560
because it was so heavy and so

322
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:22,419
and you know a lot of it is you know you

323
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:23,859
using potassium fertilizers that was the

324
00:13:22,419 --> 00:13:25,719
same as throwing rocks all on your

325
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:28,269
driveway in the winter to kill to get

326
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:31,450
rid of the ice and that's what people

327
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:33,309
were putting in the garden so what we

328
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:36,629
found over the years is that there needs

329
00:13:33,309 --> 00:13:39,669
to be a mix between some synthetic and

330
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:43,269
mostly biological most people's programs

331
00:13:39,669 --> 00:13:44,979
are probably 80% biological 20% kind of

332
00:13:43,269 --> 00:13:46,720
synthetic fertilizers because sometimes

333
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:49,570
you need that little extra push that a

334
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,790
synthetic will give you right away but

335
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:53,590
we've learned we've educated about we

336
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:57,099
feel like I tell people we feed our soil

337
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:59,680
and the soil feeds our plants we let the

338
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:02,470
microbes consume organic matter and

339
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:04,659
release it in the what I like to call a

340
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:08,050
micro rise fair right now area in and

341
00:14:04,659 --> 00:14:10,329
around the roots where no plants can use

342
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:12,309
it and you know it will only take what

343
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:14,800
it needs for nutrients like when you use

344
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:16,599
synthetics or something else it's you

345
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:17,979
know it's just like releasing pigs in a

346
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,019
buffet I like to say because they're

347
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:21,820
just going to eat eat and eat and that's

348
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:24,669
not the best thing at times to because

349
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:27,730
we strive for balance so within the last

350
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:29,439
technique specifically giant pumpkin

351
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:32,320
growers have sort of switched their

352
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,360
programs to more biologicals there's a

353
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,970
lot of asel sprawling you know being

354
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,460
used bacillus subtilis and things like

355
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:41,589
that you know I could go on and on but a

356
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:43,089
lot of growers they're all using it they

357
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,010
all have you know their own little

358
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:48,040
system or maybe some biologicals they

359
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:50,409
like humic folic acid pretty much used

360
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:53,379
by me every time I water or fertilize to

361
00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:55,679
help make nutrients more available helps

362
00:14:53,379 --> 00:14:57,939
feeds microbes so whenever I'm

363
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:59,709
fertilizing my plant I like to say once

364
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,710
again I'm fertilizing my soil to make

365
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:05,710
sure I get a good population of microbes

366
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:08,050
doing their thing now feel free to

367
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:11,740
correct me if I get this wrong but as it

368
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:13,479
was explained to me that one of the

369
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:15,730
issues that giant pumpkin growers were

370
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,310
having was because of the high amounts

371
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:20,470
of chemical fertilizers that were being

372
00:15:18,309 --> 00:15:22,559
used the plants were more prone to

373
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,220
cracking or splitting which is a

374
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:25,989
disqualification in the giant pumpkin

375
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:27,519
world for those of you that don't aren't

376
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,399
familiar with it if you have a crack or

377
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:32,350
split your pumpkin is is done for the

378
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,449
season but also you're more

379
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:36,370
open to diseases and things like that as

380
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:38,440
you're pushing this pumpkins so hard to

381
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:40,600
put on weight is that an accurate

382
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,270
statement yep that's all that's all

383
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,659
correct you know you can't push them too

384
00:15:43,269 --> 00:15:45,429
hard

385
00:15:43,659 --> 00:15:47,169
especially with you know like I said

386
00:15:45,429 --> 00:15:49,079
with synthetics and stuff like that and

387
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:52,870
yes you're more prone to disease because

388
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:55,570
Fusarium Pythium Rhizoctonia all those

389
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:58,210
things that you know cucurbits which are

390
00:15:55,570 --> 00:16:00,550
pumpkins they say you know plant like a

391
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:01,330
year on soil and then get off of it for

392
00:16:00,549 --> 00:16:03,639
five years

393
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:05,620
because that's how prone they are to

394
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:07,929
disease and I've had my handful of

395
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:11,139
disease problems here and continue to

396
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:14,500
monitor it and you know all of those

397
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:17,379
diseases I just mentioned love nitrogen

398
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,600
and water and as a giant pumpkin grower

399
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:23,950
you're pushing both but the nitrogen

400
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,920
that you get from using synthetics far

401
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:28,870
pushes you know nutrient you know even

402
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:31,000
deficiencies at was because once they

403
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,980
get bloated they tie up other nutrients

404
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,610
say that you'll be missing but they also

405
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:39,820
help push disease too so we backed off

406
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:42,519
that yes but the splitting you know

407
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:44,530
whether it's a small crack that gets in

408
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:46,720
or in a ring what we call a dill ring in

409
00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:49,259
a pumpkin where a pumpkin grows so fast

410
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,850
they get cross-sections and little split

411
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:53,559
stem splits used to be prevalent years

412
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:55,060
and years ago and I think a big part of

413
00:16:53,559 --> 00:16:57,129
that was genetics number one and number

414
00:16:55,059 --> 00:17:00,129
two was the use of synthetic so that

415
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:01,720
that's kind of been eliminated a bit

416
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:04,029
from the hobby you don't see many stem

417
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,500
splits anymore because people won't grow

418
00:17:04,029 --> 00:17:07,930
them next year that's what I've been one

419
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:10,779
of the great things about chat rooms and

420
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:13,299
in the internet is you see what these

421
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,950
pumpkin seeds are growing and if you

422
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:16,750
don't like the shape or if you're a

423
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:19,240
color person you don't like the color or

424
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:21,400
that had a bad stem you just won't plant

425
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:24,640
it next year and it keeps sort of those

426
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:27,340
bad traits out of the hobby but yeah

427
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,020
definitely we've noticed that we've been

428
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,869
able to get more pumpkins to the scale

429
00:17:29,019 --> 00:17:34,240
since we've since we've imported more of

430
00:17:31,869 --> 00:17:36,549
an organic approach to it not to say

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,210
that any of us are strictly organic

432
00:17:36,549 --> 00:17:42,430
there are some people who grow that way

433
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:44,620
it's possible but in in our area where

434
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,480
it's you know like today's 92 degrees

435
00:17:44,619 --> 00:17:47,579
all the

436
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,039
80% humidity and tonight the low will be

437
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:52,678
70 degrees that we humid all night you

438
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:54,389
have to work in some chemicals on

439
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:57,720
occasion or you'll never make it to the

440
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:59,250
end of the season yeah you know I grow

441
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,339
organically because that's sort of our

442
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:04,950
philosophy but I get powdery mildew

443
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:08,220
every year which I know you know is

444
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:10,169
affecting my overall yield but I'm not

445
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:12,690
going for a world record either so it's

446
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:14,280
a very different situation it sounds

447
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:16,289
like it's a sort of a common a hybrid

448
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:18,960
approach that's really allowing you to

449
00:18:16,289 --> 00:18:20,750
maximize plant growth and we actually

450
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:22,919
see this with the cannabis industry to

451
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:24,539
some of the biggest yields I've seen

452
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:28,259
have been sort of that combination of

453
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:29,668
biologicals and chemicals yes and that's

454
00:18:28,259 --> 00:18:33,690
definitely what that's definitely what's

455
00:18:29,669 --> 00:18:35,610
happening in our in our hobby it's a

456
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,990
combination too because you know when

457
00:18:35,609 --> 00:18:38,609
you need to color up if you've got

458
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,710
something going on like right now we got

459
00:18:38,609 --> 00:18:43,349
what we call fruit load stress these

460
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:45,390
pumpkins are approaching if they're

461
00:18:43,349 --> 00:18:47,699
going to be an all-star they got to be

462
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:51,000
hit in between 30 and 50 plus pounds a

463
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,860
day for the next month and if you notice

464
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,200
you start to get a little lime green or

465
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:57,178
you stop the tie ups and nutrients or

466
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,090
you know if you've got to go to the whip

467
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:03,030
and color them up you know that's not

468
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:06,329
gonna happen you know you could only

469
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:08,730
feed the soil so much you have to pop in

470
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:11,759
some synthetics to get it to green up

471
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:14,039
and but it's such a small amount

472
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:16,230
compared to what it used to be so yes

473
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:17,759
the biggest yields we're finding is

474
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:19,349
people who are combining both and

475
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:21,629
there's plenty of studies out on the

476
00:19:19,349 --> 00:19:24,298
internet using biologicals in

477
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,820
combination with synthetic fertilizers

478
00:19:24,298 --> 00:19:28,740
where now you know a lot of you know a

479
00:19:26,819 --> 00:19:30,149
lot of technology and the papers and

480
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:31,890
field trials that they're doing are

481
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:34,950
coming out saying that the yields were

482
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:37,559
increased using both in combination

483
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:39,179
maybe 80 20 or something like that I

484
00:19:37,558 --> 00:19:41,039
know a lot of people who grow strictly

485
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,540
organic you know don't want to hear that

486
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,789
but the results are out there now where

487
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:47,970
you can see combining them both in the

488
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:49,470
program works it works a bit better but

489
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,850
it's all in what you want to go after

490
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,220
you know people who will grow in

491
00:19:50,849 --> 00:19:55,589
medicine there's a huge market for

492
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:59,100
strictly organic and they should stay

493
00:19:55,589 --> 00:20:00,839
that way you know people who just want

494
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:03,269
and yield and they go about it a

495
00:20:00,839 --> 00:20:05,459
different way well and I think you

496
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:07,528
really hit on an important point there

497
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,870
when you said that you would everyone

498
00:20:07,528 --> 00:20:11,759
was reducing the amount of synthetic

499
00:20:09,869 --> 00:20:13,798
inputs that they were they were adding

500
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,980
into their patch and that's something

501
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:19,288
that is a goal for for myself as an

502
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,149
organic grower is to help people in

503
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:23,638
making that transition and get people to

504
00:20:21,148 --> 00:20:25,288
use less chemical nutrients so the fact

505
00:20:23,638 --> 00:20:27,599
that these biologicals are not only

506
00:20:25,288 --> 00:20:29,278
better for the planet but also better

507
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:31,439
for your plant and allows you to reduce

508
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:34,250
your inputs on the chemical scient I

509
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:38,038
think is is really important all right

510
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:40,470
it's a fact and it works especially now

511
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:42,628
there's the stuff that's that snake oil

512
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:45,538
you know it may come on the market with

513
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:47,339
a great marketing pitch and fancy labels

514
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:48,869
and stuff like that but growers are

515
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:50,278
smart nowadays no matter what you're

516
00:20:48,869 --> 00:20:52,699
growing whether you're growing flowers

517
00:20:50,278 --> 00:20:55,259
vegetables cannabis or giant pumpkins

518
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,788
the word gets out they pretty quick if

519
00:20:55,259 --> 00:20:58,829
the stuff doesn't work and people are

520
00:20:56,788 --> 00:21:00,179
really good at looking at labels now so

521
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:03,148
if you look on there and your main

522
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,610
ingredient is less than 1% of 0.001 of

523
00:21:03,148 --> 00:21:07,619
something that's very very reasonable

524
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:09,869
like a lot of people add you know shima

525
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,459
Kassadin as a base to a lot of this

526
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:13,079
stuff because it makes the water come

527
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,850
out nice and brown and everybody thinks

528
00:21:13,079 --> 00:21:16,470
wow look at that look at all rich it is

529
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:17,668
but then when you get to educate

530
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:19,558
yourself and you read the label say I

531
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:23,009
just paid it I just paid this for a

532
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:26,250
quarter humic acid that's ridiculous so

533
00:21:23,009 --> 00:21:27,870
people get shot real quick as they

534
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,190
should be nowadays that the information

535
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,678
is out there what you know what kind of

536
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,669
works and what doesn't

537
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:34,740
yeah I think that's an important point

538
00:21:32,669 --> 00:21:37,528
because this really is for you guys a

539
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,440
passion it's a sport and sort of an act

540
00:21:37,528 --> 00:21:42,179
of love you know it's it's not making

541
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,919
you any money you're really doing it

542
00:21:42,179 --> 00:21:45,450
because you enjoy it so you have to make

543
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,129
sure you follow a budget so you're not

544
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,308
spending all your money on these on your

545
00:21:47,128 --> 00:21:52,469
pumpkin patch I I read on big pumpkins

546
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,638
calm about all the people and all the

547
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:56,009
jokes that are made about how much

548
00:21:53,638 --> 00:21:57,449
people love to spend on their patch and

549
00:21:56,009 --> 00:22:00,659
how much time they spend out there it's

550
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,639
it's pretty entertaining yet you know

551
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,350
right now at this time of the year I'm

552
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:06,058
doing eight plants this year which is

553
00:22:04,349 --> 00:22:08,038
too many I have to go back to four to

554
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:11,158
five because it's just it's just too

555
00:22:08,038 --> 00:22:13,289
much you know I'm I'm 40 hours a week

556
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,780
out here to grow a poor

557
00:22:13,289 --> 00:22:18,000
some people will put 40 hours in on four

558
00:22:15,779 --> 00:22:20,220
plants or three I mean a lot of people

559
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,559
you get very very obsessive compulsive

560
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:24,779
with with doing this and yeah you can

561
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,970
spend you can spend an awful lot of

562
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:29,670
money doing this or you can get away

563
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:31,890
with some you know rudimentary skills

564
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:33,870
and go see a friend down the street or

565
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,430
less free compost and you can do well

566
00:22:33,869 --> 00:22:38,129
too so it's just one of those things

567
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:39,509
probably like your community you kind of

568
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:42,750
get out of it what you put into it

569
00:22:39,509 --> 00:22:44,789
anybody who's won these major way off

570
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,319
snow or something yeah they weren't

571
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:48,089
doing it by spending one or two hundred

572
00:22:46,319 --> 00:22:49,649
dollars for the season to grow their

573
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:53,250
pumpkins you know they they made some

574
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:55,110
sort of investment other than time but

575
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:57,500
you can like I said you can put as much

576
00:22:55,109 --> 00:23:00,869
into it or as little into it as you want

577
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:03,980
and still have you know some success but

578
00:23:00,869 --> 00:23:06,059
the people who are doing it consistently

579
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:09,450
there are investing a little bit more

580
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:10,619
than time all right so you mentioned

581
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,240
some of these things that you're using

582
00:23:10,619 --> 00:23:14,819
in your patch and some of these

583
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,380
techniques that apply to giant pumpkins

584
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:18,059
and I'm just wondering how might we

585
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:20,010
apply some of that knowledge to growing

586
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:21,990
cannabis so you and I just talked a

587
00:23:20,009 --> 00:23:23,940
little bit off air about watering and

588
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:26,549
how important watering is can you touch

589
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:30,480
on that and how how it affects overall

590
00:23:26,549 --> 00:23:32,759
yield sure our giant pumpkins here right

591
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:36,360
now my giant pumpkins you know around

592
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:38,309
for you know 400 500 pounds and like I

593
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:39,719
mentioned they're there at that stage

594
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:42,720
now or if they're going to be a stud

595
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,930
they got to start doing you know 38 to

596
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,850
50-plus pounds a day for a month so

597
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,980
having said that is you need water to

598
00:23:47,849 --> 00:23:52,049
achieve that so I have an overhead

599
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,769
watering system I do a lot of watering

600
00:23:52,049 --> 00:23:59,339
by hand I have 275 gallon totes where

601
00:23:55,769 --> 00:24:01,200
any biologicals or any fertilizers I can

602
00:23:59,339 --> 00:24:03,539
put right in a tow and I can hand water

603
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,059
and drench what I call a drench drench

604
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:07,920
the plants myself but these pumpkins

605
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:10,409
right now at getting close to a hundred

606
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,840
gallons of water a day seven days a week

607
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:15,210
we've had no rain in New England here

608
00:24:12,839 --> 00:24:17,429
this season other than really early in

609
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,890
the spring so we have to be consistent

610
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:22,350
with our watering so I don't know how

611
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:24,390
that is in your community but our

612
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:26,159
watering has to be that you can't skip

613
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:26,630
well I'm not going to worry about water

614
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,340
today

615
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:30,680
hey I'm going to Beach with my friends

616
00:24:28,339 --> 00:24:32,599
you know most of us have an automated

617
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:35,570
irrigation system that will go on and

618
00:24:32,599 --> 00:24:37,730
off on its own me I'm home so I do have

619
00:24:35,569 --> 00:24:39,829
an automated system but I choose to run

620
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:42,500
up myself where I'll have water twice a

621
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:44,689
day they'll get 50 gallons by around

622
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:47,180
11:00 11:30 in the morning I wait till

623
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:49,759
the plants a dry one of the worst things

624
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,590
you can do is water any plant whether it

625
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:54,319
be vegetable God and cannabis or

626
00:24:51,589 --> 00:24:55,819
anything especially in the morning

627
00:24:54,319 --> 00:24:57,889
especially if you're outside with this

628
00:24:55,819 --> 00:24:59,839
dew on the leaves and then you start

629
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:01,400
watering especially overhead if you have

630
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:03,679
any mold spores you're just going to

631
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:05,690
blow them all over to all your plants so

632
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:08,090
it's best to let your plants dry so I

633
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,970
opted for kind of late morning to water

634
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,709
my plants so around 11:00 11:30 that

635
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,390
water will kick on then I'll come back

636
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:17,720
at the hottest time of the day right

637
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:20,390
around 2:30 2:30 to 3:00 o'clock I can

638
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:23,870
you know I run 6 overhead sprinklers at

639
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:26,330
one time and you know in 25 30 minutes I

640
00:25:23,869 --> 00:25:28,459
can pump out another 50 gallons per

641
00:25:26,329 --> 00:25:30,949
plant so I can do about 300 gallons and

642
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,650
in that time frame boat we find watering

643
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:36,590
has to be consistent has to be there

644
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:38,290
every single day you know if you get you

645
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:40,819
know 1 to 3 inches of rain

646
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:42,230
you can back off for a few days and

647
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:43,609
hopefully you don't get too much rain

648
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,579
because that's another thing we find if

649
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:49,639
you let the soil go dry and you take a

650
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:52,099
big big rainstorm you could explode your

651
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:54,170
pumpkins because now they were deprived

652
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:55,819
of water and now there's so many roots

653
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,210
and then they're just sucking up water

654
00:25:55,819 --> 00:26:01,899
and you can have problems so we really

655
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:04,700
need to be consistent with our watering

656
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:07,009
yea because one of the things you're

657
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,660
finding too is without this consistency

658
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:10,549
you're losing yield which i think is the

659
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:12,650
big tick to take away for cannabis

660
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:14,690
growers is water stress whether

661
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:16,370
overwater or underwater watering is

662
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:18,980
going to affect your plants

663
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:21,939
accessibility susceptibility to disease

664
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:24,950
and also its ability to maximize yield

665
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:28,130
yeah there's a fine line on the watering

666
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:31,610
and believe me I pushed it too much many

667
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,920
a times because you know when it's

668
00:26:31,609 --> 00:26:35,419
really hot and really humid especially

669
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,850
if you're growing outdoors what the root

670
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,019
system does is it kind of shuts down

671
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:42,449
because what it's doing is its protect

672
00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:45,029
at least Amata it's protecting what you

673
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:47,190
call going up the chimney where your

674
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:48,509
vapor loss in your your water loss goes

675
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:50,039
right out through the stomata of the

676
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,720
leaves so when you're hot and humid the

677
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:53,039
plant protects itself so the roots kind

678
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:55,620
of close it down so you have to be

679
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,210
careful we do what you know watering a

680
00:26:55,619 --> 00:26:59,549
lot at that time because now your roots

681
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:01,079
are just going to sit there in water the

682
00:26:59,549 --> 00:27:03,450
longer they sit there in water without

683
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:06,449
working actively then you open yourself

684
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:09,690
up for Pythium water molds things like

685
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,549
that but I found with consistency of of

686
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:13,710
having a pumpkin what we call weighing

687
00:27:11,549 --> 00:27:15,149
over the charts away non chart there's a

688
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:17,610
chart that we go by as to what your

689
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:20,370
pumpkins should weigh by inches it's

690
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:23,609
very very good shot it's very very close

691
00:27:20,369 --> 00:27:26,279
in weight I fortunately have had many

692
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:28,169
that have gone over the charts which is

693
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,089
a good sign and that all comes from

694
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:33,390
genetics do you play some role in that

695
00:27:30,089 --> 00:27:34,889
but it's watering once I started

696
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:37,200
watering a little more a few years ago

697
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:40,620
my pumpkins consistently started to

698
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,910
weigh more than what they should because

699
00:27:40,619 --> 00:27:43,589
they're all work their water weight it

700
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:46,230
only makes sense but once again this is

701
00:27:43,589 --> 00:27:48,959
a fine line as to am i adding too much

702
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:51,690
water or am i adding enough water it's

703
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,940
are very very very narrow so watering is

704
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:57,120
something that all gardeners no matter

705
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,320
what you're growing need to get dialed

706
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,059
in on what works

707
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,009
I have sandy wound soil here in New

708
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,240
England and people tell me all the time

709
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,069
hey how many gallons of water you're

710
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,900
riding well if I'm adding 100 gallons if

711
00:28:05,069 --> 00:28:08,730
you're in Pennsylvania so when you have

712
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:11,130
a heavy clay soil that might be twice

713
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:13,140
the amount of water you need so I'm

714
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:16,500
always very leery to give watering

715
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:19,500
amounts or fertilizing the mouse I push

716
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,960
with boron a lot but boron rhymes with

717
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:24,509
[ __ ] and and you can go toxic with

718
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,579
boron really quick but in my sandy loam

719
00:28:24,509 --> 00:28:29,129
soil boron is tough to keep the levels

720
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:32,000
up I need boron for cell division cell

721
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:34,830
elongation so I have to use borax

722
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,450
sometimes twice a week and a pretty high

723
00:28:34,829 --> 00:28:38,460
amount and I don't let that amount out

724
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:40,710
to anybody not to be secretive but I

725
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:43,140
don't want anybody doing damage to their

726
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:46,079
plants and getting toxicity because I've

727
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:49,140
been tissue testing for 25 years and I

728
00:28:46,079 --> 00:28:50,939
kind of know what my plants need so I

729
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,890
find every Gardens different and maybe

730
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,920
in your community that's the same thing

731
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:55,900
a lot of growers are always

732
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:58,000
asking somebody you know hey what are

733
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,590
you doing it makes you always look this

734
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,839
good and somebody said well I use this

735
00:28:59,589 --> 00:29:03,399
product and somebody says ok that that's

736
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,649
going to be the magic bullet well is

737
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:08,320
there's really no one magic bullet but

738
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:11,830
that person set up their lighting their

739
00:29:08,319 --> 00:29:13,149
watering the drip system you know I find

740
00:29:11,829 --> 00:29:14,379
that people who are successful doing

741
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:18,580
anything there's more than one thing

742
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:20,830
there's a whole program you know I hear

743
00:29:18,579 --> 00:29:23,769
that a lot where people will be like you

744
00:29:20,829 --> 00:29:25,480
gotta try product X it's it's the one

745
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,730
thing that saved my garden or made me

746
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,250
put on yield or it's a magic bullet yeah

747
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:31,900
but one thing that you alluded to there

748
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,970
was that you're doing tissue testing

749
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,960
you're doing soil testing and that's

750
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,850
something I want to talk a little more

751
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,980
about but really it comes down to any

752
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:41,259
deficiency so if that magic bullet

753
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:43,779
product is the limiting growth factor in

754
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:45,609
the soil or in that plant then yeah

755
00:29:43,779 --> 00:29:47,200
you're gonna get amazing results but if

756
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,089
it's not like if your soil is already

757
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,559
high in potassium and this product is

758
00:29:49,089 --> 00:29:53,289
high in potassium you're going to

759
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,569
actually potentially do something that's

760
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:57,250
detrimental for your plant so I think

761
00:29:55,569 --> 00:30:00,279
that's a really important point that you

762
00:29:57,250 --> 00:30:02,500
brought up that yeah I see that all the

763
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:03,460
time and somebody else said to me hey

764
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,160
what do you think of this product

765
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:08,230
so-and-so uses it I'm like okay well I

766
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:10,480
have respect for that person but

767
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:12,640
so-and-so has low potassium and they've

768
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,680
gotten and I try to teach people what

769
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,140
you'd be surprised how many people don't

770
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:20,380
know how to read a fertilizer label what

771
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:21,910
the three numbers mean and if you're

772
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,470
high in potassium like you said you're

773
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:27,130
putting potassium down to begin with

774
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:30,759
potassium is like the dominant dog you

775
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:32,770
know it is it's a number one thing that

776
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:34,960
gets in the X element a root system and

777
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:36,849
the leaf system of plant quicker and

778
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,470
faster than anything so if your

779
00:30:36,849 --> 00:30:41,230
potassium sigh you'd know you're

780
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:43,440
blocking out magnesium and once your

781
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:45,819
plants top the yellow a bit you know

782
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:49,769
magnesium sulfur is a deficiency that's

783
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:53,230
been caused by excess potassium so I

784
00:30:49,769 --> 00:30:55,059
couldn't stress that more I don't know

785
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:57,670
how the tissue testing goes in the

786
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:59,349
cannabis industry but I'm sure now with

787
00:30:57,670 --> 00:31:01,420
the explosion of it that there's going

788
00:30:59,349 --> 00:31:04,149
to be lad specifically testing for it

789
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:06,910
and I once you touched your garden so

790
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:07,298
many times I can tell a lot of times by

791
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:09,399
looking

792
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:12,668
what the deficiency is because I've been

793
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:14,888
in the same Gardens for 25 years and I

794
00:31:12,669 --> 00:31:16,840
find the soil and the tissue test don't

795
00:31:14,888 --> 00:31:18,339
vary too much in a year I tissue test

796
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:20,470
every two weeks at this time of the year

797
00:31:18,339 --> 00:31:22,388
now my last tissue test will probably be

798
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:23,889
around the 1st of September and that's

799
00:31:22,388 --> 00:31:26,738
pretty much enough for me to take it

800
00:31:23,888 --> 00:31:28,418
home but until you really get dialed in

801
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:30,429
as to what's going on in your garden

802
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:32,440
then it really doesn't make sense to

803
00:31:30,429 --> 00:31:33,730
know what's going on in a guy you know

804
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,850
I'm in the East Coast you're on the west

805
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:38,409
coast we're both growing cannabis but I

806
00:31:36,849 --> 00:31:41,648
don't know what your conditions are so

807
00:31:38,409 --> 00:31:43,450
it's tough for me to educate somebody

808
00:31:41,648 --> 00:31:45,069
until they get dialed in in their own

809
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:47,739
patch and a good way of doing that is

810
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:49,269
with the you know tissue tissue testings

811
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:51,340
people tell me well I saw I'll test it

812
00:31:49,269 --> 00:31:53,108
the other day well soil is only going to

813
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:54,459
tell you what's available what's there

814
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:56,168
the tissue test is going to tell you

815
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,608
what's going up the plant and that's the

816
00:31:56,169 --> 00:31:59,139
most important thing at the stage we're

817
00:31:57,608 --> 00:32:02,678
at right now we're on pumpkins it's

818
00:31:59,138 --> 00:32:04,178
about tissue testing yeah it's a little

819
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:06,580
challenging with cannabis for a couple

820
00:32:04,179 --> 00:32:08,440
reasons so one the big challenge is not

821
00:32:06,579 --> 00:32:10,989
a lot of labs will do tissue testing on

822
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,960
cannabis because it is still federally

823
00:32:10,989 --> 00:32:16,269
illegal so you can't mail samples in for

824
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:18,940
example so that's one challenge the

825
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:22,179
other challenge is that a lot of growers

826
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:25,179
don't know how to interpret soil tests

827
00:32:22,179 --> 00:32:28,210
or tissue tests so the one of the tests

828
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:30,249
that we now sell is an artificial resin

829
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:31,690
test from this company called soil savvy

830
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:34,239
and what it is is it shows what the

831
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:37,210
plant potentially could take up over a

832
00:32:34,239 --> 00:32:38,858
period of five days so the advantage of

833
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:40,960
that being it gives you a little better

834
00:32:38,858 --> 00:32:43,118
idea of what the plant is able to take

835
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,679
out of the soil versus say like a male

836
00:32:43,118 --> 00:32:46,959
like three tests that will just tell us

837
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:50,080
everything that's in the soil but not

838
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,909
what's available to the plant so that's

839
00:32:50,079 --> 00:32:53,558
that's a good point there that you

840
00:32:51,909 --> 00:32:56,019
brought up regarding regarding testing

841
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:59,710
so what you're doing is a combination of

842
00:32:56,019 --> 00:33:02,769
soil testing chemical fertilizers in

843
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:04,989
small amounts and then biologicals is

844
00:33:02,769 --> 00:33:07,480
that is that pretty accurate that that's

845
00:33:04,989 --> 00:33:09,579
a hundred percent accurate and like I

846
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,929
said the biologicals have been huge for

847
00:33:09,579 --> 00:33:15,638
us and you know specifically in the last

848
00:33:12,929 --> 00:33:17,470
you know you know maybe about ten years

849
00:33:15,638 --> 00:33:20,258
ago it started to get a big push because

850
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,600
you remember for years you know even

851
00:33:20,259 --> 00:33:23,319
fine

852
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:26,388
didn't get much credit to biologicals

853
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:28,759
now everybody knows the important role

854
00:33:26,388 --> 00:33:31,668
that they play in your garden so yeah

855
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,099
biological is a huge you know for us and

856
00:33:31,669 --> 00:33:35,990
the combination of them and you know no

857
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:38,119
one's ever burnt their plants I'll put

858
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,679
on biologicals and then walk away the

859
00:33:38,119 --> 00:33:42,739
next day and came out and had fertilizer

860
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,480
burn so bad that you that it affected

861
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,919
you yield from biologicals you know

862
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,659
biological is a little bit goes a long

863
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:50,240
way to it's all about you know

864
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:52,879
multiplying colonies in your soil and it

865
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:56,028
takes time I can tell people all the

866
00:33:52,878 --> 00:33:58,609
time now it you got to stop biologicals

867
00:33:56,028 --> 00:34:00,349
early because if you do have a if you do

868
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:02,298
have a problem yeah it's like taking a

869
00:34:00,349 --> 00:34:04,519
knife to a gunfight point at some point

870
00:34:02,298 --> 00:34:05,808
you can't come in with biologicals when

871
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:08,659
you have a problem you can't start

872
00:34:05,808 --> 00:34:10,338
midway in the cycle of the season yeah

873
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:11,780
it's better than nothing you know if you

874
00:34:10,338 --> 00:34:13,190
have no choice you can start at them but

875
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:15,139
if you stop them right from the

876
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:17,358
beginning right right out of the box

877
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:19,309
right into the soil that's that's how

878
00:34:17,358 --> 00:34:23,108
you start with you know mycorrhizae and

879
00:34:19,309 --> 00:34:23,108
any biological is when the plants small

880
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:28,969
so what are you using exactly in your

881
00:34:27,349 --> 00:34:31,059
garden right now you mentioned humic and

882
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:34,459
fulvic acid

883
00:34:31,059 --> 00:34:36,980
you mentioned potentially compost teas

884
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:39,679
and mycorrhizal fungus what sorts of

885
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:41,240
things are you using in your patch I use

886
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,409
a lot of seaweed a lot of seaweed powder

887
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:47,148
and you know I have a tremendous one you

888
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:49,608
know my site that I use pretty much

889
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:51,858
every watering as humic fall of it and

890
00:34:49,608 --> 00:34:54,108
seaweed in it I mean seaweeds one of the

891
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:56,779
best overall things you can feed your

892
00:34:54,108 --> 00:34:58,159
plants because of the you know trace

893
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,950
minerals and nutrients it helps

894
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:02,929
remineralize your soil that's one of the

895
00:35:00,949 --> 00:35:04,848
best things that you can use and and I

896
00:35:02,929 --> 00:35:07,789
use that pretty much everyone I opt to

897
00:35:04,849 --> 00:35:09,829
feed daily and spoon-feed rather and put

898
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:13,009
on a heavy dose once or twice a week so

899
00:35:09,829 --> 00:35:16,190
every day I'm feeding I use a lot of

900
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:17,540
l-amino acids is a great product out

901
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,050
there from growth products called

902
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:22,608
essential essential and companion

903
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:25,789
companions bacillus subtilis which is a

904
00:35:22,608 --> 00:35:28,039
great you know biological to help shield

905
00:35:25,789 --> 00:35:30,279
roots for diseases those two are like my

906
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:33,909
peanut butter and jelly they go together

907
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,730
every two weeks every 14 maybe 17 days

908
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:39,818
I'm going on with a drench of those two

909
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:40,690
you know biologicals and there they're

910
00:35:39,818 --> 00:35:44,318
tremendous

911
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:46,838
also in that drench I'll use a Zoe's

912
00:35:44,318 --> 00:35:49,538
from extreme gardening you know azo

913
00:35:46,838 --> 00:35:53,739
Sperling I mean it's a tremendous fixer

914
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:55,690
of atmospheric nitrogen but another

915
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:57,788
benefit of it is it helps plants create

916
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,329
that natural growth hormone indole-3

917
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:02,859
acidic acid it it promotes that

918
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:05,589
naturally in the plant that's the

919
00:36:02,858 --> 00:36:08,019
biggest benefit to me because the more

920
00:36:05,588 --> 00:36:09,909
roots that you have that it creates the

921
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:12,579
more roots the more areas you have for

922
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:17,199
inoculation by your mycorrhizal fungi so

923
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:20,440
it's a total whole program you know I

924
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:22,358
also use you know like epsom salts you

925
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,190
know I take up many home gardeners know

926
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:26,920
by now it's not just for soaking your

927
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:30,730
feet as a sauce you know applies a quick

928
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:32,440
shot of magnesium and sulfur and my

929
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:34,240
potassium gets a little high in my soil

930
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,880
I made the mistake of adding too much

931
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:41,229
compost last fall so I paid the price so

932
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,150
far this season by tying up nutrients so

933
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:44,949
if I need to need add some quick a quick

934
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:47,740
shot of sulfur and some magnesium

935
00:36:44,949 --> 00:36:51,639
there's nothing better or more realistic

936
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:54,068
in price than M some salts so so I use a

937
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:55,239
lot of fish you know seaweed powdered

938
00:36:54,068 --> 00:36:57,250
seaweed you know I call it fish

939
00:36:55,239 --> 00:36:59,649
efficient seaweed it's a mixture of the

940
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:02,440
two humic folic acid and those

941
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:04,778
biological as I mentioned pretty much

942
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,760
they're in my program once a week I'm

943
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:09,699
doing that and some of the other ones

944
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:11,410
I'm doing like the companion and

945
00:37:09,699 --> 00:37:14,469
essential every two weeks that's by

946
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:15,818
labeled rate it was there's no need of

947
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:17,199
putting it on more than label rate

948
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:18,639
because you know some of that stuff can

949
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:20,769
get costly you don't want to waste money

950
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:23,230
but without ever expanding root system

951
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:25,150
on our plant we need to apply it a

952
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:27,429
little more often if you're growing in

953
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,338
like it seems to be like out in New

954
00:37:27,429 --> 00:37:32,230
England the legal cannabis growers grow

955
00:37:30,338 --> 00:37:35,230
12 plants and pretty much everybody

956
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:37,358
grows in between a 5 gallon 15 gallon

957
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:39,068
pot seems to be the home gardener here

958
00:37:37,358 --> 00:37:41,858
to probably do it a little less because

959
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:45,759
your roots are contained our root system

960
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:46,659
is so vast and we'll find roots you know

961
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,970
tens

962
00:37:46,659 --> 00:37:51,219
out past where the vines are in our

963
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:53,589
garden and there'll be no leaf or vying

964
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:56,349
around within ten foot those those roots

965
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:57,789
are just racing past a plant and you

966
00:37:56,349 --> 00:37:59,829
know they're looking for they're looking

967
00:37:57,789 --> 00:38:01,570
for water and nutrients so we have to

968
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:03,190
you know we probably have to cut the

969
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:04,860
rate down a little bit and drink a

970
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:08,470
little bit more with that stuff but

971
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:12,010
that's a pretty much the basis of my

972
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:14,289
biological you know program but then

973
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:16,690
like I mentioned the borax too and I do

974
00:38:14,289 --> 00:38:19,449
that I put it in with my epson salt and

975
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:21,039
and I have to do that here for you know

976
00:38:19,449 --> 00:38:24,099
for reasons I mentioned because of my

977
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:25,329
sandy loam soil yeah well you know

978
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:27,489
there's some good studies out especially

979
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:29,730
with seaweed that show that you know

980
00:38:27,489 --> 00:38:32,639
micro dosa is a greater frequency

981
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:35,949
perform much better than high doses

982
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:37,989
fewer times a year so it definitely

983
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:39,939
makes a difference to apply these things

984
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:41,529
like you are in smaller amounts at

985
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:44,200
greater frequency especially with the

986
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:46,930
humic acid and a seaweed so I'm glad you

987
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:49,629
brought that up and then yeah I cut the

988
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:52,809
label rate down on that um drenching out

989
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:54,670
of 275 gallon tanks right now and like

990
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:57,639
the label rates you know what was called

991
00:38:54,670 --> 00:39:00,190
a teaspoon per gallon you know you I

992
00:38:57,639 --> 00:39:02,759
mean just think of how much product you

993
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,800
would need each drink so I cut that down

994
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:07,480
you know by less than half you know

995
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:10,030
sometimes a quarter of it I'll do like a

996
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:12,280
quarter of the amount but I'm doing it

997
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,170
three four days in a row unless I get

998
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,810
some rain so I'm like I said I'd rather

999
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:18,849
be there just a little bit at a time and

1000
00:39:16,809 --> 00:39:21,130
I can tell you another connection that

1001
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:23,170
we have now to you know with with

1002
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:24,970
cannabis growers is pretty much a lot of

1003
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,650
the heavy hitters in the Hobby world pH

1004
00:39:24,969 --> 00:39:28,859
and I water now that's something we

1005
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:31,800
never did up until a couple of years ago

1006
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:34,539
you'd be surprised what some of these

1007
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,490
nutrients can do with the pH G of water

1008
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:39,250
once you start adding them I was shocked

1009
00:39:36,489 --> 00:39:43,000
when I first started pH in my water back

1010
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:46,269
in 2015 just how something skyrocketed

1011
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,539
it and some stuff dropped it and I find

1012
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:52,480
kind of pH around 6-2 or something like

1013
00:39:49,539 --> 00:39:54,130
that seems uh seems to work best for the

1014
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,409
plants but that's another common

1015
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,890
connection and what we're doing you know

1016
00:39:56,409 --> 00:40:00,429
in what you know your communities doing

1017
00:39:58,889 --> 00:40:02,769
now there's a lot

1018
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:05,109
of parallels there at one of the things

1019
00:40:02,769 --> 00:40:06,550
I like to bring up because you guys are

1020
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:08,110
just as passionate about your plants as

1021
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:09,940
cannabis growers are and you're both

1022
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,010
pushing the envelope in terms of trying

1023
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:13,710
out the latest in the greatest

1024
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:17,320
techniques or the latest and greatest

1025
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:20,110
products as a way of maximizing growth

1026
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,280
and yield so there's a lot of parallels

1027
00:40:20,110 --> 00:40:22,720
there in fact I think you guys are

1028
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,230
actually a little more fanatic because

1029
00:40:22,719 --> 00:40:28,480
you hear not getting you're not getting

1030
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:31,360
a final product that's either edible or

1031
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:33,119
smokeable or sellable you're really just

1032
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,500
doing it for the satisfaction of this

1033
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,839
you know having the largest vegetable in

1034
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:40,389
the world yeah you know that's a very

1035
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:44,860
good point because we're not you know oz

1036
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:48,549
has not grown for you know for

1037
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:51,640
consumption it has no medical you know

1038
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:53,710
value to it or anything but aza grown

1039
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:55,269
just yeah just for size and you know

1040
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,039
some people grow for color you know some

1041
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,719
people you know they like their genetics

1042
00:40:57,039 --> 00:41:01,179
and the only plant stuff that's gonna

1043
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:04,109
throw a really pretty orange you know

1044
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:06,549
pumpkin but you know most of us just

1045
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:08,110
strictly precise oh yeah we do push the

1046
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,060
envelope a bit more it's a very very

1047
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:12,370
good point where you know someone in

1048
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:14,079
your community might not because of you

1049
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:16,569
know the medical you know value of the

1050
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:18,519
things like that but yeah we do we do

1051
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:20,170
push the envelope you know real hard and

1052
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:22,719
real fast that's for sure you know once

1053
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:24,400
again to think that you know we're

1054
00:41:22,719 --> 00:41:29,139
probably only four or five years away

1055
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,639
maybe from a 3,000 pound pumpkin it'll

1056
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:32,319
probably be done by somebody growing in

1057
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,089
the greenhouse you know we got some

1058
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,630
really good greenhouse growers now and

1059
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:39,160
you know I I started a I used a bigger

1060
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,780
greenhouse this year in the spring for

1061
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:45,460
the first time ever I was only in it for

1062
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:46,840
six weeks and it blew you know it blew

1063
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:48,639
the plants right out of the water they

1064
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,990
were growing so fast I mean I was not in

1065
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:51,429
there for the heated season because

1066
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:53,049
being in New England unless you had

1067
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:55,179
thousands of dollars you could never

1068
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:58,269
cool it I get the airflow in there to

1069
00:41:55,179 --> 00:42:00,339
mean pain but my first six weeks I grew

1070
00:41:58,269 --> 00:42:02,949
in a greenhouse was like one team

1071
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:04,480
playing with aluminum bats and one team

1072
00:42:02,949 --> 00:42:07,480
playing what wooden bats is no

1073
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,460
comparison so I think the first 3,000

1074
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,900
pound pumpkin will be grown in a

1075
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,849
greenhouse but they think that we're on

1076
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:14,650
the verge of that is

1077
00:42:12,849 --> 00:42:16,150
incredible nothing should get that big

1078
00:42:14,650 --> 00:42:18,608
and once again I'll say it a hundred

1079
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:21,369
times that comes from people willingly

1080
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:24,130
working with each other and sharing

1081
00:42:21,369 --> 00:42:25,690
information and knowledge and you know

1082
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:27,579
pumpkin growers like you said you said

1083
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:29,769
it best we push the envelope because we

1084
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:32,680
just called the size what I find with

1085
00:42:29,768 --> 00:42:37,238
the cannabis community that reaches out

1086
00:42:32,679 --> 00:42:39,848
to me this a small negro is who really

1087
00:42:37,239 --> 00:42:42,579
that I found that really want to educate

1088
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:44,499
themselves and they really want to do

1089
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:46,239
better they want better healthier plants

1090
00:42:44,498 --> 00:42:47,949
they want a bigger yield those are the

1091
00:42:46,239 --> 00:42:49,809
ones that are on the internet and

1092
00:42:47,949 --> 00:42:51,699
they're studying they're studying labels

1093
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,079
as studying biologicals and those are

1094
00:42:51,699 --> 00:42:55,509
the ones that kind of reach out to me

1095
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:57,009
and ask a lot of questions I find around

1096
00:42:55,509 --> 00:42:59,259
here in New England most who got

1097
00:42:57,009 --> 00:43:02,528
involved in the cannabis wave that came

1098
00:42:59,259 --> 00:43:04,358
in huge for us a few years ago and

1099
00:43:02,528 --> 00:43:06,248
everybody thought because maybe they

1100
00:43:04,358 --> 00:43:07,929
liked the effects of cannabis that

1101
00:43:06,248 --> 00:43:09,788
they'd be good at running a business

1102
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:12,399
doing it well they kind of all went out

1103
00:43:09,789 --> 00:43:14,049
of business already but I found a lot of

1104
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,180
them if their friend got him into the

1105
00:43:14,048 --> 00:43:18,548
Hobby and said hey this is all you need

1106
00:43:16,179 --> 00:43:21,028
to use you use this this cycle this

1107
00:43:18,548 --> 00:43:23,139
cycle that cycle and you're all done I

1108
00:43:21,028 --> 00:43:24,880
find a good percentage of those growers

1109
00:43:23,139 --> 00:43:26,409
never do anything else they use anything

1110
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,028
else because they're perfectly happy

1111
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:31,748
with enough for their own consumption

1112
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:33,338
and then maybe sell some to a dispensary

1113
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:37,118
or to a friend to make a couple extra

1114
00:43:33,338 --> 00:43:38,828
bucks I those that's that's a big

1115
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:41,410
percentage of people in our area here

1116
00:43:38,829 --> 00:43:42,910
but there's a there's a 1/4 of that

1117
00:43:41,409 --> 00:43:45,248
that'll really want to educate

1118
00:43:42,909 --> 00:43:46,449
themselves and and push their plants and

1119
00:43:45,248 --> 00:43:48,518
they're not afraid to make a mistake

1120
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:50,649
anybody who's growing anything better

1121
00:43:48,518 --> 00:43:52,748
than anybody else they've made mistakes

1122
00:43:50,650 --> 00:43:54,639
where they've lost a crop they've lost

1123
00:43:52,748 --> 00:43:58,268
yield they've made mistakes but then

1124
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:59,858
they come back and they perfected it and

1125
00:43:58,268 --> 00:44:01,748
they've done better so it's those people

1126
00:43:59,858 --> 00:44:03,880
that I'm afraid to push the envelope

1127
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:07,828
that eventually are going to get honed

1128
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,869
in on a system yeah so really the big

1129
00:44:07,829 --> 00:44:13,359
takeaway in my book is it's all about

1130
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,979
figuring out what the limiting factor of

1131
00:44:13,358 --> 00:44:17,048
growth is whether it's your genetics

1132
00:44:14,978 --> 00:44:21,098
whether it's your watering whether it's

1133
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:24,518
some sort of nutrient imbalance or some

1134
00:44:21,099 --> 00:44:26,350
sort of lacking microbe or biological

1135
00:44:24,518 --> 00:44:29,349
activity in your soil whatever

1136
00:44:26,349 --> 00:44:31,059
is that limiting your overall growth or

1137
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:32,559
you know in some case like you mentioned

1138
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:34,480
it maybe root space and maybe you're in

1139
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:35,559
a container too small but whatever it is

1140
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,420
that's limiting is what's going to

1141
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:40,210
determine your overall yield so if you

1142
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:42,820
can reduce the number of things that are

1143
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,530
limiting factors in your soil or remove

1144
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:47,470
them you're going to maximize the

1145
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:49,240
plant's ability to grow healthy to to

1146
00:44:47,469 --> 00:44:52,329
grow a giant pumpkin or grow a really

1147
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:53,349
good high-quality cannabis that's that's

1148
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:55,750
sure I couldn't have said it better

1149
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:58,259
myself in how much acid are you putting

1150
00:44:55,750 --> 00:45:01,420
in what's it come down to the time you

1151
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:04,060
know there's a reason why that people

1152
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:05,740
consistently grow the best you know the

1153
00:45:04,059 --> 00:45:07,269
best quality the best yields whether

1154
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:09,819
it's pumpkins cannabis or whatever

1155
00:45:07,269 --> 00:45:12,039
you'll find that they're working really

1156
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:14,710
hard and they're putting in the effort

1157
00:45:12,039 --> 00:45:18,159
and I tell people time you can't expect

1158
00:45:14,710 --> 00:45:20,199
to get those results by putting in that

1159
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:21,759
effort and so you know a lot of that

1160
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:23,139
comes down to effort too at times and

1161
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:25,870
how much of how much you're putting into

1162
00:45:23,139 --> 00:45:28,480
it but there's a real fascination the

1163
00:45:25,869 --> 00:45:31,539
connection between cannabis growers and

1164
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:33,519
giant pumpkin growers because that you

1165
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:35,139
know what I found is they're all very

1166
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,880
friendly again everybody it's like a

1167
00:45:35,139 --> 00:45:38,589
mutual admiration society you get

1168
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:40,180
everybody in a room it doesn't matter

1169
00:45:38,590 --> 00:45:42,490
what you do for a living what you did

1170
00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:45,069
what your race is nothing that all fades

1171
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:47,199
away the common love for growing what

1172
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:48,490
you're growing and then the information

1173
00:45:47,199 --> 00:45:50,739
starts come on I don't know about your

1174
00:45:48,489 --> 00:45:52,359
community but in our community there's

1175
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,799

well Wallace Wow dot-com is my website

1244
00:48:30,579 --> 00:48:35,279
and you know like I mentioned earlier I

1245
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:41,250
got fascinated in the study of

1246
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:44,769
mycorrhizal fungi you know back in 2002

1247
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:48,159
2003 I started educating myself more and

1248
00:48:44,769 --> 00:48:50,440
became really fascinated by it and I you

1249
00:48:48,159 --> 00:48:52,019
know sent my first world record in 2006

1250
00:48:50,440 --> 00:48:53,909
and the big part of that was using

1251
00:48:52,019 --> 00:48:55,949
mycorrhizae fungi

1252
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:59,759
I know I found over the years that there

1253
00:48:55,949 --> 00:49:01,879
was there was a market for people who

1254
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:06,030
were very much interested in obtaining

1255
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:07,858
high-quality mycorrhizal fungi and fresh

1256
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:09,960
mycorrhizal fungi not something that

1257
00:49:07,858 --> 00:49:11,639
been sitting on a shelf y'all are in a

1258
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:13,710
warehouse for a few years because all of

1259
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:15,568
these biologicals they don't get any

1260
00:49:13,710 --> 00:49:20,670
better the longer they sit in a bag so

1261
00:49:15,568 --> 00:49:23,099

you know if people didn't like the

1289

00:50:39,028 --> 00:50:44,909
you should try it and so that's kind of

1296
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:47,219
how I got my grassroots approach and

1297
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:48,690
built the business you know because you

1298
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:50,788
know didn't have the budget going in to

1299
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:52,470
be spending you know a thousand dollars

1300
00:50:50,789 --> 00:50:55,020
a month on Google AdWords or anything

1301
00:50:52,469 --> 00:50:58,048
else like that so kind of started slow

1302
00:50:55,019 --> 00:50:59,759
and it really it really took off these

1303
00:50:58,048 --> 00:51:01,199
people are very happy with the product

1304
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,010
the labels are easy to read the

1305
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,750
directions

1306
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:06,000
you know I stand behind you know my

1307
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:07,500
products and you know I sell a lot of

1308
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:10,139
things that you know people use

1309
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:12,599
every day gardens I have a you know I

1310
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:14,460
was a starter pack a lot of cannabis

1311
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:16,980
growers use and you know starting there

1312
00:51:14,460 --> 00:51:20,039
you know they transplants in they seem

1313
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:22,710
to really like them you know the home

1314
00:51:20,039 --> 00:51:24,690
gardeners you know I find that women

1315
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:26,639
drives the market for the home gardeners

1316
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,349
because I get tons of email from women

1317
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,089
and and they have legitimate concerns

1318
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:32,699
hey I don't want my hands in a bag of

1319
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:35,190
fertilizer so you know my starter pack

1320
00:51:32,699 --> 00:51:37,469
is enclosed in a tea bag and all you

1321
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:38,610
have to do is take tea bag out don't

1322
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,049
even have to open it up put it

1323
00:51:38,610 --> 00:51:41,970
underneath the plant and walk away and

1324
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:43,500
they really like them so things have

1325
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:46,319
been things have been going real well

1326
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:49,079
for me and you know I brought on a

1327
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:51,240
social media person recently and I have

1328
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:52,739
some help now in my warehouse with

1329
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,929
shipping and receiving because it

1330
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:57,269
started getting out in front of me where

1331
00:51:54,929 --> 00:51:59,069
you know like any small business how

1332
00:51:57,269 --> 00:52:01,289
much inventory do I need and then you

1333
00:51:59,070 --> 00:52:03,000
know hey I'm sure you can attest to

1334
00:52:01,289 --> 00:52:04,679
these mistakes too you get get

1335
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,900
short-handed a couple times in inventory

1336
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,069
because you don't know just what you

1337
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:09,480
need you don't want to have too much

1338
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,870
because you know my whole thing is

1339
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:15,630
freshness it if it's not fresh I'm not

1340

00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:20,549
very happy doing it

1343
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:22,319
I love the emails I get from people I

1344
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:25,620

very passionate about it and and the

1347
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,409
members of the wall families what I call

1351
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,329
hadn't you and I started talking when

1352
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:40,769
you originally started the business we

1353
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:43,769
were talking about my cries with fungus

1354
00:52:40,769 --> 00:52:45,719
just conversations over the phone and

1355
00:52:43,769 --> 00:52:48,179

1357
00:52:48,179 --> 00:52:52,799
I've been using and selling the five

1358
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:56,129
pound package that you have the wow Mike

1359
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,660
ERISA for a few years now you've been

1361
00:52:57,659 --> 00:53:02,429
expanding and things are going well

1362
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:03,510
that's really really great thank you and

1363
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:06,210
thank you for your support

1364
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:08,960
you've been instrumental in helping me

1365
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:11,550
are you my first you know wholesale

1366
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:12,929
account so to speak that kind of got me

1367
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:14,460
going we work together on figuring

1368
00:53:12,929 --> 00:53:15,779
things out you've been instrumental and

1369
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:17,670
helping with the packaging and once

1370
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,920
again I've found that with many many

1371
00:53:17,670 --> 00:53:21,480
people but I've dealt with who have a

1372
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:24,300
business they've been more than

1373
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,340
open to saying hey take a look at this

1374
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:29,160
here's how we should be looking at this

1375
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:31,829
and I was to come in the business I came

1376
00:53:29,159 --> 00:53:33,659
from food service you couldn't call up

1377
00:53:31,829 --> 00:53:35,340
somebody who was a competitor or sold

1378
00:53:33,659 --> 00:53:37,319
similar products and said hey what do

1379
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:39,329
you think I found that a lot of people

1380
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:40,920
in this end of it have been you know

1381
00:53:39,329 --> 00:53:42,269
like karma they feel if they good to you

1382
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:43,829
you'll be good to them everybody

1383
00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:46,769
succeeds and there's plenty of room for

1384
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:49,259
everybody and and it's yeah it's it's

1385
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:52,289
been it's been amazing every day I'm

1386
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:55,580
thankful when I wake up and and I have

1387
00:53:52,289 --> 00:53:57,599
orders to fulfill I'm very very blessed

1388
00:53:55,579 --> 00:53:59,549
yeah you know we do sell similar

1389
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,900
products but at the same time like you

1390
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:02,190
mentioned we're all we're all doing

1391
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:03,599
something better for the world I feel

1392
00:54:02,190 --> 00:54:06,389
like if we're getting people to use

1393
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:09,480
organics and promoting biologicals so

1394
00:54:06,389 --> 00:54:11,368
I'm all for it and the the thing that I

1395
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:14,519
really love about your product is it is

1396
00:54:11,369 --> 00:54:18,260
the right species it's the Glomus inter

1397
00:54:14,519 --> 00:54:21,389
a disease or rise Oh Vegas

1398
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:23,400
irregularities the new name but it's the

1399
00:54:21,389 --> 00:54:25,339
right species of micro so for most

1400
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,230
vegetables including pumpkins and

1401
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:29,400
cannabis and I know if I'm buying it for

1402
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:30,840
you I'm eating something that's fresh

1403
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,340
and that's really important to me

1404
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,869
because I'm not going through a giant

1405
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:36,119
distribution system where it may have

1406
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:37,980
been you know in a warehouse for a year

1407
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:39,990
before getting to a hydro shop and then

1408
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:41,880
I'm buying it there or online you really

1409
00:54:39,989 --> 00:54:43,799
don't know what you get either so no I

1410
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:45,710
really enjoy working with you and I wish

1411
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,609
you the best with your your business

1412
00:54:45,710 --> 00:54:50,970
thank you very much yeah we're gonna

1413
00:54:47,608 --> 00:54:52,799
continue to work hard every day and sell

1414
00:54:50,969 --> 00:54:54,750
a highness quality freshest you know

1415
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:56,789
mycorrhizal product out there I'm just

1416
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:59,219
just blessed to be and such you know

1417
00:54:56,789 --> 00:55:01,440
there's two big communities as you know

1418
00:54:59,219 --> 00:55:03,089
the giant pumpkins one cuz I'll always

1419
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,650
be you know I am that you know giant

1420
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:07,260
pumpkin man is what everybody calls me

1421
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:10,349
uh-huh but and a cannabis community is

1422
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,850
has accepted me very very well I think

1423
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:13,829
they're like working with small business

1424
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:15,389
you know people and I get a lot of

1425
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:16,920
comments I was shocked they are that I

1426
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:19,379
actually returned a phone call in an

1427
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:22,019
email I said no I do that every day so

1428
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,940
but that's wonderful communities to work

1429
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:25,650
in some really nice people who are

1430
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:27,059
working hard to you know make the world

1431
00:55:25,650 --> 00:55:29,550
a better place that's for sure and I

1432
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:30,779
thoroughly enjoy it well hopefully you

1433
00:55:29,550 --> 00:55:31,880
can see another world record this year

1434
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,530
that'd be great

1435
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:37,119
well would be that's my goal you know I

1436
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:39,460
have a goal I'd love to win another

1437
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,170
world championship and that would be my

1438
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:44,559
fourth and that would tie how would dill

1439
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,329
the Creator at four World Championships

1440
00:55:44,559 --> 00:55:47,920
and I think if I could do that one day I

1441
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:52,480
would probably take a year or two off

1442
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:55,780
that is my goal is to tie to tie Howard

1443
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,210
the world record that's always my goal I

1444
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:59,680
think me personally I'm probably a few

1445
00:55:58,210 --> 00:56:03,789
years away from that

1446
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:07,599
I mean 2624 pounds was and is an

1447
00:56:03,789 --> 00:56:09,130
incredible incredible pumpkin so I have

1448
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:11,559
to perfect my system a little bit more

1449
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:14,349
now I have to get a better start with my

1450
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:16,750
greenhouses and I need some pretty good

1451
00:56:14,349 --> 00:56:19,599
weather and so it probably won't happen

1452
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:22,510
for me this year but we're gonna have

1453
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,519
