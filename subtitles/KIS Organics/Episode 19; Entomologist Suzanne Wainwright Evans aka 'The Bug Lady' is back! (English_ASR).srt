00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,450
Suzanne reached out again recently

46
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,859
because she wanted to come back on to

47
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,049
clear up some questions regarding the

48
00:01:46,859 --> 00:01:50,909
practice of dipping cuttings as well as

49
00:01:49,049 --> 00:01:54,090
discuss prayer options and the critics

50
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:55,770

51
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:57,540
are a large-scale commercial cultivator

52

setting up an IPM program utilizing

54
00:01:59,489 --> 00:02:07,978
beneficial insects I cannot recommend

Suzanne I appreciate you coming back on

68
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:34,989
the show I wanted to you'd mentioned you

69
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,400
wanted to come back on to talk about a

70
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,050
few things that we didn't cover in the

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,090
last podcast and some general questions

72
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:43,719
you've been getting starting with

73
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:45,700
dipping with propagation can you talk a

74
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:48,370
little more about that yes well first

75
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:51,310
thanks for having me back and thanks for

76
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,890
the good solid email questions that I

77
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:56,530
have gotten but I definitely did get a

78
00:02:53,889 --> 00:02:58,599
lot of questions about dipping because I

79
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:02,169
think we kind of just brushed over it

80
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,769
and dipping is not complicated but you

81
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:08,319
do have to understand what you're doing

82
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,240
because if not you can make some

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,900
mistakes but the whole idea of dipping

84
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:17,110
and a lot of this information has come

85
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,480
from researchers up in Canada Rose

86
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:20,800
Mountain House is one who's been working

87
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:24,179
on this a lot for things like

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,650
poinsettias because again since since we

89
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,750
the universities and government

90
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:32,890
researchers really aren't free at this

91
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,930
point to work on him or cannabis what we

92
00:03:32,889 --> 00:03:37,239
have to do is we have to look to other

93
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:40,540
research and see how can we translate

94
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:43,210
that to help us with this crop and this

95
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:45,370
is one situation where it started in

96
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,870
poinsettias and mums and even in the

97
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,700
ornamental market it has definitely

98
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,039
moved through a lot of their other

99
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:54,399
varieties of ornamental plants and I

100
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:58,060
definitely think that in cannabis this

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,340
is really critical because again the

102
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,699
pest you're getting most of them are

103
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:05,439
coming in on cuttings or plant material

104
00:04:03,699 --> 00:04:08,079
and you need to have better sanitation

105
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,780
practices and stop it right at the door

106
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,730
and and this is the same thing that's

107
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:14,560
been true with poinsettias we know that

108
00:04:12,729 --> 00:04:16,060
when poinsettias come in they've been

109
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,298
coming in with things like white flies

110
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:21,009
and so these dip programs have been

111
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:24,099
developed so you can dip your cuttings

112
00:04:21,009 --> 00:04:26,599
in a solution and then stick them so you

113
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,310
can start a lot cleaner it

114
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:30,410
now I'm going to guarantee you a hundred

115
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:32,750
percent perfect kill everything all the

116
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:36,020
time but it's definitely going to get

117
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:39,110
you started much cleaner than you would

118
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:42,829
without a dip and I think with what I've

119
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:46,160
been seeing out on the west coast with

120
00:04:42,829 --> 00:04:49,069
the the growers out there you really and

121
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,820
almost everybody has a story of about

122
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:54,680
well their grow was clean until somebody

123
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:56,659
brought some plants or until they

124
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,449
brought some cuttings in and so this is

125
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:01,520
a way you can stop that from happening

126
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:04,759
now I think we might have mentioned a

127
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:06,469
few products before and you do have to

128
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:08,659
you know depending on what state you're

129
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,540
in you have to see what's approved and

130
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:15,350
what's not allowed and stuff so I'm

131
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:16,819
going to speak very general so you know

132
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,420
you have to think about your situation

133
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:23,540
and see if this applies to yours but

134
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:27,020
soaps and oils are definitely some of

135
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:28,490
the leading dips being used in addition

136
00:05:27,019 --> 00:05:32,000
to another product that's being used

137
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:36,139
quite a bit is Bettina garde but when

138
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,389
selecting what dip to use you have to

139
00:05:36,139 --> 00:05:40,669
look at what are your target pests you

140
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:45,019
know Bettina garde and soap have been

141
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:47,210
very popular for poinsettias because one

142
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:50,539
of their big issues is white flies now I

143
00:05:47,209 --> 00:05:53,479
have seen white fly in cannabis but it's

144
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,310
not as big of a problem I would say as

145
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:58,069
like ham present might there's been a

146
00:05:55,310 --> 00:06:01,100
lot more broad might I've seen lately

147
00:05:58,069 --> 00:06:03,800
and to spot spider mites and Botanic

148
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:07,640
Gardens not going to really do anything

149
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:09,110
for might issues and that's why there's

150
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:11,389
a lot of interest looking at a product

151
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,009
called saw foil X which I know some of

152
00:06:11,389 --> 00:06:17,300
you if you've talked to me we've talked

153
00:06:13,009 --> 00:06:22,250
about saw foil X was actually tested up

154
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:27,590
in Canada for poinsettias and when they

155
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:30,410
did their dips it was at a 0.1% when you

156
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:33,349
read the label for a spray for this

157
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:35,360
particular oil which by the way is an

158
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:38,000
Omri listed product so it is approved

159
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,150
for use in organic production the spray

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,339
rate is 1%

161
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,579
but in the research where they were

162
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:48,489
dipping cuttings in Canada it was at a

163
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:50,919
0.1% and at that level they were still

164
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,980
able to get the insecticidal properties

165
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:56,800
of killing pests but they didn't get

166
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,450
phyto toxicity from it on the points

167
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,500
that he is and I believe they tested

168
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:05,979
mums also in the United States right now

169
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:10,839
the cephalic from a federal label does

170
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:13,390
not have dipping on the label so it's a

171
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:16,029
very in a federally you technically

172
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:18,849
can't do it it's a real challenge

173
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:21,279
because we've got to stop these mites

174
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:25,600
and this is a product we do have some

175
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:28,269
research on and we have a rate four so I

176
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,560
can't legally tell anybody to dip it but

177
00:07:28,269 --> 00:07:35,169
I'm just telling you there's research

178
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:37,660
out there at a 0.1% solution that it's

179
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:39,189
shown very good insecticidal properties

180
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:43,620
or let me call them pesticidal

181
00:07:39,189 --> 00:07:46,120
properties at that rate now the cell

182
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:47,530
we're waiting for the dip to come for

183
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,790
the label I mean it's not that it's

184
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:52,599
going to be disallowed we just need it

185
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:54,550
to show up on the label but it it has

186
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,939
shown to be very effective at stopping

187
00:07:54,550 --> 00:08:00,610
pests there is the information is out

188
00:07:57,939 --> 00:08:02,469
there online very easily that you can

189
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:06,639
find the research and how they use this

190
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:09,160
0.1% solution to dip in they've also

191
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,089
done combinations again with like

192
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:16,390
botanic garden dizzy R 0.5% soap

193
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:19,149
solution as a dip so there are other

194
00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:23,349
combinations but from an efficacy

195
00:08:19,149 --> 00:08:26,019
standpoint we found the saw file we I

196
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:29,879
have to say in ornamentals and cannabis

197
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:34,449
as a foliar spray product it has been

198
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:38,919
very very effective for mite management

199
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:41,440
but you have to get spray coverage you

200
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:45,729
have to get spray coverage and that is

201
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,200
what is critical that a lot of people

202
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:49,060
will spray it and say well it didn't

203
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,850
work well no it's because you didn't get

204
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:53,619
good spray coverage and that's why if

205
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:55,720
you're doing dips you get

206
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:58,539
Hunter percent spray coverage once you

207
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,790
have you know a large plant whether it

208
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:02,860
be a mum whether you have it

209
00:09:00,789 --> 00:09:05,079
cannabis whether you know it be anything

210
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,990
getting 100 percent spray coverage is

211
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,520
nearly impossible especially when you're

212
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:14,289
using paint sprayers but that's a whole

213
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:16,360
nother issue but this way you can start

214
00:09:14,289 --> 00:09:19,059
clean and and it's been very frustrating

215
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:21,430
to me talking to growers you know we're

216
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:23,109
like well what's your program and the

217
00:09:21,429 --> 00:09:25,149
cannabis people are being too reactive

218
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,539
they're waiting to they get a pest

219
00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:31,149
problem and then trying to treat you've

220
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:34,120
got to do your dips let your plants dry

221
00:09:31,149 --> 00:09:35,588
and then immediately share predatory

222
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:37,299
mites right out and start on your

223
00:09:35,589 --> 00:09:40,140
program then and I'm seeing too many

224
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:42,399
suppliers of biocontrol agents not

225
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,929
setting these programs up for growers

226
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,240
they're really doing a dis justice to

227
00:09:43,929 --> 00:09:48,759
their growers they're on it now there is

228
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,519
another product I've been looking at and

229
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,639
it's called tetra kirb tetra curve is on

230
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:56,679
the 25 be exempt list so it is exempt

231
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:59,139
from EPA registration so there's no

232
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:01,419
reentry time on it no protective

233
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:04,720
equipment really requirements for it and

234
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:07,569
that also is proving to be a very

235
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:10,480
effective miticide for to spot spider

236
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:12,330
mites I know they're working on testing

237
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,070
for different dip rates because again

238
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:16,570
dip rates are going to be different than

239
00:10:15,070 --> 00:10:17,950
a spray rate so but that's another

240
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:21,250
product I think there's a lot of

241
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:24,220
potential with and from being in grows

242
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:26,409
and seeing the price people are paying

243
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,990
for some of these spray products you

244
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:32,079
know this uh foil is so inexpensive to

245
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:35,320
use buy in comparison and you know by

246
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,810
the saw file from a traditional

247
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,290
horticultural Supply Company it's I

248
00:10:37,809 --> 00:10:42,879
think it's almost twice as expensive on

249
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:46,569
Amazon if you buy it but if you buy from

250
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:49,778
you know companies like southern egg BFG

251
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:54,070
you know these Carlin these kinds of

252
00:10:49,778 --> 00:10:56,200
people on you can get a good price on

253
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,350
the product and it will go a long way

254
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:01,420
for you yeah I did have a question about

255
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:03,579
that now the stuff file X you said was

256
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:04,449
also on the market under another name is

257
00:11:03,578 --> 00:11:06,439
that correct

258
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:10,040
well you can't the

259
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:11,270
same inactive ingredient the oil is last

260
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:13,159
I thought you know and things may change

261
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,919
since like a few days ago but the

262
00:11:13,159 --> 00:11:17,539
Monterey lawn and garden product which

263
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:22,549
you can buy a lot of garden centers in

264
00:11:17,539 --> 00:11:24,889
small quantities that is the same highly

265
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:26,809
emulsified oil in there okay I just

266
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:28,279
wanted to make sure yeah I added that to

267
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:30,949
my website it was a lot harder to get

268
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:32,720
this off oil accent as it as a new

269
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:35,780
company to try and offer it to customers

270
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:38,360
plus I think the the smallest size was a

271
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,589
couple gallons or like a five gallon jug

272
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,800
which is a lot more than a lot of

273
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:44,450
growers may need that we work with so

274
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:45,259
yes and I just had a discussion with

275
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,410
Bioworks

276
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:50,419
about packaging size so maybe might be

277
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:52,639
some smaller packaging might be coming

278
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:54,229
sooner than later oh that would be great

279
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,330
I'd love to get into smaller size of

280
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:58,100
directly from them yeah I just remember

281
00:11:56,330 --> 00:12:00,170
a lot of people I'm dealing with do mix

282
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,610
up 100 gallons of spray at the time and

283
00:12:00,169 --> 00:12:03,679
they need these larger quantities but I

284
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:05,690
do understand and especially when it

285
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:09,019
comes to dipping you need very small

286
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:10,310
quantities of products yes so that

287
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:11,809
brought up a couple more questions I

288
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:12,289
want to ask you around dipping before we

289
00:12:11,809 --> 00:12:15,500
move on

290
00:12:12,289 --> 00:12:18,709
so you mentioned soaps when I think of

291
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,440
soaps I think of dr. Bronner's but what

292
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:23,780
kind of soaps do you recommend for for

293
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,690
dipping and it things like that impede

294
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,329
you know again and this you know soaps

295
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,460
are a whole nother podcast because a

296
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,259
soap is not a soap is not a soap you

297
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,090
have different carbon chain lengths I

298
00:12:33,259 --> 00:12:38,539
mean they're they're some organic

299
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:41,629
herbicides that are soaps and you just

300
00:12:38,539 --> 00:12:43,819
never know with soaps sometimes what

301
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:45,580
kind of soap is actually in there

302
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,980
it gets scary when people start using

303
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:51,310
detergents you don't know about what

304
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:54,580
other additives are in there impede

305
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:59,838
insecticidal soap is designed to be an

306
00:12:54,580 --> 00:13:02,740
insecticide and it you know as with any

307
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,089
insecticide product you always have to

308
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,830
make sure that you know you're not going

309
00:13:05,089 --> 00:13:08,570
to fight Oh issues you don't want to use

310
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:09,560
it when your plants are wilted you don't

311
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,970
want to spray it in the middle of the

312
00:13:09,559 --> 00:13:12,889
day in full Sun I mean there's all these

313
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:15,110
things that you know you can do to

314
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:18,080
reduce the risk of using or having

315
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:19,629
burned from soaps and oils you know the

316
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:24,460
dr. Bronner thing is

317
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:28,480
is you know it I would say it I know

318
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:32,019
that if you get contact with a mite you

319
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,389
know you can you can have mortality you

320
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:37,120
can kill it but again it all comes down

321
00:13:34,389 --> 00:13:40,659
to spray coverage you know with a lot of

322
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,940
these products that it just depends on

323
00:13:40,659 --> 00:13:45,399
how good you spray and that's it and

324
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:48,010
there's been no real research on dipping

325
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:50,470
and dr. Bronner because it's not on the

326
00:13:48,009 --> 00:13:54,220
25 be exempt list nor is it at a

327
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:56,170
registered pesticide so really um it's

328
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:59,110
tough for people to do research with it

329
00:13:56,169 --> 00:14:00,669
because it's not you know recognized

330
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,930
really as a pesticide allure

331
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:06,339
insecticidal product in the US and so

332
00:14:03,929 --> 00:14:08,229
you know you have to be just very buyer

333
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:10,389
beware using that kind of stuff but that

334
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:11,920
is very as soon as somebody calls me and

335
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:14,460
says you're using dr. Bronner I know

336
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:17,439
it's a cannabis grower right from there

337
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,550
for those telltale cannabis signs and

338
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,750
I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad

339
00:14:18,549 --> 00:14:22,659
thing because you know what I would

340
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:25,330
weigh whether a grower do something like

341
00:14:22,659 --> 00:14:27,850
that then go spray you know orthene or

342
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:30,310
you know some of these other products

343
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:32,440
that can be way nastier but you know

344
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:34,779
just it's a risk that you can have Fido

345
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,850
with that stuff and also dr. Bronner's

346
00:14:34,779 --> 00:14:38,860
has a million different flavors and

347
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:42,040
those innards can make a difference too

348
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:45,159
but it's basically the soap working as a

349
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,629
desiccant on on the insects and mites

350
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,699
that's basically what's happening and

351
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:50,230
when you get impede again you're getting

352
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,420
the right carbon chain length as an

353
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:55,690
insecticidal soap without all this other

354
00:14:52,419 --> 00:14:58,899
stuff in it yeah I typically hear people

355
00:14:55,690 --> 00:15:01,210
choosing MIT based dr. Bronner's ones

356
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:03,189
because they think they'll get some some

357
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:06,460
of the qualities of the mint in terms of

358
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:09,190
the pesticide properties but well let me

359
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,930
tell you twice this week I've been with

360
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:13,300
two mint growers because they can't

361
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:15,069
control the insects on their mint so wow

362
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:18,519
yeah mints got some great insecticidal

363
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:20,530
properties going okay so a couple other

364
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:23,379
questions I had on this dipping thing so

365
00:15:20,529 --> 00:15:24,759
yes no go ahead ask them because I've

366
00:15:23,379 --> 00:15:28,750
got a list of things to make sure I tell

367
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:31,120
you okay so you mentioned mixing botanic

368
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,350
garden insecticidal soap can you use

369
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,320
more than one product

370
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:37,810
at a time it's well that is something

371
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:41,710
that has been tested and we know it

372
00:15:37,809 --> 00:15:44,769
works together you can get yourself into

373
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,990
trouble mixing too many things at a time

374
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:50,139
because you don't understand how they're

375
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,909
going to all interact together you know

376
00:15:50,139 --> 00:15:56,039
one real interesting study on that is

377
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:59,500
looking at nematodes and tank mixing oil

378
00:15:56,039 --> 00:16:01,269
mixing them in a dip with Botanic Garden

379
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,799
but Tanner guard won't kill nematodes

380
00:16:01,269 --> 00:16:04,329
but when they were doing some research

381
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:05,889
about it they were getting nematode

382
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,620
mortality and it turned out what

383
00:16:05,889 --> 00:16:10,569
happened is the this is what they think

384
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:13,090
is happening the the as the Botanic

385
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:15,129
Garden it was pinning the nematodes down

386
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:17,320
to the bottom and basically suffocating

387
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:20,710
the nematodes down on the bottom so it

388
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,360
was actually a physical issue of of the

389
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,460
two products so it's something that you

390
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:28,389
definitely have to keep aerated and mix

391
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:30,400
but there is work from bio work showing

392
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:32,669
and again bio works does have a

393
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,259
technical bulletin out on their website

394
00:16:32,669 --> 00:16:38,709
it's called cleaning up incoming plant

395
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:41,429
material by utilizing dips and they have

396
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:44,110
in there where you know they talk about

397
00:16:41,429 --> 00:16:46,209
dipping the you know the putting the

398
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:48,039
nimma shield together with the botanic

399
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:50,410
garden the new Micheel there are the

400
00:16:48,039 --> 00:16:52,209
nematodes and the rates and how you can

401
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:54,699
mix them all together and if you're

402
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,889
dipping something with roots because I

403
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,509
got an email from a grower saying oh you

404
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,299
said on the podcast to dip the whole

405
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:03,279
plant and oil and that's an eye I hope

406
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:04,539
that message across because when we talk

407
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,869
about oil dips we're talking about

408
00:17:04,539 --> 00:17:09,940
cuttings you know or clones as the

409
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:13,479
cannabis industry calls them but just

410
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,400
the foliage when people get rooted

411
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,370
cuttings in and we see this much more in

412
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:20,620
ornamentals and even some vegetables

413
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:23,649
growers are dipping those young plants

414
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:26,019
with the root media in there or the the

415
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:27,490
oasis or whatever media they're using

416
00:17:26,019 --> 00:17:30,220
but they'll tend to dip them in a

417
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:33,009
botanic garden emmitt ode and roots

418
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,539
yield mixed together and those three

419
00:17:33,009 --> 00:17:36,819
products we know work very well together

420
00:17:34,539 --> 00:17:39,039
because then you get the nematodes into

421
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:40,710
the media which are going to kill what's

422
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:44,230
what's our flower thrips

423
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,579
pupae they'll also kill fungus gnats and

424
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,980
then you get a bat and a guard giving

425
00:17:45,579 --> 00:17:47,509
one

426
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,400
sent coverage on the plant and then you

427
00:17:47,509 --> 00:17:52,548
get rude shield which is actually a very

428
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,530
good biological fungicide so Bioworks

429
00:17:52,548 --> 00:17:57,589
has really good literature on this

430
00:17:54,529 --> 00:18:01,910
telling you how to do it how to mix this

431
00:17:57,589 --> 00:18:05,539
stuff up with these products so you do

432
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,150
have to be careful now the rates for the

433
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:10,339
dipping with the soap and the botanic

434
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,040
garden that's out of a Canadian study

435
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:14,629
again that rose mountain house was

436
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:17,539
involved with and you know they're

437
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:20,360
wrecking recommending a 0.5% soap

438
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:23,798
solution and then they were adding in

439
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:26,719
125 grams of per liter of the botanic

440
00:18:23,798 --> 00:18:31,509
garden to gether to dip so if you go

441
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:33,980
online and go to you know university

442
00:18:31,509 --> 00:18:37,129
government website and look about dip

443
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:39,769
information you can find these rates and

444
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:43,190
what's been tested and what we know does

445
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:45,109
play well together in a dip okay and

446
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:47,630
just to be clear you're suggesting as

447
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:49,668
well so if you have a if you have a

448
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,549
facility you should be dipping even off

449
00:18:49,669 --> 00:18:55,549
of healthy mother plants at just as part

450
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:56,629
of your or your IPM strategy this is

451
00:18:55,548 --> 00:18:59,960
something that everyone should be doing

452
00:18:56,630 --> 00:19:03,080
when they're taking cuttings if I had a

453
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:07,100
facility I would be doing that because

454
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:10,970
the risk is too great you're not talking

455
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,859
about 25 cent marigold the risk is too

456
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:15,169
great and with these mites it's

457
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:17,750
generally just taking one coming in and

458
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:19,850
and something you know you may think

459
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:22,369
your grow was clean but if your employee

460
00:19:19,849 --> 00:19:25,399
went somewhere that had mites and they

461
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:29,899
hitchhiked back in or you know it's just

462
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:31,640
it's you know it's very rare that you

463
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:33,860
know someone says I absolutely know

464
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,960
insect problems I have no mite problems

465
00:19:33,859 --> 00:19:37,668
and my grow at all and most people start

466
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:41,329
clean and end up with problems so I

467
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:45,610
think it's a good preventive step to do

468
00:19:41,329 --> 00:19:48,889
because the cost is low the labor is low

469
00:19:45,609 --> 00:19:50,808
and as of yet and you know things may

470
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,429
change as more research comes out you

471
00:19:50,808 --> 00:19:55,129
know we may find there may be varietal

472
00:19:52,429 --> 00:19:57,470
differences maybe some some cannabis

473
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:59,600
varieties or cultivars don't like to be

474
00:19:57,470 --> 00:20:01,940
dipped as of yet

475
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:04,099
I haven't had anybody contact me and say

476
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:08,058
this was a problem unless they were

477
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:10,639
doing it wrong and and that's the thing

478
00:20:08,058 --> 00:20:12,710
I found with some of the emails I got

479
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:15,110
and actually visiting some of the groves

480
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:16,700
that they weren't dipping correctly

481
00:20:15,109 --> 00:20:20,209
because you know you want to take your

482
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:22,970
cuttings or again your clones you have

483
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:24,829
your and also never take them off

484
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,210
dehydrated plants make sure the plants

485
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:28,009
are well watered before you take your

486
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:30,169
cuttings which I think everybody knows

487
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:32,000
that but you know you want to mix up

488
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,070
whatever cocktail you're going to dip

489
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,048
your cuttings in it needs to make sure

490
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:38,119
it stays well mixed again if using

491
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:40,579
things like nematodes but an agar that

492
00:20:38,119 --> 00:20:42,918
kind of stuff can easily settle out if

493
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:45,319
you're doing a lot of cuttings one of

494
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:48,440
the easiest ways to do it is to take two

495
00:20:45,319 --> 00:20:53,658
like 1020 mesh flats lay the cuttings in

496
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:55,730
there and have the open parts of the the

497
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:57,049
mesh flat facing each other so basically

498
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:59,538
you've made a cage and you could

499
00:20:57,048 --> 00:21:01,519
submerge it down and you want to hold it

500
00:20:59,538 --> 00:21:03,829
five to ten seconds and kind of shimmy

501
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:05,808
it a little bit in there until no air

502
00:21:03,829 --> 00:21:09,009
bubbles come up because that means that

503
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:12,230
once the air bubbles stop coming up that

504
00:21:09,009 --> 00:21:13,640
there's no air left touching the

505
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,259
products down there I mean on the the

506
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,720
cuttings because if there's an air

507
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:20,210
pocket that means part of the plants not

508
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,029
getting covered most cannabis people are

509
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:24,980
going to be doing that volume of cutting

510
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:27,440
so what people do is they basically will

511
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,500
just mix up maybe one gallon of solution

512
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,580
put on your gloves and depending again

513
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,900
what you're using you might need

514
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:35,178
different protective equipment but

515
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:37,159
basically taking a hand full of the

516
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:39,769
cuttings and then submerging them and

517
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:41,480
just kind of shaking them not violently

518
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:44,569
but shaking underwater again you know

519
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:46,279
ten seconds or so until no air bubbles

520
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:48,980
come up pull it out kind of you know

521
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:51,408
drip it off a little bit and then you

522
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:53,779
can either some people you know will lay

523
00:21:51,409 --> 00:21:55,669
them out and then you know keep them

524
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:59,418
cool to the next day or you you know get

525
00:21:55,669 --> 00:22:01,429
them stuck right then on there the thing

526
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:03,610
that I'm seeing and believe me

527
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:05,630
ornamental guys made this mistake at

528
00:22:03,609 --> 00:22:07,569
first but now I'm a little concerned

529
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,700
because some of the cannabis guys are

530
00:22:07,569 --> 00:22:13,119
don't use that dip solution day after

531
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:16,000
day after day because you

532
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:18,899
you do have a risk of diseases getting

533
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,180
in that water so you know it between

534
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:23,350
cultivars are between you know different

535
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:26,230
groups of plants you might want to

536
00:22:23,349 --> 00:22:28,089
change that water so don't hold it over

537
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:31,180
and use it again and again because you

538
00:22:28,089 --> 00:22:32,789
will spread problems and especially if

539
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:35,110
using something like botanical I mean on

540
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:38,170
nematodes they'll all be dead they'll

541
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:40,149
end up drowning in the water so just mix

542
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:41,830
up what you need and use it but then the

543
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,570
question is is what do you do with that

544
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:46,230
leftover product after you dipped your

545
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:49,599
cutting do not spray it on your plants

546
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:51,730
no no no no no no no don't spray it in

547
00:22:49,599 --> 00:22:54,730
your greenhouse you need to dispose of

548
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:57,279
it however your state you know allows

549
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:59,230
you to dispose of it what I know some of

550
00:22:57,279 --> 00:23:01,629
my ornamental guys do is they go and

551
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:03,160
they spray it around outside around

552
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:04,620
their greenhouse so you want to just

553
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,460
dispose of it properly

554
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,349
obviously with something like dr.

555
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:10,210
Bronner's which again I have no idea to

556
00:23:08,349 --> 00:23:12,009
dip rate for that that isn't a

557
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:15,190
registered pesticide so that's easier to

558
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:17,049
dispose of but you don't want to take

559
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:18,940
you know a product that you've just

560
00:23:17,049 --> 00:23:20,859
washed all these bad things off your

561
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:24,039
cuttings and go apply it right to your

562
00:23:20,859 --> 00:23:25,869
plants wow that was a lot of really good

563
00:23:24,039 --> 00:23:29,079
information thanks for sharing all that

564
00:23:25,869 --> 00:23:30,279
I could visualize the dipping so that

565
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:31,928
really helped and I'll try and put up

566
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:34,058
some photos if I can find some too to

567
00:23:31,929 --> 00:23:35,830
help listeners yeah Bioworks has some

568
00:23:34,058 --> 00:23:38,379
and like I said you know I teach these

569
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:40,659
workshops all over the place and Debbie

570
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:42,010
from bio works I have pulled her with me

571
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,160
in fact that's what she and I are going

572
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:48,279
to be up in Alberta teaching some

573
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:50,890
classes and I think it's two weeks or so

574
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:52,990
one day we're doing ornamentals one day

575
00:23:50,890 --> 00:23:54,790
we're doing vegetables but I call her

576
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:57,460
dipping Debbie because she does a really

577
00:23:54,789 --> 00:23:59,049
good demonstration like when you mix up

578
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,670
roots yield what should it look like in

579
00:23:59,049 --> 00:24:01,779
the water when you mix up a Tanner guard

580
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:04,450
what should it look like in the water

581
00:24:01,779 --> 00:24:05,859
make sure you know you get it all mixed

582
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:07,929
in because some of those powdered

583
00:24:05,859 --> 00:24:08,979
products can clump now I know like

584
00:24:07,929 --> 00:24:10,540
seeing this is where you've got to know

585
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:12,670
your state because you can't use the

586
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:16,149
powdered you can't use the wettable

587
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:17,830
powder in Oregon of the Tanner guard so

588
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,410
you gotta you know know what your state

589
00:24:17,829 --> 00:24:21,579
rules are and use the right formulation

590
00:24:20,410 --> 00:24:23,590
but if you're using a powdered

591
00:24:21,579 --> 00:24:24,970
formulation those clumps are easy to

592
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,558
sink to the bottom and you got to get

593
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:28,990
them and she'll use like a whisk

594
00:24:26,558 --> 00:24:31,980
to make sure that it gets all mixed in

595
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:35,528
but she does a really really amazing

596
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:39,249
demonstration on it also the Vineland

597
00:24:35,528 --> 00:24:40,749
research and innovation station er where

598
00:24:39,249 --> 00:24:42,669
again rose mountain house

599
00:24:40,749 --> 00:24:44,499
works they've been putting together some

600
00:24:42,669 --> 00:24:46,419
videos on dipping again little more

601
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:47,879
point study oriented but it definitely

602
00:24:46,419 --> 00:24:52,120
will help provide good information

603
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:54,128
because again I mean I mean I you know I

604
00:24:52,119 --> 00:24:56,558
was out there was that a week and a half

605
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:58,209
ago two weeks ago some of you people

606
00:24:56,558 --> 00:25:02,460
listening probably saw me come by your

607
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:05,379
facility but it just I feel so bad for

608
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:09,909
you guys because you're just not getting

609
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:12,248
good solid science information and

610
00:25:09,909 --> 00:25:14,919
you've got to have this stuff in order

611
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:16,690
to stay in business these days I want to

612
00:25:14,919 --> 00:25:18,340
get into that a little bit but before we

613
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:20,080
do we had talked a little bit about

614
00:25:18,339 --> 00:25:21,878
sprayers we didn't give any actual

615
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:25,388
recommendations I know you love the

616
00:25:21,878 --> 00:25:27,219
company DRAM that's dra mm do you have

617
00:25:25,388 --> 00:25:28,538
any particular Spurs that you recommend

618
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,710
for getting good coverage I know you

619
00:25:28,538 --> 00:25:31,898
don't like paint sprayers

620
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:34,240
well because paint sprayers aren't

621
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:38,168
pesticide sprayers and this is I am not

622
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:42,038
a I'm not a spray equipment expert you

623
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:44,950
know I I have my niche of you know how

624
00:25:42,038 --> 00:25:48,249
how to kill them and this is you know I

625
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:49,659
I what I tell my growers should do is

626
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:52,179
contact Grant

627
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:53,860
Graham DRAM and say you know I'm an

628
00:25:52,179 --> 00:25:56,350
indoor grow I'm an outdoor grow on

629
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:59,798
average we mix up this much product this

630
00:25:56,349 --> 00:26:02,740
is you know and have them tell you what

631
00:25:59,798 --> 00:26:06,158
the right equipment is for you because

632
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:10,659
they know there are equipment and that's

633
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:13,509
what's what they're experts at and you

634
00:26:10,659 --> 00:26:16,119
know I am a firm believer of no one is

635
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,860
an expert on everything and I do I mean

636
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:19,658
if you've seen me in person you know

637
00:26:17,859 --> 00:26:21,398
unfortunately I'm an eye roller because

638
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,480
like when I meet somebody and I'm like

639
00:26:21,398 --> 00:26:24,998
well what do you specialize in

640
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,919
oh I specialize in everything no one's

641
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:30,669
an expert in everything so what you have

642
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,580
to do is find the expert in the field

643
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:35,500
you need to talk about or again you know

644
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:36,759
like you can talk to one expert and

645
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:39,519
they'll say well I don't know but this

646
00:26:36,759 --> 00:26:40,269
is the person to go talk to you know

647
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:41,979
that and that's

648
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:44,618
what I do I built this network of other

649
00:26:41,979 --> 00:26:46,929
experts because I don't know everything

650
00:26:44,618 --> 00:26:48,668
but I think DRAM has good solid

651
00:26:46,929 --> 00:26:51,639
equipment it's a lot of what my

652
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:54,239
ornamental guys use I'm not knocking any

653
00:26:51,638 --> 00:26:59,168
other spray company out there it's just

654
00:26:54,239 --> 00:27:00,879
I've just always had very I've heard

655
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:02,609
very good things about them I see my

656
00:27:00,878 --> 00:27:04,748
customers are happy and they're

657
00:27:02,608 --> 00:27:06,728
innovative which we'll talk about later

658
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:08,798
about their nematode bucket which

659
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:10,298
unfortunately I didn't realize that the

660
00:27:08,798 --> 00:27:11,679
cannabis industry didn't know about the

661
00:27:10,298 --> 00:27:13,509
nematode bucket but we'll talk about

662
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,009
that later well why don't we cover it

663
00:27:13,509 --> 00:27:16,868
now since he meant brought it up and we

664
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:19,419
were talking about DRAM already so you

665
00:27:16,868 --> 00:27:21,218
had an experience at the last conference

666
00:27:19,419 --> 00:27:23,469
you were at where someone was talking

667
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:25,538
about having trouble getting even

668
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:27,969
distribution of nematodes in greenhouse

669
00:27:25,538 --> 00:27:29,519
applications and you said the solution

670
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:32,320
was out there do you want to cover that

671
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:37,419
yeah and it's an amazingly simple

672
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:41,999
solution so there is the I would called

673
00:27:37,419 --> 00:27:47,139
the sophisticated way to go so DRAM has

674
00:27:41,999 --> 00:27:50,319
made because we were years ago having

675
00:27:47,138 --> 00:27:52,558
problems in the ornament market keeping

676
00:27:50,319 --> 00:27:54,668
our nimma toad suspended in water you

677
00:27:52,558 --> 00:27:57,098
you make your stock solution of

678
00:27:54,669 --> 00:27:59,200
nematodes up and again if you don't have

679
00:27:57,098 --> 00:28:00,368
aeration to keep oxygen in the water and

680
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,899
you don't have the water moving the

681
00:28:00,368 --> 00:28:04,028
nematodes sink out and you don't get

682
00:28:01,898 --> 00:28:06,128
even distribution and I've had

683
00:28:04,028 --> 00:28:08,888
discussions years ago with DRAM and

684
00:28:06,128 --> 00:28:11,138
other people and one thing my growers

685
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:12,638
have done it that the the this is the

686
00:28:11,138 --> 00:28:15,038
unsophisticated answer you just

687
00:28:12,638 --> 00:28:17,558
literally can use a fish bubbler that

688
00:28:15,038 --> 00:28:18,908
you can get from a bait store and it's

689
00:28:17,558 --> 00:28:21,190
kind of like instead of you know having

690
00:28:18,909 --> 00:28:22,690
your your bait well for your little fish

691
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:25,538
with your popular in it you just drop

692
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:28,028
that bubbler into your bucket of stock

693
00:28:25,538 --> 00:28:30,249
nematodes you have to be very careful

694
00:28:28,028 --> 00:28:31,598
your bubbler and that what you're using

695
00:28:30,249 --> 00:28:34,450
because people have tried different

696
00:28:31,598 --> 00:28:35,769
things doesn't get warm because you

697
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,690
don't want to cook your nematodes and

698
00:28:35,769 --> 00:28:39,459
it's easy to cook your nematodes the

699
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:41,019
idea again is to keep oxygen in the

700
00:28:39,459 --> 00:28:43,690
water because then Kadima totes like

701
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:46,088
fish and you want to keep them moving in

702
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,489
the water and so a fish bubbler can do

703
00:28:46,088 --> 00:28:50,588
that but what DRAM developed and I know

704
00:28:48,489 --> 00:28:53,229
sorry DRAM it's a little pricey but it's

705
00:28:50,588 --> 00:28:54,210
easy it's done it's simple and I it's on

706
00:28:53,229 --> 00:28:55,830
my tits an it

707
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:57,600
get proof products and I think sometimes

708
00:28:55,829 --> 00:28:59,159
you know you're going to pay a little

709
00:28:57,599 --> 00:29:00,509
bit more but it's done and you don't

710
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:03,000
have to worry about it it's a bucket

711
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:05,099
that can you can plug it in or it can

712
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,619
run off battery and it keeps your

713
00:29:05,099 --> 00:29:11,129
nematodes in suspicion in suspension and

714
00:29:07,619 --> 00:29:12,599
aerates them and what my ornamental guys

715
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:15,170
do is they'll take those buckets and

716
00:29:12,599 --> 00:29:18,449
then you just stick a dosatron in it and

717
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:21,870
then you can use that to evenly dose out

718
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:24,150
your nematodes per pot and you're

719
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:27,389
getting an even distribution it's it's

720
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:29,250
it's a beautifully simple answer and you

721
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:30,870
know you can use that bucket for other

722
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,029
things you want to keep in suspension

723
00:29:30,869 --> 00:29:35,489
and you know you can use a dosatron for

724
00:29:33,029 --> 00:29:39,809
a lot of different things to give you

725
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:43,980
better better even distribution in your

726
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:45,269
greenhouse and dosatron and BASF and BSF

727
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:47,610
is the world's largest producer of

728
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:51,980
nematodes do have literature out there

729
00:29:47,609 --> 00:29:55,229
telling you how to use a dosatron with

730
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,299
with the beneficial nematodes and

731
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:59,039
because you do have to remove a filter

732
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,690
out of it but it's actually very simple

733
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:03,000
and again if some of you been to some of

734
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,279
my workshops we actually did a live

735
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,869
demonstration of this out in California

736
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,759
I think is about two years ago with a

737
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:10,469
plug and cutting conference and we are

738
00:30:08,759 --> 00:30:14,279
going to be doing it again

739
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:19,140
I'm for those of you that are coming to

740
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:21,450
the cultivate show which is the right

741
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:22,920
now for the ornamental slash hint of

742
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,720
edge and vegetable and they're the

743
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:28,680
largest greenhouse show we have in the

744
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:30,569
US it's in July in Columbus Ohio it's

745
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:32,670
like I think maybe 30 bucks to get in

746
00:30:30,569 --> 00:30:34,379
the door I think education is maybe two

747
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:36,120
hundred dollars it's a really

748
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,730
inexpensive show but it brings about ten

749
00:30:36,119 --> 00:30:41,159
thousand greenhouse people on the

750
00:30:38,730 --> 00:30:43,769
Saturday before I have put together a

751
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:46,710
workshop in the morning it is going to

752
00:30:43,769 --> 00:30:48,210
be insect ID you want to learn those

753
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,860
five or six a food you need to know

754
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,690
we're going to teach you you want to

755
00:30:49,859 --> 00:30:53,429
learn the few common thrips we're going

756
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:55,140
to teach you then in the afternoon we're

757
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:59,070
going to go out to a commercial

758
00:30:55,140 --> 00:31:02,610
greenhouse and I've set up with myself

759
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:06,329
and then some of I will call them my a

760
00:31:02,609 --> 00:31:08,049
team biocontrol producing companies and

761
00:31:06,329 --> 00:31:09,490
their their specific people

762
00:31:08,049 --> 00:31:11,259
they're coming up hand pick who have

763
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,930
asked to help me and we are going to

764
00:31:11,259 --> 00:31:16,119
unpack biocontrol agents and show you

765
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:19,299
how to apply them correctly and we're

766
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:22,119
going to do everything from wasps to

767
00:31:19,299 --> 00:31:25,750
mite to nimah totes so if you want to

768
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:26,679
come learn how to do it first hand we're

769
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:29,230
going to be doing that there

770
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,950
unfortunately well you know I'm teaching

771
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:34,569
in a couple weeks at the bio bio

772
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:37,150
pesticide bio control conference we're

773
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:39,879
doing that specific bio control for

774
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:43,330
cannabis producers but that were limited

775
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,010
to being inside the hotel there

776
00:31:43,329 --> 00:31:46,899
and trust me hotels don't get really

777
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:50,049
excited when you start applying bugs

778
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,540
around on things in hotels so we're not

779
00:31:50,049 --> 00:31:54,819
going to be able to do live

780
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,369
demonstrations there which by the way I

781
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:59,319
think that has already sold out possibly

782
00:31:57,369 --> 00:32:01,000
because the conference contacted me and

783
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:02,230
asked if they could add more people

784
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,059
because I was trying to keep it to a

785
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:05,890
limited size but they said there's been

786
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,659
just so much demand that we might be

787
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,890
expanding the size of that so if you

788
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:11,200
haven't gotten registered you better

789
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:13,960
register now or get on the waitlist if

790
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,970
you want to be at that meeting it and a

791
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,590
tad you're coming yes I'll be there I've

792
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:19,779
got my ticket I signed up right away so

793
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:23,439
I'm really excited I also signed up for

794
00:32:19,779 --> 00:32:26,049
the greenhouse 2 or field tour the day

795
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,360
before the conference yes well most

796
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:30,009
likely it's because that sold out too

797
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:31,659
and it sounds like because they want me

798
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:33,339
to go on that to help with information

799
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,250
so I'm probably going to be in a chase

800
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:39,459
car going around with that too so I'll

801
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:40,720
see you on on that Wednesday too but you

802
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,100
know for these applications that you

803
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,710
know it's one thing to sit here and talk

804
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:46,990
about it it's another thing to see it

805
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:49,029
being done right in front of you where

806
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:51,700
you can ask questions and touch the

807
00:32:49,029 --> 00:32:56,289
equipment and have the experts in their

808
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:58,660
fields do that so I think that that is

809
00:32:56,289 --> 00:33:00,789
you know going to be super helpful that

810
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,610
show in in Columbus and again it's not

811
00:33:00,789 --> 00:33:06,339
it doesn't break the bank to attend that

812
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:07,479
show I actually last year we did another

813
00:33:06,339 --> 00:33:09,220
workshop and actually there were

814
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,450
cannabis people that came because again

815
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,579
there is a lot of crossover between

816
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:15,490
cannabis and ornamentals just like this

817
00:33:12,579 --> 00:33:17,049
nematode bucket here you know the

818
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:19,480
ornamental and vegetable guys we've had

819
00:33:17,049 --> 00:33:21,250
the answer to this and it's just somehow

820
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,000
the information didn't flow over into

821
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,039
cannabis

822
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,130
oh now here you go cannabis guys here

823
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:30,129
here's your easy solution to doing that

824
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:31,660
either the DRAM nematode bucket again

825
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,640
they've got videos and information right

826
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,150
on their website or use a fish bubbler

827
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:38,710
and with the dosatron and there you go

828
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:40,120
now with the fish bubbler are you

829
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,650
putting an airstone or anything on the

830
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:44,049
end of it are you just putting a line

831
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:46,540
directly and it's just bubbling hey

832
00:33:44,049 --> 00:33:48,069
depends on what size people are doing

833
00:33:46,539 --> 00:33:51,129
and you know we've done some tests with

834
00:33:48,069 --> 00:33:54,099
some of my growers but if you can kind

835
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,990
of aerate it where the hose is if you're

836
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:58,899
in a round bucket shooting so it kind of

837
00:33:55,990 --> 00:34:00,849
makes a toilet flushing world because

838
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,440
you again you want to keep everything

839
00:34:00,849 --> 00:34:05,740
kind of mixed up now another girl of

840
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,580
mine made like a bigger a bigger one in

841
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,710
the middle it almost looks like a

842
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:10,210
sprinkler head so it's pushing the

843
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:11,860
nematodes up and they're coming down the

844
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:13,148
sides but we did find some of the

845
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:16,360
nematodes we're getting trapped in the

846
00:34:13,148 --> 00:34:17,918
corners there and that's why I dram you

847
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:20,409
know I didn't realize because again I'm

848
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,119
not an engineer but you know we are

849
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:23,470
waiting for this bucket for a while and

850
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:28,659
it was because it was a lot harder to

851
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:30,398
engineer than they thought and I and it

852
00:34:28,659 --> 00:34:32,079
depends on the again back to the shape

853
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:33,849
of what you're doing because you got to

854
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:35,710
keep them moving and you don't get them

855
00:34:33,849 --> 00:34:38,378
trapped in corners but you also want to

856
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,329
aerate so look at what you're doing um

857
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:42,089
and you know as long as you're getting

858
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:44,049
them out in a reasonable amount of time

859
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:47,260
you just you don't want to let the

860
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:49,240
nematodes sit for hours in that you want

861
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:51,490
it you want to get them out into your

862
00:34:49,239 --> 00:34:53,709
grow I will warn you I had one

863
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:57,369
greenhouse operation to run there

864
00:34:53,710 --> 00:35:00,130
bubblers they tapped into the airline's

865
00:34:57,369 --> 00:35:02,049
for their I guess pneumatic greenhouse

866
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:04,360
tables because you know the they use the

867
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:06,610
the they step on a petal and it lifts

868
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:08,200
the table up but there were oil in those

869
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,230
lines and then oil got in there

870
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:12,609
nematodes so it sounds crazy but you got

871
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:13,990
have a clean air source and you have to

872
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:16,200
make sure it doesn't heat up and that's

873
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:18,669
what DRAM said was the other engineering

874
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:21,069
challenge is because if you compress air

875
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:23,650
it can create heat and in their early

876
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,960
designs the bucket actually heated up

877
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:27,519
and it would cook the nematodes so they

878
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:30,610
had an engineer a way to keep the

879
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:33,400
nematodes moving and oxygenated without

880
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:34,930
getting warm and is chlorine or

881
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,769
chloramines an issue when you're using

882
00:35:34,929 --> 00:35:37,719
nematodes

883
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:39,550
know it can affect the microbial content

884
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:41,049
and compost teas when I look under the

885
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:43,960
microscope but are you seeing anything

886
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:46,180
with nematodes is a big deal not really

887
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,769
I mean your average tap water drinking

888
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:53,469
water is fine and if if if if something

889
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:55,389
does kill nematodes then it would

890
00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:59,259
probably being used as animat aside out

891
00:35:55,389 --> 00:36:01,719
in the farm fields okay fair enough so

892
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:03,910
one of the things that you mentioned was

893
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:06,069
that informations not making it over

894
00:36:03,909 --> 00:36:08,019
from say the ornamental industry or the

895
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:10,960
horticulture industry over into cannabis

896
00:36:08,019 --> 00:36:12,730
and some of that relates to I would say

897
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,320
the the consultants that are out there

898
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:16,869
and I know you and I talked off air

899
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:19,510
about that a little bit in terms of

900
00:36:16,869 --> 00:36:20,949
pricing and the economics of the pest

901
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:23,500
management that you're seeing on

902
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:26,259
cannabis do you want to touch on any of

903
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:28,059
those topics real quickly yeah so and I

904
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:31,090
don't know maybe I'm snob I don't know

905
00:36:28,059 --> 00:36:35,049
but I I consider if someone is a

906
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:38,769
consultant they just consult I I don't

907
00:36:35,050 --> 00:36:41,080
understand how you can consult on your

908
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:44,710
own product you're selling you know I

909
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:45,940
consider if you are have a product for

910
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,800
sale and you're providing information

911
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,389
then your your technical support for

912
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,670
that product because to me consultant

913
00:36:49,389 --> 00:36:53,980
means unbiased and that's why I've

914
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:57,010
worked very hard with my business is I'm

915
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:58,990
not financially connected you know to I

916
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,900
don't get paid by the chemical companies

917
00:36:58,989 --> 00:37:04,419
I don't get paid by the insect arees to

918
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,210
to to promote their products I you know

919
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:09,639
if I recommend a product I never never

920
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:11,349
take any kind of kickbacks and it's been

921
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:13,179
tempting at times because people have

922
00:37:11,349 --> 00:37:14,679
offered me money they said hey we got

923
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:16,690
this huge sale let us give you a

924
00:37:14,679 --> 00:37:19,989
commission it's like no I can't take it

925
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,849
because that kind of ruins my neutrality

926
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:26,159
that I've worked so hard to build over

927
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:29,049
all these years so you know when when

928
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:30,759
somebody says they're a consultant you

929
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:33,490
know that's for you know find out well

930
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,090
do you sell anything and the other thing

931
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:38,409
I say always ask is is what you know

932
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,960
what is your background

933
00:37:38,409 --> 00:37:42,670
to be giving me advice even as a

934
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,780
technical support person okay you're

935
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:48,430
here to advise me on on insects well you

936
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,630
know what your background how have you

937
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:52,719
been doing this you know

938
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:55,630
these kinds of things and the thing

939
00:37:52,719 --> 00:37:59,669
right now with the cannabis industry is

940
00:37:55,630 --> 00:38:02,769
because there's been so much money in it

941
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:05,500
from the sense of people selling product

942
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:07,379
to cannabis growers what I have found

943
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:09,818
that I'm seeing this as nice as possible

944
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:11,440
you can make money selling products and

945
00:38:09,818 --> 00:38:13,000
not know anything about your products is

946
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,460
the biggest thing I've learned in the

947
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,750
last you know few years because there's

948
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:21,369
such a demand for products and such a

949
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,099
demand for people that are willing to be

950
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,420
able to work with the cannabis industry

951
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:28,750
because you know the university people

952
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,849
can't the government people can't and

953
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:33,278
you know there still is some stigma out

954
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,720
there with some companies where you know

955
00:38:33,278 --> 00:38:36,518
they don't want to be associated with it

956
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,889
so you know the pool of people the

957
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:41,588
cannabis industry can pull from to get

958
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:43,568
help is smaller than if you're a corn

959
00:38:41,588 --> 00:38:47,349
farmer or if you're you know a mom

960
00:38:43,568 --> 00:38:51,759
grower and so with that you've got to be

961
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:53,950
able to vet what people say and my first

962
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:56,650
thing is is just because you say it with

963
00:38:53,949 --> 00:38:59,230
confidence doesn't mean it's true and

964
00:38:56,650 --> 00:39:02,108
that has been you know and I literally

965
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:04,599
had a grower that was buying product

966
00:39:02,108 --> 00:39:05,920
from a company and the recommendations I

967
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:07,359
just did not understand the

968
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,369
recommendations at all it was the

969
00:39:07,358 --> 00:39:12,400
complete wrong predatory mite for the

970
00:39:09,369 --> 00:39:13,690
situation and I asked the groom like

971
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:16,119
well why are you doing this well because

972
00:39:13,690 --> 00:39:18,608
the supplier told me to and I'm like

973
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:20,528
well did you ask him and question him

974
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:22,268
why are you telling me to use this might

975
00:39:20,528 --> 00:39:24,009
and she's like well no because he said

976
00:39:22,268 --> 00:39:26,078
it with such confidence he was so sure

977
00:39:24,009 --> 00:39:28,088
the way he said things so I just

978
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,890
believed him and I don't want to say you

979
00:39:28,088 --> 00:39:33,099
know you had to be skeptical and not

980
00:39:29,889 --> 00:39:35,889
trust anybody but the canvas people just

981
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:39,039
need to do some better vetting and it's

982
00:39:35,889 --> 00:39:43,118
it's hard to do because you know I was

983
00:39:39,039 --> 00:39:44,380
at a meeting where I met you and you

984
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:46,420
know there was a lot of talks on

985
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:48,068
lighting and I'm not saying anybody said

986
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,048
anything about lighting was wrong or bad

987
00:39:48,068 --> 00:39:52,449
because you know what I don't know

988
00:39:50,048 --> 00:39:53,920
enough about lighting to even know if

989
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:55,028
what people were telling me was true or

990
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,528
not and as I was sitting there that's

991
00:39:55,028 --> 00:39:58,119
what I was thinking and they're saying

992
00:39:56,528 --> 00:39:59,199
you know this is the best to do here and

993
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:01,150
use this here and there and it's like

994
00:39:59,199 --> 00:40:02,618
how do I know they're true yeah they're

995
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,680
standing up on the stage

996
00:40:02,619 --> 00:40:08,619
and saying things but how do we know and

997
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:11,768
it's very hard to be able to vet a

998
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:14,619
subject that you're not educated on I

999
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:17,318
can only vet really you know people that

1000
00:40:14,619 --> 00:40:19,420
I can vet what's being said about

1001
00:40:17,318 --> 00:40:21,369
subject areas I know about but like

1002
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,289
Lighting's not one so you know I can't

1003
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:25,298
tell you if it's true or not and it's

1004
00:40:23,289 --> 00:40:29,730
how is a grower do you do that and it's

1005
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:32,199
very very difficult um there is no doubt

1006
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:34,778
yeah it is difficult we were talking

1007
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:36,939
about that how from the outside looking

1008
00:40:34,778 --> 00:40:38,259
in it's it's almost impossible to know

1009
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,809
if the information you're getting is

1010
00:40:38,259 --> 00:40:43,990
good or not so how would you if you were

1011
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:46,210
a grower go about vetting they go about

1012
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:51,598
vetting a potential consultant when it

1013
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:55,358
comes to insects so I have like my my

1014
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:58,059
list of questions that I will tell to my

1015
00:40:55,358 --> 00:41:00,219
growers and like ask these questions and

1016
00:40:58,059 --> 00:41:02,278
see what kind of answers you get and

1017
00:41:00,219 --> 00:41:06,969
that can they're there certain things

1018
00:41:02,278 --> 00:41:09,429
like that that are just sure telltale

1019
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:12,038
signs that they don't know what they're

1020
00:41:09,429 --> 00:41:16,118
talking about and it can be - you know

1021
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:18,849
knowing about lighting on insects and

1022
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:21,579
you know who needs light who doesn't

1023
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:24,338
need light things like that the other

1024
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:26,619
thing is - if if you know you you have

1025
00:41:24,338 --> 00:41:28,420
an insect problem and all right let's

1026
00:41:26,619 --> 00:41:31,869
say let's say you've got broad mite and

1027
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,838
I come in and I said okay you know let's

1028
00:41:31,869 --> 00:41:37,660
let's queue cámaras you as a grower

1029
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:40,239
should say to me okay Suzanne why are

1030
00:41:37,659 --> 00:41:43,808
you telling me to use Q camaris and I

1031
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:46,869
just say well because it's the best not

1032
00:41:43,809 --> 00:41:48,220
good enough that is not the right answer

1033
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:50,559
we should be able to discuss

1034
00:41:48,219 --> 00:41:52,808
temperatures what other crops we've done

1035
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:56,680
this in and all this kind of information

1036
00:41:52,809 --> 00:41:57,819
and if any of anybody on your listening

1037
00:41:56,679 --> 00:42:00,998
or one of the people that I've been in

1038
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:02,588
your groves you know I and it's almost

1039
00:42:00,998 --> 00:42:05,528
too much I'm going to overload you with

1040
00:42:02,588 --> 00:42:07,778
information because I want to give you

1041
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:10,568
all the facts and all my years of

1042
00:42:07,778 --> 00:42:14,230
experience of doing this to be like this

1043
00:42:10,568 --> 00:42:15,639
is you know what we're what you know why

1044
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,420
we're making these decisions because

1045
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:18,279
there are situate

1046
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,220
and cannabis and I'm you know dealing

1047
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:22,300
with us a lot we have a pest we may not

1048
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:25,149
know how to treat it

1049
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:27,250
and I'm going to say we don't know and

1050
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:30,700
let's try this but here's our

1051
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,989
contingency plan and and anybody that

1052
00:42:30,699 --> 00:42:34,059
comes in is just like well I'm going to

1053
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:36,009
solve all your problems overnight just

1054
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:39,119
buy all these bugs for me and dump them

1055
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:44,140
out that isn't that is not a plan and

1056
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:47,440
you have to be very careful on that to

1057
00:42:44,139 --> 00:42:49,089
do that and I don't want to I don't want

1058
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,900
to give you away my lake telltale

1059
00:42:49,090 --> 00:42:56,230
questions necessarily because I know

1060
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:58,300
that some of the people that sell BIOS

1061
00:42:56,230 --> 00:42:59,740
are going to listen to this podcast and

1062
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,780
if I get then they're going to be able

1063
00:42:59,739 --> 00:43:03,279
to hear the questions no that makes

1064
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:07,150
sense I know it's just such a challenge

1065
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,710
and yeah one of the others good you can

1066
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:10,389
always contact me believe me I get

1067
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:11,980
emails and again I'm struggling right

1068
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:15,279
now because I do get between like forty

1069
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,329
to sixty emails a day right now and I'm

1070
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,630
struggling to keep my head above water

1071
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:21,250
but you know if you just say hey Suzanne

1072
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:23,230
you know it you know you're a smaller

1073
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:24,760
girl or something and you know you don't

1074
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,990
necessarily that you don't I'm not

1075
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,210
looking for people to hire me but if you

1076
00:43:25,989 --> 00:43:30,339
just are like okay this is where I'm at

1077
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:32,199
this is what we're doing who's somebody

1078
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:33,640
good to work with I can just be like go

1079
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:35,829
talk to this person go talk to that

1080
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:39,009
person because I can't handle

1081
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:40,929
I can't work with everybody and some

1082
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:43,480
people did they don't need me I'm more

1083
00:43:40,929 --> 00:43:45,940
of the the problem solver when

1084
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:49,059
everything's gone to crap I come in and

1085
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,829
help fix a situation or you know do

1086
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:52,599
training to like teach you how do you

1087
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:56,829
recognize the problems early how do you

1088
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:59,380
set up you know better SOPs for you know

1089
00:43:56,829 --> 00:44:01,269
your workflow on pest management in your

1090
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:03,220
greenhouse but just as far as you know

1091
00:44:01,269 --> 00:44:05,199
hey I don't have problems really but I

1092
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:07,359
want to get started with BIOS you know I

1093
00:44:05,199 --> 00:44:09,819
can definitely point you in the right

1094
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,099
direction and it's going to depend where

1095
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,660
you are in the United States are you and

1096
00:44:12,099 --> 00:44:16,000
endure you outdoor grow

1097
00:44:13,659 --> 00:44:17,920
what are your keep s I mean there is not

1098
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,960
I'm not always going to tell everybody

1099
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,510
to go to one supplier for one thing no

1100
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:25,510
it's it all depends on those different

1101
00:44:22,510 --> 00:44:28,750
variables and there's no reason growers

1102
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:29,570
can't do their own research and track

1103
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,400
data and

1104
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:33,200
use the scientific method to figure out

1105
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,820
what works in their environment so I

1106
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:36,199
think that's important too I mean

1107
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,090
consultants can point you in the right

1108
00:44:36,199 --> 00:44:40,399
direction but you can still learn a lot

1109
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,530
yourself oh yeah and the one thing that

1110
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,480
I'm seeing with as you brought it up the

1111
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:47,269
scientific method cannabis people are

1112
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:49,039
not doing controls and this is I keep

1113
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:51,320
telling people that are buying these six

1114
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:55,039
seven eight hundred dollar spray

1115
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:57,230
products that there's like you know five

1116
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:59,210
dollars worth of product in the bottle

1117
00:44:57,230 --> 00:45:01,940
you know spray your plans with that

1118
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:03,530
triple wrench or sprayer and then spray

1119
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,240
a couple plants with just water the

1120
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:08,870
exact same way and see if you get the

1121
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:11,119
same results because cannabis growers

1122
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:13,309
can get much better spray coverage

1123
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,739
because you have a much you have a lot

1124
00:45:13,309 --> 00:45:17,420
fewer plants you know my background is

1125
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:19,909
coming from you know where someone has

1126
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:21,260
to go spray ten acres of plants and

1127
00:45:19,909 --> 00:45:23,299
they're not going to get good spray

1128
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,120
coverage and that's why you know they're

1129
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:28,400
using you know they have these like

1130
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:31,250
systemic and trans laminer pesticides

1131
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,349
and things like that because they can't

1132
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,960
get as good a spray coverage with the

1133
00:45:33,349 --> 00:45:37,909
soaps and oils cannabis you should be

1134
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,360
able to get really really really good

1135
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:43,759
spray coverage and you can get they have

1136
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:45,320
what are called water sensitive cards

1137
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:47,900
there are these yellow cards and they

1138
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:49,550
look like sticky cards and on a sidenote

1139
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:51,380
sticky cards if I go into another

1140
00:45:49,550 --> 00:45:52,880
cannabis grow that does not have sticky

1141
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,890
cards I'm going to poke somebody in the

1142
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,559
eye you guys need to use sticky cards

1143
00:45:54,889 --> 00:45:59,539
but let me go back now I will go back to

1144
00:45:57,559 --> 00:46:02,000
my focus so these cards look like yellow

1145
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:04,940
sticky cards but once they get water or

1146
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,489
moisture on them they turn blue and so

1147
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:09,380
what my ornamental people will do is

1148
00:46:07,489 --> 00:46:11,419
they will basically kind of hide these

1149
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:13,010
out on the crops and then have somebody

1150
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,690
come through and spray and then you can

1151
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,610
come back and look and see what kind of

1152
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,559
spray coverage you are getting and if

1153
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:21,650
those cards are still yellow then that

1154
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:25,009
means that area got no product but you

1155
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:27,079
know there is you know something to just

1156
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:28,790
washing your plans off with water for

1157
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:31,429
things like spider mite management even

1158
00:46:28,789 --> 00:46:33,590
if it's just that physical knocking off

1159
00:46:31,429 --> 00:46:35,599
the plant it also raises the humidity

1160
00:46:33,590 --> 00:46:38,480
and spider mites don't necessarily like

1161
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,400
that so I'm suspect about some of these

1162
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,380
products these mega expensive products

1163
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,320
that they're putting out that I think

1164
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,110
that pause

1165
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:48,180
the water is doing a lot of the control

1166
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:49,829
because we've tested a lot of these

1167
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:53,279
products in the ornamental market and we

1168
00:46:49,829 --> 00:46:56,009
just don't get the results yeah having

1169
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:58,410
been in the cannabis industry for a few

1170
00:46:56,010 --> 00:46:58,980
years now I'm it's made me a really big

1171
00:46:58,409 --> 00:47:00,869
skeptic

1172
00:46:58,980 --> 00:47:03,210
in terms of products and marketing

1173
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:04,889
claims and so the first thing I do when

1174
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,300
I'm evaluating a product is I want to

1175
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,920
see all the ingredients so I want to

1176
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,120
know that they're willing to list all

1177
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,820
the ingredients and the moment I hear

1178
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:13,769
the word proprietary a lot of red flags

1179
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:15,870
come out and then the next thing I look

1180
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:17,969
for is is this product being used in

1181
00:47:15,869 --> 00:47:19,710
horticulture or an ornamental industry

1182
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:21,209
somewhere outside of cannabis or are

1183
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:23,099
they marketing strictly to cannabis

1184
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:24,929
because if it really worked all that

1185
00:47:23,099 --> 00:47:27,389
well and had all this efficacy whether

1186
00:47:24,929 --> 00:47:28,649
it's a fertilizer or a pesticide it

1187
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:31,469
wouldn't just be in the cannabis

1188
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:34,019
industry so people really need to do the

1189
00:47:31,469 --> 00:47:35,669
research because the they're spending

1190
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:39,210
way too much money on these products I

1191
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:41,369
totally agree and and for you those of

1192
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:43,139
you that were at the organic meeting

1193
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:45,779
where I spoke in Portland I guess two or

1194
00:47:43,139 --> 00:47:46,889
three weekends ago you know but the one

1195
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:51,390
thing I talked about a lot was

1196
00:47:46,889 --> 00:47:53,129
poinsettias and poinsettias make so

1197
00:47:51,389 --> 00:47:54,960
little money off the plants you know

1198
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,570
they have a few cent profit margins on

1199
00:47:54,960 --> 00:48:00,690
them and so if a product is being used

1200
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:03,660
in poinsettias you know it has to work

1201
00:48:00,690 --> 00:48:04,980
because a grower like if I go to a point

1202
00:48:03,659 --> 00:48:07,619
set a grower and say okay we're going to

1203
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:09,030
spend five cents more a plant they are

1204
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:10,980
going to be like there's the door

1205
00:48:09,030 --> 00:48:15,600
because they can't afford to put a five

1206
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:17,909
more sense of input into that plant so

1207
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,739
that's a good indicator if it's

1208
00:48:17,909 --> 00:48:22,440
something that is used in point study a

1209
00:48:19,739 --> 00:48:26,069
production actually used you know it

1210
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:29,400
works because you the poinsettia guys

1211
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:32,430
can't afford to use it unless it does

1212
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,829
work and we do a lot of product testing

1213
00:48:32,429 --> 00:48:37,559
and poinsettias because again the

1214
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:39,659
product profit margin is so slim and I

1215
00:48:37,559 --> 00:48:41,849
came off I mentioned this before but one

1216
00:48:39,659 --> 00:48:44,250
of my greenhouse growing operations or

1217
00:48:41,849 --> 00:48:46,769
ornamental ones we did order in for

1218
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:48,809
entertainment purposes I will say you

1219
00:48:46,769 --> 00:48:50,699
know a bunch of these cannabis products

1220
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:53,610
that are you know on the twenty five be

1221
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:55,710
exempt list so they don't have to have

1222
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:56,970
EPA registration and we tested them and

1223
00:48:55,710 --> 00:49:00,150
we just we either burn the

1224
00:48:56,969 --> 00:49:03,629
is up or we just didn't get get any kind

1225
00:49:00,150 --> 00:49:06,960
of control with them and so you have to

1226
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:08,760
be very careful and I mean like I think

1227
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,679
soil is a good example and I don't you

1228
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:12,240
know keep going back to that you know I

1229
00:49:10,679 --> 00:49:13,889
mean it's not that you know again this

1230
00:49:12,239 --> 00:49:15,449
is not a commercial for stuff oil but

1231
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:17,489
just looking at costs where you can get

1232
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:20,069
a jug of stuff well I think from the

1233
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:23,250
[ __ ] supply companies it's maybe 60 $70

1234
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:25,820
for a large jug I think Amazon I think

1235
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:30,059
they want like 120 where I'm seeing

1236
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:31,710
products that have half the size of that

1237
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:34,049
and they're being sold for six or seven

1238
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:37,019
hundred which don't have the efficacy or

1239
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:40,109
safety track record and also these plant

1240
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:42,840
botanicals we don't know how they impact

1241
00:49:40,108 --> 00:49:44,400
the biocontrol agents we have a solid

1242
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:46,740
history with using some oil acts with

1243
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,650
predatory mites but once you get in to

1244
00:49:46,739 --> 00:49:51,779
plant extracts as we talked about some

1245
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:54,119
of the plant extracts have repelling

1246
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:56,430
qualities we know neem is a repellent

1247
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,349
doesn't even work well enough to repel

1248
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:59,909
all your pests away but there is some

1249
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:01,769
research showing you know where they

1250
00:49:59,909 --> 00:50:03,539
spray leaves with neem they spray and

1251
00:50:01,769 --> 00:50:04,829
leaves with as it are actin they put

1252
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,539
predatory mites on them and they just

1253
00:50:04,829 --> 00:50:08,250
like nope we're not going to stay as

1254
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:11,159
compared to untreated leaves they will

1255
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:12,690
stay on and you know the period of with

1256
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:15,868
self ILX of when you can start

1257
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:17,820
reintroducing yes of oil once it's dry

1258
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:20,940
will spray on a Monday we're releasing

1259
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:22,470
on Tuesdays now with the Tetra curb I

1260
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:24,510
just had a conversation with them I

1261
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:27,029
think they're after their miticide

1262
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:29,390
product they're saying they would they

1263
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:33,330
just feel comfortable as a general rule

1264
00:50:29,389 --> 00:50:35,129
two days is what they're recommending on

1265
00:50:33,329 --> 00:50:37,259
that and you know they're being very

1266
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:39,030
general because well are we releasing

1267
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:41,760
cucumbers are releasing sworsky are

1268
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:43,470
releasing for symbolist because when you

1269
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:44,760
get into more specific chemistry's I

1270
00:50:43,469 --> 00:50:47,039
think floor mites a really good example

1271
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:49,230
even though legal cannabis you know

1272
00:50:47,039 --> 00:50:51,449
they're not using it but flora might has

1273
00:50:49,230 --> 00:50:53,309
always been very toted touted as very

1274
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:55,199
safe with with beneficials and predatory

1275
00:50:53,309 --> 00:50:58,079
mites it's interesting cuz it's very

1276
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,719
safe with using personalists and QQ

1277
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,900
marys but it can be very toxic to

1278
00:51:00,719 --> 00:51:05,789
sworsky so when you get into some of

1279
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:09,809
these other chemistry's you have to

1280
00:51:05,789 --> 00:51:10,860
specifically look into you know the

1281
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:12,539
specific you can

1282
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:15,750
just paint with a broad brush and as

1283
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:18,599
soon as a product says to me we kill

1284
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,880
pests but we're safe with beneficials I

1285
00:51:18,599 --> 00:51:22,829
call BS on that product because whether

1286
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,650
something is a pest or a beneficial is

1287
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:27,630
all subjective to who you are and what

1288
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:29,820
you're trying to do the products are not

1289
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:32,130
sentient and can't make those decisions

1290
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:35,130
and so that's another telltale on

1291
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:38,070
products for me is is how they are

1292
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:43,260
marketing what their claims are and with

1293
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:45,960
the 25b products technically they're

1294
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:47,490
supposed to not make false claims but

1295
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:50,070
they're not really getting police and

1296
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:53,689
I've seen crazy claims that products

1297
00:51:50,070 --> 00:51:55,620
being systemic when they're not and and

1298
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:57,780
eventually it will probably catch up

1299
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:59,309
with them because again with a twenty

1300
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,380
five B you know you can list whatever

1301
00:51:59,309 --> 00:52:03,239
insecticides you want but you're not

1302
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:04,920
supposed to lie on those labels and if

1303
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:06,839
the government does come and knock and

1304
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:09,300
you better have proof of your claims and

1305
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:11,880
again it's eventually they're going to

1306
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,830
start cracking down yeah and you

1307
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,539
mentioned I would just throw that that

1308
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:16,949
also includes plant washes as well

1309
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:19,440
people are listing things as plant

1310
00:52:16,949 --> 00:52:21,839
washes and then telling you you know off

1311
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:23,309
off label that they're insecticides so

1312
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,070
that's something else to watch out for

1313
00:52:23,309 --> 00:52:28,590
yeah because they've proven you don't

1314
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:30,660
know what's in them yeah and you also

1315
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,610
mentioned that phyto toxicity is not

1316
00:52:30,659 --> 00:52:34,259
always something you can visually see so

1317
00:52:32,610 --> 00:52:36,150
some of these botanicals may have an

1318
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:37,470
impact or be stressing the plant and you

1319
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:40,050
might not even realize it

1320
00:52:37,469 --> 00:52:42,750
yes and you know they did that the the

1321
00:52:40,050 --> 00:52:44,010
most I think the most textbook study

1322
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:46,889
that was with you know when they were

1323
00:52:44,010 --> 00:52:48,870
using the ivory soap on tomatoes where

1324
00:52:46,889 --> 00:52:50,429
they got lower yield using Irish soap

1325
00:52:48,869 --> 00:52:51,719
and compared to an insecticidal soap

1326
00:52:50,429 --> 00:52:53,369
even though you didn't see photo

1327
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:58,019
toxicity on the plant it definitely

1328
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:59,519
affected the yield on that so I want to

1329
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:01,380
circle back around we talked a little

1330
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:02,909
about two other consultants out there

1331
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:04,200
and some of the recommendations you were

1332
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:05,670
hearing that you weren't very excited

1333
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:08,309
about and one of the things you had

1334
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,869
mentioned sorry off air was that

1335
00:53:08,309 --> 00:53:11,549
consultants were not recommending

1336
00:53:09,869 --> 00:53:13,529
treatment and propagation or early in

1337
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:17,400
the plant's life when there's so much

1338
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:19,290
less leaf tissue and it's easier to you

1339
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:21,329
know easier to do lower rates do you

1340
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:23,009
want to touch on that a little bit yeah

1341
00:53:21,329 --> 00:53:24,840
and see this is what makes me think that

1342
00:53:23,010 --> 00:53:26,250
they don't know what they're doing or

1343
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:28,490
they're just trying to make more money

1344
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:30,989
off off the growers and you know what

1345
00:53:28,489 --> 00:53:32,849
everybody deserves to be in business

1346
00:53:30,989 --> 00:53:34,319
everybody deserves to make a living I am

1347
00:53:32,849 --> 00:53:38,880
not trying to take a living away from

1348
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:40,620
anybody just you know when you have to

1349
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,619
do pest management and propagation you

1350
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:45,420
cannot wait because if you wait you may

1351
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,519
not be able to treat the problem or it

1352
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,530
may be too expensive to treat for the

1353
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:52,139
problem and it can get very expensive to

1354
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:53,250
try to be curative and I'm sure a lot of

1355
00:53:52,139 --> 00:53:54,599
people are going to be shaking their

1356
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:56,849
heads because they look at the money

1357
00:53:54,599 --> 00:54:00,659
they've spent and some of these

1358
00:53:56,849 --> 00:54:02,670
recommendations I've heard if just the

1359
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:04,049
person that said hey this is what we're

1360
00:54:02,670 --> 00:54:05,430
going to do for that I could have told

1361
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:08,039
you from the beginning it wasn't going

1362
00:54:05,429 --> 00:54:10,079
to work I now get it I don't know

1363
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:11,550
everything and some situations and you

1364
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:13,469
know we don't know but there's some

1365
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:18,210
things we know just aren't going to work

1366
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:21,029
and you have to be you know talk to more

1367
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:24,179
than one person I I tell all my growers

1368
00:54:21,030 --> 00:54:27,450
work with at least two different insect

1369
00:54:24,179 --> 00:54:29,579
arees you know so that you have you know

1370
00:54:27,449 --> 00:54:30,049
do you have more than one person to talk

1371
00:54:29,579 --> 00:54:32,940
to

1372
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:33,269
like Kelly vans with beneficial insect

1373
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:35,789
eree

1374
00:54:33,269 --> 00:54:38,369
I think he does a great job but I

1375
00:54:35,789 --> 00:54:40,289
guarantee you he will not be offended at

1376
00:54:38,369 --> 00:54:42,630
all if you know you turn around and you

1377
00:54:40,289 --> 00:54:45,389
go ask you know like Paul cool from bio

1378
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:48,329
best you know hey we've got this problem

1379
00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:51,599
I think that people like Kelly and Paul

1380
00:54:48,329 --> 00:54:53,579
will kind of be glad that the grower is

1381
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,239
taking initiative to do your homework

1382
00:54:53,579 --> 00:54:58,799
and what you'll often find is that with

1383
00:54:57,239 --> 00:55:00,149
these people that I think have been

1384
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:04,260
doing a very good job you'll get very

1385
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:06,090
similar answers not that you always have

1386
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,950
to do the exact same thing to get the

1387
00:55:06,090 --> 00:55:09,990
same answer because you can have spider

1388
00:55:07,949 --> 00:55:11,639
mites and there's possible different

1389
00:55:09,989 --> 00:55:15,839
routes to take to manage spider mites

1390
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:18,449
but I don't think that with that these

1391
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:20,850
good solid pest management people get

1392
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:23,339
upset when you question their

1393
00:55:20,849 --> 00:55:25,469
recommendations because again it makes

1394
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:27,630
me feel good when you question me it

1395
00:55:25,469 --> 00:55:28,919
does because that means you care and

1396
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:31,500
you're taking the time to educate

1397
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:34,460
yourself so you just have to be very

1398
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:37,289
careful with these recommendations and

1399
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:38,210
if somebody's working with you and if

1400
00:55:37,289 --> 00:55:40,279
they have no

1401
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:43,190
but put together a program for your

1402
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,859
propagation or you know they've been

1403
00:55:43,190 --> 00:55:47,450
just focusing on you know releasing at

1404
00:55:45,858 --> 00:55:50,239
the end of the crop I would say find

1405
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:53,059
somebody else to work with you've got to

1406
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:54,139
start and propagation and you know and

1407
00:55:53,059 --> 00:55:55,880
again I hate keep going back to

1408
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:57,829
ornamentals but like the ornamentals

1409
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,150
we're sticking our cuttings and we're

1410
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:02,059
getting the beneficials right out they

1411
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:04,369
all get nematodes you know right as soon

1412
00:56:02,059 --> 00:56:06,259
as they're stock and you need air quotes

1413
00:56:04,369 --> 00:56:08,480
here because you've got a look at your

1414
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:09,770
media and you know those kinds of things

1415
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,789
and how you're propagating because

1416
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:14,449
they're not going to work in all systems

1417
00:56:10,789 --> 00:56:16,219
but if you're rooting in soil you should

1418
00:56:14,449 --> 00:56:18,108
be putting nematodes right in from the

1419
00:56:16,219 --> 00:56:20,149
get-go I mean that's just standard

1420
00:56:18,108 --> 00:56:21,739
that's standard inexpensive practice

1421
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:24,108
because if you can stop the fungus gnats

1422
00:56:21,739 --> 00:56:26,059
then I'm not going to get the call when

1423
00:56:24,108 --> 00:56:28,608
you're out in your grow with a mascara

1424
00:56:26,059 --> 00:56:31,969
brush trying to brush you know fungus

1425
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:33,170
gnats out of your blooms yeah and the

1426
00:56:31,969 --> 00:56:35,449
last thing I wanna touch on on this

1427
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:37,250
subject is pricing so you said you've

1428
00:56:35,449 --> 00:56:39,379
seen some pretty dramatic price

1429
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:42,980
increases for cannabis growers over

1430
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:44,720
other crops I don't know I won't say

1431
00:56:42,980 --> 00:56:47,119
it's a price increase I will just say

1432
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:51,709
that the cannabis people are paying way

1433
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,960
more than then the ornamental markets

1434
00:56:51,710 --> 00:56:56,990
are and I will say this very delicately

1435
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:58,070
as possible without everybody hating me

1436
00:56:56,989 --> 00:57:00,858
and I'm sure I'm going to get some nasty

1437
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:03,170
emails but it's typically through the

1438
00:57:00,858 --> 00:57:05,929
distributors I'm seeing some pretty

1439
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:07,608
exorbitant pricing now I do understand

1440
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:09,649
you know that if they're caught if

1441
00:57:07,608 --> 00:57:12,319
they're calling on you providing a good

1442
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:14,630
service they're educating you you know

1443
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:17,088
you do have to pay for some of that in

1444
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:19,070
your pricing there's there's no doubt

1445
00:57:17,088 --> 00:57:21,440
about that I think that you know if you

1446
00:57:19,070 --> 00:57:23,570
pay five percent and I'm just making

1447
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,409
that number up ten percent more but

1448
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,530
you're getting good customer service

1449
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:29,299
it's worth it you know and I have no

1450
00:57:27,530 --> 00:57:31,940
problem for I mean I don't think that's

1451
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:35,990
an issue but what I take issue with is I

1452
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:39,920
am seeing as much as you know a hundred

1453
00:57:35,989 --> 00:57:42,049
percent if not more price increases and

1454
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:44,900
they're just not even getting good

1455
00:57:42,050 --> 00:57:46,250
information so the bottom line is people

1456
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:48,920
need to do their own research as a

1457
00:57:46,250 --> 00:57:51,320
grower you need to you need to look

1458
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:51,829
choppy round you need to find out who

1459
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,600
knows what there

1460
00:57:51,829 --> 00:57:54,829
talking about and double-check what

1461
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:57,019
they're telling you with someone else so

1462
00:57:54,829 --> 00:57:59,049
that that just puts the onus on the

1463
00:57:57,019 --> 00:58:02,239
growers all it really comes down to

1464
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:05,630
right right and I mean and and the thing

1465
00:58:02,239 --> 00:58:08,089
is is it may seem like a huge hump at

1466
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:11,599
first but once you get over this hump

1467
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:14,120
and you learn these basics then it gets

1468
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,250
easier sadly I don't think my job gets

1469
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:17,929
easier every year but because I always

1470
00:58:16,250 --> 00:58:20,150
have new challenges but you know you

1471
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:21,409
once you've experienced a problem and

1472
00:58:20,150 --> 00:58:23,960
been able to get through it you know

1473
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:26,659
then you know for the next time and it

1474
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:29,630
does get easier as for a grower when

1475
00:58:26,659 --> 00:58:32,000
you're dealing in a mono cropping system

1476
00:58:29,630 --> 00:58:34,070
in that way and again with the

1477
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:36,019
information I mean I really feel like

1478
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:40,220
the cannabis industry is hijacked the

1479
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:44,179
internet just be very very very careful

1480
00:58:40,219 --> 00:58:46,730
and selective about what you read online

1481
00:58:44,179 --> 00:58:48,619
and many years ago I had to stop trying

1482
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:50,420
to answer all these questions and then

1483
00:58:48,619 --> 00:58:53,119
now it's like I even struggle with some

1484
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:55,099
of the the group's the the message

1485
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:57,109
boards because I just I get mad because

1486
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:59,269
I see what growers are being told to do

1487
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:01,190
or someone puts up a picture of an aphid

1488
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:04,130
and someone's like oh you know that's a

1489
00:59:01,190 --> 00:59:05,690
winged you know fungus gnats because but

1490
00:59:04,130 --> 00:59:08,240
they say it so it's sort of like they

1491
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:12,800
know and it's not accurate information

1492
00:59:08,239 --> 00:59:14,809
so you just really have to you have to

1493
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:19,100
educate yourself and you have to go to

1494
00:59:14,809 --> 00:59:20,809
good sources to get educated so that you

1495
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:22,759
are not more knowledgeable and you're

1496
00:59:20,809 --> 00:59:26,179
not spending you know I've heard growers

1497
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:29,000
paying $1 a sachet you know for the

1498
00:59:26,179 --> 00:59:30,409
release systems and you know ornamental

1499
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:33,949
guys and again there's differences in

1500
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:35,299
pricing between biocontrol agents you

1501
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:36,919
know is it q comparison there is a

1502
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,100
source key in there is it Andrew Sony in

1503
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:42,980
there and then also volume you know if

1504
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:44,869
you need five sachets you know you're

1505
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:47,690
probably going to have to pay more than

1506
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:50,719
my grower getting 10,000 sachets but you

1507
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:52,700
know the the sachets with like cue

1508
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:54,559
cámaras you know they can be you know

1509
00:59:52,699 --> 00:59:57,319
ornamental people are paying maybe 15

1510
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,299
cents for those you know and to hear

1511
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:01,670
people paying you know these exorbitant

1512
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:03,950
prices and again everybody deserves to

1513
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:05,420
make a living and you know the

1514
01:00:03,949 --> 01:00:05,779
distributors do need to have a bit of a

1515
01:00:05,420 --> 01:00:07,190
mark

1516
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:09,500
for their business for the service

1517
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:11,450
they're supplying and everything but it

1518
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:13,849
better come with some really really

1519
01:00:11,449 --> 01:00:17,598
really good information and some amazing

1520
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:19,760
customer service if ah you're getting

1521
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:21,920
those kinds of markups I don't think

1522
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:24,590
it's been any secret for me I mean I'd

1523
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:26,539
really push my growers to you know buy a

1524
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,800
bit more direct from the insector ease

1525
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:30,710
in the sense of having the product

1526
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:32,750
dropship direct to the insectary direct

1527
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:34,159
to you from the grower but if you got

1528
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,349
three plants at your house you're not

1529
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:37,909
going to be able to your the volumes are

1530
01:00:36,349 --> 01:00:40,609
going to be too large the packaging is

1531
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:42,500
going to be too large for you to do that

1532
01:00:40,608 --> 01:00:45,519
the insect trees are really set up to be

1533
01:00:42,500 --> 01:00:47,630
sold to commercial growing operations

1534
01:00:45,519 --> 01:00:49,009
yeah and something I want to touch on

1535
01:00:47,630 --> 01:00:51,050
again that you mentioned that I think is

1536
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:54,140
important that we've kind of glossed

1537
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:55,580
over is once you have an IPM program in

1538
01:00:54,139 --> 01:00:57,769
place and once you have the right

1539
01:00:55,579 --> 01:00:59,900
procedures in place with the dipping and

1540
01:00:57,769 --> 01:01:02,480
the scouting and you have the right

1541
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,160
staff there it becomes very easy it's

1542
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:05,630
not like at that point that you're

1543
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:08,118
putting in all this time and energy and

1544
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:10,280
money into bio controls it really runs

1545
01:01:08,119 --> 01:01:11,960
itself so I don't want people to get

1546
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:14,390
discouraged like you mentioned because I

1547
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,619
think that it is very possible in yuria

1548
01:01:14,389 --> 01:01:16,969
you're working with people that are

1549
01:01:15,619 --> 01:01:17,358
doing it already and doing it really

1550
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:19,129
well

1551
01:01:17,358 --> 01:01:23,059
so and you know this idea that

1552
01:01:19,130 --> 01:01:25,550
biocontrol doesn't work so when do when

1553
01:01:23,059 --> 01:01:28,099
do I get a phone call when they have

1554
01:01:25,550 --> 01:01:30,230
sprayed and tried everything and they

1555
01:01:28,099 --> 01:01:32,240
want me to come you know sometimes fix

1556
01:01:30,230 --> 01:01:33,588
the problem because they can't get it

1557
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:37,129
under control and this is true across

1558
01:01:33,588 --> 01:01:41,269
you know all crops but the thing with

1559
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:44,838
the the cannabis again if you start

1560
01:01:41,269 --> 01:01:47,239
early that you don't get there but

1561
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:50,838
imagine cannabis growers out there if

1562
01:01:47,239 --> 01:01:52,699
you had to grow you know 200 varieties

1563
01:01:50,838 --> 01:01:55,779
of plants and you perpetually had new

1564
01:01:52,699 --> 01:01:58,250
cuttings coming in the door from other

1565
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,050
countries and from other growers and you

1566
01:01:58,250 --> 01:02:03,139
had this perpetual train of pest coming

1567
01:02:00,050 --> 01:02:05,990
in and how hard that is to manage this

1568
01:02:03,139 --> 01:02:07,250
is why not all but a lot of the

1569
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:09,259
ornamental people have definitely

1570
01:02:07,250 --> 01:02:11,030
shifted into using the bio controls

1571
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:13,369
especially in propagation because

1572
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:16,190
they're able to stop the problems there

1573
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:19,809
before they get started and also they're

1574
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:23,179
not spraying pesticides there that

1575
01:02:19,809 --> 01:02:25,009
can create resistance issues even if you

1576
01:02:23,179 --> 01:02:27,739
rotate pesticides through motives of

1577
01:02:25,009 --> 01:02:29,900
actions you can still develop resistance

1578
01:02:27,739 --> 01:02:32,028
issues and you know you when you get

1579
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:34,039
spider mites in your greenhouse you

1580
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:36,889
don't know necessarily their pedigree if

1581
01:02:34,039 --> 01:02:38,089
they had come you know from an

1582
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:39,889
ornamental crop where they've had

1583
01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:41,509
exposure over and over to different

1584
01:02:39,889 --> 01:02:43,548
chemistry's you know some of your

1585
01:02:41,509 --> 01:02:45,318
chemistry's may not work so you don't

1586
01:02:43,548 --> 01:02:47,268
know the pedigree of the pest you have

1587
01:02:45,318 --> 01:02:48,798
and even if some of I will say the

1588
01:02:47,268 --> 01:02:50,328
synthetic pesticides will work and

1589
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,650
that's why we go back to the soaps and

1590
01:02:50,329 --> 01:02:55,190
oils because they're more of a physical

1591
01:02:51,650 --> 01:02:57,980
kill and they really don't care as much

1592
01:02:55,190 --> 01:03:00,289
about you know what genetics you have

1593
01:02:57,980 --> 01:03:02,420
for resistance and I have a bug lady

1594
01:03:00,289 --> 01:03:04,759
consulting t-shirt that says you can't

1595
01:03:02,420 --> 01:03:06,230
build resistance to being eaten and so

1596
01:03:04,759 --> 01:03:08,960
you know with some of these past we're

1597
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:10,490
dealing with a lot of white flies spider

1598
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,099
mites and aphids that are resistant to a

1599
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:14,959
lot of chemistry's well you know when

1600
01:03:13,099 --> 01:03:16,940
that Liesman comes and chows down on you

1601
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:19,309
or that parasite comes in six are egging

1602
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:21,318
you she doesn't really care that much if

1603
01:03:19,309 --> 01:03:25,160
you're resistant to you know or Athene

1604
01:03:21,318 --> 01:03:26,900
or Abid kind of thing you know and so

1605
01:03:25,159 --> 01:03:30,009
that's why there's been this real growth

1606
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:32,269
to with the bio controls is because of

1607
01:03:30,009 --> 01:03:34,969
we don't have to worry about resistance

1608
01:03:32,268 --> 01:03:36,709
issues that much and even so far with a

1609
01:03:34,969 --> 01:03:39,259
lot of the microbial products we haven't

1610
01:03:36,710 --> 01:03:41,809
had any resistance issues - like bavaria

1611
01:03:39,259 --> 01:03:44,480
bassiano or trichoderma or things of

1612
01:03:41,809 --> 01:03:46,430
those nature and also with a lot of the

1613
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:50,210
beneficials you know some of our limited

1614
01:03:46,429 --> 01:03:53,028
mobility they can't fly but you know

1615
01:03:50,210 --> 01:03:55,519
they are going to search high and low on

1616
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:59,829
that plant to find a food source and

1617
01:03:55,518 --> 01:04:02,808
most of the chemicals you are using in

1618
01:03:59,829 --> 01:04:04,640
cannabis well they're not systemic you

1619
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:07,069
guys can't use the systemic products

1620
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,480
you're using contact products so unless

1621
01:04:07,068 --> 01:04:10,159
you get a hundred percent spray coverage

1622
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,139
you're not going to be able to get them

1623
01:04:10,159 --> 01:04:14,420
and one of the big things that came up

1624
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:16,578
that we discussed at the meeting in

1625
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:18,829
Portland a couple weeks ago there's no

1626
01:04:16,579 --> 01:04:20,420
such thing really as a systemic miticide

1627
01:04:18,829 --> 01:04:22,880
out there if someone saying they have a

1628
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,200
systemic miticide again move on down the

1629
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:26,119
road because it's not true

1630
01:04:24,199 --> 01:04:27,858
I'm not going and you know you will

1631
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:30,309
probably get into that more at the

1632
01:04:27,858 --> 01:04:32,929
biocontrol cannabis conference in

1633
01:04:30,309 --> 01:04:35,540
California but it

1634
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:37,250
doesn't really exist because of the way

1635
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:39,679
the chemicals move and the plans and

1636
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:42,139
plant biology and and physiology and the

1637
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:44,409
way insects and mites feed differently

1638
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:46,818
in plants it's a whole other discussion

1639
01:04:44,409 --> 01:04:48,649
so really when you have critics that are

1640
01:04:46,818 --> 01:04:49,940
saying the bio controls don't work you

1641
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:52,460
really want to focus on some of the

1642
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:53,960
variables associated with the bolts that

1643
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:56,720
you know the application so like the

1644
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:58,519
sprayer that you're using the consulting

1645
01:04:56,719 --> 01:05:00,980
advice and the rates even if you're

1646
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:02,750
applying the right the right bugs to

1647
01:05:00,980 --> 01:05:06,139
deal with the right situation in a given

1648
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:08,239
environment or even the quality of the

1649
01:05:06,139 --> 01:05:10,519
insects that people are purchasing to

1650
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,529
know that they're alive and fresh and

1651
01:05:10,519 --> 01:05:13,909
arriving in a condition where they're

1652
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:16,550
going to want to eat whatever the pest

1653
01:05:13,909 --> 01:05:17,598
is so I I think there's a lot of

1654
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,309
variables though that people need to

1655
01:05:17,599 --> 01:05:21,349
consider before they jump to bio

1656
01:05:19,309 --> 01:05:24,200
controls don't work and I just I think

1657
01:05:21,349 --> 01:05:27,530
that's a factor right and what cracks me

1658
01:05:24,199 --> 01:05:28,189
up to no end is and again this is across

1659
01:05:27,530 --> 01:05:30,380
the board

1660
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:33,050
ornamental vegetable cannabis everybody

1661
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:34,550
people will spray a pesticide it doesn't

1662
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:36,619
work what do they do they spray it again

1663
01:05:34,550 --> 01:05:38,900
doesn't work they'll still spray it

1664
01:05:36,619 --> 01:05:40,548
again and you'll see this but you know

1665
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,309
one little hiccup in a bio control

1666
01:05:40,548 --> 01:05:47,150
programs bio control doesn't work not

1667
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:50,750
not the fact of an out the top reasons I

1668
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:52,160
will say now and it has changed through

1669
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:56,449
the years like a series we were doing

1670
01:05:52,159 --> 01:05:58,578
this podcast let's say 20 years ago 20

1671
01:05:56,449 --> 01:06:01,308
years ago and I was actually selling

1672
01:05:58,579 --> 01:06:04,730
biocontrol agents 20 years ago my first

1673
01:06:01,309 --> 01:06:05,930
one of most issue would be you know we

1674
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:07,039
really didn't know a lot what we were

1675
01:06:05,929 --> 01:06:09,469
doing and we're having to do a lot of

1676
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,338
trialing so we expected failure but then

1677
01:06:09,469 --> 01:06:13,848
also product quality wasn't as good

1678
01:06:12,338 --> 01:06:16,759
today

1679
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:19,369
the reason I'm seeing people failing

1680
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:21,980
honest to god is I think the number one

1681
01:06:19,369 --> 01:06:23,720
thing right now and I will say cannabis

1682
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:29,119
and I will even include ornamentals and

1683
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:31,068
this is bad advice I I just I I mean

1684
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,809
it's just some of the basic simple stuff

1685
01:06:31,068 --> 01:06:34,730
I was in a greenhouse that runs at 60

1686
01:06:32,809 --> 01:06:37,339
degrees and they were putting out

1687
01:06:34,730 --> 01:06:38,170
sworsky for control of Western flower

1688
01:06:37,338 --> 01:06:40,548
thrips

1689
01:06:38,170 --> 01:06:43,099
sworsky does not like to be at 60

1690
01:06:40,548 --> 01:06:44,838
degrees you need little tiny mittens for

1691
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:46,850
the sworsky and scarves for them and

1692
01:06:44,838 --> 01:06:48,829
they're it's too cold

1693
01:06:46,849 --> 01:06:50,059
and you know this is what I'm like why's

1694
01:06:48,829 --> 01:06:51,980
this person even making this

1695
01:06:50,059 --> 01:06:54,739
recommendation they should know better

1696
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:58,159
and so right there that program was

1697
01:06:54,739 --> 01:07:02,389
failing solely because it was a bad

1698
01:06:58,159 --> 01:07:04,719
recommendation now from the again

1699
01:07:02,389 --> 01:07:07,219
product quality standpoint and

1700
01:07:04,719 --> 01:07:09,379
periodically I do you know these product

1701
01:07:07,219 --> 01:07:11,899
quality workshops on how to assess your

1702
01:07:09,380 --> 01:07:14,090
your bio control agents but we've gotten

1703
01:07:11,900 --> 01:07:16,070
way way way way better on it and I think

1704
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:19,789
as long as the products come to you from

1705
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:22,309
the insector ease and the key the key

1706
01:07:19,789 --> 01:07:25,099
players as far as in sectaries where the

1707
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:27,739
bugs coming from you have bio line you

1708
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:29,750
have bio best you have coal pert you

1709
01:07:27,739 --> 01:07:33,049
have beneficial in Sector E and also

1710
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:34,849
BASF now BSF just does the nematodes so

1711
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:37,340
that they're only an imitator producer

1712
01:07:34,849 --> 01:07:40,819
but these other four companies those are

1713
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:42,530
I would say the the largest producers

1714
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:44,180
and like copra it's probably largest in

1715
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:46,910
the world bio best is probably behind

1716
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:49,399
them and bio line might be right up I'm

1717
01:07:46,909 --> 01:07:52,429
not sure where if they're right behind

1718
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,619
bio best but those are the big in sector

1719
01:07:52,429 --> 01:07:56,960
ease now most of them have production

1720
01:07:54,619 --> 01:07:58,159
overseas I mean if you go look at a map

1721
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,470
you know there's production in Canada

1722
01:07:58,159 --> 01:08:03,739
and Mexico and in different locations in

1723
01:08:00,469 --> 01:08:06,829
Europe and Spain and Africa so they have

1724
01:08:03,739 --> 01:08:08,089
multiple and sector ease but a lot of

1725
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:14,420
the products we're getting here in the

1726
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:16,400
US does come from Europe that and it is

1727
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:18,980
it's FedExed over and then so it comes

1728
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:20,479
from Europe over to here and then it

1729
01:08:18,979 --> 01:08:21,858
goes to the end sector E and then if

1730
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:23,269
you're buying from an insectary it comes

1731
01:08:21,859 --> 01:08:26,390
to you from there now it's going to a

1732
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:27,800
distributor that distributes it

1733
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,840
physically themselves so then it gets

1734
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:32,000
ships to the distributor and this is

1735
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:34,310
where things you know how long is it at

1736
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,659
the distributor for you know I've gotten

1737
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,609
emails before from companies

1738
01:08:35,659 --> 01:08:38,449
distributors that have over ordered and

1739
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:39,859
it's like we're sitting on all this

1740
01:08:38,449 --> 01:08:41,479
product you know anybody that wants to

1741
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:43,970
buy it well that's another day the

1742
01:08:41,479 --> 01:08:45,649
products been there and some things can

1743
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,329
handle that but other biocontrol agents

1744
01:08:45,649 --> 01:08:49,399
don't do so well I mean like purse

1745
01:08:47,329 --> 01:08:51,079
emili´s man you want that out of the

1746
01:08:49,399 --> 01:08:53,239
bottle the second you get it there's

1747
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:55,760
been research done on how they can

1748
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:58,579
cannibalize themselves and packaging the

1749
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:59,969
personalists so you really you need to

1750
01:08:58,579 --> 01:09:01,318
know your sourcing and

1751
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:03,420
another thing when you do go to buy from

1752
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:05,370
a distributor whose product am I getting

1753
01:09:03,420 --> 01:09:07,409
am I getting bio lines am i gettin bio

1754
01:09:05,369 --> 01:09:09,630
bests because there are different

1755
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:11,759
packagings there's different carriers

1756
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:15,569
there's differences between the company

1757
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,948
and different companies and you know I

1758
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:17,940
when I talk to people that are buying

1759
01:09:16,948 --> 01:09:19,019
through distributors I'm like well whose

1760
01:09:17,939 --> 01:09:22,469
product you getting they're like well

1761
01:09:19,020 --> 01:09:24,900
just depends the thing is is you get

1762
01:09:22,469 --> 01:09:26,640
familiar with the way packaging is you

1763
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:28,229
get again familiar with carriers I mean

1764
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:31,109
a good example is if you look at a food

1765
01:09:28,229 --> 01:09:33,238
parasites you get it from bio line

1766
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:34,680
there's no carrier in the bottle well

1767
01:09:33,238 --> 01:09:36,509
you get it from bio best it's got

1768
01:09:34,680 --> 01:09:38,369
buckwheat Hall in there you get it from

1769
01:09:36,509 --> 01:09:39,930
Coker they have like a sawdust carrier

1770
01:09:38,369 --> 01:09:42,619
and so you do have to do different

1771
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:44,520
release methods for those products

1772
01:09:42,619 --> 01:09:46,798
beneficial insectary doesn't use a

1773
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:48,839
carrier and there so you you have to

1774
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,640
know what to expect and you don't want

1775
01:09:48,838 --> 01:09:51,809
to have carrier one week and not a next

1776
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:54,060
and the person going to put them out

1777
01:09:51,810 --> 01:09:56,160
gets confused so you know these are all

1778
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:57,600
things that have to be looked at when

1779
01:09:56,159 --> 01:09:58,979
trying to make a program work and I

1780
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,530
think sometimes people are getting

1781
01:09:58,979 --> 01:10:03,479
products that are a little old and I've

1782
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:05,250
actually on some of microbials I've had

1783
01:10:03,479 --> 01:10:08,218
growers buy product that were expired

1784
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:10,560
through distributors that are holding

1785
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:13,469
the product so you have to you know you

1786
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:16,130
got to watch all that stuff and be aware

1787
01:10:13,469 --> 01:10:19,020
of all of that and then the other reason

1788
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:21,630
I do see biocontrol programs fails is

1789
01:10:19,020 --> 01:10:25,380
pesticide residue that there's something

1790
01:10:21,630 --> 01:10:29,400
on the plants that we we didn't know

1791
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:31,260
about or that was sprayed and that is

1792
01:10:29,399 --> 01:10:33,210
incompatible with a bio control agent

1793
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:35,880
that's another reason we can have issues

1794
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:37,529
there great well I think I cover it or

1795
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,210
we covered all the topics that I wanted

1796
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:41,069
to cover today was there anything else

1797
01:10:39,210 --> 01:10:44,550
you wanted to chat about before we sign

1798
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:46,799
off for listeners um I don't think so

1799
01:10:44,550 --> 01:10:48,300
and again you know again I'll say it

1800
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,440
again people deserve to be in business

1801
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:54,210
but you know just I think for the

1802
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:56,549
cannabis industry people need to do a

1803
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:58,800
better job getting information to the

1804
01:10:56,550 --> 01:11:01,829
cannabis industry as a cannabis grower

1805
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,900
you need to just you know put on your

1806
01:11:01,829 --> 01:11:07,710
thinking cap as my mom used to tell me

1807
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:09,689
to do all the time and you know at you

1808
01:11:07,710 --> 01:11:11,880
know analyze what you're being told I

1809
01:11:09,689 --> 01:11:13,379
mean does it make sense someone is

1810
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:13,829
telling you to dissolve aspirin and

1811
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:16,140
water

1812
01:11:13,829 --> 01:11:19,260
and water your plants does that really

1813
01:11:16,140 --> 01:11:20,460
make sense and if you think about some

1814
01:11:19,260 --> 01:11:25,140
of these things growers are being told

1815
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:28,079
to do it just it doesn't and back to the

1816
01:11:25,140 --> 01:11:30,990
root a fit issue which you know I got

1817
01:11:28,079 --> 01:11:33,210
some emails about that we're doing work

1818
01:11:30,989 --> 01:11:36,689
looking at nematodes on Rue David I

1819
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:39,720
didn't say we had the solution for that

1820
01:11:36,689 --> 01:11:42,409
I'm still right now my strongest

1821
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:45,420
recommendation is still using botanic

1822
01:11:42,409 --> 01:11:47,970
garden a no guard correctly you know you

1823
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,560
can't just you know magically spritz it

1824
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,180
on the soil service and expect your Rudy

1825
01:11:49,560 --> 01:11:54,900
Fitz to go away and you know there's

1826
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:57,270
differences between the soils a volume

1827
01:11:54,899 --> 01:11:59,599
of pots there's a lot of variables in it

1828
01:11:57,270 --> 01:12:03,080
but I just don't feel comfortable enough

1829
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:05,550
recommending nematodes Rove beetles or

1830
01:12:03,079 --> 01:12:07,920
even you know hypo a space miles which

1831
01:12:05,550 --> 01:12:10,970
is now straighter lapses as a control

1832
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,829
option for rude aphids they may help

1833
01:12:10,970 --> 01:12:15,720
suppress it but I've talked to people

1834
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,399
that have spent thousands of dollars on

1835
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,280
those three previously-mentioned

1836
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:23,969
biocontrol agents and not gotten control

1837
01:12:20,279 --> 01:12:28,590
of rudy foods or even suppression of it

1838
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:30,449
so be careful about the information

1839
01:12:28,590 --> 01:12:32,340
you're getting out there and when

1840
01:12:30,449 --> 01:12:34,349
someone makes a recommendation you know

1841
01:12:32,340 --> 01:12:38,880
does it suppress it or does it control

1842
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:40,680
it that's a big difference there that

1843
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,289
was entomologist Suzanne Wainwright

1844
