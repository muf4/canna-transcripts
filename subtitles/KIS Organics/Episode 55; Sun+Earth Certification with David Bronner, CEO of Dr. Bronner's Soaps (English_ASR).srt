00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:41,280
aka cosmic engagement officer for dr.

12
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,679
Bronner's a top-selling brand of natural

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,719
soaps in North America not only do they

14
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:47,759
make the best soap but they've dedicated

15
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,359
themselves to advocacy around our food

16
00:00:47,759 --> 00:00:51,329

psychedelic medicine into American and

21
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:02,698
global culture in my opinion this is one

22
00:01:00,869 --> 00:01:05,099
of the best examples of how a company

23
00:01:02,698 --> 00:01:07,170
can operate ethically and sustainably in

24
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,509
today's society and it was an honor to

25
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:11,280
spend this time with David I could do an

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,930

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,670

29
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,359

00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:59,939
our company as a nonprofit religious

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:04,500
organization in 1948 ish it's a little

45
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:07,228
hazy he himself was a third gym third

46
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:11,430
generation master snow maker from a

47
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:13,530
German jurist so making family his

48
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,830
grandfather began so man

49
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:18,750
facture in 1858 in a small southern

50
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:23,700
german town of Lao pine in the duysts

51
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:25,560
under their Jewish quarter and as by the

52
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:27,359
time he was coming of age his dad and

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,580
two uncles had expanded the family

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,150
business to be pretty much the biggest

55
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:36,690
snow maker in Germany and they were had

56
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:39,510
a factory in a LeBron another southern

57
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:41,669
German town kind of in the heart of the

58
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:47,090
manufacturing kind of super center in

59
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:49,469
southern Germany and he was used

60
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:51,150
apprentice to another master master so

61
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:55,620
making family and earn his master's

62
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:57,840
certificate but you know in the late 20s

63
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:00,719
when he was working with his dad and two

64
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,819
uncles I mean he was pretty activist

65
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:08,219
from day one very Zionists and and then

66
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:11,488
just personality-wise his clashing with

67
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:13,139
his dad a lot and you know his dad

68
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:18,269
didn't really want him mixing politics

69
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:21,000
and so think and as far as the Hitler

70
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:24,420
and and in the rise of fascism that

71
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,069
wasn't clear that that point but more

72
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,899
just out of the kind of generational

73
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:31,939
class or their dad my granite came over

74
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,939
in 1929 to the US and set up shop in

75
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:37,939
Chicago and Milwaukee became a

76
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:40,620
consultant to the US soap industry

77
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:44,189
helped design factories and launch

78
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,569
products and married and had three kids

79
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:50,459
and but also was becoming increasingly

80
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:53,519
desperate with the rise of Hitler to get

81
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:57,359
his family out and his two sisters got

82
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,989
out one his youngest sister got he got

83
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:05,790
out in 36 in age of 20 and ended up on

84
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,310
in a kibbutz in Israel and being kept

85
00:04:05,789 --> 00:04:11,459
kibbutz and then and I was Lodi and

86
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,920
Louisa got out in 38 right before the

87
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:15,989
close the borders and she eventually

88
00:04:13,919 --> 00:04:22,038
became she came to us and eventually

89
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:25,530
became a professor of German Hebrew at

90
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:27,300
UMass Boston for what four short

91
00:04:25,529 --> 00:04:28,948
centuries a chemist

92
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,668
ourselves and actually made the

93
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:35,699
waterproofing compound for American GIs

94
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:38,758
going into Korea but then didn't get

95
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:41,009
credit like her mail whatever supervisor

96
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,348
just kind of screwed her she quit and

97
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:50,250
discussed you got her PhD and became a

98
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:53,430
professor and but anyways so dr. Braam

99
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:55,348
my grandparents were told in Francisca

100
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,910
like a lot of Bushwick Jews that they

101
00:04:55,348 --> 00:05:01,168
were going to thought they were going to

102
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,169
write out the madness and in 1940 the

103
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,969
factory was area nice and then shortly

104
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:12,779
thereafter they were deported and killed

105
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:15,240
in the camps in 42 and 44 and then also

106
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:19,309
in this time my granddad's wife my dad's

107
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:24,870
mom was very sickly and in and out of

108
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:28,649
hospital and died I think in 1945 and my

109
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:31,319
dad was too so just a lot of it's just

110
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:33,959
huge tragedy was hitting my granddad and

111
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:36,538
somehow in the midst of this you was

112
00:05:33,959 --> 00:05:39,538
having these a mystical experiences that

113
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:40,918
of the oneness of humanity and on all

114
00:05:39,538 --> 00:05:42,779
the faith traditions and all the

115
00:05:40,918 --> 00:05:44,908
shamanic and faith traditions were

116
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:46,679
pointing at the same transcendent

117
00:05:44,908 --> 00:05:49,800
mystery that were all children of and

118
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,870
that you know at the deepest level it's

119
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:56,090
it's about love and and getting down and

120
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:58,949
serving each other and loving each other

121
00:05:56,089 --> 00:06:00,629
that in a nuclear-armed world if we

122
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:03,379
didn't realize that transcending unity

123
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:06,300
across ethnic and religious divides

124
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:09,000
we're gonna all perish and it felt

125
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,770
urgently called on his mission to unite

126
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:16,918
spaceship earth and what about lecturing

127
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:19,829
around the country selling his soaps cut

128
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:22,198
on the side and and you know and he saw

129
00:06:19,829 --> 00:06:24,269
it soaps are cut out of fashion and a

130
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:27,090
post-world War two ERA it was all about

131
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:32,399
better living through chemistry you know

132
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:33,448
from from agriculture to plastics to you

133
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:37,978
know person don't care everything was

134
00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:39,598
moving to a petrochemical basis and my

135
00:06:37,978 --> 00:06:41,008
granddad early on saw the problem that

136
00:06:39,598 --> 00:06:44,968
in saturating our

137
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:47,550
with all these toxic compounds and in

138
00:06:44,968 --> 00:06:50,129
stay true to the natural versatile about

139
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:52,918
a gradable soap formulas of his family

140
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:55,740
and so he's going around lecturing on

141
00:06:52,918 --> 00:06:58,649
his peace plan and kind of soon realizes

142
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,180
people are coming more to get the soap

143
00:06:58,649 --> 00:07:02,639
which you know words got out like wow

144
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,129
this is I'm really good soak and realize

145
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,598
people are coming more to get the soap

146
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,539
then here stick around and hear what he

147
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,399
had to say so he started putting his

148
00:07:09,538 --> 00:07:15,269
message on every label of our bottle

149
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:18,300
bottles and you know for him the bottle

150
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:19,978
was there to sell a label I mean as much

151
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:24,348
as the label that was there to sell so

152
00:07:19,978 --> 00:07:26,878
and you know and he did found the

153
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:30,088
company when he considered a non-profit

154
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:31,919
religious organization with the rise of

155
00:07:30,088 --> 00:07:34,110
the counterculture and hippies and the

156
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:36,359
wholesale rejection of the war machine

157
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:38,459
and you know they are of seven spring

158
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,699
and the ecological catastrophe that was

159
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:44,189
becoming more and more apparent the

160
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:46,050
soaps is really resonated and you know

161
00:07:44,189 --> 00:07:48,300
the whole kind of became a soap of the

162
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:50,218
generation that he could you know wash

163
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:52,860
your hair your dog dishes by the side of

164
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:55,918
the river and not worry about it

165
00:07:52,860 --> 00:08:00,419
and you know grew on this label of peace

166
00:07:55,918 --> 00:08:03,028
and love and so you know that's you know

167
00:08:00,418 --> 00:08:07,588
that's what really I think cemented his

168
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:09,598
place and you know and and then he was

169
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:11,639
part of you know are so part of the

170
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:14,009
health room store movement and healthy

171
00:08:11,639 --> 00:08:17,788
movement kind of through the 70s and 80s

172
00:08:14,009 --> 00:08:20,129
and and into the 90s well and then also

173
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:22,848
in this period the IRS kind of stepped

174
00:08:20,129 --> 00:08:26,490
in or came down on my granddad and

175
00:08:22,848 --> 00:08:29,938
basically you know disagreed with my

176
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:32,879
granddad's tax exempt status and my

177
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:38,459
grand I was fortunate bankruptcy in the

178
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:40,318
late 80s and and so my dad mom and uncle

179
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:42,718
Ralph at that point stepped in to kind

180
00:08:40,318 --> 00:08:46,318
of fire a lot of bad advisers and right

181
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:48,240
to ship an exit as a for-profit but you

182
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:52,229
know we have that nonprofit DNA at the

183
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,820
heart of our business and my dad for his

184
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,159
part he you know he can't

185
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:58,629
a series of foster homes because my

186
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,419
grand I was off saving the world and

187
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:05,799
financially supported my dad and uncle

188
00:09:01,419 --> 00:09:07,209
and aunt but wasn't really around as a

189
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:10,599
father and kind of bailed on his

190
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,940
responsibilities in that way and so my

191
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:16,690
dad really compensated and he went to

192
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:19,390
the Navy at age 17 served four years

193
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,850
came out worked for a bit from my

194
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:24,580
granddad but then went on to run a

195
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,909
chemical specialty operation or

196
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:30,250
manufactured in LA even when my granddad

197
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:37,240
move down Escondido here in North County

198
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:39,460
San Diego and so so he my dad oversaw

199
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,470
that he developed a bunch of products

200
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:43,570
including firefighting foam and then a

201
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,350
special effects version of foam and so I

202
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,570
personally grew up working for my dad

203
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:51,430
and so then in the late 80s Oh him and

204
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:53,920
my mom so they slept in my granddad's

205
00:09:51,429 --> 00:09:56,799
health was failing at Parkinson's so my

206
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:58,089
dad and mom and uncle were running dr.

207
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:59,559
Bronner's and then my dad was also

208
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,840
running on a chemical which is as

209
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:04,149
independent at that point his own

210
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,810
independent chemical consultancy which

211
00:10:04,149 --> 00:10:10,179
primarily was dealing with firefighting

212
00:10:07,809 --> 00:10:12,459
foam and then also special effects foam

213
00:10:10,179 --> 00:10:15,219
for Hollywood so I grew up going to

214
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,250
alka-seltzer and commercial shoots like

215
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:20,860
blasting foam on trees and movie movie

216
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,210
shoots and such and you know grew up

217
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:24,509
with my brother just blasting foam on

218
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:28,720
each other it's super fun out of a

219
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:30,279
engine and house fire hose but you know

220
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:33,519
my dad wanted nothing to do my

221
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:35,379
granddad's cosmic trip and he felt as

222
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,269
soon as my grant started on the all one

223
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:40,000
mission at dads I kind of wanted nothing

224
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:42,250
to do it he was all he was all about

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,809
family and community and what can you do

226
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:46,059
right here what's in front of you what's

227
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:48,879
practical you know looking actually

228
00:10:46,059 --> 00:10:51,969
leverage and make you know a difference

229
00:10:48,879 --> 00:10:55,600
in you know kind of near immediate

230
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:58,090
sphere of influence and um so and I very

231
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,730
much came up under my dad and and really

232
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,519
downloaded his kind of moral kind of

233
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,289
compass and in my granddad it wasn't

234
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,779
really until after college when I was an

235
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:07,669
absent

236
00:11:05,779 --> 00:11:10,759
I mean my granddad was you know amazing

237
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:14,839
but just really sailed way over my head

238
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:16,819
as a kid I just didn't grok it and you

239
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,639
know you know we must make this patience

240
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:23,270
and you know and I just wasn't in the

241
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:25,669
space yet they appreciate that but then

242
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:28,100
you know in college I started smoking on

243
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:30,259
cannabis and you know this realizing

244
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:32,450
just how beautiful music and friends and

245
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:36,460
just really prioritizing that and kind

246
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:39,650
of retiring from alcohol cultures and

247
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:41,269
and then going to Amsterdam 95 and

248
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:45,049
intersecting the cannabis cup I had a

249
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:48,500
euro past went to Amsterdam and really

250
00:11:45,049 --> 00:11:50,929
just got blown blown open had some huge

251
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,740
psychedelic experiences that really kind

252
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:58,969
of uh made clear that my granddad was

253
00:11:54,740 --> 00:12:01,370
100% on point and he was exactly right

254
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:06,050
and that our deepest ground is his love

255
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:08,060
and light and that somehow the swirls of

256
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:10,309
absurdity and suffering that that is the

257
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:11,719
truth and that's what all these fake

258
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:13,129
traditions are pointing at when they're

259
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,950
not making idols out of their own

260
00:12:13,129 --> 00:12:20,779
beliefs and symbols and systems and you

261
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,810
know and just kind of dedicated myself

262
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:25,370
to making the world a better place and

263
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:28,099
also in this time you know just

264
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,000
realizing that cannabis is a sacrament

265
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:33,200
as are all psychedelic allies and that

266
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,589
one is going to dedicate my life to

267
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,390
ending the war I saw that the drug war

268
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:42,260
is in large part a religious war on the

269
00:12:38,389 --> 00:12:44,899
sacraments of our people and you know

270
00:12:42,259 --> 00:12:47,720
and in my squat in Amsterdam I actors

271
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:51,819
there's a church in Arkansas in 1993 of

272
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:55,700
all places Clark called our church that

273
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:58,610
formed to which cannabis as a sacrament

274
00:12:55,700 --> 00:13:00,920
and and you know explicitly to make a

275
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:02,690
First Amendment challenge and of course

276
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:05,929
in 93 I mean they got busted up pretty

277
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,450
quickly by this by the FBI and people

278
00:13:05,929 --> 00:13:11,359
were arrested there were two people that

279
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:12,910
had escaped and immigrated to EPSA dam

280
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,649
and they were in my squat they were just

281
00:13:12,909 --> 00:13:18,289
one of these guys with Sam Smith like

282
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:20,519
just a real heavyweight dude I think

283
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:23,669
he's up in the northwest somewhere

284
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,240
but just real spiritual cat you know

285
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:28,889
just be really dedicating his life to

286
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,959
cannabis as a sacrament of higher

287
00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:35,999
vibration living and so this very

288
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:38,039
influential at that time and so anyway

289
00:13:35,999 --> 00:13:40,079
so I came back became a mental health I

290
00:13:38,039 --> 00:13:41,849
came back I sold all my stuff was gonna

291
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:44,008
move back to Amsterdam to grow plants

292
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,100
and activated became vegan in this

293
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:49,318
timeframe of just realizing the disaster

294
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:52,079
of Western consumption on a planet just

295
00:13:49,318 --> 00:13:55,378
wrecking an environment you know I hope

296
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,428
for ecosystems and communities around

297
00:13:55,379 --> 00:13:57,869
the world just being completely

298
00:13:56,428 --> 00:14:01,318
disrupted to see the kind of

299
00:13:57,869 --> 00:14:02,999
capitalistic machine of making us you

300
00:14:01,318 --> 00:14:04,318
know food you know tasty food and

301
00:14:02,999 --> 00:14:06,749
fabulous clothes and there's all the

302
00:14:04,318 --> 00:14:08,399
consumables that we consume without

303
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:09,928
thinking about it and how they're

304
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:12,539
produced or who's producing them or

305
00:14:09,928 --> 00:14:14,159
where they're coming from and just you

306
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:16,338
know to seeing that machine on the earth

307
00:14:14,159 --> 00:14:18,240
it's like a comet hitting the earth and

308
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:23,610
you know just waking up to that

309
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:25,528
dimension of things and so so so just

310
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:29,639
there's a whole series of events and and

311
00:14:25,528 --> 00:14:32,159
I came back to the states and became a

00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:37,699
and also realize that a company like dr.

332
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:39,948
Bronner's would offer me a job I would

333
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:42,409
go for a second leaving alone you know I

334
00:15:39,948 --> 00:15:45,318
had really not wanted to do my own thing

335
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:48,528
with them just realizing wow what a what

336
00:15:45,318 --> 00:15:50,719
a gift that you know an opportunity I

337
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:52,490
have and so I let my dad know yeah

338
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,740
surely around when does the birth of our

339
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:57,409
daughter and she was born on the same

340
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:00,560
day dr. Bronner died the same same exact

341
00:15:57,409 --> 00:16:06,078
day my I was born dr. Bronner guide and

342
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:09,018
a high fived in and out and and and then

343
00:16:06,078 --> 00:16:11,620
you know let my dad know and and then he

344
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:15,169
was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer

345
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:17,328
shortly after so you know fortunately I

346
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:20,299
already made that decision to come back

347
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:23,479
so I came back in keeping him in six

348
00:16:20,299 --> 00:16:26,359
months but he lived for for a little

349
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:27,560
over a year and his goal was to see my

350
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,769
sister marry to my brother-in-law

351
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:35,059
Michael my sister Lisa which happened

352
00:16:30,769 --> 00:16:40,669
June 6 of 1998 and then on June 12th he

353
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:42,409
KeePass transitioned and just was an

354
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:44,179
amazing man and we had an amazing year

355
00:16:42,409 --> 00:16:46,549
together and it's just very intense I

356
00:16:44,179 --> 00:16:48,588
just downloaded a lot of the ropes and

357
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,500
just the ethics and wait he rolled and

358
00:16:48,589 --> 00:16:53,540
one of the last things he did until he

359
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:57,500
died on June 12 which was my uncle

360
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:59,870
Robert a his brother was one of the last

361
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:04,818
things he did is give effectively

362
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:07,099
one-third of our value our net worth was

363
00:17:04,818 --> 00:17:09,168
was in a was in a thousand acres in East

364
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:11,208
County San Diego and he wanted to give

365
00:17:09,169 --> 00:17:12,949
that to the Boys and Girls Club this is

366
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,288
kind of really cool kind of full circle

367
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:18,970
like the mentor programs youth mentoring

368
00:17:15,288 --> 00:17:22,578
programs that helped him in the kid and

369
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:24,709
and all our advisors like man oh don't

370
00:17:22,578 --> 00:17:26,899
do that we got a refuge the state taxes

371
00:17:24,709 --> 00:17:27,110
from what my granddad died let's not do

372
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,840
that

373
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:31,759
my dad's like Adam is like no we can do

374
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,939
this you know we're gonna be alright and

375
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:37,940
this is what I want to do and so he my

376
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:40,909
mom mount my growth oversaw that gift

377
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:43,159
and really just set the example tone for

378
00:17:40,909 --> 00:17:46,340
what we were going to be as a company

379
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:48,200
and that you know and as I

380
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:49,519
you know came in and you know this was

381
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,289
me and my mom initially and that my

382
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,529
brother after a couple years I convinced

383
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:55,159
to come in my brother Mike is now

384
00:17:53,529 --> 00:17:57,950
fifty-fifty with me

385
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:03,170
he's company president and I'm the cause

386
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:05,150
the engagement officer and but we put

387
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,039
into place a five to one compensation

388
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:10,430
cap versus our lowest paid warehouse

389
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:11,629
position and that all profits not needed

390
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,370
for the business we were going to

391
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:17,360
dedicate to the charities and causes we

392
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:19,069
believed in and so one of the first

393
00:18:17,359 --> 00:18:23,179
things we did was we added hemp seed oil

394
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:24,529
to the soaps in 1999 and thinking that

395
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,900
we were on the verge of Rica Mercia

396
00:18:24,529 --> 00:18:31,009
lysing but also you know in part opening

397
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:35,000
up cultural space for cannabis and you

398
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:38,269
know just kind of a hemp team at the

399
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:42,019
perfect nexus of policy reform and

400
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:44,269
environmental sustainability and and

401
00:18:42,019 --> 00:18:45,740
being an example you know so the worst

402
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:47,779
example of an out-of-control ice

403
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:49,940
terrible drug war that would schedule a

404
00:18:47,779 --> 00:18:54,289
non drug agricultural crop is a Schedule

405
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:56,000
one drug and you know and then kind of

406
00:18:54,289 --> 00:19:00,369
got into it with the DEA and we were in

407
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,829
an extended battle from 2001 to 2004

408
00:19:00,369 --> 00:19:08,149
that we were when the DEA tried to ban

409
00:19:03,829 --> 00:19:12,019
imports of MC m seeded and M seed oil

410
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:14,420
for food and body care and we beat them

411
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,400
and there's a hearse FDA was beat

412
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:21,860
we funded the industry's legal defense

413
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,750
coordinated help coordinated and yeah we

414
00:19:21,859 --> 00:19:28,939
actually won a Bob Marley's birthday in

415
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:30,680
February 2004 we got a clean 3-0

416
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:35,630
unanimous victory in the Ninth Circuit

417
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:39,289
and then in parallel was funding

418
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:41,030
American safe access stuff share it come

419
00:19:39,289 --> 00:19:43,220
out as anti-globalization movement to

420
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:45,759
set up if she got tackled by federal

421
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,170
marshal and the IMF protests in DC and

422
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:52,190
really jacked her neck and was using

423
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:54,050
cannabis and to help heal so she founded

424
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:55,700
the you know nation's was affected

425
00:19:54,049 --> 00:19:58,710
patient advocacy group and we're big

426
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,990
supporters of her and he saw

427
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:03,120
and then um you know and then in

428
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:04,440
parallel we were putting in place you

429
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:07,409
know understanding that our supply

430
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:09,090
chains that you know whatever cool stuff

431
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,980
we do here at headquarters with our

432
00:20:09,089 --> 00:20:13,919
employees and a manufacturing process

433
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,809
but that's like 10% of our impact and

434
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:17,550
that 90 plus percent of our impact was

435
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:20,609
in our agricultural supply chains and

436
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,309
how our materials are being grown and

437
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:26,369
processed matter way more than what we

438
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,230
were doing turning that in the soap in

439
00:20:26,369 --> 00:20:31,799
in terms of environmental and social

440
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:33,690
impact so the first you know like most

441
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:35,669
people we bought in price inspect we

442
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,559
just you know you know bought from

443
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:40,590
brokers we had no visibility or real

444
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:42,509
interest in knowing exactly where our

445
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:44,819
stuff was coming from just like pretty

446
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:47,339
much everybody and you just buy on the

447
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:50,460
con it come out of your market but you

448
00:20:47,339 --> 00:20:51,809
know realizing that that what's kind of

449
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:55,079
making the roads go to hell in a

450
00:20:51,809 --> 00:20:56,490
handbasket and you know that that this

451
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:58,079
is the race to the bottom pitting

452
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,049
farming communities against each other

453
00:20:58,079 --> 00:21:03,839
and you know it just leads to these huge

454
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:06,480
corporate industrial plantations ripping

455
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:08,939
up rainforests and you know displacing

456
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,890
small family farming communities up

457
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:13,350
their land and they become you know

458
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:17,490
plantation workers for slave wages and

459
00:21:13,349 --> 00:21:19,559
it's a it's a horrible cycle and you

460
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:22,230
know especially around our tropical oils

461
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:25,079
like coconut and palm and then olive oil

462
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:28,519
and mint oil and where our main

463
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:32,730
ingredients along with the hemp oil so

464
00:21:28,519 --> 00:21:35,309
so we said about identifying farming

465
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:37,620
communities that we could work in direct

466
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:39,929
partnership with and on regenerative

467
00:21:37,619 --> 00:21:42,599
organic terms you know not using a whole

468
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:45,240
bunch of synthetic inputs synthetic

469
00:21:42,599 --> 00:21:49,369
pesticides and fertilizers to produce

470
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:51,630
our raw materials and you know basically

471
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:52,949
trying to figure out like how do we farm

472
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:55,290
in nature's image if you look at a

473
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:57,870
forest there's no external chemical

474
00:21:55,289 --> 00:22:02,909
inputs it's completely self regenerating

475
00:21:57,869 --> 00:22:05,279
and and so just been on a just an

476
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:07,440
amazing crash course for the past 20

477
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:09,599
years getting better and better and

478
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,308
working in partnership with our farmers

479
00:22:09,599 --> 00:22:13,248
and

480
00:22:10,308 --> 00:22:15,259
kind of best practices as far as compost

481
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:17,058
and cover cropping and minimal sort of

482
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:19,219
the servants and intercropping with

483
00:22:17,058 --> 00:22:21,489
complimentary tree crops of different

484
00:22:19,219 --> 00:22:24,499
canopy heights the markets maximize

485
00:22:21,489 --> 00:22:27,979
photosynthetic capture and biomass yield

486
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:31,278
and so carbon sequestration and and and

487
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:33,649
yields are much higher and so then so is

488
00:22:31,278 --> 00:22:35,210
income and and then you know making sure

489
00:22:33,648 --> 00:22:38,778
we're investing in the communities where

490
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:40,759
we're working in and so we've got really

491
00:22:38,778 --> 00:22:43,878
cool project for coconut in Sri Lanka

492
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:46,808
and now a new one and Samoan we've got a

493
00:22:43,878 --> 00:22:50,058
really cool palm project in Ghana or

494
00:22:46,808 --> 00:22:53,418
intercropping Coco banana and cassava

495
00:22:50,058 --> 00:22:55,638
with the palm and it's you know wow

496
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,479
device file diverse you know wildlife

497
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,398
habitat

498
00:22:56,479 --> 00:22:59,749
you know Paul and that's you know always

499
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:02,028
making sure there's plenty of habitat

500
00:22:59,749 --> 00:23:04,509
for beneficial insects and predatory

501
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:07,729
prey predator insects and pollinators

502
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:09,558
and then in olive oil we actually

503
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:11,479
partnered 90 percent of our olive oil

504
00:23:09,558 --> 00:23:16,428
comes from olive farmers from the West

505
00:23:11,479 --> 00:23:18,288
Bank and doing all regenerative

506
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:20,538
super-rad projects and then to be clear

507
00:23:18,288 --> 00:23:23,838
when I on to Israel about it although we

508
00:23:20,538 --> 00:23:26,868
do hate to occupation and in the current

509
00:23:23,838 --> 00:23:29,298
government we source the balance from

510
00:23:26,868 --> 00:23:32,058
half from a Jewish family farm and half

511
00:23:29,298 --> 00:23:34,398
from a Arab Christian project in the

512
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:37,278
Nazareth green so we have Muslim Jewish

513
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:41,118
Christian olive oil and or soap all

514
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:43,608
organic and regenerative and then you

515
00:23:41,118 --> 00:23:45,528
know and then all this time - we've been

516
00:23:43,608 --> 00:23:48,108
using our profits to fund different

517
00:23:45,528 --> 00:23:50,298
causes and ballot campaigns and so

518
00:23:48,108 --> 00:23:55,338
engage them GMO labeling campaign really

519
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:58,009
hard against Monsanto and DuPont down in

520
00:23:55,338 --> 00:24:00,138
Oregon when we came so close in 2014 you

521
00:23:58,009 --> 00:24:02,778
know we lost but 800 votes it was such a

522
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:04,638
heartbreak but um you know learned a lot

523
00:24:02,778 --> 00:24:06,558
you know finding 3 ballot measures in a

524
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:09,528
row they're you know parallel we're

525
00:24:06,558 --> 00:24:12,979
helping fund the you know the cannabis I

526
00:24:09,528 --> 00:24:15,558
mean cannabis prohibition first

527
00:24:12,979 --> 00:24:17,419
california's failed prop 19 like even

528
00:24:15,558 --> 00:24:20,148
though we all thought it was a bad idea

529
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:22,278
to go in that year in that time I

530
00:24:20,148 --> 00:24:23,629
remember coming off Burning Man it was

531
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:25,849
like wow this

532
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:28,250
turn around without the first serious

533
00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:30,709
national discussion happening about

534
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,119
ending cannabis prohibition and so this

535
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,620
really I realized it's the power of

536
00:24:32,119 --> 00:24:35,329
these ballot measures to really advance

537
00:24:33,619 --> 00:24:37,099
the cultural conversation and kind of

538
00:24:35,329 --> 00:24:39,559
move the needle so that you can win in

539
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:40,869
subsequent years and indeed we did we

540
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:45,919
broke through in Washington Colorado

541
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:47,989
2012 an Oregon DC in Alaska in 2014 and

542
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:51,050
we actually funded entirely the DC

543
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:54,170
campaign in our social head of social

544
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,139
action is Adam ire hiding her and he was

545
00:24:54,170 --> 00:25:00,200
the campaign manager for legalizing weed

546
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:02,150
in the Capitol which is huge is because

547
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,860
we're talking to the national leadership

548
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:08,800
within the local media you know in 2016

549
00:25:06,859 --> 00:25:13,399
you know obviously it was a huge year

550
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,500
but also in this time we started it was

551
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:17,960
becoming crystal clear that the same

552
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,240
forces that were screwing up all the

553
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,160
other commodity crops in the world that

554
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,359
you know that we had to set up you know

555
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:29,360
put forth a lot of effort to you know

556
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:30,799
kind of go against and set up in a you

557
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,990
know truly sustainable regenerative

558
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,029
supply chain but that those same

559
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:38,990
corporate industrial forces were moving

560
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:40,730
big time in the cannabis and you know

561
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:45,259
part of what was really helpful for us

562
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:47,420
in in our just kind of normal raw

563
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:49,279
material supply chains and in our

564
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,529
products and having the USDA Organic

565
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,170
Program and then also

566
00:25:51,529 --> 00:25:57,200
Fairtrade certification programs and you

567
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:59,300
know consumer facing programs that could

568
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,000
really tell you know cynically

569
00:25:59,299 --> 00:26:03,649
communicate to consumers who you know

570
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,750
wanted to buy products that didn't go to

571
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:08,060
hell and back you know you could certify

572
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:10,250
with a third-party like in that this is

573
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:11,899
a trusted you can trust but indeed this

574
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,119
product was produced in a way that you

575
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:16,340
would want and you know this soap this

576
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:20,179
food that Apple you know that t-shirt

577
00:26:16,339 --> 00:26:21,559
and so you know we saw in camp with

578
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:24,710
cannabis but because of federal

579
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:26,450
prohibition you couldn't access USDA

580
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:30,500
Organic program because it's a you know

581
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:32,509
federally regulated word and you know we

582
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,759
you know neither there was some pretty

583
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:37,099
good local certifications out there but

584
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:42,410
but nothing that seemed to have any

585
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:44,209
traction and degree and so we were

586
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:47,330
interested in my figuring out how can we

587
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:50,390
kind of get some kind of third-party

588
00:26:47,329 --> 00:26:52,939
certification program that's robust that

589
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:56,020
addresses not just soil health and land

590
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,900
management but also fair labor practices

591
00:26:56,019 --> 00:27:02,509
and you know in parallel we're partners

592
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:05,000
how to go with Patagonia on the

593
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:06,650
regenerator organic standard so the

594
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:13,460
regenerative organic Alliance and the

595
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:15,679
website for that is regen organic org so

596
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:17,419
that's this next level certification

597
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,030
that takes the best of fair labor so

598
00:27:17,419 --> 00:27:23,000
health and animal welfare and pasture

599
00:27:20,029 --> 00:27:25,250
based criteria into one single standard

600
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,569
and we're all in the pilot of that and

601
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,079
we're going to launch that early next

602
00:27:26,569 --> 00:27:28,970
year

603
00:27:27,079 --> 00:27:32,599
for you know full-scale commercial

604
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:34,220
launch so kind of in parallel we were in

605
00:27:32,599 --> 00:27:37,009
the cannabis space kind of parallel to

606
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:40,038
the regenerative organic we we

607
00:27:37,009 --> 00:27:42,319
identified Andrew black who's you know

608
00:27:40,038 --> 00:27:45,519
works with organ tilt who's our our main

609
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:47,808
organic certified and just really cool

610
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:51,980
awesome cat you know driving and

611
00:27:47,808 --> 00:27:53,928
certified count kind and then Jacob over

612
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:56,750
in Colorado doing cannabis Conservancy

613
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:59,210
doing great work and realized these are

614
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,849
two really great cats to work with and

615
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:03,679
then flow kana you know really

616
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:06,490
appreciated their business model and

617
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,259
that they very much have the ethics of

618
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,058
going to partners going to market in

619
00:28:09,259 --> 00:28:12,230
partnership with their farmers and not

620
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:16,460
trying to play them off against each

621
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:18,048
other and you know also a really good

622
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,419
sounding partner and to some other

623
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:21,589
stakeholders mostly farmers and then

624
00:28:20,419 --> 00:28:23,570
just identifying some just really

625
00:28:21,589 --> 00:28:25,609
kick-ass farmers we were growing

626
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:27,678
cannabis in a truly regenerative way a

627
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:29,569
lot of time I've met many of them

628
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:33,798
multi-generational back-to-the-landers

629
00:28:29,569 --> 00:28:36,048
you know their parents were you know

630
00:28:33,798 --> 00:28:38,298
part of the original organic kind of

631
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:40,788
revolution and are just growing like

632
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:42,769
really beautiful integrated farms where

633
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:45,079
cannabis is growing alongside vegetables

634
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:47,450
and just you know taking care of their

635
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:50,909
land right and treating their people

636
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:53,340
right so we were you know we

637
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:55,250
we help bring everyone together or just

638
00:28:53,339 --> 00:29:00,119
help you know throw some fuel on the on

639
00:28:55,250 --> 00:29:02,460
on the process and so long story short

640
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:05,159
Sun and Earth is a certification

641
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,740
standard specific to cannabis but

642
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:11,490
basically is you know very something of

643
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,109
a regenerative organic in that it you

644
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:16,380
know basically celebrates farmers and

645
00:29:13,109 --> 00:29:18,389
products and brands that are you know

646
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:22,800
sourcing and producing that assume in a

647
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:25,730
righteous way you know without chemicals

648
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,579
in the soil under the Sun a fair labor

649
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:32,630
and you know it's kind of tending their

650
00:29:29,579 --> 00:29:35,579
land right and and you know receiving

651
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:38,130
you know prices from brands that are

652
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:39,419
also certified but you know that they

653
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:43,890
can you know take care of their land

654
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:45,660
correctly so yeah so I guess you know

655
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:49,110
that's oh yeah and then brother David's

656
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:51,360
was a so then we're and we're

657
00:29:49,109 --> 00:29:54,599
brainstorming okay what's the most

658
00:29:51,359 --> 00:29:56,969
effective way of communicating sun under

659
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:58,529
certification in the market and to the

660
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,470
trade and we realize like actually

661
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:02,849
launching a brand but you know that

662
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:05,610
would be consumer facing and in the

663
00:30:02,849 --> 00:30:07,319
stores and talking about tenders but you

664
00:30:05,609 --> 00:30:09,929
know making it not-for-profit and being

665
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:12,230
clear that we're not you know we want to

666
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:14,519
see all our competition certified

667
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:17,610
southerners like we're not out here to

668
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:19,829
make money you just want to you know

669
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,869
create you know market presence and

670
00:30:19,829 --> 00:30:25,109
consumer demand for Southern Earth and

671
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:30,239
have that be like the organic USDA seal

672
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:32,339
or Intel Inside and just everybody can

673
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,230
jump on that and that's exactly what we

674
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:36,480
want to see and we're now starting to

675
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,950
see that there's a lot of interest and

676
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,799
we're hoping we're going to have a

677
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:43,980
critical mass with farms and brands so

678
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,899
that by second quarter next year there's

679
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,279
a really high-powered marketing firm

680
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,710
that wants to do a bunch of pro bono

681
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,220
work for senators but we want to wait

682
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:54,569
until there is like a critical mass of a

683
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:57,839
certified product in the market and

684
00:30:54,569 --> 00:31:00,029
brands before we kind of pull the

685
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:02,970
trigger on that but then that would be a

686
00:31:00,029 --> 00:31:04,889
pretty big marketing campaign on behalf

687
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:09,420
of senators

688
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:11,400
and so we're looking forward to that and

689
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,740
then I guess the you know other thing

690
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:17,610
here going on it's like super awesome

691
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:20,609
somewhat related but maybe not the most

692
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:24,240
related but awesome is the psychedelic

693
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:28,500
or the psilocybin therapy campaign in

694
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:34,440
Oregon alongside a broad-based drug

695
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,509
policy reform I would say general

696
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,410
decriminalization of all drugs and shift

697
00:31:36,509 --> 00:31:41,549
from mass incarceration to treatment

698
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:44,160
measure and so there's two measures in

699
00:31:41,549 --> 00:31:45,839
Oregon that are right now being pulled

700
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:48,480
tested and make sure they're viable what

701
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:50,549
we're pretty optimistic that both will

702
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,299
be so that in Oregon you're gonna have a

703
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:57,450
perfect storm of psilocybin therapy and

704
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:59,700
ship to Portugal style a criminalization

705
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:02,819
of all drugs and treating addiction as a

706
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,430
health problem and and and using tax

707
00:32:02,819 --> 00:32:07,559
revenues from marijuana there to fund

708
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:10,140
treatment centers and then introducing

709
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:13,589
psilocybin therapy into the culture you

710
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:15,930
know in a really in a way that license

711
00:32:13,589 --> 00:32:20,039
just licensed and trained facilitators

712
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:24,150
and make sure that there's a you know

713
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,799
good preparation good set in setting you

714
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:28,670
know good integration afterwards and

715
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:30,599
really optimize the therapeutic outcomes

716
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:32,009
because I think it's like it's really

717
00:32:30,599 --> 00:32:35,250
exciting what's happening up there and

718
00:32:32,009 --> 00:32:38,490
we've committed resources to both

719
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:39,529
campaigns so but anyways this shifting

720
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:43,740
back the Sun and Earth

721
00:32:39,529 --> 00:32:45,359
yeah we're just really excited that you

722
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:47,990
know we're just the amount of interest

723
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:50,129
there is out there and yeah it's hope to

724
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:52,589
see more and more farmers I think we

725
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,530
just had a first for Oregon farmers

726
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:57,359
certified senators which is awesome

727
00:32:55,529 --> 00:33:01,049
and it's you know not in the brother

728
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:04,949
David's supply chain and that's also

729
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:09,629
important so so yeah so I guess that's

730
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:12,180
the background where we're at now wow

731
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:15,090
that was a lot of great information it's

732
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:16,529
so wonderful to hear your your family's

733
00:33:15,089 --> 00:33:18,839
history and

734
00:33:16,529 --> 00:33:20,250
that strong foundation in in sort of

735
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:22,379
ethics and morality that's been

736
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:23,900
expressed and and the history of

737
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:27,510
activism that's really been passed down

738
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:30,840
generally generally generationally it's

739
00:33:27,509 --> 00:33:32,759
really cool I have a lot of questions

740
00:33:30,839 --> 00:33:34,500
but since we last talked about sun and

741
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:38,250
earth why don't we just dive in with

742
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:40,380
that you've talked about how it's this

743
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:43,200
regenerative organic certification that

744
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:47,010
just goes so far beyond anything that

745
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:48,930
currently exists and people can I'll put

746
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:51,450
all the links online here so people can

747
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:53,009
read more about exactly what that

748
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:54,330
certification entails so we're not going

749
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:55,650
to go into all those details I'll

750
00:33:54,329 --> 00:33:58,470
probably have Andrew on to talk more

751
00:33:55,650 --> 00:34:02,670
about them but you talked about this

752
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:05,789
need for a unifying certification around

753
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:07,590
regenerative cannabis can you touch on

754
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:09,360
that a little bit more as to like the

755
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:12,000
importance from you know as someone who

756
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,829
has a background in you know

757
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,739
understanding cus ort of marketing and

758
00:34:13,829 --> 00:34:18,659
large-scale distribution of things how

759
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:22,469
important is this certification from

760
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:24,210
that perspective yeah and you know first

761
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:26,519
I do you want to shout out to dem Pierre

762
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:28,980
and you know by dynamic and you know

763
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:32,579
there's other real quality efforts and

764
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,619
standards out there and you know we see

765
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:37,019
that we're in solidarity and alliance

766
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:40,679
with with all the high bar standards out

767
00:34:37,019 --> 00:34:42,389
there but you know we we do really feel

768
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:46,378
there is a need for senators and that

769
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,570
third party kind of system for consumers

770
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:52,589
especially when you have want to get to

771
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:56,010
scale and you have distance between the

772
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:58,680
consumer and the farmer yeah that so

773
00:34:56,010 --> 00:35:00,540
that third party is you know and then we

774
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,539
like multi ingredients and all that that

775
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:07,759
third party verification is pretty key

776
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:07,759
so yeah I think for you know that

777
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,400
yeah the importance of a certification

778
00:35:11,369 --> 00:35:17,549
in the first place is you know there's

779
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,960
over it's easy to to talk to talk you

780
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:21,570
know it's much harder to walk the walk

781
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,099
so the certification is a way of like

782
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:26,519
kind of breaking through the

783
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:28,230
greenwashing - you know sincerely

784
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:29,550
communicate honestly communicates

785
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:32,599
consumers that you know

786
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:35,360
indeed was produced to the highest bar

787
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:38,579
you know regenerative organic criteria

788
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:40,050
and then um and then yeah the marketing

789
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:42,329
campaign I mean it's just kind of

790
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:46,260
crucial that there's a lot of noise in

791
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:48,389
the market and a lot of competing you

792
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,590
know whatever so yeah it's as important

793
00:35:48,389 --> 00:35:52,710
you know put together a good

794
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:55,829
communication campaign so that you know

795
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:56,159
consumers are aware of what this is

796
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:58,259
about

797
00:35:56,159 --> 00:36:00,089
you know why it's important and why they

798
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:02,400
should look forward and buy these kind

799
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:05,570
of products yeah I'm up here in

800
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,950
Washington State I was grateful for your

801
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:12,809
contributions that dr. Bronner's made

802
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:14,189
towards the GMO labeling campaign that

803
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:17,549
was where I first really started hearing

804
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:20,490
about your advocacy and inter in terms

805
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:22,050
of the organic movement up here in

806
00:36:20,489 --> 00:36:24,239
Washington State because we can't use

807
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:26,070
the word organic on any of our products

808
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:29,939
it gets really sticky it's really hard

809
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:31,620
to know how things were grown and it's a

810
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:34,079
big challenge here we've had a lot of

811
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:36,690
issues with pesticides the use of

812
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,289
illegal pesticides known carcinogens

813
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:44,070
even with regulations and testing by the

814
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:46,199
state and I know as a consumer I have

815
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:48,090
very little trust level in what's being

816
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:51,359
produced here in Washington without

817
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:54,210
having a personal relationship with the

818
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:58,289
cultivator and so I think allowing

819
00:36:54,210 --> 00:37:00,900
greater access and greater confidence in

820
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:03,570
what's being produced is is really

821
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:05,099
important yeah no that's it man right

822
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:06,660
there I mean that's that's the problem

823
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:10,739
right I mean there's so much pesticides

824
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:13,920
and crap in a lot of flowers being grown

825
00:37:10,739 --> 00:37:16,199
and yeah so Southern Earth is definitely

826
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,599
a way of guaranteeing that's not

827
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:21,239
happening and you know like if you don't

828
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:23,130
know your cultivator and you know you

829
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,159
can trust like a Sun and Earth product

830
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:31,140
nothing kind of exactly the point that

831
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:32,819
we're wanting to achieve here and and

832
00:37:31,139 --> 00:37:35,519
just to clarify sun and earth is only

833
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:38,610
for people that are growing in soil

834
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:40,889
outdoors under the Sun it doesn't offer

835
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:43,400
a certification option for people that

836
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:47,789
are growing in indoor environments

837
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:50,990
no it's you know I think there's some

838
00:37:47,789 --> 00:37:55,949
level of like some light that might be

839
00:37:50,989 --> 00:37:59,279
allowed and and you know and I think

840
00:37:55,949 --> 00:38:01,500
you're you know you know as far as like

841
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:04,860
the first few weeks or something can be

842
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:06,059
in a greenhouse or something you know

843
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:09,630
there's there's some reasonable

844
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:13,549
allowance but yeah but the general point

845
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:16,500
is we want it to be like in the soil and

846
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:20,640
you know farm like you know most things

847
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,750
or you know most most crops but you know

848
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:24,509
that said I mean there's a whole

849
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:26,869
spectrum of indoor and you know there

850
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:30,690
are much more ecological ways of growing

851
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:33,989
indoors obviously than others very much

852
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:37,289
appreciate you know people doing it much

853
00:38:33,989 --> 00:38:40,049
more high bar and indoors but I think

854
00:38:37,289 --> 00:38:42,210
the kind of gold standard is you know in

855
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:44,900
the soil and Under the Sun yeah I think

856
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:48,030
from an ecological impact perspective

857
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:49,559
growing outdoors in the Sun is is great

858
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:53,150
I think it's a challenge in certain

859
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:56,009
states depending on environment but

860
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,320
overall I think it's a very lofty and

861
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:01,590
very worthwhile goal and something to

862
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,470
shoot for and this standard goes so far

863
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:07,920
beyond anything organic it's it's pretty

864
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:09,329
crazy if you go to Sun and Earth org you

865
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,950
can read about it and I'll put links on

866
00:39:09,329 --> 00:39:13,949
the website it's it's pretty

867
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:15,809
comprehensive and I've had long

868
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:17,699
conversations with Andrew black as I'm

869
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:19,139
sure you have too I didn't realize how

870
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:22,019
challenging putting together a

871
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:23,219
certification really was in my head when

872
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:25,920
I first started learning about I was

873
00:39:23,219 --> 00:39:29,389
like well is it an organic input sure

874
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,650
then it's okay but there's so many other

875
00:39:29,389 --> 00:39:34,529
things to consider and it's really like

876
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:36,840
navigating this grey area almost it's

877
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,760
not as black and white when you're

878
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,500
trying to establish it and then once you

879
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,600
have it like in the case with your

880
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:45,119
certification it becomes more black and

881
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:48,690
white you can say this is ok this is not

882
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:51,420
ok but getting there I I can see all

883
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:54,990
those challenges in that path ya know

884
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,369
it's like yeah it's nothing not easy and

885
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:56,769
you know it's important to bring that

886
00:39:56,369 --> 00:39:58,599
you know

887
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:01,150
various stakeholders together they you

888
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:03,219
know everyone can hear everyone's you

889
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:05,530
know experience and views and you know

890
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:07,779
it's you know and then put the standard

891
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:09,519
out for comment and get like more

892
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,700
widespread feedback it just makes sure

893
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:17,769
it's you know both rigorous and workable

894
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:18,519
and and all that so yeah andrew has done

895
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:20,230
a great job

896
00:40:18,519 --> 00:40:22,329
yeah and I'm looking forward to

897
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:23,469
interviewing him here soon to kind of

898
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:26,500
dive into some of the more technical

899
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:29,679
aspects but I did want to ask you so

900
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:31,630
brother David's is a is sort of a brand

901
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:34,029
sort of lender like a nonprofit more of

902
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:36,579
like a co-op model it sounds like from

903
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:38,800
what I was reading are all the are all

904
00:40:36,579 --> 00:40:40,690
the farms that are working with brother

905
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,990
David's going to be sun and earth

906
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:46,599
certified as part of part of being

907
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:48,489
accepted into that program yeah exactly

908
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:51,670
I mean that's that's what we are we're

909
00:40:48,489 --> 00:40:54,339
we're we're basically a not-for-profit

910
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:55,690
brand celebrating senators farmers like

911
00:40:54,340 --> 00:41:00,250
that's you know we're a brand platform

912
00:40:55,690 --> 00:41:01,869
to kind of celebrate the rocks these the

913
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:04,599
rock star farmers they're the

914
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:07,690
celebrities and the point of the whole

915
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:08,889
project and you know we just generally

916
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:10,809
want people to really kind of think

917
00:41:08,889 --> 00:41:13,690
about the fact that you know everything

918
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:17,349
reproduces or everything we consume has

919
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:20,019
been you know grown and produced in you

920
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:21,400
know somewhere by some farmer and you

921
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,949
know how was it produced who is that

922
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:26,680
farmer was that it was their farm labor

923
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:28,480
respected or exploited you know just

924
00:41:26,679 --> 00:41:32,469
just really connecting to the ed to the

925
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,909
farm level so yeah so we're we're

926
00:41:32,469 --> 00:41:36,879
exclusively working with some of their

927
00:41:33,909 --> 00:41:40,239
certified farmers okay so the the idea

928
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:42,550
is then that farms are incentivized to

929
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:45,699
join this program because they're going

930
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:48,039
to have people backing them handling

931
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:49,629
more of the marketing and those aspects

932
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:52,029
and they can focus then on the farming

933
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:55,300
and cultivation and then from a consumer

934
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:57,310
perspective will the product cost maybe

935
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,470
a dollar or two more but you're getting

936
00:41:57,309 --> 00:42:02,349
all that reassurance and you're

937
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:03,909
supporting the farms and ethics that may

938
00:42:02,349 --> 00:42:05,949
support you know your own personal

939
00:42:03,909 --> 00:42:07,420
ethics when you're buying a product is

940
00:42:05,949 --> 00:42:11,279
that is that sort of the idea behind

941
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:13,088
that yeah so it's

942
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,170
Minoo it still depends I mean

943
00:42:13,088 --> 00:42:16,269
southerners we argh

944
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:20,909
I mean brother David's for sure we pay a

945
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:23,019
premium to our southerners farmers and

946
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:25,269
you know and there is going to be a

947
00:42:23,019 --> 00:42:27,659
marketing budget for Senate earth so if

948
00:42:25,269 --> 00:42:30,429
you are just a farmer selling direct to

949
00:42:27,659 --> 00:42:34,358
consumer you know hopefully we're going

950
00:42:30,429 --> 00:42:36,250
to create awareness but you know such

951
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:38,319
that you commit can command a price

952
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:41,260
premium but you know generally speaking

953
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:43,960
I think a lot of you know what we're

954
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:46,510
going to really target as far as getting

955
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:48,280
that premium to farmers and we want to

956
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:50,260
see the brands at the brand level

957
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,019
certified a son on earth and then as

958
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:55,869
part of that commitment like they would

959
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:58,239
then pay like a 10% premium or you know

960
00:42:55,869 --> 00:43:00,190
or whatever to farmers that they're

961
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:01,899
sourcing from who are you know go

962
00:43:00,190 --> 00:43:05,260
through the effort to become senator

963
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,420
certified you know that's not like

964
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,410
mandated but it's like something that

965
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:14,079
were you know recommending that that be

966
00:43:11,409 --> 00:43:16,059
the case and you know it's kind of like

967
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:18,369
organic on the shelf I mean it is a

968
00:43:16,059 --> 00:43:20,980
higher price and it's just about

969
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:24,490
communicating to consumers you know why

970
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:26,050
they should pay that higher premium and

971
00:43:24,489 --> 00:43:29,139
you know we're gonna set about doing

972
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:31,269
that but I wouldn't say advice ours like

973
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:33,549
you know oh we totally got it and you

974
00:43:31,269 --> 00:43:35,079
don't have to spend time like telling

975
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:37,060
the story we kind of need all of us it's

976
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:39,549
kind of like a what do you say open

977
00:43:37,059 --> 00:43:42,159
source project we all got to be talking

978
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:43,630
about it so I'm kind of curious your

979
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:46,389
opinion so you guys have managed to

980
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:48,250
maintain your ethics and integrity with

981
00:43:46,389 --> 00:43:50,679
dr. Bronner's and still lead the

982
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:52,929
industry in in your field with natural

983
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:54,309
soaps I'm kind of wondering how do you

984
00:43:52,929 --> 00:43:56,019
manage to compete with these larger

985
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,730
corporations that are making more money

986
00:43:56,019 --> 00:43:59,679
and spending more on marketing you know

987
00:43:57,730 --> 00:44:01,539
using cheaper inputs and yet you're

988
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,299
still able to pay an equitable wage and

989
00:44:01,539 --> 00:44:05,170
donate considerable funds to the causes

990
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:07,180
you believe in

991
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:08,650
I think there's parallels here in the

992
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:10,929
cannabis industry as some of these

993
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:13,450
larger companies are moving in do you

994
00:44:10,929 --> 00:44:16,029
have any advice or anything you can

995
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:19,269
share around that yeah you know I think

996
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:21,630
just being kind of true to yourself and

997
00:44:19,269 --> 00:44:24,550
[Music]

998
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:27,760
you know doing the right thing

999
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:33,070
you know making sure your your pain your

1000
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:34,660
people well you know sourcing from the

1001
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:37,150
you know right kind of farms and farmers

1002
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:39,779
and and all that you know results in a

1003
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,130
somewhat higher price point but you know

1004
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:44,160
you know telling that you know just

1005
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:46,420
being effective and telling that story

1006
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:49,329
and communicating that there's you know

1007
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:51,849
a huge swath of cannabis consumers who

1008
00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:54,190
like organic shoppers for food I mean

1009
00:44:51,849 --> 00:44:55,838
they want to know where their medicine

1010
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:59,409
comes from they want to know it didn't

1011
00:44:55,838 --> 00:45:02,980
suck and um you know I think that there

1012
00:44:59,409 --> 00:45:05,739
is a real market there to tap and yeah

1013
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:07,088
you know I think um you know the big

1014
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:09,009
players they've you know they're gonna

1015
00:45:07,088 --> 00:45:11,170
have a lot of a lot of money it's the

1016
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:12,700
campaigns and whatnot but you know they

1017
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:16,450
generally aren't going to have as much

1018
00:45:12,699 --> 00:45:20,710
soul as a really kind of smaller more

1019
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:24,608
awesome more nimble kind of brand or

1020
00:45:20,710 --> 00:45:26,170
company farm and I think that you know

1021
00:45:24,608 --> 00:45:28,659
just kind of really connecting and that

1022
00:45:26,170 --> 00:45:30,670
more soulful way with your customer base

1023
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:33,639
and I'm just really appreciating what

1024
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:36,000
you're about is I you know really you

1025
00:45:33,639 --> 00:45:38,279
know not just producing the right just

1026
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,380
product and you know best way possible

1027
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,820
but um you know there's also generally

1028
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,750
vibrating in a way that's trying to make

1029
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:51,280
the world better I think that you know

1030
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:52,630
definitely can um with sand well I mean

1031
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,700
it's you know I'm not well I don't want

1032
00:45:52,630 --> 00:45:57,880
to minimize how hard and difficult it is

1033
00:45:54,699 --> 00:45:59,618
with all the players moving in and the

1034
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,910
huge disruptions going on in the

1035
00:45:59,619 --> 00:46:03,280
industry and that's part of what's on

1036
00:46:00,909 --> 00:46:05,170
earth is about is is really about

1037
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:06,910
helping you know the farms and small

1038
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:08,200
family farmers you know really

1039
00:46:06,909 --> 00:46:11,710
struggling in this kind of catastrophe

1040
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:13,149
really to survive and this is one of the

1041
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,730
tools it's like okay how do we

1042
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:17,410
effectively communicate to the consumers

1043
00:46:15,730 --> 00:46:19,630
like dr. Bronner's it's connected with

1044
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:23,199
you know how do we get you know what

1045
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:24,579
what are the tools how did we do it so

1046
00:46:23,199 --> 00:46:27,639
that's part of what some of nurses and

1047
00:46:24,579 --> 00:46:30,880
yeah and I would just say that you know

1048
00:46:27,639 --> 00:46:34,029
we were small once and that you know I

1049
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,670
guess yeah and then you know just making

1050
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:38,319
sure you got the you know right margin

1051
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:39,789
structure to support all that

1052
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:43,380
but you know not too high a price point

1053
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:46,749
that's a big trick and um

1054
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:49,390
yeah I guess just navigating the waters

1055
00:46:46,748 --> 00:46:52,958
skillfully is you can and with a whole

1056
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:55,478
lot of luck yeah I guess that's how we

1057
00:46:52,958 --> 00:46:58,298
did it so what I'm hearing is is have a

1058
00:46:55,478 --> 00:47:00,759
good product stick to your guns and keep

1059
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:02,768
your ethics and what you believe in and

1060
00:47:00,759 --> 00:47:05,019
then make sure to tell a story and tell

1061
00:47:02,768 --> 00:47:08,018
your message effectively is that sort of

1062
00:47:05,018 --> 00:47:10,298
the some some of what you're what you're

1063
00:47:08,018 --> 00:47:11,798
getting out there that's it and then and

1064
00:47:10,298 --> 00:47:14,139
then yeah and then I don't know I mean

1065
00:47:11,798 --> 00:47:16,630
maybe that you resonate in an in a cool

1066
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:19,958
way and you get some cool breaks yeah

1067
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:22,169
just staying true to your guns in some

1068
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:25,448
ways that you wouldn't otherwise and

1069
00:47:22,168 --> 00:47:29,858
yeah but um but yeah that's it

1070
00:47:25,449 --> 00:47:32,199
that's pretty much the the recipe yeah

1071
00:47:29,858 --> 00:47:34,659
so your your advocacy for hemp and

1072
00:47:32,199 --> 00:47:36,699
cannabis goes back you know quite far I

1073
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:39,489
know you were even arrested in back in

1074
00:47:36,699 --> 00:47:41,199
2012 in front of the White House how do

1075
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:44,139
you feel the legalization process has

1076
00:47:41,199 --> 00:47:45,188
gone so far in a lot of these states and

1077
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:48,699
where do you see it headed for

1078
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:50,798
cultivators yeah well you know actually

1079
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,849
and that's the view point out something

1080
00:47:50,798 --> 00:47:54,969
there's like you know instead of a

1081
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:56,679
marketing budget like we've got kind of

1082
00:47:54,969 --> 00:48:00,119
an activism budget and we're like really

1083
00:47:56,679 --> 00:48:02,858
good at leveraging our activism to

1084
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:04,689
generate you know not just when the

1085
00:48:02,858 --> 00:48:07,958
cause do we want that's our main purpose

1086
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:10,149
and goal but also it effectively gets us

1087
00:48:07,958 --> 00:48:13,478
a lot of you know kind of media

1088
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:15,809
attention and you know whatever social

1089
00:48:13,478 --> 00:48:18,068
media and stuff so you know I think like

1090
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:21,400
spent you know just being out there and

1091
00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:24,400
fighting for causes that you no matter I

1092
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:27,278
mean most of all you to ourselves but

1093
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,028
also to you know people who are buying

1094
00:48:27,278 --> 00:48:32,168
our products

1095
00:48:28,028 --> 00:48:34,059
I think that's um you know just being in

1096
00:48:32,168 --> 00:48:36,368
they're really fighting the good fight

1097
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:40,890
is you know just helpful for building

1098
00:48:36,369 --> 00:48:44,229
building business in this kind of space

1099
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:46,929
and then yeah so legalization yeah I

1100
00:48:44,228 --> 00:48:49,629
mean I think that a lot of legalization

1101
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:51,130
is you know it's kind of like I don't

1102
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,068
know I forgot who said it but somebody

1103
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:54,588
said once

1104
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:58,759
like you don't want to watch laws or

1105
00:48:54,588 --> 00:49:00,978
sausage get made and you know a lot of

1106
00:48:58,759 --> 00:49:03,588
these like you know legalization efforts

1107
00:49:00,978 --> 00:49:06,198
are you know they're kind of driven by

1108
00:49:03,588 --> 00:49:07,699
polls like you know okay what do you

1109
00:49:06,199 --> 00:49:10,009
think what do they think they're gonna

1110
00:49:07,699 --> 00:49:12,139
get to 50 plus 1 with and all the

1111
00:49:10,009 --> 00:49:16,159
concessions that they make and that kind

1112
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:19,788
of over over burdensome regulations that

1113
00:49:16,159 --> 00:49:22,940
you know what you know various interests

1114
00:49:19,789 --> 00:49:25,039
feel are necessary to win and I

1115
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:27,559
definitely do appreciate the you know

1116
00:49:25,039 --> 00:49:30,049
kind of goal of any prohibition is first

1117
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:32,479
and foremost but yeah I think a lot of

1118
00:49:30,048 --> 00:49:35,659
them legalization efforts or you know

1119
00:49:32,478 --> 00:49:38,208
kind of less than ideal too far from

1120
00:49:35,659 --> 00:49:40,509
ideal as far as the regulatory burdens

1121
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:46,909
being placed on small farmers and

1122
00:49:40,509 --> 00:49:48,978
businesses and yeah so you know

1123
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:52,028
hopefully we can you know clean clean

1124
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:54,259
things up legislatively and then um you

1125
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:57,768
know then this would like market-based

1126
00:49:54,259 --> 00:50:00,409
programs like seminars just try to you

1127
00:49:57,768 --> 00:50:02,238
know really help kind of what's kind of

1128
00:50:00,409 --> 00:50:04,909
you know clearly the big industrial

1129
00:50:02,239 --> 00:50:06,829
players are moving in and or you look

1130
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:08,838
able to navigate this super complex

1131
00:50:06,829 --> 00:50:14,449
regulatory environment you know much

1132
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:17,659
easier um so yeah I mean ideally we move

1133
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:19,548
to a world where you know cannabis is

1134
00:50:17,659 --> 00:50:22,009
just another crop and it's more or less

1135
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:23,659
regulated and treated like one and not

1136
00:50:22,009 --> 00:50:26,239
like nuclear waste yeah

1137
00:50:23,659 --> 00:50:28,940
do you see cannabis following a wine or

1138
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:30,619
whiskey model or well do you think big

1139
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:32,929
big AG is going to take over the

1140
00:50:30,619 --> 00:50:35,390
industry here with potentially with

1141
00:50:32,929 --> 00:50:37,578
federal legalization no I think it's big

1142
00:50:35,389 --> 00:50:39,528
one I think it's like wine right you're

1143
00:50:37,579 --> 00:50:41,630
gonna have your what do you call it too

1144
00:50:39,528 --> 00:50:44,809
but Chuck you'll have the you know super

1145
00:50:41,630 --> 00:50:48,079
commodity stuff but you know I think

1146
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:50,930
very much cannabis will follow the wine

1147
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:54,229
model and you'll have you know everybody

1148
00:50:50,929 --> 00:50:56,598
who's producing quality cannabis not

1149
00:50:54,228 --> 00:50:58,399
everybody but you know I think people

1150
00:50:56,599 --> 00:51:01,789
are really producing like the top

1151
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:03,858
quality styles and doing a smart job you

1152
00:51:01,789 --> 00:51:06,199
know communicating and marketing you

1153
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:07,880
know what they're up to and

1154
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:09,559
you know just connecting in a soulful

1155
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:11,509
real way with their customers and

1156
00:51:09,559 --> 00:51:12,949
getting a good name for themselves it I

1157
00:51:11,509 --> 00:51:15,409
think just very much like you see with

1158
00:51:12,949 --> 00:51:19,188
the wine and I'm you know microwire II

1159
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:20,749
to whatever scale winery model um in

1160
00:51:19,188 --> 00:51:24,588
California and elsewhere I think that's

1161
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:26,708
pretty much how cannabis will go so

1162
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:30,349
they'll be big players mixed in with

1163
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:33,678
kind of smaller smaller players so you

1164
00:51:30,349 --> 00:51:35,809
don't see federal legalization having a

1165
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:38,709
dramatic impact on that because like for

1166
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:42,619
me I had this an interesting discussion

1167
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:45,828
with an some some other people that are

1168
00:51:42,619 --> 00:51:47,838
involved in canvas advocacy over on the

1169
00:51:45,829 --> 00:51:50,109
East Coast and my concern with federal

1170
00:51:47,838 --> 00:51:53,538
legalization is someone who you know

1171
00:51:50,108 --> 00:51:54,858
makes potting soils and provides organic

1172
00:51:53,539 --> 00:51:58,579
amendments and things like that to

1173
00:51:54,858 --> 00:52:01,489
growers is that you know Scott's or Dow

1174
00:51:58,579 --> 00:52:04,099
or Bayer could come in at any point with

1175
00:52:01,489 --> 00:52:06,438
federal legalization and pretty much you

1176
00:52:04,099 --> 00:52:07,880
know wipe me off the face of the map in

1177
00:52:06,438 --> 00:52:10,278
about five minutes

1178
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:13,789
and so I don't see my business model as

1179
00:52:10,278 --> 00:52:16,248
being something that has a potential

1180
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:19,039
long-term success just because I don't

1181
00:52:16,248 --> 00:52:23,108
have the dollars and the PhDs and it

1182
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:25,579
were a small company to stay relevant I

1183
00:52:23,108 --> 00:52:28,998
don't know what your thoughts are on it

1184
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:31,339
on the you know on all of this but I

1185
00:52:28,998 --> 00:52:34,068
think it's an interesting subject to

1186
00:52:31,338 --> 00:52:35,838
talk about for sure ya know I mean can

1187
00:52:34,068 --> 00:52:38,538
you say again what's your business focus

1188
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,308
what's your so Iowa I have a seven-acre

1189
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:45,439
like farm and feed store that's organic

1190
00:52:40,309 --> 00:52:46,999
in in Washington State and we you know

1191
00:52:45,438 --> 00:52:50,478
we're big advocates for growing your own

1192
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:52,638
food and regenerative agriculture but

1193
00:52:50,478 --> 00:52:54,348
I'm actually having to shut down the

1194
00:52:52,639 --> 00:52:56,599
farm due to some compliance code

1195
00:52:54,349 --> 00:52:59,659
compliance issues with the county and so

1196
00:52:56,599 --> 00:53:01,609
we're just focusing now on our gardening

1197
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:05,059
side of our business which is providing

1198
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:07,728
you know organic amendments and then

1199
00:53:05,059 --> 00:53:10,909
soils and things like that organic soils

1200
00:53:07,728 --> 00:53:13,158
to the cannabis industry and I know that

1201
00:53:10,909 --> 00:53:14,659
you know Scott's already has a line

1202
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:17,119
called black magic that's available in

1203
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:18,798
Home Depot you know more and more

1204
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,170
companies are focusing on organic

1205
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:23,688
and coming out there but a lot of the

1206
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:26,318
big AG companies are still holding off

1207
00:53:23,688 --> 00:53:28,909
due to this you know the federal

1208
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:30,558
regulations but I'm just wondering if

1209
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:31,368
we're gonna get flooded the moment I'm

1210
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,929
wondering if they're already doing

1211
00:53:31,369 --> 00:53:36,170
research and they're just ready to take

1212
00:53:32,929 --> 00:53:38,449
over the moment you know someone else is

1213
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:39,679
elected or the things go legal I did

1214
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:43,309
it's really interesting

1215
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:45,619
ya know I mean that's definitely you

1216
00:53:43,309 --> 00:53:48,709
know a concern and I mean I would say

1217
00:53:45,619 --> 00:53:50,809
that I'm just kind of like you see with

1218
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:53,598
organic and and the point of like

1219
00:53:50,809 --> 00:53:55,519
regenerative organic is that it kind of

1220
00:53:53,599 --> 00:53:57,410
rewards there's only you know it's

1221
00:53:55,518 --> 00:53:59,568
generally hard to be a senator's farmer

1222
00:53:57,409 --> 00:54:02,268
or regenerative organic farmers here big

1223
00:53:59,568 --> 00:54:06,768
this is it's pretty management intensive

1224
00:54:02,268 --> 00:54:09,919
style farming and you know lends itself

1225
00:54:06,768 --> 00:54:11,958
to smaller scale to kind of handle the

1226
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:13,489
diverse crop rotations and I mean

1227
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:16,788
they're much more productive funds by

1228
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:18,528
area and um you know and just a you know

1229
00:54:16,789 --> 00:54:21,410
much more knowledge intensive management

1230
00:54:18,528 --> 00:54:24,858
intensive versus chemical intensive so I

1231
00:54:21,409 --> 00:54:27,078
think that you know that's part of what

1232
00:54:24,858 --> 00:54:30,498
we hope to do with Sun on earth you know

1233
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:33,439
is you know create that market space and

1234
00:54:30,498 --> 00:54:36,438
consumer space this is hard to do at a

1235
00:54:33,438 --> 00:54:38,958
large scale and then yeah you know I

1236
00:54:36,438 --> 00:54:43,728
mean for any given I guess input or

1237
00:54:38,958 --> 00:54:46,489
commodity you know I guess yeah I guess

1238
00:54:43,728 --> 00:54:48,228
it depends but yeah I mean I you know I

1239
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:50,318
can see how the you know big players

1240
00:54:48,228 --> 00:54:53,688
moving in it that's definitely not a

1241
00:54:50,318 --> 00:54:55,518
concern but you know hopefully you know

1242
00:54:53,688 --> 00:54:57,108
you can get a you know customer base I

1243
00:54:55,518 --> 00:54:59,028
just really appreciate the integrity and

1244
00:54:57,108 --> 00:55:01,009
soul that's you're putting into making

1245
00:54:59,028 --> 00:55:03,728
your amendments and you know whatever's

1246
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:09,619
going into the Scott's black magic stuff

1247
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:10,759
you know not nearly as awesome so you

1248
00:55:09,619 --> 00:55:12,499
know and that's something I guess per

1249
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:17,239
senator to think about on the input side

1250
00:55:12,498 --> 00:55:19,608
as well you know that kind of reality

1251
00:55:17,239 --> 00:55:21,228
well well Sun on Earth is interesting to

1252
00:55:19,608 --> 00:55:23,958
me because there aren't a lot of inputs

1253
00:55:21,228 --> 00:55:25,998
coming from off the farm which I think

1254
00:55:23,958 --> 00:55:31,219
is is wonderful I mean that's ultimately

1255
00:55:25,998 --> 00:55:32,079
what we all aim for realizing that much

1256
00:55:31,219 --> 00:55:35,139
of

1257
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:38,679
cannabis cultivation is not going to be

1258
00:55:35,139 --> 00:55:40,869
able to qualify for senator certified do

1259
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:44,109
you see another certification like I

1260
00:55:40,869 --> 00:55:46,449
know certified kind already exist and is

1261
00:55:44,110 --> 00:55:48,099
a great program but do you see other

1262
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:49,359
certifications showing up down the road

1263
00:55:48,099 --> 00:55:51,339
I know the Washington State Department

1264
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,220
of Ag has talked about having an organic

1265
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:56,620
certification and they're working on one

1266
00:55:53,219 --> 00:55:58,359
what what would can we have for indoor

1267
00:55:56,619 --> 00:56:00,549
growers for example or other forms of

1268
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,650
cultivation yeah yeah

1269
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:04,690
hundred percent I mean I think it's all

1270
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,639
about incremental progress and I don't

1271
00:56:04,690 --> 00:56:09,700
want to say that the perfect should be

1272
00:56:06,639 --> 00:56:11,819
the enemies are good you know I think

1273
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:13,889
there's definitely room for

1274
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:17,559
certifications at different levels I

1275
00:56:13,889 --> 00:56:19,960
mean ideally they are like an on-ramp to

1276
00:56:17,559 --> 00:56:22,509
Sun and Earth eventually as farmers kind

1277
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:27,159
of get off chemical employees and start

1278
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:29,890
generating more on farms utility and you

1279
00:56:27,159 --> 00:56:33,969
know just get a into that rhythm but I

1280
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:37,599
think definitely a spectrum makes sense

1281
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:40,149
and is gonna be the reality so you think

1282
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:41,969
there's a chance you know chemical or

1283
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:45,010
synthetic growers will switch over to

1284
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:46,629
this type of certification because the

1285
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,670
way I saw this is like this this

1286
00:56:46,630 --> 00:56:51,160
certification is so far beyond even just

1287
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:52,900
organic certification the people that

1288
00:56:51,159 --> 00:56:54,159
were going to the farmers at least that

1289
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:56,230
would be interesting to be the ones that

1290
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:59,289
are already like pretty passionate about

1291
00:56:56,230 --> 00:57:01,090
regenerative agriculture or at least

1292
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:03,880
have some working knowledge cuz the

1293
00:57:01,090 --> 00:57:08,940
amount of knowledge involved to meet the

1294
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:08,940
standard is pretty high I would say yeah

1295
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:14,380
he's a jumping off point so some years

1296
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:16,660
is organic not not conventional farming

1297
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:19,480
I mean honey I would say convention

1298
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:23,769
would need to go organic and just kind

1299
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:27,250
of learn you know you know I mean it's a

1300
00:57:23,769 --> 00:57:31,000
big thing to go off chemicals and manage

1301
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:35,739
custom you pressure fertility you know

1302
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:37,599
without synthetic inputs and yeah I

1303
00:57:35,739 --> 00:57:40,689
don't think most conventional growers

1304
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:42,639
are in a position to go to seminars but

1305
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:45,610
I think if we're successful as a program

1306
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:48,159
you know like the USDA Organic Program

1307
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:51,340
we create a charity man you know that

1308
00:57:48,159 --> 00:57:55,029
will create you know the incentives for

1309
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:57,340
many farmers who you know who are

1310
00:57:55,030 --> 00:57:59,860
removing organic but not quite to sunder

1311
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:02,680
it so like go ahead and up their game to

1312
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:06,190
that level I guess you know Indian

1313
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:07,359
dimensional farmers can um you know

1314
00:58:06,190 --> 00:58:09,340
there's things like integrated pest

1315
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,160
management you know different

1316
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:13,720
regenerative act techniques that are not

1317
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:17,109
they're not necessarily an organic

1318
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:19,299
program but are farming in a relatively

1319
00:58:17,110 --> 00:58:22,450
more ecological way versus like the

1320
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:28,539
complete disaster you know monoculture

1321
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:31,379
GMO deserts but uh but ya know I think

1322
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:34,929
it's definitely a um the high bar is

1323
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:36,970
definitely enough everybody is ready to

1324
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:39,039
merely summon earth but we do want to

1325
00:58:36,969 --> 00:58:41,079
recognize everybody who is there who

1326
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:43,900
right now don't have that kind of market

1327
00:58:41,079 --> 00:58:46,319
distinction you know we want to give

1328
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:50,260
them that recognition and

1329
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:53,860
consumer-facing recognition so your

1330
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:55,510
philosophy is really to meet growers

1331
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:58,059
wherever they're at in the journey and

1332
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:59,920
if you can just send them a little a

1333
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:02,650
little closer a little further down the

1334
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,940
path towards helping the environment and

1335
00:59:02,650 --> 00:59:06,309
being a little more ecologically

1336
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:08,110
conscious than it's a wind so this

1337
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:10,150
really isn't intended to be exclusive

1338
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:14,230
it's it's more of an inclusive process

1339
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:16,030
it sounds like yeah that's you know in

1340
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:19,000
the regenerate organic standard we've

1341
00:59:16,030 --> 00:59:20,740
got a bronze silver gold system and I

1342
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,929
think they're entertaining a tiered

1343
00:59:20,739 --> 00:59:27,549
system if that's not already the case

1344
00:59:22,929 --> 00:59:29,289
and seminars and yeah a magic guys

1345
00:59:27,550 --> 00:59:31,480
definitely want to you know and then

1346
00:59:29,289 --> 00:59:33,940
there's those incremental steps all

1347
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:35,320
along the way you said it well it's all

1348
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:38,740
about like wherever you are you know

1349
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:40,660
just begin that journey towards uh you

1350
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:44,199
know regenerative organic kind of holy

1351
00:59:40,659 --> 00:59:46,599
grail you know that's the idea Legrand

1352
00:59:44,199 --> 00:59:49,119
vision is like a flaw all of us take

1353
00:59:46,599 --> 00:59:51,339
responsibility as consumers and we see

1354
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:53,500
our plates as farms and our knives as

1355
00:59:51,340 --> 00:59:56,079
returning knives and our forces pitch

1356
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:57,670
boards and you know we you know what is

1357
00:59:56,079 --> 00:59:58,449
our section in the garden look like what

1358
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,798
is

1359
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:02,949
we're kind of farm where does that land

1360
00:59:59,798 --> 01:00:05,349
what is the farmers that look like his

1361
01:00:02,949 --> 01:00:08,588
workers you know is he able to take care

1362
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:10,119
of his land in a degenerative way or is

1363
01:00:08,588 --> 01:00:12,818
he just you know this is just like a

1364
01:00:10,119 --> 01:00:14,230
blasted industrial landscape that's just

1365
01:00:12,818 --> 01:00:16,329
you know wrecking the world and what

1366
01:00:14,230 --> 01:00:17,588
there's one third of their surface is

1367
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:19,778
under a duster or agricultural

1368
01:00:17,588 --> 01:00:22,449
mismanagement if we can shift that to

1369
01:00:19,778 --> 01:00:24,869
regenerative organic linear farm in

1370
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:27,129
nature's image farming ecosystems are

1371
01:00:24,869 --> 01:00:30,548
replicating natural ones and important

1372
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:33,369
functional ways you know I've been most

1373
01:00:30,548 --> 01:00:36,219
importantly good for about Everest I

1374
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:38,588
have a tad wildlife habitat going

1375
01:00:36,219 --> 01:00:41,739
nutritious nutrient-dense food medicine

1376
01:00:38,588 --> 01:00:44,230
and clothes and everything else I mean

1377
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:47,259
that'sthat's the goal so the consumer

1378
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:49,719
side you know creating the demand and

1379
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:51,339
I'm a farmer side that putting forward

1380
01:00:49,719 --> 01:00:53,558
the certification program and then

1381
01:00:51,338 --> 01:00:57,489
training programs also is really

1382
01:00:53,559 --> 01:00:58,630
important to just help us get there yeah

1383
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:00,729
I love it

1384
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:02,588
you're speaking my language I'd say it's

1385
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:05,190
so great to hear it and I I really

1386
01:01:02,588 --> 01:01:07,420
appreciate the work you guys are doing

1387
01:01:05,190 --> 01:01:09,759
this is sort of an unrelated question

1388
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,920
just out of curiosity to kind of end the

1389
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:14,528
podcast I know you mentioned you had

1390
01:01:11,920 --> 01:01:17,318
some time over in Amsterdam you started

1391
01:01:14,528 --> 01:01:20,079
you know consuming cannabis in college

1392
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:23,739
I'm sure at some point in time you've

1393
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:25,568
had conventional versus organic and and

1394
01:01:23,739 --> 01:01:28,479
probably a variety of different

1395
01:01:25,568 --> 01:01:31,659
cultivars do you have a favorite

1396
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:34,088
cultivar out of curiosity and then have

1397
01:01:31,659 --> 01:01:35,639
you can you tell a difference smoking

1398
01:01:34,088 --> 01:01:40,210
you know organically versus

1399
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:43,598
conventionally grown cannabis well I

1400
01:01:40,210 --> 01:01:45,400
mean I've been I guess back in that you

1401
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:48,730
know I had like not any real

1402
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,108
consciousness I mean my my experience in

1403
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:53,318
like the mid nineties was when the dead

1404
01:01:50,108 --> 01:01:54,699
were local talented you know podcast

1405
01:01:53,318 --> 01:01:57,250
it's on a whole other dimension of

1406
01:01:54,699 --> 01:01:58,659
awesome it was like ridiculous

1407
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:03,630
you know versus like them kind of

1408
01:01:58,659 --> 01:02:06,639
message that was and all around them and

1409
01:02:03,630 --> 01:02:08,259
yeah Amsterdam is you know I didn't

1410
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:11,588
really you know I wasn't yet kind of

1411
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:12,349
vibrating on that tube yeah and it was

1412
01:02:11,588 --> 01:02:15,380
until late

1413
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:17,179
you know I guess you know now I mean I

1414
01:02:15,380 --> 01:02:20,510
generally just don't really smoke I

1415
01:02:17,179 --> 01:02:24,139
guess much that isn't outdoor you know

1416
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:27,350
sun-grown organic you know my favorite

1417
01:02:24,139 --> 01:02:35,000
strain I would say the I'm really

1418
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:38,569
digging water dog farm the phoenix

1419
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:44,420
rising pretty pretty pretty amazing

1420
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:47,300
sativa both also like the lemon egg it's

1421
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:52,490
a kind of a lemonade rolls-royce Rose

1422
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:54,289
choice coming out of urban ology it's

1423
01:02:52,489 --> 01:02:56,209
one of our seminars certified media is

1424
01:02:54,289 --> 01:03:01,190
also a nurse certified I guess I like

1425
01:02:56,210 --> 01:03:06,199
the sativas generally speaking but also

1426
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:11,389
really harmony rose from oh that Elysian

1427
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:14,210
Fields or no soft pitch I'm blanking on

1428
01:03:11,389 --> 01:03:20,869
the farmer but that's harmony Rose it's

1429
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:22,849
the the lady she's actually cultivated a

1430
01:03:20,869 --> 01:03:24,500
lot of high CBD cultivars is kind of

1431
01:03:22,849 --> 01:03:27,039
really dialing in on the vibration of

1432
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:33,650
the high having no ideas underlying

1433
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:40,039
cannabinoid profile and yeah Harmony

1434
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:43,599
Rose is from oh my gosh anyways yeah and

1435
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:45,889
you know he gets I guess I don't know I

1436
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,019
you know if you did a blind taste test

1437
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:50,150
on the I don't know fun like that

1438
01:03:47,019 --> 01:03:52,820
sophisticated like really pulled apart

1439
01:03:50,150 --> 01:03:55,160
but I guess vibrationally I just like

1440
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:56,780
knowing you know same thing with an

1441
01:03:55,159 --> 01:03:59,329
apple I mean I guess you could you might

1442
01:03:56,780 --> 01:04:02,570
fool really conventional versus organic

1443
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:04,849
apple or something but you know I think

1444
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,490
just library should only just really

1445
01:04:04,849 --> 01:04:10,849
knowing that my medical center of my

1446
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:13,879
this Apple came from a farm those you

1447
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:15,940
know doing everything right and it is

1448
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:19,910
like a great place to work and live

1449
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:24,380
early your farmer or the farm dog or cow

1450
01:04:19,909 --> 01:04:26,119
or the you know bugs that it's all well

1451
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:28,340
not the certain kind of bugs

1452
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:32,210
after that kind of buzz it is a pretty

1453
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:33,620
good place you know I get that you know

1454
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:36,650
it's just more that knowledge it's like

1455
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:39,710
what's really important and then of

1456
01:04:36,650 --> 01:04:41,840
course the experience is also crucial

1457
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:44,059
and that's something you really want to

1458
01:04:41,840 --> 01:04:46,280
emphasize the Sun on Earth is that these

1459
01:04:44,059 --> 01:04:50,750
are some of the top quality flowers you

1460
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:54,290
know top top top shelves flowers but

1461
01:04:50,750 --> 01:04:57,110
anybody's producing and doing it in a

1462
01:04:54,289 --> 01:04:58,820
totally regenerative way so you're also

1463
01:04:57,110 --> 01:05:00,170
setting I think that's a good point so

1464
01:04:58,820 --> 01:05:01,640
you're also setting a standard in terms

1465
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:03,289
of the flower itself you're not just

1466
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:06,619
saying because you grew in this method

1467
01:05:03,289 --> 01:05:08,300
if it's you know poor quality it's not

1468
01:05:06,619 --> 01:05:10,339
