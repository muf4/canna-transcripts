1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:06,810
hey guys

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,699
tad here we kiss organics and I'm making

3
00:00:06,809 --> 00:00:10,410
this video because I see people posting

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:12,989
photos of their plants online all the

5
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,820
time and asking what's going on and you

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,640
see advice across ranging across the

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,160
board from at cal-mag to add molasses

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,449
you have a nitrogen deficiency but

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,929
really we don't know

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:27,000
and that's where soil testing comes in

11
00:00:24,929 --> 00:00:28,768
I think soil testing is critical and

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,689
everyone should be doing it in their

13
00:00:28,768 --> 00:00:32,759
gardens now most people are familiar

14
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,590
with the Logan lab standard soil test

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:35,759
this is a male like three test and

16
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,320
there's a bunch of different tests out

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:38,609
there and a bunch of labs but I'm just

18
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,480
gonna explain the comparisons between

19
00:00:38,609 --> 00:00:44,609
these two to keep this video short now

20
00:00:41,479 --> 00:00:47,339
may lick three tests tells us everything

21
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:49,439
that's in the soil so it'll give us our

22
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,600
cation exchange capacity or micro and

23
00:00:49,439 --> 00:00:53,339
macro nutrients it's not a hundred

24
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,698
percent accurate but it gives us a good

25
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,230
range now the disadvantage of that test

26
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,390
is it doesn't tell us what's actually

27
00:00:58,229 --> 00:01:01,890
available to the plant that's where

28
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,500
things like Tichy testing and a

29
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,019
saturated paste test or now this new kit

30
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:08,069
from soil savvy this soil test is

31
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,250
something I've been doing a lot of

32
00:01:08,069 --> 00:01:13,889
research on lately and it's very very

33
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:17,099
easy to use so let me show it to you

34
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:18,540
this is the entire kit it's got a return

35
00:01:17,099 --> 00:01:20,039
envelope so you're not paying for any

36
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,880
shipping to send the sample back which

37
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,159
is awesome

38
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:27,089
it's kind of scoop it's got simple

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,609
instructions and this is the whole kit

40
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:32,368
right here what's in here is a special

41
00:01:29,609 --> 00:01:34,950
synthetic resin or an artificial root

42
00:01:32,368 --> 00:01:36,989
and what that does is it slowly pulls up

43
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,090
ions over the course of five to seven

44
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:41,219
days and this is tells us what's

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,710
actually available to your planet right

46
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:47,938
now now the way you use a kit like this

47
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:49,859
is keep in mind everyone's room is

48
00:01:47,938 --> 00:01:51,868
different everyone's growing different

49
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:53,909
cultivars and strains everyone's using

50
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:57,060
different nutrients and has different

51
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,310
microbes cycling nutrients in their soil

52
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:00,750
so let's say you're having the best crop

53
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,030
you've ever grown two weeks in the

54
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:06,030
flower well you can take a soil sample

55
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,739
at that stage of growth and that will

56
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,618
give you a benchmark for future growth

57
00:02:07,739 --> 00:02:12,750
now let's say the next time around

58
00:02:10,618 --> 00:02:14,430
not skidding the same results well if

59
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,530
everything else is the same you can do

60
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,450
this well savvy test and see oh well my

61
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,430
manganese levels are lower this time or

62
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:22,679
I have too much iron and then you can

63
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:24,420
make real-time adjustments this is gonna

64
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,980
help increase your yield this is gonna

65
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,979
help with plant health and plant growth

66
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:32,459
it's an all-around win so in combination

67
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:34,408
with the Logan lab test which is going

68
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:36,479
to give us everything that's in the soil

69
00:02:34,408 --> 00:02:37,949
with this soil Saturday test which tells

70
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:40,348
us what's currently available to plant

71
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:42,298
it allows us to have a really good idea

72
00:02:40,348 --> 00:02:44,369
of the nutrient and mineral profiles of

73
00:02:42,299 --> 00:02:46,409
our soil the other way you can use this

74
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:48,719
test is let's say you want to know how

75
00:02:46,409 --> 00:02:50,789
quickly a given application is actually

76
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:52,530
becoming plants available or how much of

77
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:54,358
it is becoming plants available well

78
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:56,340
let's say for example you put out some

79
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,950
high peak guano and you wanna know when

80
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,390
is that phosphorus actually becoming

81
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:03,030
plants available well you could do a

82
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:05,789
test a week out and say okay this much

83
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,500
phosphorus is now in a form that the

84
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:10,289
plant can take up so it's a really

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,750
really easy simple and fast effective

86
00:03:10,289 --> 00:03:15,298
way of testing your soil I will be doing

87
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,370
a full podcast episode just on soil

88
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:18,870
testing in the near future if you're not

89
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,030
familiar with the podcast it's called

90
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,219
cannabis cultivation in science and you

91
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,769
can check it out right on our website

92
00:03:23,219 --> 00:03:28,799
kiss organics calm and it's also

93
00:03:25,769 --> 00:03:31,769
available on iTunes youtube stitcher all

94
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,329
the major platforms the last thing I

95
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:35,250
want to say about this soil test is we

96
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:38,209
do have it available on our website

97
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:41,669
right now it's $30 with free shipping

98
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:43,289
regularly $35 so if you wanted to try

99
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,329
this kind of testing and compare the

100
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:49,229
results this is a great way to do it and

101
00:03:45,329 --> 00:03:52,290
I've also included a soil test of the

102
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:54,988
Logan lab test and the soil savvy test

103
00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:56,969
right there on the product page of the

104
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:58,409
exact same sample so you can see the

105
00:03:56,969 --> 00:04:00,180
differences that you're getting in these

106
00:03:58,409 --> 00:04:02,400
test results it's really interesting so

107
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,579
check it out if you can't find it just

108
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,930
go on to kiss organics that's kis oor GA

109
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:11,219
and ICS comm type in soil test into the

110
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:12,900
search function it'll pop right up

111
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,949
alright thanks for checking out the

112
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,949
video happy growing
