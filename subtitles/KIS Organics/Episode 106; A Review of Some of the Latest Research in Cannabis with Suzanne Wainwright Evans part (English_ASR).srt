cultivation and science podcast and our

7
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,679
advertisers we can keep doing our part

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,539
to bridge the gap between research and

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,100
cultivation we are honored that you

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,840

00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:45,480
welcome to the Cannabis cultivation and

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,340
science podcast I'm your host Tad Hussey

16
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:49,019
of Kiss Organics this is the podcast

17

where we discuss The Cutting Edge of

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,559
growing from a science-based perspective

19
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,939
and drawn top experts from around the

20
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:56,038
industry to share their wisdom and

21
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:58,140
knowledge my guest this week is my good

22
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:00,480
friend Suzanne Wainwright Evans also

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,820
known by many as the bug lady she's an

24
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,739
ornamental entomologist specializing in

25
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,239
integrated Pest Management Suzanne has

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,159
been involved in the green industry for

27
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:09,959
more than 25 years with a primary focus

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,540
on biological controls and using

29
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:13,859
pesticides properly she is a graduate of

30
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:15,900
the University of Florida with degrees

31
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:17,938
in both entomology and environmental

32
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,680
Horticulture Suzanne has been on the

33
00:01:17,938 --> 00:01:21,298
podcast multiple times and I highly

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,680
suggest folks go back and listen to some

35
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,020
of her other podcasts if you haven't

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,700
already this podcast though is a

37
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:28,560
two-part Series where we discuss some of

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,540
the latest research in cannabis and hemp

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,640
from a recent invite-only conference she

40
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,520
had intended one of the biggest topics

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,400
being viruses and cannabis now on to the

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,478
show

43
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,400
but one thing I want to mention for

44
00:01:39,478 --> 00:01:43,259
Growers is like Guardian getting back to

45
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,780
Guardian mind spray because these

46
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,519
products aren't really regulated we

47
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,379
never people Growers were using it

48
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:51,420
thinking it was organic not realizing

49
00:01:49,379 --> 00:01:54,478
they were spraying was it abamectin or

50
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,579
Ivermectin yeah basically Avid abimectin

51
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:57,780
it's also known as minks too was in

52
00:01:56,578 --> 00:02:00,239
there

53
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,978
so there was Avid mixed in and we didn't

54
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:04,078
know it they were sending out samples to

55
00:02:01,978 --> 00:02:07,019
everyone so so many people contaminated

56
00:02:04,078 --> 00:02:08,758
their grows with with Avid without even

57
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:12,000
realizing it but you know the product

58
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:12,598
obviously worked really really well

59
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,759
um

60
00:02:12,598 --> 00:02:16,378
and so you're just trusting this

61
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:17,759
company's word until someone does

62
00:02:16,378 --> 00:02:20,878
independent testing and it wasn't until

63
00:02:17,759 --> 00:02:22,859
a grower in Oregon failed an organic

64
00:02:20,878 --> 00:02:24,479
grower for having Avid on their crop and

65
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:26,160
they're like there's no way

66
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:27,598
you know we haven't used anything except

67
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:29,520
for this Guardian mind spray that they

68
00:02:27,598 --> 00:02:30,899
tested it and found out and the guy got

69
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,459
in trouble

70
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,319
um frankly not in as much trouble as I

71
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,140
thought he should have but um

72
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:39,179
it's a good lesson for for Growers with

73
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,979
these 25b products to just be really

74
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:44,580
careful

75
00:02:40,979 --> 00:02:45,780
um but on that note Suzanne um a lot of

76
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,300
Growers

77
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:51,479
of organic guys I see push back against

78
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,340
using mineral oils they don't want to

79
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:55,018
use a petroleum-based product which I I

80
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:57,479
can understand

81
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,879
they'll technically put you know it's

82
00:02:57,479 --> 00:03:02,699
still mined from the Earth to a certain

83
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:06,060
extent I mean if you want to talk about

84
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:08,518
upcycling it's a byproduct I mean and I

85
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,979
mean I get it believe me I mean we buy

86
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,099
100 wind energy for our house we pay

87
00:03:10,979 --> 00:03:17,219
more to have wind energy at our place so

88
00:03:14,098 --> 00:03:20,399
that you know we're not paying for coal

89
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:22,859
and oil and you know we just bought a

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:29,040
hybrid electric pickup because you know

91
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:32,159
we I get it but at the same time I you

92
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:35,400
know a little you know it's okay to you

93
00:03:32,158 --> 00:03:38,158
know drive your you know F-350

94
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,280
everywhere every day if you don't need a

95
00:03:38,158 --> 00:03:43,500
truck and you know but they're going to

96
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,180
get upset about using a minimal amount

97
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,580
of a byproduct from the petroleum

98
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:49,799
industry do they not I mean I guarantee

99
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:51,959
you they use Ziploc baggies and it's

100
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,299
just weird how we've got obsessed with

101
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,739
this one little thing

102
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,140
um you know

103
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,459
or do they not use any other Plastics in

104
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,919
their production facility do they not

105
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,539
use hoses do they not use drip line I

106
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:06,780
don't see them bailing on those and

107
00:04:03,539 --> 00:04:09,060
those are all petroleum products

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:11,818
sure it's it's everywhere

109
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:14,039
um but let's are there what are some

110
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:16,500
examples of other options Growers could

111
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:19,620
consider if they weren't comfortable

112
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:22,379
using stuff oil X or mineral oils in

113
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:24,600
their Garden well I know the two oils

114
00:04:22,379 --> 00:04:25,860
we're testing right now I'll let you

115
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,639
know

116
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:29,220
um

117
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,139
but until the trials are done

118
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:32,759
I can't you know I don't have answers

119
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,680
yet you know first thing we're doing is

120
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:36,419
phytotoxicity on poinsettias because

121
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:39,240
they're again the most sensitive and

122
00:04:36,418 --> 00:04:41,159
then we're also looking at efficacy on

123
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,720
um like Lewis mites which is a type of

124
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,639
spider mites

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,520
um and then um we're also looking at

126
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,460
some white fly stuff right now so we're

127
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:54,180
slowly getting these products tested

128
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:57,120
um because uh many of my large or some

129
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:59,879
of my larger ornamental facilities

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,418
actually have r d departments that can

131
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:05,699
do trials and research stuff because

132
00:05:03,418 --> 00:05:07,079
they kind of have these rules of Growers

133
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:09,240
just can't take a product and go spray

134
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:11,819
it at the facility until it clears the r

135
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,840
d department for Vital toxicity and

136
00:05:11,819 --> 00:05:14,839
efficacy testing

137
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:24,659
so looking specifically at other oils

138
00:05:20,459 --> 00:05:27,258
I know like neem oil carranja oil are a

139
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,259
couple options

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:32,580
I mean there are other oils out there

141
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:35,100
for sure it's just they get really

142
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:37,198
expensive really fast if you just have a

143
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:38,580
few plants it's not going to mean much

144
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,079
to you I mean it's

145
00:05:38,579 --> 00:05:42,478
you know

146
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:44,120
you're okay with paying that price you

147
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:47,639
know a lot of in my head I'm used to

148
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:49,800
thinking about pennies you know of cost

149
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:51,720
and having to keep costs down on

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,819
everything and so that's why I'm always

151
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,500
thinking about the economics of it but

152
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,599
if you're a home hobby grower or a

153
00:05:55,500 --> 00:06:00,180
smaller production facility it's not

154
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,379
going to cost you that much more to use

155
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,660
like tetracurb uh rosemary oil

156
00:06:04,379 --> 00:06:07,978
okay and then with the neem oil you do

157
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,380
need to wait a little longer before

158
00:06:07,978 --> 00:06:11,579
reintroducing beneficials versus some of

159
00:06:10,379 --> 00:06:13,978
these other options based on the

160
00:06:11,579 --> 00:06:16,560
research you've seen it depends there's

161
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,459
a there's just so neem oil is so

162
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:23,519
variable and that's part of the problem

163
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:26,099
and I'm still a little you know gun shy

164
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:28,379
after the pesticide contamination issues

165
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,840
that came up with neem and acidor actin

166
00:06:28,379 --> 00:06:32,180
a couple years ago

167
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:35,459
um

168
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:39,300
you know I just I and and more likely to

169
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:42,000
have phytotoxicity issues with neem

170
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,120
so basically what happened was the neem

171
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,939
tree in India had gotten sprayed with a

172
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,879
very old pesticide that we don't even

173
00:06:47,939 --> 00:06:52,439
use here now we use them here still

174
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,740
I thought you said it was something that

175
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:56,819
was just so rare over here

176
00:06:54,740 --> 00:07:00,199
there were several different products

177
00:06:56,819 --> 00:07:00,199
they hit for by finthrin

178
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,860
Worthing

179
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:09,300
um and orthane is still used here in the

180
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:11,400
United States but the theory is that the

181
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:15,060
trees were because it wasn't like with

182
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:16,679
the with the Guardian mitocyte issue the

183
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,319
concentration was so high in there they

184
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:22,259
were opening the bottle pouring avidin

185
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:24,240
and you know doing that the levels in

186
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,520
the neem and the acid or action were so

187
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,139
for a second Suzanne um looks like the

188
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:29,459
internet went out but essentially what

189
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:31,800
you're saying is they were pouring the

190
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:34,680
Avid into the bottle based on the

191
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,720
concentration so am I back that makes

192
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,019
sense to me am I back you were back now

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,699
okay yeah where the the levels that were

194
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:43,799
found in these products and you know

195
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,598
it's been debated what happened you know

196
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:47,759
was it contamination at the bottling

197
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,379
plants were they bottling bifenthrin and

198
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,900
then they switched over to bottle neem

199
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:54,120
because it was very low levels

200
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,000
um I mean where the trees spray you know

201
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,399
there's because if you want to go down a

202
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,439
rabbit hole of scary pesticides

203
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:04,439
go look at what goes on in India with

204
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:07,079
pesticides like one of the worst stories

205
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:08,819
I ever read is they sprayed tea fields

206
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,899
and then elephants went in there and ate

207
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:12,000
some of the tea and it killed the

208
00:08:09,899 --> 00:08:15,318
elephants

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,560
oh that is awful yeah so

210
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:18,560
this is this

211
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:23,878
[ __ ] a spray stuff OLX but we'll buy

212
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,759
neem oil from India when you look at the

213
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:29,939
environmental stuff there is horrific

214
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:32,399
you know I mean you've got to pick and

215
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:34,139
choose your battles you can't be you

216
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,879
know

217
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:38,519
perfect at everything all the time

218
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:41,099
environmental and everything but it's

219
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:43,559
just weird to me that there's been this

220
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:46,800
pushback and it was kind of started by

221
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:49,319
one particular group of people on using

222
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:52,379
stuff oil and you know you're talking

223
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,440
about using a one percent in a gallon of

224
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:58,139
water which is a very small amount as

225
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,060
needed um I'm not saying neem I'm sorry

226
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,338
I'm not saying that stuff oil is for

227
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:04,500
everything but for you know again him

228
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,240
for us it might in spider mites it's a

229
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,519
great product you can do targeted

230
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,000
knockdowns it's cheap

231
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:15,139
um but again with anything you do there

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,539
is an environmental impact

233
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:21,179
and to be clear like neither of us work

234
00:09:18,539 --> 00:09:23,759
for or sell stuff oil or no it's a it's

235
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:27,299
a Brandt product you can also buy it

236
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:29,639
um even on Amazon as Monterey Garden or

237
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:31,859
Monterey horticultural oil

238
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:34,259
um that's the other branding if you're a

239
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:36,120
small homeowner grower

240
00:09:34,259 --> 00:09:38,338
um I've tried to sell it I frankly can't

241
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,139
I can't get at a price to where I could

242
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,519
resell it so

243
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:43,199
um but I think it's a good product and

244
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,000
so I'd recommend it we that's why

245
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,140
Suzanne recommends it and Suzanne's the

246
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,639
reason I recommend it it's just because

247
00:09:46,139 --> 00:09:50,759
there's a lot of research around it to

248
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:53,278
support it but we were talking at

249
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:55,080
mjbizcon about some of the other

250
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:56,879
products that are out there that are

251
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,440
like enzyme based or things like that

252
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:59,700
and we're talking about one in

253
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:02,459
particular and you're like oh that's

254
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,560
primarily citric acid can you touch on

255
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:07,619
that a little bit

256
00:10:04,559 --> 00:10:09,299
in terms of how that works or what

257
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,159
well if that might be an option for

258
00:10:09,299 --> 00:10:13,079
folks that are you know wanting to move

259
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:16,319
away from

260
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,639
more traditional pesticide options

261
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,839
yes

262
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,379
um

263
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:24,600
I mean I kind of go back to my default

264
00:10:21,379 --> 00:10:26,879
comment of if it's such an amazing

265
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,639
product why is cannabis the only

266
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,639
industry that uses it and it is sold too

267
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:38,700
I mean so you you would could it be the

268
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,720
price point no oh my God citric acid

269
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,720
because it's cheap it's in like

270
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,539
oh I just mean like uh if you're talking

271
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,980
about a product that's only in cannabis

272
00:10:45,539 --> 00:10:49,620
could it be because it can't be made

273
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,820
affordably enough for ornamentals but

274
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:55,139
it's still effective would you like to

275
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:58,260
the price of ornamental pesticides is

276
00:10:55,139 --> 00:11:02,699
insane these days these newer designer

277
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:05,039
pesticides are so expensive so expensive

278
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,560
um but by keeping the prices super high

279
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:09,838
The Growers don't overuse them

280
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:12,119
if something's cheap people do it over

281
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,300
and over and over and use it again you

282
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,980
crank that price up and then people are

283
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:18,958
very limited and then it makes the

284
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,839
product have a longer shelf life and it

285
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:23,399
doesn't get overused

286
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,440
oh because insects don't develop

287
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,559
resistances quickly

288
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,160
it's like the sultan you're only allowed

289
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:31,159
on the label

290
00:11:32,159 --> 00:11:35,939
label three times an entire crop cycle

291
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:37,859
are you allowed to spray that product

292
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,839
you cannot come in and spray that once a

293
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,000
week you won you can't afford it and

294
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,060
number two the label will not allow it

295
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,679
and that way this product has persisted

296
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:48,679
on the market for years without any

297
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:52,319
resistance issues

298
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:54,599
where products that once they go generic

299
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,778
and people can buy very cheap versions

300
00:11:54,600 --> 00:12:00,240
of them like a metacloprid

301
00:11:57,778 --> 00:12:02,399
um like synthetic pyrethrins because the

302
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,320
price point is so low people just spray

303
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,480
them spray and spray and then we have a

304
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,879
lot of resistance issues so high prices

305
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,759
are a way to keep people from overusing

306
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:13,439
the products on those designer

307
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:16,740
pesticides

308
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,959
also remember like at least 10 million

309
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:22,019
dollars at least to develop that product

310
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:25,379
where if you're making a

311
00:12:22,019 --> 00:12:29,278
citric acid Rosemary's you know

312
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:31,139
sunflower oil you know in your kitchen

313
00:12:29,278 --> 00:12:34,620
you don't have 10 million dollars of

314
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:36,659
development in that it's it's it's you

315
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,000
look if you actually look at the

316
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,159
percentage of active in those what we

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,299
call salad dressing products

318
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,799
um even though salad dressing can be

319
00:12:42,299 --> 00:12:46,859
very tasty

320
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:49,919
um you know and then price it out you

321
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:51,839
you can see the the markup there on on

322
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:53,819
those and it's not because they're

323
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,620
putting that money into r d to develop

324
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:58,079
new products

325
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,899
um it's just I mean is there research

326
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:02,519
though on citric acid and is there what

327
00:13:00,899 --> 00:13:05,700
is the mechanism of action I think

328
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:07,019
around citric it's I I I've not

329
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,060
the search yet

330
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,860
not saying it's not out there

331
00:13:09,059 --> 00:13:13,919
um but I haven't gone down that rabbit

332
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,560
hole because I will tell you we did test

333
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:18,419
one of the popular citric acid products

334
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,859
at one of my ornamental Growers and we

335
00:13:18,419 --> 00:13:21,838
fried our plants and we're like yeah

336
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:23,820
we're done

337
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,860
um it it did too much at the label rate

338
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,079
just labeled rate too much phytotoxes

339
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,740
yeah now the thing is is with cannabis

340
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:33,299
cannabis it's a it's a hearty plant it

341
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,180
can handle stuff

342
00:13:33,299 --> 00:13:39,000
ornamental crops cannot handle it it's

343
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:40,979
pretty resilient it can handle repeated

344
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,799
oil sprays

345
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:46,680
um you know it's it's it's pretty hard

346
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:48,419
to cause phytotoxicity with it

347
00:13:46,679 --> 00:13:50,879
um and I mean it's a it's a pretty

348
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:54,360
forgiving crop compared to

349
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:57,419
orchids poinsettias pansies

350
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,220
um you know lettuce things like that

351
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:01,559
um

352
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:03,060
so overall because remember you know I'm

353
00:14:01,559 --> 00:14:05,518
not just working in cannabis I'm working

354
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:08,039
in multiple cropping systems

355
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,078
um and you know trying to find things

356
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:13,379
that um

357
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:16,439
can be used safely throughout multiple

358
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:18,838
crops you know if if spraying a citric

359
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:20,880
acid product works for you you see

360
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:22,980
efficacy

361
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,259
you know use it you know if something

362
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,820
works for you

363
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:29,399
I just don't have a lot of faith because

364
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:33,079
of the damage I've seen and not as good

365
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:33,078
as efficacy as I would like to see

366
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,720
so you're saying it may kill some but

367
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,639
not all of a Target yeah well it's also

368
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,620
going to be spray coverage just like

369
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,860
anything else it's it's going to depend

370
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:46,198
on the sprayer you use and one of the

371
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:48,600
things I see in cannabis is again

372
00:14:46,198 --> 00:14:50,338
cannabis Farms or production facilities

373
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,139
tend to be smaller

374
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,240
you've got a monoculture you've got a

375
00:14:52,139 --> 00:14:56,759
guy going there in Spring and he can

376
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,500
really almost wash those plants off in

377
00:14:56,759 --> 00:15:00,419
some facilities not not the larger

378
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:03,778
facilities but in a lot of the smaller

379
00:15:00,419 --> 00:15:05,399
mid-size ones where because of the

380
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:07,620
structure the way cannabis is it's easy

381
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,980
to get into the canopy

382
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:13,500
um to get the undersized leaves where

383
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:16,379
you don't necessarily get that in other

384
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:19,139
crops and you don't have the time to put

385
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:21,958
into spring like you do

386
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:24,419
um and I do think a lot of efficacy we

387
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:27,899
see in cannabis is the washing action of

388
00:15:24,419 --> 00:15:29,639
just the water carrier just blasting the

389
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:32,100
the pests off the plant in certain

390
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:35,159
situations

391
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:37,320
there there was a semi

392
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,219
I don't want to say famous

393
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,079
um

394
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:41,699
study done and they looked at

395
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:44,458
traditional pesticides microbial

396
00:15:41,698 --> 00:15:47,278
pesticides and water sprays on I think

397
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:49,500
it was 12 plants so very small amount of

398
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:51,958
plants easy to get good spray coverage

399
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,240
again water bio pesticides and

400
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:58,198
conventional pesticides same efficacy

401
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,899
for controlling Western Flower thrips

402
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:02,879
because of the washing action of the

403
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:05,639
water I kind of got into it with a

404
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:08,159
researcher a touch on it because you

405
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,600
know go spray five acres and see if you

406
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,879
get the same results and you won't

407
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,278
because you can't get that kind of spray

408
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:18,059
coverage on large acreage if you have a

409
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:20,820
few plants you absolutely can and you

410
00:16:18,059 --> 00:16:23,698
just can't on large acreage and so

411
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,680
that's why you get different results and

412
00:16:23,698 --> 00:16:28,819
it's all based on spraying and spraying

413
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,819
technique and sprayers

414
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:35,459
foreign makes sense yeah no that's great

415
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,339
um and a couple of spraying companies

416
00:16:35,458 --> 00:16:40,018
that we like uh dram who's been on the

417
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:43,139
show makes excellent sprayers they're

418
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:43,919
Water breaker watering wand is awesome

419
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:47,339
um

420
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:49,679
uh and actually uh Kurt Becker I had

421
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,720
asked him in a in a webinar with you

422
00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:54,958
what other options are there you know

423
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:56,278
for because dram sprayers are expensive

424
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:58,078
um he mentioned birchmeyer is another

425
00:16:56,278 --> 00:17:00,120
company that he liked that made a good

426
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:02,159
good sprayer too so throwing that out

427
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:04,078
there for people but a good sprayer is

428
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:06,720
expensive but it's well worth it it will

429
00:17:04,078 --> 00:17:08,938
pay for itself coverage it will pay for

430
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,798
itself because I've had Growers saying

431
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:12,480
that products stuff oil is the perfect

432
00:17:10,798 --> 00:17:13,679
one stuff oil doesn't work stuff well

433
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,360
doesn't work well what do you spring

434
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:17,459
with and either they're using a paint

435
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,899
sprayer or they're using an herbicide

436
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:21,179
sprayer it's something they just bought

437
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,579
down at Home Depot or Lowe's that is

438
00:17:21,179 --> 00:17:25,500
designed for lower pressure and larger

439
00:17:23,578 --> 00:17:26,759
particle size with so you don't get

440
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,318
dripped because that's what you want

441
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:31,379
with herbicides and that's what most

442
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:33,058
homeowners want but I've had those girls

443
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:36,240
that say stuff well doesn't work and

444
00:17:33,058 --> 00:17:38,279
once they move to a dram like backpack

445
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:41,759
sprayer now they're getting the results

446
00:17:38,279 --> 00:17:43,678
the pesticide didn't change it was the

447
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:46,200
sprayer changed in particle size change

448
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,298
and that really can make a difference

449
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,980
and again I'm just going to reset again

450
00:17:48,298 --> 00:17:52,200
because there's this vicious rumor I get

451
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,079
paid by by works and I do not get paid

452
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:57,480
by bioworks I don't have any

453
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:59,819
um Financial affiliation I don't take

454
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:03,240
Kickbacks I have spent my entire career

455
00:17:59,819 --> 00:18:06,980
working I'm good at being poor because I

456
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,980
don't take Kickbacks on products

457
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:11,160
yeah they uh they have a nice lineup of

458
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:11,819
products for sure

459
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,860
um

460
00:18:11,819 --> 00:18:15,418
When you mention the sprayers though it

461
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:17,538
made me think because I did some just

462
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:21,600
you know direct microscopy at my house

463
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:23,460
looking at uh compost teas through

464
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:26,279
sprayer so before it went through a

465
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:28,980
sprayer and after and we found like

466
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:30,359
certain sprayers definitely affected the

467
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,240
microbes all right I took a look at an

468
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:35,399
atomizer years ago and and looked at it

469
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,859
and basically you can see the damage

470
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,740
that sprayers do to microbial products

471
00:18:37,859 --> 00:18:42,178
depending on the sprayer

472
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:45,000
so it's really important when we're

473
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:46,320
spraying microbial products oils all

474
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,819
these things that we have the right

475
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:49,678
equipment

476
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,000
for that spray or we may not be getting

477
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,179
the efficacy that we think we're getting

478
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,819
yep yep Michael brownbridge at Vineland

479
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:58,740
research and innovation has done some of

480
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,599
that work but he's looking at more

481
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,980
commercial size sprayers and looking at

482
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:07,199
thermal Foggers and things like that

483
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,360
one of the ways they tested

484
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,419
um how microbial stuff went through

485
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:16,199
sprayers is you can go on Amazon and you

486
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,240
can buy PDA plates that are sterile and

487
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,740
then you can set your plates out and you

488
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,880
can spray your spray over the top of it

489
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:26,880
and cap it and then in 24 48 Hours your

490
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:29,340
microbes will grow on that plate to know

491
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,039
if they're alive or not so if you did it

492
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:33,899
like Bavaria basiana you know you should

493
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:37,980
start seeing lots of little super super

494
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:41,280
white fuzz balls growing on that plate

495
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:42,660
um you know in in a quickly

496
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:46,019
um you know to know they're there if

497
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:49,080
you're you're doing meteorism

498
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:51,660
um you're gonna see you know like a a

499
00:19:49,079 --> 00:19:52,918
blue green kind of fuzzy growing so this

500
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,980
is why it's important to know your

501
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,200
microbes no no all that stuff but you

502
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,940
you can easily test them with those PDA

503
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:03,779
plates from Amazon

504
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:05,519
so and speaking of Bavaria we talked

505
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,558
recently there's a pretty

506
00:20:05,519 --> 00:20:10,319
popular organic company out there

507
00:20:07,558 --> 00:20:11,579
selling Bavaria and uh you went and

508
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:13,439
actually looked at the rates on it and

509
00:20:11,579 --> 00:20:15,599
found it was so low

510
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,038
there was no way you could get efficacy

511
00:20:15,599 --> 00:20:20,038
with it yet

512
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:22,038
they're selling a ton of it so same sort

513
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:25,919
of regulatory issues around

514
00:20:22,038 --> 00:20:27,240
biostimulants right and EPA bio

515
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,520
pesticides yeah

516
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,660
um well there

517
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:32,639
biopesticides are regulated by the

518
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:34,740
stimulants currently are not really

519
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,960
regulated but the EPA is going to change

520
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,839
that because everybody is cheating

521
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,759
basically they're taking biopesticides

522
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,399
like Bavaria and izeria and then

523
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:47,038
diluting them and then on the side

524
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:49,140
they'll make insecticidal claims but in

525
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:51,960
writing they won't give you any claims

526
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:54,660
and really any information it's really

527
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:57,298
really important to be looking at Spore

528
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,720
counts on that product

529
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:03,480
um to make sure and this is this is a

530
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,360
whole nother presentation

531
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,038
um yeah and you know and I've given a

532
00:21:06,359 --> 00:21:10,379
couple talks on this

533
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:11,819
um around the country about how to look

534
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:14,340
at the sport counts know where you need

535
00:21:11,819 --> 00:21:15,899
to be where they've shown what Spore

536
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:18,418
numbers you need to be at for killing

537
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:20,700
certain pests and blah blah blah blah

538
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:22,020
um so just you know do do your

539
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,419
comparison

540
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:26,599
um between EPA registered microbials and

541
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,220
non-epa registered

542
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:31,798
microbials on like Bavaria and look at

543
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,038
the numbers and that's telling right

544
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:34,038
there

545
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,840
yeah and I've seen this too on the heavy

546
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,980
metal side with soil companies um some

547
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:43,199
of these companies claim to be really

548
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:44,460
transparent but then when and the tests

549
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,558
that they're publishing

550
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,720
in that they're doing in-house look

551
00:21:46,558 --> 00:21:50,279
quite good but then I'll have a grower

552
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,919
fail for heavy metals and we test the

553
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,240
product independently and it comes back

554
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:56,100
totally different than that one test

555
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,038
that they showed on you know on

556
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,719
Instagram so you really have to do your

557
00:21:59,038 --> 00:22:03,179
due diligence

558
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,860
around this because companies that are

559
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,240
not registering products are not being

560
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:08,459
regulated and if they're not being

561
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,079
regulated you're just trusting that that

562
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:13,019
company is doing what they're saying

563
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,579
they're doing and you know that on as a

564
00:22:13,019 --> 00:22:16,079
grower that's that's sort of on you at a

565
00:22:14,579 --> 00:22:19,980
certain point did I tell you about the

566
00:22:16,079 --> 00:22:21,720
recent herbicide Scandal I heard about

567
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,860
no so when I was thinking about that

568
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:25,558
California

569
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:27,538
two weeks ago I think it was

570
00:22:25,558 --> 00:22:31,440
um I was talking to some of the

571
00:22:27,538 --> 00:22:34,558
Department of AG people and apparently a

572
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,080
company out of Florida was selling an

573
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,359
organic herbicide

574
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:41,339
of course it's Florida but they sold it

575
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:45,959
to a lot of California Growers and it

576
00:22:41,339 --> 00:22:48,178
was working so amazing and so amazing

577
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,679
that it kind of caught the attention of

578
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:52,500
some of the regulatory people so they

579
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:54,600
got some product and sampled it I think

580
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:56,640
they said it was you remember 20 or 40

581
00:22:54,599 --> 00:23:00,899
percent glyphosate

582
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:03,980
in it oh geez and so and this was an

583
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,980
organic herbicide

584
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:08,579
oh

585
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:10,319
that's so scary yep um I hate that yeah

586
00:23:08,579 --> 00:23:12,899
and now you've got these Organic Farms

587
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:15,418
that have sprayed Roundup not knowing it

588
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,820
was and this goes back to

589
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:19,500
you better check your products you know

590
00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:22,859
it would be great if you could trust

591
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:25,440
people but not everybody but a lot of

592
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:27,240
people suck and they're not looking out

593
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,779
for your best interest and here you had

594
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:32,880
a a small organic company and it is

595
00:23:30,779 --> 00:23:34,619
really screwed a lot a lot of organic

596
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,440
farmers I don't know what the resolution

597
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:38,759
is going to be to this because

598
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,798
you know

599
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:41,819
the farmer is unknowingly sprayed

600
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,279
Roundup

601
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:45,960
so according to

602
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:47,579
you know the regulatory stuff they have

603
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,200
to lose their certification but they

604
00:23:47,579 --> 00:23:51,000
didn't do it on purpose but at the end

605
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,940
of the day was Roundup sprayed on that

606
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,298
soil yes and so it has to lose its

607
00:23:53,940 --> 00:24:00,840
certification even though it's not their

608
00:23:57,298 --> 00:24:02,460
fault you know but is it three years or

609
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,959
you have to be completely clear yeah

610
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,700
three years yeah so they would they

611
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,980
would send them back three years well

612
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:09,058
the other thing too if you if you and

613
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,380
this doesn't necessarily apply to

614
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:13,019
cannabis because you aren't organically

615
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:15,480
certified but if you

616
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:17,099
um are going to apply anything because

617
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:21,538
we have people reach out to us regarding

618
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:23,279
like compost tea or humic acids and

619
00:24:21,538 --> 00:24:25,019
things like that that maybe don't have

620
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:27,480
an Organic certification

621
00:24:25,019 --> 00:24:29,519
I always say like don't don't use that

622
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,079
product put me in touch with the

623
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:33,658
certifier get that product approved

624
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:35,579
before you ever buy it or apply it to

625
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:36,960
your to your property because of what

626
00:24:35,579 --> 00:24:38,699
you're talking about right now it's it's

627
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,319
a big concern yes you want that

628
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,019
certifier to sign off on it and and

629
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:44,700
that's usually not an issue but

630
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:46,619
you you want to make sure that

631
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,720
everything's kosher before you uh and

632
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:51,000
and I will say you know Omri is one of

633
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,860
the bigger third-party certifiers and a

634
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,380
lot of people you know

635
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:57,658
say it's you know a bunch of crap that

636
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,700
that you just pay them off I will tell

637
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:02,039
you because my husband's product is Omri

638
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:05,640
listed but granted they are a huge pain

639
00:25:02,038 --> 00:25:07,440
in the ass but they regularly test his

640
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:10,259
product they need samples of his product

641
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:13,919
they test it for heavy metals they test

642
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:15,599
it for all the stuff and you know I'm

643
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,059
actually surprised how often they want

644
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,980
to test biodegradable pods but they do

645
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:23,158
it and Williams got to pay for all of

646
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,819
this but they're doing their job

647
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:26,400
um

648
00:25:23,819 --> 00:25:29,599
so they do follow through the testing

649
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,600
they didn't know about that oh

650
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:39,658
why did they do this to William all the

651
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:42,240
time but they're just you know being

652
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:44,820
they're right it's good yeah we need

653
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,960
that regulation it's a big issue like a

654
00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:47,879
lot of the

655
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,200
companies I see selling fertilizer

656
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,679
haven't registered their products

657
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,659
because I go and look at wsda cdfa and

658
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:56,038
or Omri and

659
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:57,900
you know they're just skating under the

660
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:59,339
radar and

661
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,538
so they don't have that kind of

662
00:25:59,339 --> 00:26:03,240
regulatory

663
00:26:00,538 --> 00:26:04,980
oversight but anyway we've been talking

664
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,599
for a long time here I need to let you

665
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,640
go we didn't even we did say we wanted

666
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:10,740
to talk about we didn't even finish

667
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,380
going through my notes from the lecture

668
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,538
because you had so many questions

669
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,860
oh I'm sorry okay well do you want to

670
00:26:15,538 --> 00:26:18,538
hit a few more let me just hit a few

671
00:26:16,859 --> 00:26:21,000
highlights

672
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:23,158
um okay so it's okay uh it's all right I

673
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,259
mean you know us we can talk for days

674
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:28,320
about this stuff

675
00:26:25,259 --> 00:26:30,240
um so impress it might research at

676
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:34,259
Colorado State

677
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:37,798
um they basically found and no no big

678
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:40,798
surprise here uh stuff oil X

679
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:42,240
did very well in their trials uh so did

680
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,599
tetrachurb

681
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,940
which that's that rosemary oil which um

682
00:26:45,599 --> 00:26:49,558
that was kind of nice to see

683
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,120
um so again for him for us at night they

684
00:26:49,558 --> 00:26:53,759
got good results there I would like to

685
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:55,619
see that replicated a couple more times

686
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:58,019
on that

687
00:26:55,619 --> 00:27:00,418
um and they also found that sulfur did

688
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:03,778
well and we all know that

689
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,720
um sulfur uh does kill hempressive mind

690
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:07,980
there's no question about that but I was

691
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,440
actually doing some reading the other

692
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,980
day

693
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,558
that

694
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:16,259
um there seems to be like this Boomerang

695
00:27:13,558 --> 00:27:19,319
effect that they see in outdoor sulfur

696
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:21,538
use where it actually can create more

697
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:23,339
spider-mite issues after sulfur

698
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:25,379
applications which is kind of

699
00:27:23,339 --> 00:27:28,678
interesting that's a whole nother uh

700
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:30,778
rabbit hole that you can go down the

701
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:32,340
other really interesting thing

702
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:34,440
um there's before you move on from

703
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:36,778
sulfur yeah can you just give your quick

704
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,058
30 second PPE

705
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:40,980
talk around sulfur for Growers who may

706
00:27:39,058 --> 00:27:42,899
not have heard it and are using sulfur

707
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,740
or thinking about using sulfur Okay so

708
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:49,259
so there is no doubt sulfur kills and

709
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:50,700
works well on powdery mildew and it

710
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,400
kills and works well in him press it

711
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:57,120
might I'm not debating that ever I just

712
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:59,940
with sulfur if you use the indoor

713
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:02,399
labeled Greenhouse product currently

714
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:04,880
what is on the market has a 24-hour

715
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,200
re-entry time so after you've applied it

716
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:12,059
you're not supposed to go back in there

717
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,819
for 24 hours for for human safety

718
00:28:12,058 --> 00:28:16,259
um I realize that that that's a lot of

719
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:19,319
time

720
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:20,640
um for a facility but that's the label

721
00:28:19,319 --> 00:28:22,079
is the law and that's what's on the

722
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:25,020
label

723
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:27,720
um it also can mess up uh some of your

724
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:28,980
beneficial insects where sulfur is not a

725
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:30,839
good insecticide it can be a good

726
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,558
miticide but not necessarily a good

727
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:36,839
insecticide there where Oil Products

728
00:28:34,558 --> 00:28:40,259
generally will either have a zero or a

729
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:42,839
four hour REI they can kill beneficials

730
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:45,240
on contact but basically active you know

731
00:28:42,839 --> 00:28:47,220
stuff oil X or products like that once

732
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:50,099
they're dry you can re-release your

733
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:52,558
beneficials and you're right back into

734
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:54,000
it also

735
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:55,918
you have to be very careful about the

736
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,440
timing of software applications I

737
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:00,659
recently had a grower who they used it

738
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,700
in vegetative but use it I think too

739
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,559
many times and because of the

740
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,538
persistence in the environment endure

741
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:08,399
their flower ended up tasting like

742
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:12,359
sulfur even though they never applied it

743
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:15,120
actually in flour so you do have to be

744
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:17,579
and you're talking about spraying sulfur

745
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:18,839
right now yeah okay because I think

746
00:29:17,579 --> 00:29:21,839
there's still people out there burning

747
00:29:18,839 --> 00:29:25,798
salt which is illegal there is no in the

748
00:29:21,839 --> 00:29:28,500
United States there is no legal product

749
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:30,538
for vaporizing or burning sulfur it is

750
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,579
absolutely illegal in the U.S there's

751
00:29:30,538 --> 00:29:34,579
one product left registered in Canada

752
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:40,859
and I assume that's for safety reasons

753
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,259
health concerns I assume so too but

754
00:29:40,859 --> 00:29:45,538
nobody wants to register a vaporizing

755
00:29:43,259 --> 00:29:46,798
sulfur product anymore in the U.S it is

756
00:29:45,538 --> 00:29:49,259
not that it is

757
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,879
there's no law saying it's illegal there

758
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:52,980
are no registered products all the

759
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,960
registered products they the companies

760
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:56,700
doing them drop their labels they

761
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,860
weren't staying uh they weren't going to

762
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:01,259
keep doing that that

763
00:29:58,859 --> 00:30:04,439
also I've heard enough stories from like

764
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:08,480
the 60s and 70s of greenhouses burning

765
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,480
down because of sulfur pots

766
00:30:08,579 --> 00:30:12,778
oh I did it back in the day yeah you

767
00:30:11,038 --> 00:30:14,278
know and looking back I you know I think

768
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:15,599
I just held my breath and went in and

769
00:30:14,278 --> 00:30:18,659
unplugged it and then closed the door

770
00:30:15,599 --> 00:30:20,278
again but looking back now I would wear

771
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:22,679
a respiratory I wouldn't do it now but

772
00:30:20,278 --> 00:30:24,898
if I did I would wear a respirator and

773
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:26,640
be a lot more careful with my health now

774
00:30:24,898 --> 00:30:28,918
that I'm older

775
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,419
um so word of caution to folks around

776
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,520
sulfur

777
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,960
um okay sorry no that's fine I keep

778
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:36,240
interrupting no no that's fine I mean

779
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:38,340
and also once you sulfur you can't go

780
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,220
back to an oil for a period of time

781
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:43,619
again depending on indoor outdoor rained

782
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:46,620
there's so many variables in there

783
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:49,918
um so I'm not again not debating whether

784
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:53,398
sulfur kills mites yes we know it does I

785
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:55,799
just think there's so many other issues

786
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:58,500
around using it that I think in the long

787
00:30:55,798 --> 00:31:00,599
run most facilities are better off with

788
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,058
an oil product for mites

789
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:06,599
and the research is showing that these

790
00:31:03,058 --> 00:31:09,898
oils can work just as well as sulfur

791
00:31:06,599 --> 00:31:11,339
and also killed mildews and

792
00:31:09,898 --> 00:31:13,199
Powder Mill do things like that too yeah

793
00:31:11,339 --> 00:31:15,418
well sulfur does powdery mildew but so

794
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:17,700
does stuff oil X PM's on the label

795
00:31:15,419 --> 00:31:20,220
that's what I'm saying yeah yeah and so

796
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,460
does water too yeah but

797
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:25,500
yeah all right okay so

798
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:28,019
um again shout out to

799
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:30,179
um Olivia Carter she's a student at

800
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:31,980
Colorado State and I'm very interested

801
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,500
in following

802
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:37,380
um her career I really enjoyed talking

803
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:42,319
with her she has actually

804
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,760
been looking at how hemp russet mites

805
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:49,500
reproduce differently on different

806
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:52,558
cultivars of hemp and we all know I mean

807
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:54,898
obviously everybody knows that cultivars

808
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:57,599
of cannabis and hemp are very different

809
00:31:54,898 --> 00:32:01,199
even though it's a scene in Gina's

810
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:03,359
specific epithet um on there but she's

811
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,419
actually looking at how hemp russet

812
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:11,000
might and she looked at one was called

813
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:16,200
unicorn and Elite was the other and

814
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:20,398
so on Elite in a week impressive mites

815
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:23,480
could lay 20 eggs but unicorn only laid

816
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:25,798
four eggs so there was a huge difference

817
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:26,778
in the

818
00:32:25,798 --> 00:32:29,519
um

819
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:31,140
reproductive capabilities depending on

820
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,700
which cultivar was and obviously these

821
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,559
plants are grown under the same

822
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:39,000
conditions in a research control

823
00:32:34,558 --> 00:32:42,178
environment there they also found

824
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:45,179
um that it took a lot longer for

825
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:47,759
hemporacic mites to mature on unicorns

826
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:51,000
and actually did not live as long on on

827
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:52,319
unicorn as it did Elite so if you're an

828
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,659
impressive bite you're going to want to

829
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:57,778
live on Elite because you can have more

830
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,399
babies your life cycles faster you live

831
00:32:57,778 --> 00:33:02,278
longer or first there's something

832
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:04,918
different about this unicorn uh cultivar

833
00:33:02,278 --> 00:33:07,440
of hemp that they don't perform as well

834
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:09,419
on and I mean we see this where you go

835
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,820
I've been in facilities and you have

836
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,200
this table of cannabis and it's crusty

837
00:33:11,819 --> 00:33:15,418
with him for us at my and the call for

838
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,740
right next to it doesn't have them on it

839
00:33:15,419 --> 00:33:22,679
and yes they're in different

840
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:24,899
um different containers so in theory yes

841
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,340
you could have something different but

842
00:33:24,898 --> 00:33:28,739
generally the plants are treated the

843
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:32,699
same in a facility but there is

844
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:34,259
something to cultivars that these mites

845
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,380
and it's like so when someone says to me

846
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:40,798
well you know how fast does hemp present

847
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:42,600
might reproduce on cannabis it depends

848
00:33:40,798 --> 00:33:44,819
it depends on the cultivar of the plant

849
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,639
it depends on nutrition there's so many

850
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:51,259
variables in there there's not one you

851
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,259
know specific quick answer there

852
00:33:51,298 --> 00:33:57,960
so that was that makes sense nice to see

853
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:59,819
that actually being done and she's

854
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,319
actually there's a whole bunch of work

855
00:33:59,819 --> 00:34:03,359
she's going to be working on where

856
00:34:01,319 --> 00:34:05,879
they're actually looking at the Genome

857
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,039
of hemporacic mites so they'll be able

858
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,800
to you know take a plant sample and test

859
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:13,378
it to see if they detect the Genome of

860
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:15,179
hamper acid Mite in the sample I don't

861
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:18,719
know if that's ever going to become an

862
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:20,519
affordable test method for Growers but

863
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,019
um they they are working out that

864
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:24,358
process so there's some real interesting

865
00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:26,280
stuff coming down the lines

866
00:34:24,358 --> 00:34:28,199
um I mean there was so much stuff at

867
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,119
this meeting it's the best meeting I

868
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:32,519
have been to in a couple years I learned

869
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:34,200
so much from these researchers and it's

870
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:36,000
really great because now it's my job to

871
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:37,980
take what I've learned there and take it

872
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,980
to the Growers but also give credit to

873
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:44,039
these researchers because they deserve a

874
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:46,559
lot of praise for the hours of sitting

875
00:34:44,039 --> 00:34:48,838
and Counting hemp russet mites on a

876
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:50,759
plant I mean who wants that job counting

877
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:52,519
how many eggs the ham press I mean that

878
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,800
takes dedicated education

879
00:34:52,519 --> 00:34:57,179
and you know these can you can you say

880
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,760
the name of the show again for folks

881
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:02,940
well it's not a show

882
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:05,099
and it's Invitational

883
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:06,420
only oh that's right you had told me

884
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:09,420
that because I had said I wanted to go

885
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,838
the next year okay now all right no

886
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,838
they're they're

887
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,400
cheers to network

888
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,200
um and and again discuss their research

889
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,940
um and also there's been some funding

890
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:26,399
where we're actually going to be making

891
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,220
some educational videos

892
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,260
um I'm on the the team that's working on

893
00:35:29,219 --> 00:35:34,559
um like hemp pests

894
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:38,700
um of stuff but this is a um this is a

895
00:35:34,559 --> 00:35:40,500
funded project through a grant uh for

896
00:35:38,699 --> 00:35:42,358
researchers and and

897
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,699
um they invited me which I felt very

898
00:35:42,358 --> 00:35:46,699
honored to be invited to be part of this

899
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:50,940
cool was there so was there other

900
00:35:48,659 --> 00:35:52,078
research at the show highlights that you

901
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:54,139
wanted to touch on here yeah those were

902
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,140
the

903
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:02,099
of course yeah I know but those were a

904
00:35:59,519 --> 00:36:02,940
few things that I thought

905
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,160
um

906
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:11,099
were your your people would find your

907
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:12,299
people your listeners uh would find very

908
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:13,260
interesting

909
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,000
um and trying to get that information

910
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:16,680
out

911
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,219
um and then

912
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:19,219
um so yeah

913
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,940
yeah no that was a lot um

914
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:29,940
so just to recap the main things were uh

915
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:32,639
hop latent viroid is

916
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,659
uh being found in positive and Roots

917
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:38,400
When leaves are testing uh negative so

918
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:40,259
we actually should be looking at Roots

919
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:43,139
which has a whole bunch of implications

920
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:44,579
in media and other

921
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,299
other things

922
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,660
um

923
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:52,079
you're seeing a variety of viruses in

924
00:36:48,659 --> 00:36:54,420
hemp and cannabis Beyond you know ones

925
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,680
that we've necessarily heard of even and

926
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,820
they seem to be spreading and then uh

927
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:00,899
let's see what else did we talk about

928
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:03,000
here

929
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,500
uh the research you just mentioned

930
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,079
around

931
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:10,380
um from was it Olivia

932
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,480
oh which one for the Olivia Carter she's

933
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,400
doing

934
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,260
genome on the hempress at night and

935
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,260
actually looking at their life cycle

936
00:37:18,838 --> 00:37:23,759
and that certain cultivars are more

937
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,720
susceptible to a particular pests than

938
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,300
others

939
00:37:24,719 --> 00:37:28,559
which we see in facilities all the time

940
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,359
so that makes a lot of sense that's good

941
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:31,199
to see that played out

942
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:33,179
um

943
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,939
was there any other at least research

944
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:38,519
related stuff that I missed in sort of I

945
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:42,440
think those are the high lights I

946
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,440
brought to you again I took a

947
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:46,980
notebook

948
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:49,980
full of especially the disease stuff but

949
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:51,900
again I you know

950
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:55,019
not so much uh

951
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:57,599
disease person again the the main

952
00:37:55,019 --> 00:38:00,000
disease people you know again

953
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,838
um zamir up at Simon Frazier and then

954
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,239
Jana Beckerman at Purdue those are two

955
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:12,179
of the people like leading the charge

956
00:38:06,239 --> 00:38:14,879
and for following people and you know he

957
00:38:12,179 --> 00:38:16,500
don't just you can't just email these

958
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:18,180
people with you know I've got one plant

959
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:21,000
what's wrong with you know these guys

960
00:38:18,179 --> 00:38:22,858
are researchers that are super busy

961
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:26,159
um working on stuff but it's definitely

962
00:38:22,858 --> 00:38:28,920
worth keeping an eye on them and read

963
00:38:26,159 --> 00:38:31,440
what they're publishing and if you get a

964
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:33,480
chance to hear them speak

965
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:35,820
um it's definitely

966
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:37,920
um worth worth doing

967
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:41,280
um I'm actually yeah you can follow

968
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,220
people on Google Scholar and um you'll

969
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,160
receive alerts or emails every time

970
00:38:44,219 --> 00:38:48,598
someone cites one of their research

971
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,699
um papers or when they come out with a

972
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:52,740
new paper that's something I do with a

973
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:54,598
few researchers that I really like yeah

974
00:38:52,739 --> 00:38:56,959
well I'm hoping I'm I'm going to be

975
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:56,960
speaking

976
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:01,079
in February maybe January I don't know

977
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:03,358
January February I'm going to be

978
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:05,400
speaking up in British Columbia and I've

979
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:08,400
got to email zamir because I'm hoping he

980
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,139
and I can catch up on some stuff

981
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:13,380
together because

982
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:15,118
um uh he's just he's a great guy he's

983
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:17,400
he's a lot of fun

984
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,800
um and I I appreciate all the work he's

985
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:23,400
doing and making the research very

986
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:25,920
usable applied work for cannabis Growers

987
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,200
again I feel bad for the U.S researchers

988
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:30,599
because their hands are tied uh for

989
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:32,338
working in cannabis and have these such

990
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:33,838
narrow parameters they have to work in

991
00:39:32,338 --> 00:39:36,119
but again that doesn't mean they're not

992
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:38,578
producing good research and

993
00:39:36,119 --> 00:39:40,680
again with this research you know it

994
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:43,619
takes years to get the stuff published

995
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:45,899
so the research is coming

996
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:49,980
um it's just going to take a bit longer

997
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:53,460
to get a lot of this out out there so

998
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:55,980
sure sure and then uh lastly before we

999
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:58,858
sign off I want to

1000
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,480
um give a shout out to catchmaster and

1001
00:39:58,858 --> 00:40:02,940
talk a little bit about your poster uh

1002
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,139
it's for those of you that can get to

1003
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:06,480
see the video here I think we'll

1004
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:09,239
probably put it up on YouTube

1005
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,740
you can actually see the poster that

1006
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:13,259
Suzanne frame in the background it's on

1007
00:40:10,739 --> 00:40:14,879
both of our Instagram Pages we've taken

1008
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,099
pictures of it just kind of highlighting

1009
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,160
it but um hopefully those will be made

1010
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,079
available here soon I haven't I have an

1011
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:23,819
email into catchmaster to find out how

1012
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:26,160
they're going to distribute this poster

1013
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,760
out to Growers but they make

1014
00:40:26,159 --> 00:40:28,920
um

1015
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:30,780
monitoring cards sticky yellow sticky

1016
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:33,740
cards they make blue cards they make a

1017
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:38,519
variety of products for Pest Control

1018
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:41,039
ranging from insects rodents live animal

1019
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:44,460
traps a whole bunch of things

1020
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:45,838
um and uh they they make good they make

1021
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,400
good sticky cards you want to talk a

1022
00:40:45,838 --> 00:40:49,920
little bit about that or a little about

1023
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:52,579
the poster well the idea of the poster

1024
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,079
was to help

1025
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:57,000
identify what things that are stuck on

1026
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:59,700
sticky cards look like

1027
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,338
um I spend a lot of time

1028
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:04,259
um looking at Sticky cards and sometimes

1029
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:06,719
because insects fall in weird positions

1030
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,320
it can be it can be hard to identify

1031
00:41:06,719 --> 00:41:12,299
them and so on this poster we tried I

1032
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:14,820
tried to break it down to good things

1033
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:16,500
bad things and in different things which

1034
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:19,800
is kind of hard to do because I do have

1035
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,179
mites is bad because typically mites are

1036
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,839
generally

1037
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:24,598
um

1038
00:41:21,838 --> 00:41:25,199
generally bad but

1039
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:26,820
um

1040
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:29,239
sometimes you know there can be

1041
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:33,000
beneficial mites but typically we don't

1042
00:41:29,239 --> 00:41:34,799
find beneficial mites on sticky cards

1043
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,358
not to say you can't but generally we

1044
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,160
don't

1045
00:41:36,358 --> 00:41:39,358
um so

1046
00:41:38,159 --> 00:41:41,879
um that's where they have different

1047
00:41:39,358 --> 00:41:44,880
color rings for The Greener good red is

1048
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,800
bad and then blue like with uh kalimbola

1049
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,420
springtails you know they're kind of

1050
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,740
indifferent

1051
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:51,240
um and it's not something you have to

1052
00:41:49,739 --> 00:41:54,479
worry about but they're not what I'd

1053
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:56,578
consider beneficial as in beneficial in

1054
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,858
the the meat eating capacity on your

1055
00:41:56,579 --> 00:42:00,480
plant and so it's just a quick guide

1056
00:41:58,858 --> 00:42:02,039
um to some of the basic things you find

1057
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,280
out there

1058
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:06,838
um and yeah that's yeah it's a really

1059
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,380
cool poster

1060
00:42:06,838 --> 00:42:09,059
um

1061
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:10,619
I'm looking forward to getting one I'm

1062
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,759
hoping I can get them in and then I

1063
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,619
think I talked to catchmaster about

1064
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,359
sending them out to Growers

1065
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,619
um we're getting soil through us for

1066
00:42:15,358 --> 00:42:17,519
example as a way to get them out to

1067
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:18,720
people

1068
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:20,460
um but we'll when we have more

1069
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:21,959
information about how people they're

1070
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:24,179
going to be distributed we'll definitely

1071
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:26,039
I'll let listeners know because it is

1072
00:42:24,179 --> 00:42:27,899
really cool to see

1073
00:42:26,039 --> 00:42:30,480
you know the kinds of things that would

1074
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,019
end up on your sticky card in a facility

1075
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,599
um

1076
00:42:31,019 --> 00:42:35,219
actual photos of them versus you know

1077
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,720
having to go online and guess and things

1078
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:38,759
like that and stuff can get mislabeled

1079
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,838
so this one was made by Suzanne so we

1080
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:42,480
know that all the everything's

1081
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,139
identified and photographed correctly

1082
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,820
um

1083
00:42:43,139 --> 00:42:46,980
yeah and it's just a nice resource for

1084
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:49,280
folks one thing I regret not gone there

1085
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,280
was a piece

1086
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:58,380
of PC boss Fighters can look an awful up

1087
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:01,199
like uh thrips on sticky cards and also

1088
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:03,240
perlite can look like white flies

1089
00:43:01,199 --> 00:43:04,858
um I've had that happen a few times

1090
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:06,598
where you just have to get in there and

1091
00:43:04,858 --> 00:43:07,980
look but typically what I do with my

1092
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:09,359
sticky cards from Growers is I bring

1093
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,420
them home with me and then I put them

1094
00:43:09,358 --> 00:43:15,358
under my microscope and just scan across

1095
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:17,760
them so I don't miss anything

1096
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:21,259
um because if you really want to check

1097
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:21,260
them thoroughly for what's going on

1098
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,240
um yeah and so you I assume though with

1099
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,919
a Dyno light or a good Loop you can

1100
00:43:27,239 --> 00:43:30,479
pretty much identify everything you're

1101
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,460
pretty effective you can tell if it's a

1102
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,318
thrips or an aphid but I just had a

1103
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,639
situation where in the greenhouse when I

1104
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,219
quick looked at it I thought it was

1105
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:40,019
soybean thrips but then when I got it

1106
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:42,539
back and looked at it under a scope I'm

1107
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:45,358
like nope that's not a soybean thrips

1108
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:48,059
and I'm pretty sure it's a bean thrips

1109
00:43:45,358 --> 00:43:49,619
um but you can't with a lens out in the

1110
00:43:48,059 --> 00:43:51,838
greenhouse it can be hard to tell them

1111
00:43:49,619 --> 00:43:54,240
apart so that's again why I kind of do

1112
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:56,279
it uh I go over it with higher

1113
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:58,979
magnification

1114
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,319
um under mice how important though is

1115
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:04,199
that to a grower I know that like for

1116
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:06,480
you you want to identify the particular

1117
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:08,039
species but if if we can narrow it down

1118
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,539
to a family

1119
00:44:08,039 --> 00:44:11,699
you know if we can say we know it's

1120
00:44:09,539 --> 00:44:13,318
thrips do we really need can you give me

1121
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:14,759
an example of what a real world example

1122
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,858
of why I would need to know the

1123
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,900
particular species of thrips versus just

1124
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:22,078
knowing that it's a threat well not all

1125
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,480
Thrift species pupate in the soil so if

1126
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,160
it is a non-soil pupating thrips

1127
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,920
nematodes are not going to help you in

1128
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,259
your Pest Management program like echino

1129
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:34,680
thrifts nematodes do not help control a

1130
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:37,260
kind of thrips and also predatory mites

1131
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:39,000
really cannot control in a kind of

1132
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:41,700
thrips population if you have a kind of

1133
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:43,500
thrips you pretty much have to spray for

1134
00:44:41,699 --> 00:44:45,480
them and you know soaps oils microbials

1135
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:48,000
do work but mites and nematodes aren't

1136
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:52,440
where with like onion drips nematodes

1137
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:56,460
work really well and so do the predatory

1138
00:44:52,440 --> 00:45:00,300
mites this thing with soybean thrips

1139
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:02,639
I I find soybean thrips regularly dotted

1140
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:04,079
throughout cannabis facilities but I

1141
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:06,779
still don't really know if they're

1142
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,420
blowing in or if they're reproducing but

1143
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:12,359
they really don't cause damage but this

1144
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:15,119
Bean thrips is a caliotrips species

1145
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:18,598
um that I've seen become devastating to

1146
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,119
outdoor cannabis in California

1147
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:22,318
um it's not really on this part of the

1148
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,660
United States so it's a little

1149
00:45:22,318 --> 00:45:26,639
concerning to find it in a greenhouse

1150
00:45:24,659 --> 00:45:28,980
over here my guess is it came in

1151
00:45:26,639 --> 00:45:31,500
genetics from the West Coast it's now

1152
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,960
inside of a greenhouse the question is

1153
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,239
is it going to become

1154
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:36,780
economically important

1155
00:45:36,239 --> 00:45:40,019
um

1156
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:41,760
in this facility or on the East Coast

1157
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:42,900
where it's in an indoor protected

1158
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,160
environment and that's why it's

1159
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:46,440
important to know because if it's the

1160
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:48,179
soybean thrips ah we're not going to do

1161
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:50,220
anything different the bean thrips man

1162
00:45:48,179 --> 00:45:53,039
we got to watch that close

1163
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:54,959
um so it does make a difference on how

1164
00:45:53,039 --> 00:45:56,579
much damage the different thrip species

1165
00:45:54,960 --> 00:46:01,220
can do to cannabis

1166
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,220
and also how you manage it

1167
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:06,000
okay so it you could in the facility you

1168
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:08,400
could be saving a ton of Labor or

1169
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,139
wasting your money just by not getting a

1170
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,300
proper identification your application

1171
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:14,039
rates may be off you're maybe using the

1172
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,780
wrong product Okay so

1173
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:17,338
you gave a very good example of why we

1174
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:19,560
need to identify the species okay and

1175
00:46:17,338 --> 00:46:21,659
when I go up to BC

1176
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,818
um in January February again I'm going

1177
00:46:21,659 --> 00:46:25,858
to try to get my calendar updated

1178
00:46:23,818 --> 00:46:29,159
um I think I'm going to be doing a like

1179
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:32,400
a thrips taxonomy ID talk there talking

1180
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:35,519
about the main thrips

1181
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,920
um and how you tell them apart for where

1182
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:40,079
Growers can do that

1183
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,639
um not making it over complicated but

1184
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:44,160
making it

1185
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:46,739
making it

1186
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:48,659
understandable enough for Growers

1187
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:50,879
um to be able to to help make decisions

1188
00:46:48,659 --> 00:46:51,539
on management

1189
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,660
um

1190
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:56,039
I know I can be like I don't know I'm

1191
00:46:54,659 --> 00:46:57,899
gonna find a polite word for myself but

1192
00:46:56,039 --> 00:46:59,579
the being the queen of a jerk about

1193
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:02,039
always wanting to know what species it

1194
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:04,859
is and how I think it's so important and

1195
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:08,039
you know for some things Western Flower

1196
00:47:04,858 --> 00:47:10,759
thrips onion thrips on cannabis you know

1197
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:10,759
the the

1198
00:47:11,159 --> 00:47:15,838
does it make a difference in management

1199
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:18,659
on those two not necessarily but it's

1200
00:47:15,838 --> 00:47:20,699
important to be accurate

1201
00:47:18,659 --> 00:47:22,679
um on those things

1202
00:47:20,699 --> 00:47:24,659
um and I think you know even though

1203
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:26,098
Management's the same you know what does

1204
00:47:24,659 --> 00:47:27,659
it matter if you didn't identify it

1205
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:30,059
right well it matters because you need

1206
00:47:27,659 --> 00:47:32,159
to be accurate I mean that's just part

1207
00:47:30,059 --> 00:47:34,380
of my job is to be accurate and not

1208
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:36,960
guess and there's too much guessing and

1209
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:39,059
bad information going around

1210
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,619
um on this stuff I'm sorry I just got a

1211
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:43,199
kitten on my lap

1212
00:47:40,619 --> 00:47:44,400
this is Agatha who is being very

1213
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:48,838
difficult

1214
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:51,420
hi Todd oh very cute I know she's been I

1215
00:47:48,838 --> 00:47:53,460
she jumped that five foot cardboard box

1216
00:47:51,420 --> 00:47:55,680
and got in here

1217
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:57,358
well it's good to see her on the show

1218
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,399
yes

1219
00:47:57,358 --> 00:48:01,500
um well I think that's all my questions

1220
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,240
for today thank you so much for your

1221
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:04,920
time um I know we covered a lot and

1222
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:06,358
jumped around a lot but I thought that

1223
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,039
was really interesting oh yeah that's

1224
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:09,900
and I learned I kind of wish you were in

1225
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:11,099
my pocket at that meeting Tad because

1226
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,680
you would have found it really

1227
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:16,260
interesting but what will pastors Amir

1228
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:18,299
and get him on your show and again he

1229
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,859
can go into much greater depth about his

1230
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:23,280
work you know I there's no way I can

1231
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:26,578
begin to do justice to his work because

1232
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:28,500
I you know I like speaking more about my

1233
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:30,599
experiences and my work and I can go

1234
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,739
more in depth just repeating other

1235
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,000
people's research you know it's it's not

1236
00:48:34,739 --> 00:48:38,759
always the best way to go and I think

1237
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:40,019
it's best to get it direct from the

1238
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,359
source so we'll work on getting some

1239
00:48:40,019 --> 00:48:44,039
mirror and he can talk a lot more

1240
00:48:42,358 --> 00:48:45,420
um on that stuff

1241
00:48:44,039 --> 00:48:47,400
um

1242
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,260
yeah I think we do need to cover viruses

1243
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:50,700
and thyroids and more depth because it

1244
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,099
is becoming more of a more of an issue

1245
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:55,019
in cannabis absolutely yes so I think

1246
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:57,900
that'd be great yes but I appreciate you

1247
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:59,099
having me again Tad I always love doing

1248
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,920
this with you

1249
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:04,440
and uh yeah well you always seem to come

1250
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:06,720
across new information and stuff and

1251
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,920
Pest Management is just such a challenge

1252
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,118
it's one of those things that's always

1253
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,700
evolving

1254
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:15,358
and uh so I think we do need to do

1255
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:17,519
regular shows on you know IPM related

1256
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:20,880
topics so I think that's great I

1257
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:22,380
appreciate it yes so and now it's almost

1258
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:26,099
officially the beginning of my candy

1259
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:28,559
making season so yay

1260
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:31,200
so right on okay well thank you so much

1261
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,578
