caught up with her for this interview

60
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:12,569
now if you are a large-scale commercial

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,068

64
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:22,519

66

67
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,098
a few questions answered or have a small

68
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,169
medical grow and no budget for actual

69
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:32,729
consulting please try and attend one of

70
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:35,128
her upcoming talks rather than emailing

her she is a very generous person with

72
00:02:35,128 --> 00:02:38,548

73
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:40,739
everyone but her consulting schedule is

74
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:42,450
very full and is this is her livelihood

75
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:44,400
I assured her that she would not be

76
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,199
bombarded by emails after the show as

77
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,840
she is incredibly busy person already

78
00:02:46,199 --> 00:02:50,518
she has a ton of information including

79
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,870
her upcoming events articles she's

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,840

81
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:57,000
please do check it out now before we

82
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,709
dive into this week's podcast I wanted

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,930
to give listeners a bit of background I

84
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,669
purposely kept the questions as general

85
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,769
as possible because as you will soon

86
00:03:02,669 --> 00:03:06,840
learn with biological controls it's not

87
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,030
as simple as this bug eats that book

88
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,438
there's a lot of other information you

89
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,359
need to know starting with proper

90
00:03:10,438 --> 00:03:13,948
identification and then looking at the

91
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,260
growing environment to determine what

92
00:03:13,949 --> 00:03:17,669
bio controls would be most effective

93
00:03:15,259 --> 00:03:19,469
it's really important to get an expert

94
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:21,419
with a background in entomology to

95
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:24,000
properly utilize these beneficial and

96
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:24,979
predatory insects now let's get on with

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,150
the show

98
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,530

00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,049
with Suzanne Wainwright evans also known

102
00:03:34,289 --> 00:03:39,598
as the bug lady and Suzanne can you give

103
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:42,840
me a little bit of a background into how

104
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:46,378
you got into into this industry and why

105
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,030
bugs are so fascinating to you well

106
00:03:46,378 --> 00:03:50,310
first thanks for having me it was really

107
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,188
great to meet you in person the other

108
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:55,530
week you're very impressive so I agreed

109
00:03:53,188 --> 00:03:57,900
to do this because I really appreciate

110
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:00,090
you wanting to get good scientific

111
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,430
information out there and getting good

112
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,639
information to growers so they can

113
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:07,919
manage their pest issues but my

114
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:11,189
background I decided in middle school I

115
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:13,169
wanted to be an entomologist and that

116
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:16,319
was basically the path I set myself on

117
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,549
self on and I went to the University of

118
00:04:16,319 --> 00:04:19,139
Florida where I have degrees in

119
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:21,959
entomology and environmental

120
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:24,778
horticulture and while I was in college

121
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:27,780
I worked in the horticulture /

122
00:04:24,778 --> 00:04:30,120
agriculture industry doing many

123
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:33,379
different jobs so I've been in the

124
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:37,709
industry over 25 years and for the last

125
00:04:33,379 --> 00:04:40,560
16 years I've worked for myself as an

126
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:43,500
independent insect consultant where I

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,129
don't sell I do not sell biocontrol

128
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,800
agents I don't sell pesticides my job is

129
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:52,889
basically to help growers put together

130
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:55,668
good pest management programs but a

131
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:59,040
little bit more focused on the

132
00:04:55,668 --> 00:05:01,168
biocontrol options but I do have to

133
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,360
understand pesticides and how they work

134
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,579
and compatibility with biocontrol agents

135
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,100
because sometimes we don't have

136
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:11,099
biocontrol agents for some of our pest

137
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,510
issues so you do work within the

138
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,640
cannabis industry I know you've given

139
00:05:12,509 --> 00:05:17,039
talks at canna con and then I just most

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:20,610
recently heard you at another conference

141
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:22,590
and beyond that though you do a lot of

142
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,900
work outside of the canvas industry with

143
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,549
the ornamental with ornamental crops and

144
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:28,709
things like that can you talk a little

145
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:33,720
bit more about the sorts of work that

146
00:05:28,709 --> 00:05:35,250
you do yeah I work in I would I

147
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,790
generally what I say is I work in

148
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,418
everything but like soybeans and corn

149
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:45,090
and big outdoor AG I have customers that

150
00:05:42,418 --> 00:05:48,060
are aquaponics producers where they're

151
00:05:45,089 --> 00:05:51,119
growing fish and they're growing lettuce

152
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:53,220
I also work with some of the theme parks

153
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:56,220
dealing with insect pests in their

154
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:57,930
landscape where they're open for the

155
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,090
majority of the day and they can't

156
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:02,699
afford or they can't afford the time to

157
00:06:00,089 --> 00:06:04,409
come in and spray or there's the public

158
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,769
perception of seeing people in spray

159
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:11,130
suits I work with large ornamental

160
00:06:07,769 --> 00:06:13,978
growers I one of my growers they produce

161
00:06:11,129 --> 00:06:17,100
four million points study as a year and

162
00:06:13,978 --> 00:06:19,379
do a million hanging baskets so some

163
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,680
large scale operations all the way down

164
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:25,709
to some smaller greenhouses that

165
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,310
specialize maybe in edible flowers or

166
00:06:25,709 --> 00:06:32,159
other specialty crops I like to work

167
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:34,199
with challenging situations and usually

168
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,939
people end up at me when they've tried

169
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:38,728
everything else and are just kind of

170
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:42,168
struggling with controlling pests and so

171
00:06:38,728 --> 00:06:45,860
they hire me to come in and basically

172
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:47,930
figure out what's going on and and come

173
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:51,139
up with a strategy on how to manage

174
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:55,009
pests again with a bit more of a focus

175
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:57,408
on on bio control options great now one

176
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:59,509
thing I want to emphasize is that we

177
00:06:57,408 --> 00:07:01,370
talked a little bit off off air before

178
00:06:59,509 --> 00:07:03,439
this and you'd mentioned you'd only been

179
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,968
home for I think four weeks so far this

180
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:08,569
year you're obviously really busy and

181
00:07:04,968 --> 00:07:11,300
your plate is full with consulting as it

182
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:13,639
stands now if you're listening to this

183
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:17,240
podcast and you are a large-scale

184
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,788
commercial grower or cultivator and you

185
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:21,110
need to bring someone in to help you you

186
00:07:19,788 --> 00:07:22,938
would be able to potentially provide

187
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:25,129
consulting for that but you probably

188
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,860
don't have time for one or two emails

189
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:30,889
from that guy with three plants or five

190
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,658
plants or a small Grove so what kind of

191
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:34,939
resources would you recommend for

192
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:38,348
someone like that starting out who wants

193
00:07:34,939 --> 00:07:41,330
to consider using beneficial insects and

194
00:07:38,348 --> 00:07:43,938
you know wouldn't would necessarily fit

195
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:47,318
into your consulting schedule it's

196
00:07:43,939 --> 00:07:51,979
challenging because even some of the

197
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:54,050
small growers you know small CSAs that

198
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:57,378
are maybe just like an acre or so have

199
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:02,838
the same kind of challenges of how do

200
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:05,509
you get current viable information for

201
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:08,778
their business when most most

202
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:11,088
publications you know they're they're

203
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:12,379
targeting large-scale commercial AG and

204
00:08:11,088 --> 00:08:15,379
that's where a lot of the research is

205
00:08:12,379 --> 00:08:17,870
done and it is a real challenge you know

206
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:19,699
I think sometimes you know having a

207
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:22,250
network of other growers to reach out to

208
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,020
is really important but unfortunately

209
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,300
what I've seen with in the cannabis

210
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,948
industries is there's some bad

211
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,889
information and it just keeps getting

212
00:08:27,949 --> 00:08:34,158
perpetuated and perpetuated with the the

213
00:08:30,889 --> 00:08:36,889
cut and paste ability of the internet

214
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:39,110
and even on some of the Facebook pages

215
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:42,139
where people are posting insects for

216
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:43,879
identification it you have people and I

217
00:08:42,139 --> 00:08:47,328
see this as nice as you can who are just

218
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:50,448
not qualified to being able to identify

219
00:08:47,328 --> 00:08:52,698
insects and I see people when they say

220
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:55,809
they're they're guessing but they say it

221
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:57,639
like it's fact and growers are

222
00:08:55,809 --> 00:09:01,329
getting bad information a

223
00:08:57,639 --> 00:09:04,889
misidentification with being cannabis

224
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,560
you know you don't have the options of

225
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:12,250
reaching out to extension with where

226
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,739
other people can but you can you know if

227
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:17,980
you do have an insect pest you can't put

228
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,930
the insect just in alcohol and as long

229
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,570
as it's not on the plant material you

230
00:09:19,929 --> 00:09:24,069
could get someone to identify it for you

231
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:27,250
through extension just don't mention

232
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:29,200
post plant because once they find out

233
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,490
what the host plant is you know they're

234
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,240
not going to be able to help you because

235
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,980
of all the the money and everybody knows

236
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,940
the issue there I don't have to go over

237
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:43,810
that but there are going to be some more

238
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:47,350
resources coming I'm seeing more of the

239
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:49,809
traditional trade journals and magazines

240
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:52,028
that have focused on ornamental and

241
00:09:49,809 --> 00:09:53,709
vegetable greenhouse production become

242
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:55,870
more involved in the cannabis industry I

243
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:58,360
was actually contacted this week by one

244
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,339
of the trade publications that are

245
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,740
interested in doing they want to talk to

246
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:05,740
me about doing an e publication on pest

247
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:09,789
management for specifically for cannabis

248
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:12,039
because cannabis has its own set of

249
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:15,490
challenges that some of the other

250
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:17,949
industries don't have but you know they

251
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,589
have different challenges that you know

252
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:23,800
the cannabis people don't have but I

253
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:25,690
mean as I've looked around resources are

254
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:28,359
pretty limited there are some books

255
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,020
available but I tell you I've read

256
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:34,450
through some of them and it just there's

257
00:10:32,019 --> 00:10:36,279
just some of the information is good but

258
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:39,640
there's also bad information in there

259
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:42,338
and it's really hard for me once I look

260
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,769
at a resource that I know has bad

261
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:48,760
information how am I to trust anything

262
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:51,220
else that resource says so it's it's

263
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:53,110
it's a real challenge right now for

264
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:53,740
small cannabis growers to get good

265
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:57,639
viable

266
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:59,589
information I think that some of the

267
00:10:57,639 --> 00:11:02,528
educational conferences might provide

268
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:04,690
some of that opportunity but again you

269
00:11:02,528 --> 00:11:07,059
have to look at who's speaking what

270
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:09,070
their background is to qualify them to

271
00:11:07,059 --> 00:11:11,588
be speaking and I've

272
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,420
attended some sessions for people that

273
00:11:11,589 --> 00:11:15,339
are quote unquote cannabis pest

274
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:19,000
management experts and again I've seen

275
00:11:15,339 --> 00:11:20,620
bad information given out there so you

276
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,470
know I wish I had a better answer but

277
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,360
it's a real challenge so it sounds like

278
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:27,970
starting with an Extension Service or

279
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:30,190
university is a good option one thing

280
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,509
you brought up with consultants is is a

281
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,899
good point that anyone can be a

282
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:37,149
consultant if they want to slap that

283
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:40,059
title behind their name and there's no

284
00:11:37,149 --> 00:11:42,370
requirements for that one of the

285
00:11:40,059 --> 00:11:43,958
challenges also with that is that these

286
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,179
consultants while they may may have a

287
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:47,409
good list of customers or clients that

288
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:48,758
they're working with that doesn't

289
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:51,639
necessarily mean that what they're doing

290
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:54,959
is optimal or the most successful option

291
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:58,209
there so I guess that that leads me to

292
00:11:54,958 --> 00:12:00,849
where where do you like people to start

293
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:04,448
so if when you walk into a new facility

294
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:05,800
or a new situation what is the first

295
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,778
thing you're looking at I'm gonna I'm

296
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:09,879
gonna guess identification is that where

297
00:12:07,778 --> 00:12:12,429
you like to always start when it comes

298
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:14,458
to these by problems or yeah we have to

299
00:12:12,429 --> 00:12:17,318
know what you're dealing with and again

300
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:20,518
insect ID is really critical and I see a

301
00:12:17,318 --> 00:12:24,818
lot of guessing and a lot of assumptions

302
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:27,578
and you know some insects are easier to

303
00:12:24,818 --> 00:12:29,769
identify than others but some can be

304
00:12:27,578 --> 00:12:33,099
extremely challenging

305
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:36,909
thrips is a good example and trying to

306
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:40,060
identify immature thrips is is it will

307
00:12:36,909 --> 00:12:42,429
melt your brain it is so hard you really

308
00:12:40,059 --> 00:12:44,198
need to be able to see adults and

309
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:47,019
ideally you do have to slide mount them

310
00:12:44,198 --> 00:12:49,689
you have to spread their wings so when

311
00:12:47,019 --> 00:12:51,339
somebody posts a picture online of an

312
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,189
immature thrips and everybody is like oh

313
00:12:51,339 --> 00:12:56,050
it's this it's that it's this it's that

314
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:58,088
you know I went to college for seven

315
00:12:56,049 --> 00:13:01,059
years for this and I've been doing this

316
00:12:58,089 --> 00:13:03,540
for 25 years and I don't know so I don't

317
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:08,049
know how all these people magically know

318
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:10,208
so and that's what happens is is you

319
00:13:08,049 --> 00:13:12,099
know people have gotten bad

320
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,768
identifications and pest management

321
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:16,769
options have not worked so when I do go

322
00:13:14,769 --> 00:13:19,629
in we spend quite a bit of time on

323
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:22,909
identifying what the problem is I also

324
00:13:19,629 --> 00:13:26,539
want to know what you've been doing

325
00:13:22,909 --> 00:13:28,459
as far as what you've tried and you know

326
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,769
if something should have worked and

327
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:33,730
didn't work you know we spent a fair

328
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:36,980
amount of time on troubleshooting so you

329
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:38,990
had this problem this should have

330
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:41,000
controlled it but it didn't work why

331
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,250
didn't work just saying it didn't work

332
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,840
it's not good enough for me I want to

333
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,529
get in there and find out what went

334
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,139
wrong

335
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:52,220
so that we can correct the problem and

336
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:54,919
either not do that again or correct it

337
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:57,590
so it does work because sometimes it can

338
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,829
be applicator error you know whether it

339
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:01,970
be BIOS or spray products it can be the

340
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,009
rates were wrong

341
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:06,410
you know environmental conditions I mean

342
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:10,569
there is a whole list of things that can

343
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:15,350
go wrong when you're trying to treat for

344
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:18,590
pests pest issues and so figuring out

345
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:22,009
how we got there is is really critical

346
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:22,850
ah when I get into a facility that's a

347
00:14:22,009 --> 00:14:25,509
really good point

348
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,279
one other thing because these are live

349
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:29,929
you know living organisms there's a

350
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:32,509
chance they could be coming in stressed

351
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:35,539
as well or dead one of the things he

352
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,819
talked about was identification of the

353
00:14:35,539 --> 00:14:39,740
quality of the bugs that you're

354
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,210
producing you're you're buying or

355
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,190
purchasing and making sure that they're

356
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:46,580
arriving in a state where they're going

357
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:48,980
to want to eat whatever pest problem

358
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,800
you're dealing with the correct yes in

359
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,690
fact I've taught some workshops with

360
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:55,579
some I will call them co-workers but

361
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,730
they're not they don't work for me but

362
00:14:55,580 --> 00:15:00,379
there are industry people that I trust

363
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:04,370
we've taught a couple times now around

364
00:15:00,379 --> 00:15:07,700
the country how to assess the quality of

365
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:11,299
your bio control agents again being a

366
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:13,759
grower you know and what you have

367
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:15,559
available equipment wise and testing

368
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:17,450
wise you know it is kind of limited but

369
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:20,509
there are some you know quick down and

370
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:23,240
dirty things that growers can do just a

371
00:15:20,509 --> 00:15:25,309
double check that said you know being in

372
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,340
this industry for many many years now

373
00:15:25,309 --> 00:15:31,759
the quality has greatly improved we know

374
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:34,670
so much more now than we even did know

375
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,679
five years ago it's constantly evolving

376
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,990
getting better at shipping

377
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:41,659
better ventilation on packaging but one

378
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:44,269
of the most critical things and anybody

379
00:15:41,659 --> 00:15:46,730
that knows me knows this I think it is

380
00:15:44,269 --> 00:15:49,909
so important for your bio control agents

381
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:53,570
to be shipped to you directly from the

382
00:15:49,909 --> 00:15:55,879
insector ii-if distributors when a sell

383
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:58,430
product that's fine but I don't like

384
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:00,528
when product goes from an insect or e to

385
00:15:58,429 --> 00:16:02,239
a distributor they repackage or they

386
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:05,809
stick their label on it and they reship

387
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:08,509
out because that adds extra shipping

388
00:16:05,809 --> 00:16:10,609
time also it's more time for the

389
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:14,269
temperature to fluctuate within it

390
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:17,120
within you know the shipping process

391
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:19,909
where you want to keep those biocontrol

392
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,919
agents at their consistent temperature

393
00:16:19,909 --> 00:16:25,360
basically and until you're going to warm

394
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:29,778
them up and to be ready to use them so I

395
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:32,360
have seen situations with product that

396
00:16:29,778 --> 00:16:37,370
have been sold through distributors not

397
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,139
drop shipped but through you know

398
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:41,120
distributors where the product has not

399
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:43,100
been so good I've also seen emails

400
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,769
saying hey we've got extra product this

401
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:48,800
week and offering it a discount but you

402
00:16:45,769 --> 00:16:51,139
know when those insects are stressed or

403
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:54,109
dead or been cannibalized it's not going

404
00:16:51,139 --> 00:16:56,299
to do a lot of good you know so I think

405
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:59,899
it's really important to get from a good

406
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:03,109
quality supplier and it can be

407
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:04,609
challenging because from you know being

408
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,380
in grows and stuff you know a lot of

409
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,969
people just like to go online order

410
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:12,920
stuff and pay through it through PayPal

411
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:15,769
but the key and sector ease that sell to

412
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:17,929
the US you just can't go order on their

413
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:20,480
website and pay with PayPal they're more

414
00:17:17,929 --> 00:17:23,000
set up in a traditional purchasing

415
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:25,068
system it's where you need to contact in

416
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,828
Sector E and set up an account with them

417
00:17:25,068 --> 00:17:29,359
which they do take credit cards but you

418
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:31,099
know I think that you're just you're

419
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:33,039
going to get a better quality product

420
00:17:31,099 --> 00:17:36,558
you're going to get better information

421
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,839
now it can be challenging if you are a

422
00:17:36,558 --> 00:17:41,149
hobbyist growers because you typically

423
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:42,740
need much smaller amounts and some of

424
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:45,559
the in secretaries do have minimum

425
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:48,349
orders and that may be a situation where

426
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:50,680
you may have to use a distributor but

427
00:17:48,349 --> 00:17:54,219
you've just got to stay on top

428
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:56,170
making sure that product is is a quality

429
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,339
product before you go out because it

430
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:59,019
gaan there's no point in spending the

431
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:02,169
money and then the time of putting it

432
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:05,589
out if if they're not going to do what

433
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:07,300
they need to do so if you were let's

434
00:18:05,589 --> 00:18:10,569
just say hobby grower Ella that's a good

435
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:13,180
term for that where would you start not

436
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:15,460
knowing as much about you know insects

437
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:17,500
as you do is there a company out there

438
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:19,690
that they could potentially call up and

439
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,579
place a smaller order if they can't go

440
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:24,970
directly to an insect or e and then on

441
00:18:21,579 --> 00:18:26,740
the same note if I was a larger facility

442
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,839
or commercial grower and got a

443
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:31,240
recommendation from you or someone else

444
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:33,099
that's knowledgeable would I want to set

445
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,279
up an account directly with an insect er

446
00:18:33,099 --> 00:18:38,199
e so one thing about the cannabis

447
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:41,410
industry is actually you guys are pretty

448
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,140
tight-knit and you guys visit each

449
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:44,980
other's grows which we can talk about

450
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,920
that later

451
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:51,640
yes but um and and back in the early

452
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:53,920
days like you know 20 years ago when

453
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,600
back then I actually did sell biocontrol

454
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:59,410
agents before we learned I'm a terrible

455
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,419
sale salesperson but what some of my

456
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:03,880
greenhouse people would do down in

457
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,910
Florida is to help save on shipping is

458
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,620
they pull their order all together and

459
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,269
they would come to one facility and then

460
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:12,399
people just drive over pick their stuff

461
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:14,500
up and take it back and so if you guys

462
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,540
do you know you have your friends around

463
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,549
that you know also grow you talk to each

464
00:19:16,539 --> 00:19:22,059
other you know they could you guys could

465
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:23,710
pull your order together and then you'd

466
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:26,230
be able to meet some of these minimum

467
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:30,910
orders from insect erease and be able to

468
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,529
just do it that way is is one option the

469
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:34,450
other thing is and I don't know the

470
00:19:32,529 --> 00:19:36,970
exact minimum orders for all the in

471
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:39,190
sector ease but I do think beneficial in

472
00:19:36,970 --> 00:19:42,009
sector II I don't think their minimum

473
00:19:39,190 --> 00:19:44,650
order is too high but remember you are

474
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:48,250
going to be paying overnight Freight on

475
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:49,840
this on these biocontrol agents and it's

476
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,289
very frustrating to people when they're

477
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:55,079
spending forty dollars on on bugs but

478
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:57,490
then you know fifty dollars on shipping

479
00:19:55,079 --> 00:20:00,399
so you do have to look at the price of

480
00:19:57,490 --> 00:20:02,140
shipping as part of the biocontrol

481
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,640
agents and of course your pricing on

482
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:04,120
shipping is going to depend on where

483
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,340
your

484
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:08,409
and you know how much you're actually

485
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:11,740
getting and things like that but

486
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,450
sometimes whether you buy one bottle or

487
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,870
six bottles your shipping might be the

488
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:18,130
same because you know there's that

489
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:20,259
basically the way they're doing more

490
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:23,710
shipping today it's based on you know

491
00:20:20,259 --> 00:20:26,470
the size of the box and so oftentimes it

492
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:27,819
I'll tell my growers to do to is talk to

493
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:30,220
them and if you know you're ordering two

494
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:31,809
bottles per symbolist you know ask them

495
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:33,970
how much it is to just go ahead and fill

496
00:20:31,809 --> 00:20:35,589
out the rest of that box because putting

497
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,480
out extra is not necessarily going to

498
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:39,879
hurt anything and just spending a little

499
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,400
more money to get things SuperDuper

500
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,230
cleaned up might be worth the time

501
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,690
because you're paying the shipping

502
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:50,410
anyhow on that but the best thing to do

503
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:52,120
is is look at your needs contact and in

504
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:54,790
Sector E and see what their minimum

505
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:56,739
order is for where you are and see if

506
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:59,409
they can do that but if not there are

507
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:02,019
smaller distributors that will break

508
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:04,269
down these larger orders for you but

509
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:06,400
again you do sometimes can run the risk

510
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:08,740
of the product being a day or two older

511
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:11,560
some things can handle it if they've got

512
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:14,529
a food source you know they tend to do

513
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,899
okay things like sachets can handle it

514
00:21:14,529 --> 00:21:18,759
but when you get into some of the

515
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,160
predatory mites that don't have food it

516
00:21:18,759 --> 00:21:22,900
can it can impact the quality of the

517
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,759
product and especially again if you get

518
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,500
that warming and cooling and any

519
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:29,289
condensation in the bottle that can

520
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:31,480
really be an issue now I realize we just

521
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:33,879
kind of dove right in without ever

522
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:35,170
talking about exactly why this is so

523
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,790
important I don't want to spend a lot of

524
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:39,670
time on it because I think a lot of our

525
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:43,240
listeners are pretty savvy but why are

526
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:45,160
we really using bio controls why is why

527
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:47,319
is this industry so important in such a

528
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,090
solution because I know for me when I

529
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:51,609
first found out about people using

530
00:21:49,089 --> 00:21:54,970
beneficial insects I was I was initially

531
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:57,189
pretty skeptical of it and to me I

532
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:59,799
didn't realize how much there was to

533
00:21:57,190 --> 00:22:01,720
know I guess I started out thinking okay

534
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:03,250
you have this bug I'm dealing with two

535
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,140
spotlights well I get this is the

536
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,279
solution and not realizing that there

537
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,820
were all these other factors like

538
00:22:06,279 --> 00:22:12,639
lighting humidity temperature and and so

539
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:15,129
much more that went into choosing the

540
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,070
right beneficial insect to deal with the

541
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:17,480
right past

542
00:22:16,069 --> 00:22:18,439
to make sure it was successful because

543
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,089
I'm sure there's a lot of people out

544
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,000
there buying the wrong insects for the

545
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:24,619
wrong pests and wasting a lot of money

546
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:27,769
so yeah do you want to touch on that

547
00:22:24,619 --> 00:22:29,049
just a little bit so I'm going to talk

548
00:22:27,769 --> 00:22:31,309
about let's talk about overall

549
00:22:29,049 --> 00:22:33,529
agriculture as a whole because I mean

550
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:37,099
cannabis now as part of agriculture the

551
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:40,579
number one driving force behind the use

552
00:22:37,099 --> 00:22:44,599
of biocontrol agents is because people

553
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:48,250
cannot manage their pests with spray

554
00:22:44,599 --> 00:22:52,659
products anymore their resistance to

555
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:57,200
chemical pesticides is a very big factor

556
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:59,390
it's just like how people have taken

557
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:02,660
over taken a taken too many antibiotics

558
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:04,280
and so now a lot of the diseases that

559
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:06,710
humans get are resistant to antibiotics

560
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:08,990
the exact same thing has happened with a

561
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:11,210
lot of these key pests like aphids and

562
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:14,779
thrips and to spot spider mites they've

563
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:16,579
had so much exposure to chemicals there

564
00:23:14,779 --> 00:23:20,000
they're not if a lot of people say oh

565
00:23:16,579 --> 00:23:24,379
they mutate it's not that it's it's

566
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:26,319
they're selecting for insects and mites

567
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,630
that are able basically to metabolize

568
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:32,329
the pesticide and it doesn't kill them

569
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:35,750
or people use what is called a sub

570
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:39,710
lethal dose where they the pests are

571
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,859
exposed to lower doses of a product and

572
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:45,769
it doesn't kill them but it allows them

573
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:47,689
to build up resistance to it and that's

574
00:23:45,769 --> 00:23:49,279
why it's very dangerous

575
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,630
when people are like well I don't really

576
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,309
want to spray chemicals so I'm just

577
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:54,830
going to you know use a real low rate

578
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:59,659
below what's on the label because that

579
00:23:54,829 --> 00:24:02,599
really contributes to having the pest

580
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:05,480
resistant to these chemistry's and what

581
00:24:02,599 --> 00:24:07,849
has happened again you know to spotted

582
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,279
spider mites white flies Western flower

583
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:12,289
thrips a foods I mean you look at -

584
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:15,619
spotted spider mites they're resistant

585
00:24:12,289 --> 00:24:18,920
to 95 different chemistry's now because

586
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:22,549
of exposure to chemical pesticides so

587
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:25,310
this has been overall an agriculture the

588
00:24:22,549 --> 00:24:28,099
driving force is because they can't

589
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:29,940
management manage them I don't get calls

590
00:24:28,099 --> 00:24:33,269
from growers saying well

591
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:36,240
oh I care about the drinking water and I

592
00:24:33,269 --> 00:24:38,579
care about no it's oh my gosh I can't

593
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:42,569
just I can't control these pests we have

594
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:45,168
to do something and so that really is

595
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:48,808
what has gotten the ball rolling now

596
00:24:45,169 --> 00:24:50,820
what has happened to is is there are

597
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:52,648
things called MRLs as our maximum

598
00:24:50,819 --> 00:24:55,200
residue levels and that's what they're

599
00:24:52,648 --> 00:24:57,148
looking at with produce now we're okay

600
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,580
yes this chemical is illegal to spray on

601
00:24:57,148 --> 00:25:03,298
this this vegetable but you can only

602
00:24:59,579 --> 00:25:05,220
have so much of that chemical on it so

603
00:25:03,298 --> 00:25:07,918
you can't just spray that chemical over

604
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:10,288
and over and over again even though it's

605
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,840
legal to be applied there so people are

606
00:25:10,288 --> 00:25:14,849
looking to break up their spray programs

607
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:17,548
by using these biocontrol agents so they

608
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:19,638
don't spray as much now the cannabis

609
00:25:17,548 --> 00:25:22,528
industry can be like well hey you know

610
00:25:19,638 --> 00:25:25,528
we haven't been using these pesticides

611
00:25:22,528 --> 00:25:28,109
and so you know our pest problems

612
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:30,929
shouldn't be resistant first of all come

613
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:33,388
on you guys all know the chemicals you

614
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:35,250
guys have been spraying and it's pretty

615
00:25:33,388 --> 00:25:36,689
poor I hear you laughing cuz you know

616
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,970
what I'm talking about I do

617
00:25:36,690 --> 00:25:39,870
ideally growers would contact me ten

618
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:42,419
years ago

619
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:46,798
you know and hey I'm growing tomatoes

620
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:49,139
I've got spider mites you know it then

621
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,908
there was no concern for human safety

622
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:53,490
and I don't think it was at a malicious

623
00:25:50,909 --> 00:25:57,120
Witness it was out of just ignorance of

624
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:59,609
not understanding you know combustion of

625
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,859
pesticides connage concentrations of

626
00:25:59,609 --> 00:26:03,628
pesticides into oils off of plants and

627
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:07,648
the impacts now there's actually

628
00:26:03,628 --> 00:26:10,500
regulatory rules by the states for which

629
00:26:07,648 --> 00:26:14,158
chemicals you can use and so okay fine

630
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,940
you know we're not using Avid we're not

631
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:19,860
using flora might the problem is is what

632
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,419
is the rest of the agricultural

633
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:27,689
community using uh you know if if the

634
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:31,889
the ornamental guy down the way is doing

635
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:34,649
a rotation of spider my of avid and

636
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:37,048
flora might and hexagon and ovation and

637
00:26:34,648 --> 00:26:39,319
he develops resistance if those two

638
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:41,970
spots spider mites do get into your grow

639
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:43,619
they already have that resistance so

640
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:46,190
even though you may have not if you

641
00:26:43,619 --> 00:26:50,069
those chemicals you have a resistant

642
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:53,190
population and that's how we have had a

643
00:26:50,069 --> 00:26:55,349
major problem controlling this

644
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:57,630
particular white fly species in the

645
00:26:55,349 --> 00:26:59,909
United States believe it or not it the

646
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,070
problem actually originated in Spain and

647
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,600
they overused chemistry's there to the

648
00:27:02,069 --> 00:27:05,700
where the white flies were resistant and

649
00:27:03,599 --> 00:27:08,879
that population of white flies got into

650
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:10,440
the United States and has spread so even

651
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,780
though you may not be spraying the

652
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,940
chemicals the pest pop population you

653
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,399
have may have been exposed to it through

654
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:20,789
multiple generations and so they can be

655
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,740
resistant just to state the obvious here

656
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:25,589
I assume you're getting good results

657
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:27,690
when people are following a proper bio

658
00:27:25,589 --> 00:27:29,579
control program you're able to control

659
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:32,490
or eradicate some of these pest problems

660
00:27:29,579 --> 00:27:35,069
okay first of all destroy the word

661
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:38,009
eradicate from your vocabulary there is

662
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:40,829
no such thing even you know back in the

663
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:43,140
80s and 90s the chemical guys we talk

664
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:45,509
about eradicating pests now when they

665
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,730
talk about pest management they talk

666
00:27:45,509 --> 00:27:50,129
about suppressing it being below an

667
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:51,660
economic threshold because you're not

668
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:55,559
going to be able to eradicate it it's

669
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:57,840
it's growing a plant that's pretty darn

670
00:27:55,558 --> 00:27:59,910
clean and you know you're not seeing

671
00:27:57,839 --> 00:28:02,970
pest issues and you're not seeing damage

672
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:04,130
because eradication is just it just does

673
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:07,620
not happen anymore

674
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:10,830
so if we had to spot mites or thrips or

675
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:13,558
brood a fence whatever pest in in a in

676
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:15,509
an indoor facility let's say so a more

677
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:17,549
controlled environment we should assume

678
00:28:15,509 --> 00:28:19,890
that those will always be there for the

679
00:28:17,549 --> 00:28:22,919
life of the facility or you know for

680
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,870
multiple crops it's very possible you

681
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:26,789
know especially if you know have any

682
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:29,489
kind of hydroponic system setup if

683
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:32,159
you're using any kind of NFT or where

684
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,569
your urban flood benches especially Rudy

685
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,940
fits you're just going to spread them

686
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:40,649
and spread them and spread them all it

687
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:43,350
takes is one being left behind and for

688
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:46,259
the cannabis industry they don't have

689
00:28:43,349 --> 00:28:49,469
some of the I will air quote stronger

690
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:52,019
chemistry's that can really knock back a

691
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:56,160
pest issues they just don't have it as

692
00:28:52,019 --> 00:28:57,299
an option your best thing to do is not

693
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,210
get

694
00:28:57,299 --> 00:29:01,529
the problem but to be honest I think the

695
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,200
cats out of the bag on that

696
00:29:01,529 --> 00:29:06,269
I mean they've just spread all their

697
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,150
problems far and wide between everybody

698
00:29:06,269 --> 00:29:12,329
at this point yeah let's talk about that

699
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,240
a little bit so some of the things that

700
00:29:12,329 --> 00:29:17,519
we're seeing are a lot of problems with

701
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,650
people sharing sharing clones or

702
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:20,190
spreading you know spreading pests back

703
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,200
and forth

704
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:25,080
what sorts of things do you recommend

705
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,660
just basic common-sense things that you

706
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,939
think every grower should be doing when

707
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:33,630
it comes to getting in new genetics or

708
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:38,549
even just basic bio controls around the

709
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:41,660
around the facility well every time you

710
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:45,990
bring new plant material into a facility

711
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:49,230
you it is a gamble and we're still

712
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:52,109
trying to wrap our hands around exactly

713
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:55,860
all the pest problems you potentially

714
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:59,490
could have it seems like you know new

715
00:29:55,859 --> 00:30:01,169
new pests are popping up that you know

716
00:29:59,490 --> 00:30:02,430
it's not that you can't say well we

717
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:03,779
didn't think it'd be on cannabis you

718
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:05,910
just didn't think about it being on

719
00:30:03,779 --> 00:30:08,789
cannabis and it's turning out to be

720
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:12,960
cannabis is a pretty good host for a lot

721
00:30:08,789 --> 00:30:16,170
of a lot of problems and now that we're

722
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:18,180
seeing more industrial hemp being grown

723
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:22,289
outside we're really learning more about

724
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:24,390
which pests attack it which are a lot of

725
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:26,730
your common agricultural pests they're

726
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:28,500
moving right over from you know

727
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:33,630
vegetable and grain production right

728
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:36,569
into cannabis stuff but you know if you

729
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:39,240
cannot bring stuff in which I know is

730
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,740
because you need to get new genetics you

731
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:44,519
know that that's how people are getting

732
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:47,190
problems these hem present mites are not

733
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:49,889
a government conspiracy that the

734
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:51,420
government is breeding and blowing at

735
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:54,900
you're laughing again but I know people

736
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:57,509
believe that it's not part of a weed bio

737
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:59,490
control program it's a different speed

738
00:30:57,509 --> 00:31:03,089
it's it's it's not even might that's

739
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:05,069
close to the hemp Russert might you get

740
00:31:03,089 --> 00:31:08,490
him present might because somebody

741
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:10,428
brought it in on a plant material or

742
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:12,308
their clothing

743
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:16,309
and it's kind of been a little self

744
00:31:12,308 --> 00:31:18,109
itself done so if I were to build my

745
00:31:16,308 --> 00:31:22,069
ideal green house today I would

746
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:24,558
definitely have a quarantine facility

747
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:29,089
where you would hold all new plant

748
00:31:24,558 --> 00:31:32,058
material just to make sure that it's not

749
00:31:29,089 --> 00:31:36,470
coming in with any pests I also think

750
00:31:32,058 --> 00:31:39,829
that dipping cuttings is going to be the

751
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,528
best way to stop new new things from

752
00:31:39,829 --> 00:31:44,148
coming in the ornamental industry is

753
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:48,288
really starting to embrace this

754
00:31:44,148 --> 00:31:50,138
technology of dipping cuttings because

755
00:31:48,288 --> 00:31:51,980
then you get a hundred percent coverage

756
00:31:50,138 --> 00:31:54,229
I'm not going to say you're going to

757
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:56,028
radically single pests on there one

758
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:59,480
hundred percent but you can get pretty

759
00:31:56,028 --> 00:32:01,128
significant knock back it's a practice

760
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,470
that even people that have their own

761
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:05,839
stock mother plants in their facility

762
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:07,669
are when they take those cuttings

763
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:10,428
they're dipping them before they stick

764
00:32:07,669 --> 00:32:13,999
them even even in house stuff just to

765
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:17,419
stop that constant cycle of of these

766
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:20,839
pests so you know having quarantine

767
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:23,090
facility keeping things isolated dipping

768
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:27,589
cuttings and just it's all about

769
00:32:23,089 --> 00:32:27,970
sanitation practices and and you know it

770
00:32:27,589 --> 00:32:31,009
just

771
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:33,710
Cannabis people just need to learn more

772
00:32:31,009 --> 00:32:37,429
about sanitation if you get an

773
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:39,169
opportunity to ever I recommend for

774
00:32:37,429 --> 00:32:42,019
canvas people go to or some of the

775
00:32:39,169 --> 00:32:44,778
ornamental production facilities that

776
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:46,490
are doing things like geraniums like you

777
00:32:44,778 --> 00:32:48,679
can't just go in and touch plants with

778
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:50,450
your bare hands you have sanitation you

779
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:52,278
got to wash your hands you have to you

780
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:53,600
know use alcohol things like that to

781
00:32:52,278 --> 00:32:56,659
make sure you're not spreading any

782
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:59,449
pathogens and granted not all ornamental

783
00:32:56,659 --> 00:33:03,080
facilities have quarantines and do all

784
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:05,600
the right stuff but they have more

785
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:08,288
options to clean their products up and

786
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:12,288
their pests they're dealing with may not

787
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:14,749
completely destroy their crop and the

788
00:33:12,288 --> 00:33:16,970
cannabis crop value is much higher per

789
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:18,919
plant than ornamentals you know it's

790
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,649
it's just you can afford to throw away

791
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:24,320
you know ten pansy plants and it's no

792
00:33:21,648 --> 00:33:28,758
big deal you can't afford to do that

793
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:32,119
in a cannabis facility also a human

794
00:33:28,759 --> 00:33:34,399
transmission I think is really something

795
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:36,439
that needs to be look at because most

796
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,138
people that work at a facility grow at

797
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:42,278
home and it's very easy to transport

798
00:33:39,138 --> 00:33:45,349
those pests back and forth when you go

799
00:33:42,278 --> 00:33:47,690
to a grow facility or you have guests

800
00:33:45,349 --> 00:33:49,339
visiting you know have they been at any

801
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:51,740
other grows that day because if they

802
00:33:49,339 --> 00:33:54,319
were in an infested grow they swipe

803
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,079
their sleeve up against a plant can pick

804
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:58,939
up pests there is potential for them

805
00:33:57,079 --> 00:34:01,548
that it possible they brush up against

806
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:06,100
another plant you know they could spread

807
00:34:01,548 --> 00:34:08,659
it spread insects and mites that way

808
00:34:06,099 --> 00:34:11,000
chance of been happening I don't think

809
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:13,039
anybody's looked at the you know the

810
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:17,148
exact risk of that but it could

811
00:34:13,039 --> 00:34:21,289
definitely happen and so protocols of

812
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:24,378
you know tie-back suits you know lab

813
00:34:21,289 --> 00:34:27,199
coats hand-washing stations all that

814
00:34:24,378 --> 00:34:29,960
stuff I think is so critical and I just

815
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:31,939
don't see those kinds of things at the

816
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:35,389
the cannabis facilities being

817
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:37,700
implemented so in your ideal facility

818
00:34:35,389 --> 00:34:39,740
you'd have no one doing home grows and I

819
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:42,739
assume no one going from another grow

820
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:45,199
back to your greenhouse they would have

821
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:47,358
to go home shower change clothes or a

822
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,730
dress that would you have foot baths in

823
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,710
place do you think those are useful it

824
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:55,940
depends on how you're growing you know

825
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:57,260
places that have cement floors I was at

826
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,510
a place this last week you could have

827
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:01,730
eaten off their floors there was so

828
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:03,619
meticulous and the chances of a pathogen

829
00:35:01,730 --> 00:35:04,880
being able to survive in those kind of

830
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:06,800
environments and again it depends on the

831
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,500
pathogen are much slimmer than those

832
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,440
that have little dirt piles and or on

833
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:14,750
gravel or outdoor production facilities

834
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:17,480
but I will say you know I'm not

835
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:21,349
pathologist that's you know the diseased

836
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:23,568
person Department to look at what the

837
00:35:21,349 --> 00:35:28,430
risk is for disease transmission where

838
00:35:23,568 --> 00:35:31,699
I'm more dealing with insect issues I

839
00:35:28,429 --> 00:35:33,858
also you know the the tobacco mosaic

840
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:36,769
virus you know a lot of people say oh

841
00:35:33,858 --> 00:35:38,329
well you know I plant you know you can

842
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:41,090
see some of them

843
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:44,569
the the symptoms in the plant but I'm

844
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:49,280
still getting my same amount of harvest

845
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:51,410
I think is a very risky uh attitude to

846
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:53,210
have because then if you are taking

847
00:35:51,409 --> 00:35:55,819
cuttings off of those plants and then

848
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:58,579
Reaper Appa gating you know we don't

849
00:35:55,820 --> 00:36:01,100
want to be spreading a virus you know

850
00:35:58,579 --> 00:36:04,549
through through all the plants out there

851
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:07,009
and I don't know really if there's been

852
00:36:04,550 --> 00:36:12,200
enough looked at the long-term impact of

853
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:15,290
this virus on cannabis and what if you

854
00:36:12,199 --> 00:36:17,689
have a secondary problem that those two

855
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:21,019
problems then could completely stress

856
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:22,639
the plant out so smoking is something

857
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:26,300
that you know has to be looked at

858
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:28,279
because you know do some reading on

859
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:30,019
tobacco mosaic virus again not exactly

860
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,540
my department because it's mechanically

861
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:35,059
transmitted by hands and cigarettes and

862
00:36:32,539 --> 00:36:37,639
all that but you know I I think that's

863
00:36:35,059 --> 00:36:38,659
that's a risk you need to look at you

864
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:40,129
know most vegetable production

865
00:36:38,659 --> 00:36:43,069
facilities do not allow their employees

866
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:45,380
to smoke because a potential virus

867
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:48,350
transmission from cigarettes have you

868
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:50,570
actually seen lab results showing

869
00:36:48,349 --> 00:36:51,710
tobacco mosaic virus in cannabis and

870
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:54,559
then have you heard of it being

871
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:57,559
transferred from cigarettes okay so I

872
00:36:54,559 --> 00:37:00,590
have seen pictures of the plants that

873
00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:03,500
they and I did not physically see the

874
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:05,690
actual report I'm going on them saying

875
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:09,769
that the report came back positive for

876
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:12,079
it so in that situation because you know

877
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:14,389
I can't be all places at all times and

878
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,829
you know I'm in Pennsylvania where

879
00:37:14,389 --> 00:37:22,639
cannabis is just starting over here but

880
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:26,179
you can get those eliza

881
00:37:22,639 --> 00:37:28,639
test kits like from AG dia that you can

882
00:37:26,179 --> 00:37:31,699
do that quick first initial virus

883
00:37:28,639 --> 00:37:33,769
testing in-house to see if you do get a

884
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:36,829
positive before paying to send it off

885
00:37:33,769 --> 00:37:39,199
for further virus testing it's just a

886
00:37:36,829 --> 00:37:40,969
quick way to make sure oh because it

887
00:37:39,199 --> 00:37:42,829
could be nutritional it could be

888
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:45,889
cultural there could be other things so

889
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:50,329
at least it's a quick way to do that and

890
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:51,619
I've talked to other people in a

891
00:37:50,329 --> 00:37:52,190
cannabis industry and I will say they've

892
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,409
seen

893
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:58,010
to know what they're talking about that

894
00:37:54,409 --> 00:38:00,259
this is a concern for them and it will

895
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:04,190
be interesting to see what happens with

896
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:07,819
more of the hemp being grown outdoors in

897
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:10,880
traditional tobacco States to see if you

898
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:15,588
know it becomes an issue for outdoor

899
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:17,838
production as well on that so it's just

900
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:19,219
something to keep an eye out for again

901
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:22,519
we don't have the answers for everything

902
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:24,500
because this is such a new new

903
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,659
developing industry and there just

904
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:30,050
hasn't been a lot of research on it yet

905
00:38:26,659 --> 00:38:32,629
but it does from the report and again

906
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:34,280
once you get into biology testing and

907
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,170
stuff you know you can get a positive

908
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:39,440
for one virus when it can be another

909
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:40,849
virus it gets very complicated but I do

910
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:42,980
think it's something we need to watch

911
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:45,710
for and again it's all part of

912
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:49,519
Sanitation one thing you touched on is

913
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:51,170
that these these pests seem to be

914
00:38:49,519 --> 00:38:53,318
opportunistic like they prefer you

915
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:56,059
mentioned plant stress being a factor

916
00:38:53,318 --> 00:38:59,630
how much of a factor is plant stress in

917
00:38:56,059 --> 00:39:03,739
terms of a lot of these pests well when

918
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:06,920
you say stress um I you know there's

919
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:09,379
this race to push the plans and again

920
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:11,900
this is not this is just not cannabis

921
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:14,510
this is ornamentals they push the plants

922
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:17,450
want them to grow fast they want them to

923
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:19,910
be dark green you want nice big blooms

924
00:39:17,449 --> 00:39:22,969
or buds on anything but there is a lot

925
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:25,909
of support of research now on ornamental

926
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:29,568
and vegetable crops that when you push

927
00:39:25,909 --> 00:39:32,509
these plans to grow and the plants are

928
00:39:29,568 --> 00:39:34,699
actually growing at a faster rate the

929
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:37,119
plants can't can't produce a lot of

930
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:40,039
their natural defensive chemicals and

931
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:41,358
you know the plants natural defenses

932
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:43,699
chemicals that includes you know

933
00:39:41,358 --> 00:39:46,639
caffeine nicotine things like that those

934
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:48,919
are built-in insecticides pyrethrins but

935
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,348
if you're busy growing you can't produce

936
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,838
as many chemicals and you become more

937
00:39:51,349 --> 00:39:55,789
susceptible they've done work looking at

938
00:39:53,838 --> 00:39:57,818
roses and chrysanthemums and they've

939
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,989
actually found by reducing

940
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:02,480
parts-per-million of nitrogen it can

941
00:39:59,989 --> 00:40:04,429
have significant impact on spider mite

942
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,800
population and Western flower thrips

943
00:40:04,429 --> 00:40:08,289
population so the

944
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:09,789
something in ornamentals that we're

945
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:12,070
trying to do you know we're still we

946
00:40:09,789 --> 00:40:13,539
have to grow on a schedule because you

947
00:40:12,070 --> 00:40:15,340
got to get those plans out for Mother's

948
00:40:13,539 --> 00:40:17,739
Day you got to have the poinsettias out

949
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:19,920
in time for Christmas sales and all that

950
00:40:17,739 --> 00:40:22,809
but we're looking at can we lower

951
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,710
nitrogen levels to where we can help

952
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:28,539
suppress some of these plants you know

953
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:32,440
some of the pest pressures but still

954
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:35,230
grow a healthy quality plant and so with

955
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:38,829
cannabis you know it's it's you know

956
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:40,690
more is not better but it seems to be

957
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:43,389
the motto of this industry of just

958
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,760
dumping every a lot of different stuff

959
00:40:43,389 --> 00:40:47,319
on the plants but I do think this is

960
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:50,110
something that needs to be looked at is

961
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:52,480
you know if we can adjust fertilization

962
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:54,670
to we can still get your same amount of

963
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,440
harvest but reduce your pest pressures

964
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:58,329
and it takes research and it takes

965
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,579
someone willing to do the research and

966
00:40:58,329 --> 00:41:04,840
unfortunately that's still not going to

967
00:41:00,579 --> 00:41:07,360
be done on a government University

968
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:09,850
Extension level it takes a growing

969
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:11,650
facility that's willing to take the time

970
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:14,319
to do that and to understand research

971
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:16,840
and how to do it so this is a question

972
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:20,860
I'm really curious about I hear a lot of

973
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:23,920
people correlating Brix levels with pest

974
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:25,390
resistance do you have any information

975
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,940
on that in terms of the the sugar

976
00:41:25,389 --> 00:41:30,730
content in the leaf somehow making a

977
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:33,940
plant less interesting to a particular

978
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,590
pest well I don't have too much comment

979
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,909
on it because usually you know when

980
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:38,740
you're talking about brick stuff usually

981
00:41:36,909 --> 00:41:39,879
talking about fruit production because

982
00:41:38,739 --> 00:41:41,589
they're trying to look at the sugars

983
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,099
that way but there was an interesting

984
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:47,380
study done University of Maryland I

985
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:49,569
believe it was dr. mike rupp I have to

986
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:51,940
go back and look but they were looking

987
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:56,110
at brown marmorated stink bug which you

988
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:59,380
know we're seeing in cannabis hanging

989
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:03,010
out and a feeding on the plant they

990
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:04,809
looked on trees ornamental trees in the

991
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:07,690
landscape where the brown marmorated

992
00:42:04,809 --> 00:42:09,460
stink bugs were feeding and there's this

993
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,260
in its you know I don't want this job

994
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:13,929
but somebody does this job where they

995
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:15,430
actually can when an insect is feeding

996
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:16,869
you can almost you can basically cut off

997
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:18,969
their mouthparts and then it works

998
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:22,210
basically as a needle and

999
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:24,219
oh then you can collect from the end of

1000
00:42:22,210 --> 00:42:27,070
the broken off mouth part where exactly

1001
00:42:24,219 --> 00:42:29,739
the insect was feeding they do this leg

1002
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,480
with aphids to see what they're feeding

1003
00:42:29,739 --> 00:42:33,219
on what part of the plant and the sugar

1004
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:35,320
content and they found that brown

1005
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:37,569
marmorated stink bug knew exactly on

1006
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:41,530
trees where to tap into higher sugar

1007
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:43,480
levels as to them in the plants and

1008
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:45,280
that's with a head for because sugar

1009
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,449
content in a plant is not evenly

1010
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:55,300
distributed and so it's something that's

1011
00:42:49,449 --> 00:42:57,189
starting to be looked at but I don't

1012
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:59,830
have an exact scientific answer with it

1013
00:42:57,190 --> 00:43:02,650
it may be anecdotal there may be

1014
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:04,360
something to it but if you know you're

1015
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:06,039
pushing one plant to do one thing that

1016
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:09,309
it typically can't do another thing you

1017
00:43:06,039 --> 00:43:12,250
can you can only do so much at once well

1018
00:43:09,309 --> 00:43:14,710
it does appear that when you have a room

1019
00:43:12,250 --> 00:43:16,989
of plants the most stressed plant will

1020
00:43:14,710 --> 00:43:20,679
be the first one that you'll see pests

1021
00:43:16,989 --> 00:43:24,819
on in in mind but unless you have a very

1022
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:26,789
susceptible cultivar yes and that's the

1023
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:29,530
thing - and I think it's really really

1024
00:43:26,789 --> 00:43:31,960
beautiful for the cannabis industry to

1025
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:36,460
be tracking okay we're growing these

1026
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,619
these 10 cultivars but you know number 9

1027
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:40,599
always seems to be the first with a

1028
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:42,819
spider mite outbreak that needs to be

1029
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,029
noted and people need to be sharing that

1030
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,400
information so that even though you know

1031
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:51,790
maybe it has some other great qualities

1032
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:56,220
you know selecting for cultivars that

1033
00:43:51,789 --> 00:43:58,090
have more resistance issue resistance

1034
00:43:56,219 --> 00:44:01,719
resistant issues is the right word but

1035
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:04,030
resistance to them so that maybe you may

1036
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:06,189
give up some other little quality but

1037
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,280
selecting for plants that don't have

1038
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:10,480
pest issues saw that in chrysanthemum

1039
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:14,200
production there's a variety called

1040
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,719
viren that is a you want Western flower

1041
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:18,159
thrips you grow that variety and most

1042
00:44:16,719 --> 00:44:21,039
commercial growers do not grow it

1043
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:23,109
anymore because it is so prone to

1044
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,090
Western flower thrips even though it has

1045
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,250
a nice flower to it and what ended up

1046
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:29,650
happening is people actually use it as a

1047
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:31,300
trap plant where they would put it in

1048
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:32,838
the middle of their other mums and it

1049
00:44:31,300 --> 00:44:35,028
would actually draw the western fly

1050
00:44:32,838 --> 00:44:37,578
northrop's right to the viral then they

1051
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:39,679
would bag the fire on and get rid of the

1052
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:42,528
plant and they would actually pull the

1053
00:44:39,679 --> 00:44:44,659
pests out that way but there's a

1054
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:47,719
definite correlation between stress and

1055
00:44:44,659 --> 00:44:49,368
cultivar deciding on okay who's going to

1056
00:44:47,719 --> 00:44:51,979
get fed on and who's not going to get

1057
00:44:49,369 --> 00:44:54,099
fed on have you seen I want to come back

1058
00:44:51,978 --> 00:44:56,419
to the indicator trap plant in

1059
00:44:54,099 --> 00:44:58,450
pollinator plants but before we do I

1060
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:00,769
just want to touch on other things like

1061
00:44:58,449 --> 00:45:02,989
I've heard there were some studies I've

1062
00:45:00,768 --> 00:45:06,318
read some studies on seaweed helping

1063
00:45:02,989 --> 00:45:08,509
with insect resistance have you done any

1064
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:12,079
research or read anything on that I mean

1065
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:15,228
I know that I mean so you know seaweeds

1066
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:17,150
have cytokinins in them and that from

1067
00:45:15,228 --> 00:45:19,429
what I've seen in personal experience is

1068
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:23,420
it does definitely help with overall

1069
00:45:19,429 --> 00:45:27,588
plant growth I've not seen and this is

1070
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:29,269
also where when you look at research you

1071
00:45:27,588 --> 00:45:31,429
have to specifically look at how the

1072
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:33,558
research was done and who did the

1073
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:36,469
research and where was it published and

1074
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:38,298
is it peer reviewed because you know

1075
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:40,729
you've got the whole thing today of you

1076
00:45:38,298 --> 00:45:42,679
know pay to publish and you could have

1077
00:45:40,728 --> 00:45:45,919
some really bad science but you can pay

1078
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:47,748
a journal to publish it for you and that

1079
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:49,700
doesn't mean it's actually good sound

1080
00:45:47,748 --> 00:45:52,308
science and so that's why you got to be

1081
00:45:49,699 --> 00:45:55,068
very careful with reading some of the

1082
00:45:52,309 --> 00:45:57,710
stuff and and the sources and also look

1083
00:45:55,068 --> 00:46:00,079
how the experiments are done what one

1084
00:45:57,710 --> 00:46:02,269
example of you know people were looking

1085
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,729
at silicon because it was like oh you

1086
00:46:02,268 --> 00:46:06,889
use silicon it thickens the cuticle and

1087
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,449
then you don't have as many pest issues

1088
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:11,739
well there were some initial work done

1089
00:46:08,449 --> 00:46:14,239
where they put silicone on plants and

1090
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:16,940
then they looked at mealy bugs on them

1091
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:19,009
but they saw no difference well the

1092
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,979
problem was is the crop they were using

1093
00:46:19,009 --> 00:46:24,739
was not a silicon accumulator and you

1094
00:46:21,978 --> 00:46:26,149
see this that just because you use

1095
00:46:24,739 --> 00:46:27,318
something on one plant doesn't mean

1096
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,479
you're going to get the same results on

1097
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:30,739
another plant because plants are picky

1098
00:46:29,478 --> 00:46:33,048
about what nutrients they're going to

1099
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:36,619
uptake and in what form and in what

1100
00:46:33,048 --> 00:46:38,929
quantities and you know this is where

1101
00:46:36,619 --> 00:46:41,210
maybe seaweed may work in some

1102
00:46:38,929 --> 00:46:45,108
situations and some even some media's

1103
00:46:41,210 --> 00:46:46,320
but may not in another also you've got

1104
00:46:45,108 --> 00:46:49,619
to have a

1105
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:52,350
roll when you do the test to make sure

1106
00:46:49,619 --> 00:46:54,059
that it's something not environmental or

1107
00:46:52,349 --> 00:46:55,469
something else that's causing the

1108
00:46:54,059 --> 00:46:57,360
results that you think you're seeing

1109
00:46:55,469 --> 00:46:58,889
that's a really good point I'll have to

1110
00:46:57,360 --> 00:47:01,079
go back and look it was a book called a

1111
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:03,299
seaweed in plant growth by TL Sen which

1112
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,150
was a collection of research articles

1113
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:07,680
that he sort of he sort of went over and

1114
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,940
I remember reading about it but I'll

1115
00:47:07,679 --> 00:47:10,529
have to go back and look and you do

1116
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:12,150
bring up a really good point that we try

1117
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:14,250
and emphasize and just about every

1118
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:16,829
podcast that people do need to have a

1119
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:19,679
control they need need to look at an

1120
00:47:16,829 --> 00:47:21,539
actual study and see how it was how it

1121
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,429
was established and how it was set up

1122
00:47:21,539 --> 00:47:25,920
and make sure the mythal methodology

1123
00:47:23,429 --> 00:47:27,329
fits with what they're looking to draw

1124
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,329
from it so those are all really good

1125
00:47:27,329 --> 00:47:33,509
points moving on though I would love to

1126
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:35,069
ask you this is one that I know we

1127
00:47:33,510 --> 00:47:37,440
talked about a little bit when we met

1128
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:40,019
was about neem and neem oil and how you

1129
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:43,200
mentioned it was not your favorite can

1130
00:47:40,019 --> 00:47:45,389
you touch a little bit on that sure I'm

1131
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:46,409
not saying neem oil is bad let me put

1132
00:47:45,389 --> 00:47:48,539
that out there cuz I don't want to get

1133
00:47:46,409 --> 00:47:53,099
all these you know hate emails you know

1134
00:47:48,539 --> 00:47:55,739
but from my personal experience doing

1135
00:47:53,099 --> 00:47:58,259
you know what I do virtual oils or not

1136
00:47:55,739 --> 00:48:00,059
oils or not oils or not oils you know

1137
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:02,130
there's a reason you cook with Wes and

1138
00:48:00,059 --> 00:48:04,650
oil there's a reason we used you know

1139
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:06,210
different kinds of oils for you know

1140
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,650
make up and there's different kinds of

1141
00:48:06,210 --> 00:48:08,340
oils then that we use for pest

1142
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,039
management

1143
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:14,730
there's particle size difference they

1144
00:48:11,039 --> 00:48:17,369
some of them you know are mix better

1145
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:19,079
into water than others you know there's

1146
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,460
some that do better in certain you know

1147
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:23,849
spray equipment that don't cause

1148
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:26,010
clogging the thing with neem oil is

1149
00:48:23,849 --> 00:48:28,349
people like oh you know it's from a

1150
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:30,300
plant so you know we're crunchy granola

1151
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:31,759
is that's great I hate the petroleum

1152
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,440
industry so I don't want to use

1153
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:35,790
petroleum-based products well if you

1154
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,190
hate petroleum-based products you better

1155
00:48:35,789 --> 00:48:40,860
stop driving your car and you know

1156
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:43,260
heating your house and you know drinking

1157
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:45,300
out that plastic cup unfortunately you

1158
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:47,460
know petroleum is part of our lives I

1159
00:48:45,300 --> 00:48:50,700
would be great if it wasn't the way it

1160
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:54,119
is but that's the reality just because

1161
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:57,960
something is a plant-based product does

1162
00:48:54,119 --> 00:49:00,568
not mean it is always safe for humans

1163
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,309
always say for the

1164
00:49:00,568 --> 00:49:05,880
you know that's that's a big

1165
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:08,040
misconception that people you know think

1166
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:08,880
that just because it's it's plant based

1167
00:49:08,039 --> 00:49:11,519
it's saved

1168
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:15,809
I'm not saying neem is not safe but neem

1169
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:18,568
is a product that is regulated by our

1170
00:49:15,809 --> 00:49:21,180
government and it has to be registered

1171
00:49:18,568 --> 00:49:23,068
you know and have an EPA registration

1172
00:49:21,179 --> 00:49:26,848
number on the products because of its

1173
00:49:23,068 --> 00:49:30,719
insecticidal properties where my concern

1174
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:33,240
comes in is we know neem is a good

1175
00:49:30,719 --> 00:49:36,149
repellent there's some good research out

1176
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:38,729
of Purdue looking at neem is a repellent

1177
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:40,440
for like Japanese beetles where they

1178
00:49:38,730 --> 00:49:41,909
spray a plant with neem they have

1179
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,010
another point they haven't sprayed with

1180
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:46,440
neem and sure enough the Japanese

1181
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:48,390
beetles tend to pass up a bit more the

1182
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:52,108
plant with the neem on it because it has

1183
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:55,639
a repelling quality so if you spray that

1184
00:49:52,108 --> 00:49:58,230
on a plant and you want to release

1185
00:49:55,639 --> 00:50:00,629
biocontrol agents and again you've got

1186
00:49:58,230 --> 00:50:02,400
to look at each individual biocontrol

1187
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:05,789
agents you can't say it with a broad

1188
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:08,579
sweeping blanket but there's a chance

1189
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:10,710
you can repel your beneficials off the

1190
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:13,079
plants I've seen biocontrol agents just

1191
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:14,519
go to the stems and walk down in March

1192
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:17,309
off plants because they don't want to

1193
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:20,909
live there there is some research done

1194
00:50:17,309 --> 00:50:22,980
where they have sprayed plant material

1195
00:50:20,909 --> 00:50:24,659
with neem and then put some of the

1196
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:27,150
predatory mites on there and the

1197
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:29,519
predatory mites choose to leave because

1198
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:31,349
of the repelling quality on there so if

1199
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:35,909
you're not going to use biocontrol

1200
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:37,500
at all sure go for it but if you think

1201
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:40,108
you're going to be using biocontrol

1202
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:42,809
agents you better think about this now

1203
00:50:40,108 --> 00:50:45,150
if you're growing outside you know we've

1204
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:48,269
got overhead irrigate you know rain or

1205
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:49,889
irrigation you know UV light stuff's

1206
00:50:48,269 --> 00:50:51,509
going to break down a lot faster but

1207
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:54,989
most people are not growing outside

1208
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:56,790
they're growing you know in a protected

1209
00:50:54,989 --> 00:50:59,250
environment where they're not overhead

1210
00:50:56,789 --> 00:51:02,159
irrigating and and compounds didn't

1211
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:04,048
pretend to persist for longer how long

1212
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:07,019
don't really know because there hasn't

1213
00:51:04,048 --> 00:51:09,119
been a ton of work done on this yet but

1214
00:51:07,019 --> 00:51:11,730
it is just something if my grower has

1215
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:13,769
the option then they're using bios

1216
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:17,789
between using neem or product

1217
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:20,610
soyal X you know I prefer them to use

1218
00:51:17,789 --> 00:51:23,070
the saw file X because once that's dry

1219
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:24,870
we found that the predatory mites do

1220
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:28,019
extremely well on the plants after that

1221
00:51:24,869 --> 00:51:30,960
we don't get that repelling quality with

1222
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:32,730
with the product and you know some oil

1223
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,139
ax yeah I got a look at your state and

1224
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:36,179
see if it's approved in your state or

1225
00:51:34,139 --> 00:51:38,429
not I know it's proved down in like

1226
00:51:36,179 --> 00:51:40,109
Colorado but you know it's an armory

1227
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:42,690
listed product so it's a proof used in

1228
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:46,039
organic production it's being used in

1229
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:49,619
vegetable production and it's an oil

1230
00:51:46,039 --> 00:51:52,170
that I very rarely see photo toxicity

1231
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:54,269
with the other thing back to knee neem

1232
00:51:52,170 --> 00:51:56,190
is not neem is not neem there's

1233
00:51:54,269 --> 00:51:58,949
different producers of it there's

1234
00:51:56,190 --> 00:52:00,840
different processes so you know you

1235
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:03,409
really got to if you're going to pick a

1236
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:07,289
product you really need to learn that

1237
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:09,329
product and and understand it and know

1238
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:11,730
how to use it in your growing system

1239
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:13,769
yeah I've seen huge differences like

1240
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:15,719
over a thousand ppm difference in as

1241
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:17,699
interacted levels across different neem

1242
00:52:15,719 --> 00:52:19,829
oils so I totally agree with you on that

1243
00:52:17,699 --> 00:52:22,259
yeah I didn't realize it was such a

1244
00:52:19,829 --> 00:52:24,179
repellent so you mentioned some oil X

1245
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:26,520
well I looked into this after the first

1246
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:28,589
time you mentioned it to me and it's a

1247
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:29,820
tough product for most people to get

1248
00:52:28,590 --> 00:52:32,670
their hands on unless they are a

1249
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:34,170
large-scale commercial grower so your

1250
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:36,960
alternative you mentioned was the

1251
00:52:34,170 --> 00:52:38,159
Monterey garden horticultural oil yes

1252
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,860
said it was the same or a similar

1253
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,389
product yes and that one people should

1254
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:46,019
be able to source and find even on

1255
00:52:42,389 --> 00:52:48,750
amazon.com now for that which brings us

1256
00:52:46,019 --> 00:52:50,250
back to dunking your clones so I'm going

1257
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:52,679
to throw myself under the bus and say

1258
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:55,500
when I brought some clones home they

1259
00:52:52,679 --> 00:52:58,649
were already in small plants they were

1260
00:52:55,500 --> 00:53:00,329
in soil already so I wanted to treat

1261
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:02,220
them because I didn't know if they were

1262
00:53:00,329 --> 00:53:05,549
if they had something on them so I

1263
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:09,750
dumped them in a five-gallon bucket that

1264
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:12,180
I had filled with a neem oil and green

1265
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:14,579
cleaner combination at 5050 oh my god

1266
00:53:12,179 --> 00:53:17,879
well I want to get your thoughts on this

1267
00:53:14,579 --> 00:53:19,619
and the the plants even dunked the soil

1268
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,660
the whole thing and the plants took it

1269
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:22,429
fine actually they didn't really freak

1270
00:53:21,659 --> 00:53:25,940
out and put them under

1271
00:53:22,429 --> 00:53:26,629
a lot of light right after but what do

1272
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,460
you recommend

1273
00:53:26,630 --> 00:53:30,230
well first off I'll let you cover what I

1274
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:32,119
did wrong and why you think this is a

1275
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:33,170
terrible idea but then secondly what do

1276
00:53:32,119 --> 00:53:34,670
you recommend for people that are

1277
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:36,530
bringing in plants that are already in

1278
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:38,150
soil because most people are not passing

1279
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:39,829
clones like they do in the ornamental

1280
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:41,900
industry where it's just the leaf tissue

1281
00:53:39,829 --> 00:53:46,579
it's usually in rock wool or it's in

1282
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:50,990
peat or some sort of media already right

1283
00:53:46,579 --> 00:53:53,150
well I've just okay so what is hard is

1284
00:53:50,989 --> 00:53:55,789
when you have products and you don't

1285
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:59,450
have a good dip rate because when you

1286
00:53:55,789 --> 00:54:03,039
look at the research on dips dip rate is

1287
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:07,578
lower typically then spray rate and

1288
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:09,650
until somebody has you know figured out

1289
00:54:07,579 --> 00:54:13,160
what that rate by dipping them in there

1290
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:16,970
and growing the plant out and make sure

1291
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:20,149
there's no negative impact you don't

1292
00:54:16,969 --> 00:54:22,578
necessarily know and when you are

1293
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:27,139
dealing with mixing up just a small

1294
00:54:22,579 --> 00:54:31,579
quantity of a pesticide a small error

1295
00:54:27,139 --> 00:54:35,088
can be a big error and you know it's

1296
00:54:31,579 --> 00:54:38,480
easy to go wrong so there was research

1297
00:54:35,088 --> 00:54:41,509
done out of Canada looking at dips with

1298
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:43,730
soil X and I will say that for the

1299
00:54:41,510 --> 00:54:45,829
ornamental market currently there is not

1300
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:48,530
a dip label yet even though the research

1301
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:51,170
has been done but this spray rate for

1302
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:54,470
the stuff oil is typically 1 to 2% where

1303
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:57,710
the dip read is 0.1 percent that's a

1304
00:54:54,469 --> 00:55:00,769
huge difference from spraying to dipping

1305
00:54:57,710 --> 00:55:04,159
where they felt they got good enough

1306
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:06,409
pest control without pausing fido on a

1307
00:55:04,159 --> 00:55:09,769
phyto toxicity you know damage to the

1308
00:55:06,409 --> 00:55:12,858
plant and do keep in mind you can have

1309
00:55:09,769 --> 00:55:15,530
photo toxicity that is not visible to

1310
00:55:12,858 --> 00:55:17,929
the human eye it can plants can be

1311
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:20,240
stressed and kinam and it can impact

1312
00:55:17,929 --> 00:55:22,699
their growth without us actually seeing

1313
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:26,629
burning or curling or spots or things

1314
00:55:22,699 --> 00:55:28,789
like that so that dots there now what I

1315
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:31,548
always do we start talking about dipping

1316
00:55:28,789 --> 00:55:34,159
is we look at what the plan is and what

1317
00:55:31,548 --> 00:55:36,110
your target pest is to see what dips are

1318
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,559
out there for you I

1319
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:41,450
you do have to be careful with any kind

1320
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:44,360
of oil and dipping roots because there

1321
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:46,759
is potential for Fito toxicity on the

1322
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:49,730
roots but again it comes back to product

1323
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:52,580
and raids and temperatures and you know

1324
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:54,500
as your plant stressed even before you

1325
00:55:52,579 --> 00:55:57,559
dip did you soak it too long because

1326
00:55:54,500 --> 00:56:00,679
it's a dip it's not a soak you know we

1327
00:55:57,559 --> 00:56:02,779
have to look at all these factors but

1328
00:56:00,679 --> 00:56:05,629
for some of the other pests

1329
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:07,100
you know dipping in the botanic garden

1330
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:11,000
something that's being done regularly

1331
00:56:07,099 --> 00:56:13,849
you can dip in in soaps and there are

1332
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:15,289
once you go look at the labels and look

1333
00:56:13,849 --> 00:56:17,269
for the dip rates you can find these

1334
00:56:15,289 --> 00:56:19,880
recommended rates and like with the

1335
00:56:17,269 --> 00:56:22,309
Tanner guard which again it that that's

1336
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,170
a whole nightmare because like down in

1337
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:26,599
Colorado you can't use the Tanner guard

1338
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,500
but you can do Tanner guard max but

1339
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,230
you're not going to have a high enough

1340
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:33,289
concentration but various bores really

1341
00:56:30,230 --> 00:56:35,210
to do what you need to do for that it's

1342
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:38,389
getting unfortunately very complicated

1343
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:40,909
but just saying that you can mix

1344
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:43,309
products for dips it's best to look at

1345
00:56:40,909 --> 00:56:45,289
what your target pests are what your

1346
00:56:43,309 --> 00:56:48,259
plant is and try to find the right tip

1347
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:50,840
for you and you may need to do some some

1348
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:53,270
testing and and to grow out plants and

1349
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:55,430
when you do dip monitor those plants all

1350
00:56:53,269 --> 00:56:57,500
the way through their lifecycle and see

1351
00:56:55,429 --> 00:57:00,559
if you do notice anything and in the

1352
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:02,840
long run but dipping is the way that

1353
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,509
many greenhouse people are stopping pest

1354
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:07,180
from getting in the door I have no idea

1355
00:57:05,510 --> 00:57:10,550
that the dip rates could vary that much

1356
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:13,489
when I did it I think I used the low end

1357
00:57:10,550 --> 00:57:15,530
of the spray rate and I didn't let it

1358
00:57:13,489 --> 00:57:17,750
saturate the soil to really get into the

1359
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:20,900
root zone but you know I didn't know

1360
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:22,699
what I was doing either so I really

1361
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,950
appreciate that feedback that's really

1362
00:57:22,699 --> 00:57:26,569
interesting so can we talk a little bit

1363
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:29,480
about some of the products that you may

1364
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:32,390
or may not have experience with one of

1365
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,800
the things that I think is important for

1366
00:57:32,389 --> 00:57:37,039
people to realize in the industry is

1367
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:38,870
that products that aren't EPA regulated

1368
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:40,900
whereas certain certain ones are like

1369
00:57:38,869 --> 00:57:43,880
I'll use neem is an example of that

1370
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:45,920
they're claiming to be plant washes or

1371
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:48,110
leaf shine products as a way of getting

1372
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,550
around having to do or not having the

1373
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:53,059
ability to get red

1374
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:54,320
the EPA as a pesticide do you have any

1375
00:57:53,059 --> 00:57:56,389
experience or do you have any thoughts

1376
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:58,760
first off on plant wash or plant shine

1377
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:59,989
products and then can we talk a little

1378
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:03,020
about some of the products you may have

1379
00:57:59,989 --> 00:58:07,129
used or seen other growers use over the

1380
00:58:03,019 --> 00:58:10,940
years it's it's a gamble you know using

1381
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:16,039
products that have not been what I will

1382
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:18,710
say is vetted it is a risk it's kind of

1383
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:22,519
like going down to the farmers market

1384
00:58:18,710 --> 00:58:23,840
and buying herbal medicine and when I

1385
00:58:22,519 --> 00:58:25,639
say over medicine I'm not talking about

1386
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,700
cannabis but you know what I mean it's

1387
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:31,730
you know supplements because it's not

1388
00:58:28,699 --> 00:58:34,069
regulated so you don't really know what

1389
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:37,119
truly you're getting because basically

1390
00:58:34,070 --> 00:58:39,470
you know you can break things down into

1391
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,420
you know you have your government

1392
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:43,219
registered products which have will have

1393
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:45,650
an EPA registration number and that will

1394
00:58:43,219 --> 00:58:47,750
include again your name products your as

1395
00:58:45,650 --> 00:58:50,480
interact in products your synthetic

1396
00:58:47,750 --> 00:58:52,219
pesticides insecticidal microbial

1397
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,889
products then we have what's called the

1398
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:56,750
twenty five B list and these are

1399
00:58:54,889 --> 00:58:59,420
products that basically the government

1400
00:58:56,750 --> 00:59:00,650
said several years ago okay we know

1401
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,960
these products are pretty much food

1402
00:59:00,650 --> 00:59:05,570
grade and if you make your pesticides

1403
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,610
fungicides insecticides - sides whatever

1404
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,590
out of them

1405
00:59:06,610 --> 00:59:10,849
we are not going to require you to pay

1406
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:12,950
the millions of dollars to get them

1407
00:59:10,849 --> 00:59:15,829
registered but that doesn't mean the

1408
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:17,599
products work that means you as a grower

1409
00:59:15,829 --> 00:59:20,480
you're just not going to kill yourself

1410
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:22,579
or your employees by using these

1411
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:26,329
products again it's a lot of food based

1412
00:59:22,579 --> 00:59:31,699
products but there is no there's no

1413
00:59:26,329 --> 00:59:35,119
testing really or no vetting through any

1414
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:37,969
kind of agency for them and then there's

1415
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:39,889
the well we're just going to not make

1416
00:59:37,969 --> 00:59:42,709
pesticidal claims we're going to go with

1417
00:59:39,889 --> 00:59:45,500
with we're calling it a wash kind of

1418
00:59:42,710 --> 00:59:47,059
thing which i you guys all know what's

1419
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:48,650
been going on with the plant washes what

1420
00:59:47,059 --> 00:59:51,019
they're finding in them what they're

1421
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:53,630
finding in some of these other products

1422
00:59:51,019 --> 00:59:56,059
I mean people are lying and they're

1423
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:58,369
adding other pesticides into them to

1424
00:59:56,059 --> 01:00:00,469
make their products work better and it's

1425
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:03,289
a risk if you are willing to take those

1426
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:05,839
risks and possibly you know lose a crop

1427
01:00:03,289 --> 01:00:07,699
because of pesticide contamination you

1428
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:10,370
know that's that's a risk some people

1429
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:14,539
are willing to take but I don't think

1430
01:00:10,369 --> 01:00:19,190
they understand that there's on these

1431
01:00:14,539 --> 01:00:22,610
25b products there's no there's no not

1432
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:25,220
there's nothing to be like proof of them

1433
01:00:22,610 --> 01:00:28,430
working or any testing or really

1434
01:00:25,219 --> 01:00:31,099
anything like that so it's it's it's a

1435
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:34,609
tough it's a tough thing not to say

1436
01:00:31,099 --> 01:00:38,449
there can be these 25 B products that

1437
01:00:34,610 --> 01:00:42,470
can be good products but most of them

1438
01:00:38,449 --> 01:00:44,779
are all dependent on spray coverage and

1439
01:00:42,469 --> 01:00:47,059
how well can you spray and cover your

1440
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:50,050
plant because if you can suffocate it

1441
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:53,420
with an oil most likely you can kill it

1442
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:55,010
but you know you don't always know

1443
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:57,829
what's in these bottles you're getting

1444
01:00:55,010 --> 01:01:00,530
unless you actually are having them

1445
01:00:57,829 --> 01:01:02,000
tested to make sure of what they're

1446
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:03,620
claiming is in there is in there because

1447
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:07,039
again there have been too many

1448
01:01:03,619 --> 01:01:08,719
incidences now of these plant washes or

1449
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:10,789
even some of the 25 B products where

1450
01:01:08,719 --> 01:01:12,250
people have knowingly put pesticides in

1451
01:01:10,789 --> 01:01:15,050
there to make them work better

1452
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:17,599
interestingly enough so that stuff I

1453
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:20,750
just talked about it used to be sold

1454
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:23,420
years ago at a very dilute rate called

1455
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:25,789
clean and shine and so it was a plant

1456
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,530
cleaner and it was abused they would

1457
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:29,389
spray down a lot of the tropicals to

1458
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:32,420
wash off pesticide residues and things

1459
01:01:29,389 --> 01:01:35,000
like that but the rate is so low as a

1460
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:37,940
foliar application it really didn't have

1461
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,980
those insecticidal properties where you

1462
01:01:37,940 --> 01:01:42,829
need to be at like the 1 to 2 percent

1463
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:47,150
concentration of the product and see the

1464
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:48,860
insecticidal properties from it so it's

1465
01:01:47,150 --> 01:01:51,920
a gamble it's a complete gamble you know

1466
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:53,750
if you got a product that it's not EPA

1467
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,539
registered I would first of all have it

1468
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:59,059
tested for any other pesticides in it

1469
01:01:56,539 --> 01:02:03,170
because again cannabis is too expensive

1470
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:06,349
of a crop to take a risk on and then you

1471
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:08,960
know you'd want to you know only test a

1472
01:02:06,349 --> 01:02:11,239
plant have a control next to it just to

1473
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:14,059
make sure that you aren't going to have

1474
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:16,549
any photo toxicity or other weird things

1475
01:02:14,059 --> 01:02:17,190
happening from it and also does it

1476
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:21,359
actually

1477
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:24,960
work I think what's happening a lot with

1478
01:02:21,358 --> 01:02:27,869
these these exempt products is is when

1479
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,269
you have three or four plants and you

1480
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:34,440
can get such good spray coverage the

1481
01:02:30,269 --> 01:02:36,929
water is doing a lot for you so I think

1482
01:02:34,440 --> 01:02:38,670
what's happening is that people that

1483
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:40,828
just have a few plants or plants that

1484
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:42,809
are well spaced and that are in those

1485
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:46,920
plants looking over every inch every day

1486
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:49,769
when they spray I think the water is

1487
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,769
actually washing a certain percentage of

1488
01:02:49,769 --> 01:02:55,800
the pest off the plants there was

1489
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:58,500
actually a study done I think it was

1490
01:02:55,800 --> 01:03:02,430
last year the year before where they

1491
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:06,179
looked at you know Western flower thrips

1492
01:03:02,429 --> 01:03:08,879
and by getting good spray water coverage

1493
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:11,578
they were actually able to pretty much

1494
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,470
knock thrips back to the point of

1495
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:15,300
conventional insecticides they were at

1496
01:03:13,469 --> 01:03:17,399
the same level but they were able to get

1497
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:21,480
in there and get spray coverage on every

1498
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,430
single leaf and really baby those plants

1499
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:26,250
also in some of these products they have

1500
01:03:23,429 --> 01:03:27,809
surfactants surfactants are soaps so

1501
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:29,608
it's almost like you're spraying the

1502
01:03:27,809 --> 01:03:31,799
plant tooth and insecticidal soap so I

1503
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:34,019
think the physical action of washing

1504
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:35,730
plus having a surfactant in there

1505
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:38,039
sometimes I think that's what's

1506
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:41,969
providing a lot of the control not

1507
01:03:38,039 --> 01:03:45,088
actually the active ingredient so with

1508
01:03:41,969 --> 01:03:47,399
one of my ornamental larger growing

1509
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:49,469
operations we actually have them order

1510
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,420
in and I don't want to get into brand

1511
01:03:49,469 --> 01:03:54,509
names but some of them are air-quote

1512
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:58,019
popular cannabis products and we sprayed

1513
01:03:54,510 --> 01:04:00,180
them like we would regularly spray in a

1514
01:03:58,019 --> 01:04:01,858
greenhouse we didn't do you know dot

1515
01:04:00,179 --> 01:04:03,899
wand where you get under every leaf

1516
01:04:01,858 --> 01:04:05,489
because the reality is is and larger

1517
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:07,500
commercial growing operations you can't

1518
01:04:05,489 --> 01:04:12,000
do that but we sprayed them and we

1519
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:14,190
actually did a dipping too and we saw a

1520
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:17,039
lot of photos photo toxicity and we

1521
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:22,079
really didn't get the control that was

1522
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:25,559
claimed by the products so you know we

1523
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:28,730
just the the commercial ornamental

1524
01:04:25,559 --> 01:04:30,750
people and vegetable guys they're not

1525
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:32,608
adopting the

1526
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:34,079
a lot of these products because we just

1527
01:04:32,608 --> 01:04:37,619
don't see the efficacy with it because

1528
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:39,569
they can't spray like the cannabis

1529
01:04:37,619 --> 01:04:42,180
people can spray and baby

1530
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:44,970
each plant so would be interesting when

1531
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:47,250
you spray brand name product then I

1532
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:49,169
would spray you know another plant with

1533
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:50,670
you know a surfactant and then have your

1534
01:04:49,170 --> 01:04:51,960
control and see if you see the

1535
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:54,090
difference have a control would just

1536
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:56,130
spraying water and see what kind of

1537
01:04:54,090 --> 01:05:00,119
results you get and please please please

1538
01:04:56,130 --> 01:05:03,539
stop spraying with paint sprayers I I

1539
01:05:00,119 --> 01:05:07,380
don't understand this trend either paint

1540
01:05:03,539 --> 01:05:09,119
sprayers are not pesticide applicators

1541
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,500
they're not designed they don't have the

1542
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:15,510
the nozzles

1543
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:18,179
I think investing in a good piece of you

1544
01:05:15,510 --> 01:05:22,050
can get the right particle size you know

1545
01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:24,239
the the the angle nozzles and all that

1546
01:05:22,050 --> 01:05:26,039
kind of stuff is is really critical I

1547
01:05:24,239 --> 01:05:28,019
don't understand why people you know

1548
01:05:26,039 --> 01:05:29,340
have these plants with so much money and

1549
01:05:28,019 --> 01:05:33,358
they baby them so much and then they

1550
01:05:29,340 --> 01:05:35,220
cheap out using a paint sprayer to spray

1551
01:05:33,358 --> 01:05:36,779
their plants so do you have a

1552
01:05:35,219 --> 01:05:38,608
recommendation on that in like an

1553
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:44,790
atomizer or a fog or anything like that

1554
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:47,098
I think that this is when you talk to a

1555
01:05:44,789 --> 01:05:49,289
company that produces spray product for

1556
01:05:47,099 --> 01:05:51,510
what are you doing are you a greenhouse

1557
01:05:49,289 --> 01:05:53,338
producer are you a field producer you've

1558
01:05:51,510 --> 01:05:56,970
got to get the right equipment for what

1559
01:05:53,338 --> 01:05:59,279
you're doing and you know that the

1560
01:05:56,969 --> 01:06:01,230
different tips which this is really

1561
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:03,990
where you get into specifics on that

1562
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:05,699
I think DRAM is an excellent company

1563
01:06:03,989 --> 01:06:09,299
that produces really good quipment

1564
01:06:05,699 --> 01:06:12,000
that's pretty much the company that most

1565
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:13,710
commercials commercial growers have

1566
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,230
their products they see DRAM equipment

1567
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:18,000
all the time in greenhouses but again

1568
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:19,079
depending on how you're spraying and

1569
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,389
what you're spraying and what you're

1570
01:06:19,079 --> 01:06:22,829
doing it can all be very different yeah

1571
01:06:21,389 --> 01:06:24,679
we buy their hoses I've had great

1572
01:06:22,829 --> 01:06:26,848
success with that company as well so

1573
01:06:24,679 --> 01:06:28,980
yeah they're nice people and they're

1574
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:30,690
smart people Kurt Becker plug out to

1575
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:34,619
that guy and don't bombard him with

1576
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:38,309
emails you know Sara Lee but he is so

1577
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:40,079
knowledgeable on spray equipment if you

1578
01:06:38,309 --> 01:06:42,809
ever get the opportunity to hear Kurt

1579
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:43,558
talk it is you know I always learn from

1580
01:06:42,809 --> 01:06:47,099
him and

1581
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:49,199
and he is he really knows his stuff and

1582
01:06:47,099 --> 01:06:51,509
he's not a bullshitter I'm sorry my lad

1583
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,469
swear I just did sorry you're all good

1584
01:06:51,509 --> 01:06:55,528
totally fine

1585
01:06:52,469 --> 01:06:57,479
so I gotta give me beep over that when

1586
01:06:55,528 --> 01:06:59,309
you go back no I give all these the

1587
01:06:57,478 --> 01:07:01,078
explicit rating just in case so there's

1588
01:06:59,309 --> 01:07:03,420
no like talk about kids trying to learn

1589
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:05,099
how to grow cannabis on a side note

1590
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:08,880
though so I have a I have a greenhouse

1591
01:07:05,099 --> 01:07:13,528
and we grow a variety of different crops

1592
01:07:08,880 --> 01:07:15,209
and this year I got mites which I did

1593
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:16,889
not do the right thing and fully

1594
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:18,149
identify bee but I didn't plan on

1595
01:07:16,889 --> 01:07:21,150
treating them I was just going to let

1596
01:07:18,150 --> 01:07:24,479
the crop go anyway at the end of the

1597
01:07:21,150 --> 01:07:27,239
season so my question is overwintering

1598
01:07:24,478 --> 01:07:29,548
in greenhouses so for growers that are

1599
01:07:27,239 --> 01:07:31,259
growing cannabis and have the ability to

1600
01:07:29,548 --> 01:07:33,900
just open up that greenhouse in the

1601
01:07:31,259 --> 01:07:36,329
winter and let let it freeze or let

1602
01:07:33,900 --> 01:07:38,608
temperatures drop down to to lower

1603
01:07:36,329 --> 01:07:39,900
conditions is that a good idea does that

1604
01:07:38,608 --> 01:07:43,199
even make any difference in the

1605
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:48,209
lifecycle for a lot of these pests it it

1606
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:50,099
all depends on the pests also do you

1607
01:07:48,208 --> 01:07:51,688
have cement floors or do you have gravel

1608
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:53,249
floors where you know if they're gravel

1609
01:07:51,688 --> 01:07:55,108
where they can get down lower and can be

1610
01:07:53,248 --> 01:07:57,478
protected which is different than a

1611
01:07:55,108 --> 01:08:00,119
cement floor which is going to be naked

1612
01:07:57,478 --> 01:08:03,058
and they're going to be exposed and also

1613
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:05,880
how cold can you really get it I will

1614
01:08:03,059 --> 01:08:09,900
just say this somehow miraculously

1615
01:08:05,880 --> 01:08:12,479
outside you know pests overwinter every

1616
01:08:09,900 --> 01:08:14,160
winter even in some of the harshest

1617
01:08:12,478 --> 01:08:16,858
conditions but the difference between

1618
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:19,408
outside and in a greenhouse is outside

1619
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:22,529
you know days get shorter temperatures

1620
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:26,519
start drawing dropping and all the

1621
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:29,099
animals birds you know deer insects mice

1622
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:30,929
I'll get their cue oh it's wintertime we

1623
01:08:29,099 --> 01:08:34,319
have to prepare for winter depending on

1624
01:08:30,929 --> 01:08:36,569
the insect or might they all overwinter

1625
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:39,900
differently summer eggs summer pupae

1626
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:42,989
some are adult and some can handle

1627
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:46,019
cooler temperatures than others it's a

1628
01:08:42,988 --> 01:08:49,379
tough thing to do to really freeze out

1629
01:08:46,020 --> 01:08:50,429
pests completely especially when you're

1630
01:08:49,380 --> 01:08:51,900
probably going to bring them right back

1631
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:52,469
in on your plant material in the spring

1632
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:55,679
anyhow

1633
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:57,179
yeah where my concern what also was that

1634
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:58,769
we have some straw bales and

1635
01:08:57,179 --> 01:09:02,609
and I'm wondering if I'm contaminating

1636
01:08:58,769 --> 01:09:03,779
those straw bales with these mites is

1637
01:09:02,609 --> 01:09:05,159
that a canal

1638
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,839
what are they gonna what are they going

1639
01:09:05,158 --> 01:09:10,708
to feed on I mean if you think about

1640
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:12,899
mites or you know they don't have a hard

1641
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:17,248
exoskeleton like beetles to help from

1642
01:09:12,899 --> 01:09:19,048
desiccation you know bring home a bean

1643
01:09:17,248 --> 01:09:20,368
leaf with spider mites on it which just

1644
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:22,229
reminded me of spider mites and

1645
01:09:20,368 --> 01:09:24,929
refrigerator I forgot about crap they're

1646
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:27,420
probably dead by now but bring home a

1647
01:09:24,929 --> 01:09:29,099
leaf with some spider mites on it and

1648
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:30,809
you know put in a petri dish and see how

1649
01:09:29,099 --> 01:09:34,769
long those might survive

1650
01:09:30,809 --> 01:09:37,619
not that long they really are I mean

1651
01:09:34,769 --> 01:09:39,569
they're hearty but they're not Hardy

1652
01:09:37,618 --> 01:09:40,498
when they don't have good environmental

1653
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:43,650
protection

1654
01:09:40,498 --> 01:09:45,420
I think plants Brie is more of an issue

1655
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:47,488
but geez my spider mites are not going

1656
01:09:45,420 --> 01:09:48,929
to go oh look I want to live in a straw

1657
01:09:47,488 --> 01:09:51,958
hay bale where there's no food source

1658
01:09:48,929 --> 01:09:53,069
for me they can't overwinter just go

1659
01:09:51,958 --> 01:09:54,298
dormant or anything like that I don't

1660
01:09:53,069 --> 01:09:55,709
know enough about their lifecycle

1661
01:09:54,298 --> 01:09:58,769
honestly I need to do a little research

1662
01:09:55,708 --> 01:10:01,260
well the to spot spider mites they for

1663
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:03,380
outside go into what's called diapause

1664
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:07,260
and they start turning more pumpkiny

1665
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:11,069
orangish in the fall and then they go

1666
01:10:07,260 --> 01:10:12,689
overwinter in that stage but again for

1667
01:10:11,069 --> 01:10:15,688
screenhouse you don't get those

1668
01:10:12,689 --> 01:10:18,090
conditions and you know with aphids a

1669
01:10:15,689 --> 01:10:21,389
Fitz feed on one plant but they

1670
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:23,760
overwinter on an alternate host so you

1671
01:10:21,389 --> 01:10:26,279
got to know your pests and you've got to

1672
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:31,019
understand its life cycle yeah you bring

1673
01:10:26,279 --> 01:10:33,149
up a fence so having a edible nursery on

1674
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:34,829
our property as well we have a lot of

1675
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:40,228
different plants and I always get a fits

1676
01:10:34,828 --> 01:10:42,658
on our nester ships every year and I as

1677
01:10:40,229 --> 01:10:44,909
it was explained to me the lifecycle of

1678
01:10:42,658 --> 01:10:48,478
an aphid part of it was that these ants

1679
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:51,388
will farm them as a way of getting more

1680
01:10:48,479 --> 01:10:52,199
of that the sugary substance I think you

1681
01:10:51,389 --> 01:10:54,389
had a name for it

1682
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:56,698
honeydew had the honeydew correct and

1683
01:10:54,389 --> 01:10:59,219
then I thought it was a predatory wasp

1684
01:10:56,698 --> 01:11:00,899
that was eating the aphids but I from

1685
01:10:59,219 --> 01:11:03,118
the talk I got the impression that was

1686
01:11:00,899 --> 01:11:07,078
actually wrong when you spoke about it

1687
01:11:03,118 --> 01:11:08,698
okay parasitic wasps predator it's a

1688
01:11:07,078 --> 01:11:11,049
parasitic wasp because we kind of break

1689
01:11:08,698 --> 01:11:12,669
down into predators and parasites or

1690
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:14,860
redditors tend to you know they're more

1691
01:11:12,670 --> 01:11:16,480
like lace wings and ladybird beetles

1692
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:18,279
that eat them where the parasites are

1693
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,529
parasites you know I'm sticking my egg

1694
01:11:18,279 --> 01:11:23,229
in you and I'm going to you know eat you

1695
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:26,800
from the inside out kind of thing so

1696
01:11:23,229 --> 01:11:30,069
with a foots there are many of those

1697
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:32,170
parasitic wasps available for sale but

1698
01:11:30,069 --> 01:11:35,618
you've got to get the right pair of

1699
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:37,300
sight for the right a food pest so you

1700
01:11:35,618 --> 01:11:39,729
have to know at aphid you're dealing

1701
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:42,969
with and then you have to see if there

1702
01:11:39,729 --> 01:11:45,638
is a commercially available a parasitic

1703
01:11:42,969 --> 01:11:48,880
wasp for it then get it and be able to

1704
01:11:45,639 --> 01:11:51,309
release it so would I be better off just

1705
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:53,679
hosing that down I I did notice the wasp

1706
01:11:51,309 --> 01:11:56,320
was landing on those things but it never

1707
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:58,899
really got a head I guess of my aphid

1708
01:11:56,319 --> 01:12:00,609
population and I would put diatomaceous

1709
01:11:58,899 --> 01:12:02,920
out earth out as a way of helping

1710
01:12:00,609 --> 01:12:05,529
control the ants which is another thing

1711
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:09,158
I wanted to talk to you about was de but

1712
01:12:05,529 --> 01:12:11,229
in terms of treating Athens is just

1713
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:13,929
water the best option there in terms of

1714
01:12:11,229 --> 01:12:15,848
just hosing them off the plants depends

1715
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:18,849
on what aphid species you have because

1716
01:12:15,849 --> 01:12:20,529
and I mean I'm black normally on

1717
01:12:18,849 --> 01:12:23,559
nasturtiums you'll see like black beanie

1718
01:12:20,529 --> 01:12:26,559
foods which is not something I've now

1719
01:12:23,559 --> 01:12:27,820
have heard of in cannabis yet I mean I

1720
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:30,010
don't want to say it could never be

1721
01:12:27,819 --> 01:12:33,130
there but you know it that's that's a

1722
01:12:30,010 --> 01:12:35,110
different thing it it also depends on

1723
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:37,420
your economic threshold you know plants

1724
01:12:35,109 --> 01:12:39,729
can have a low level of aphids and it's

1725
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:42,880
not the end of the world especially for

1726
01:12:39,729 --> 01:12:44,289
outdoor production or if you're growing

1727
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:45,969
nasturtiums just for their bloom

1728
01:12:44,289 --> 01:12:49,149
something like that I mean I grow

1729
01:12:45,969 --> 01:12:51,819
nasturtiums I let you know if it's get

1730
01:12:49,149 --> 01:12:53,618
on there and they don't for my landscape

1731
01:12:51,819 --> 01:12:55,479
it's not a problem because there's

1732
01:12:53,618 --> 01:12:59,289
enough predators that come in the

1733
01:12:55,479 --> 01:13:00,698
surfeit flies and you know ladybird

1734
01:12:59,289 --> 01:13:03,099
beetle are there's enough things that

1735
01:13:00,698 --> 01:13:06,219
feed on them but typically in a

1736
01:13:03,099 --> 01:13:10,960
greenhouse situation we don't really

1737
01:13:06,219 --> 01:13:12,730
want them in there I mean yes you can is

1738
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,649
a physical action of washing them off

1739
01:13:12,729 --> 01:13:16,058
with water but nasturtiums they tend to

1740
01:13:14,649 --> 01:13:18,189
be on the underside to leave and it's

1741
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:20,889
harder to get water coverage you gotta

1742
01:13:18,189 --> 01:13:23,738
you know the angled wand kind of to

1743
01:13:20,889 --> 01:13:25,029
spray underneath on there but in a

1744
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:26,348
greenhouse you know we

1745
01:13:25,029 --> 01:13:28,479
typically are using more of the

1746
01:13:26,349 --> 01:13:30,489
parasites to manage them because the

1747
01:13:28,479 --> 01:13:32,769
parasites can fly around the greenhouse

1748
01:13:30,488 --> 01:13:34,149
and find that one aphid that's tucked

1749
01:13:32,770 --> 01:13:36,070
away over in the corner that you might

1750
01:13:34,149 --> 01:13:38,049
have missed so that's the advantage to

1751
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:40,889
using the parasites is they can fly

1752
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:43,329
around and find them so when you mention

1753
01:13:40,889 --> 01:13:45,788
these different plants we talked about

1754
01:13:43,328 --> 01:13:47,889
trap plants and indicator plants and

1755
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:49,300
maybe pollinator plants what is there

1756
01:13:47,889 --> 01:13:51,578
anything that you would you would grow

1757
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:52,809
in your greenhouse if you had if you had

1758
01:13:51,578 --> 01:13:55,389
cannabis that you think would be

1759
01:13:52,809 --> 01:13:57,639
potentially beneficial in one of those

1760
01:13:55,389 --> 01:13:59,800
aspects depends on what I was growing in

1761
01:13:57,639 --> 01:14:01,538
my greenhouse and my woodcut what my

1762
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:04,119
cannabis grower or my you know a

1763
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:06,488
nasturtium farmer you know it let's say

1764
01:14:04,118 --> 01:14:09,788
your let's say your cannabis grower for

1765
01:14:06,488 --> 01:14:12,488
the sake of the podcast so I don't think

1766
01:14:09,788 --> 01:14:14,439
the aphid banker plant system that's

1767
01:14:12,488 --> 01:14:17,468
commercially available as we're as of

1768
01:14:14,439 --> 01:14:19,839
yet we haven't proved really a need for

1769
01:14:17,469 --> 01:14:21,788
that even though I've seen it I don't

1770
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:25,809
think it's worth the potential there

1771
01:14:21,788 --> 01:14:28,988
there may be potential with using the

1772
01:14:25,809 --> 01:14:31,239
purple flash pepper with aureus because

1773
01:14:28,988 --> 01:14:34,509
I've seen in outdoor cannabis production

1774
01:14:31,238 --> 01:14:36,638
aureus feeding on spider mites naturally

1775
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:39,039
in that situation so I know aureus will

1776
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:41,590
go to cannabis and feed on the spider

1777
01:14:39,038 --> 01:14:43,479
mites and the problem with aureus which

1778
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:46,750
is also called the minded fire bug you

1779
01:14:43,479 --> 01:14:49,299
have to have a pollen it for it to

1780
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:51,460
complete its life cycle and in most

1781
01:14:49,300 --> 01:14:53,230
greenhouses you don't have a pollen

1782
01:14:51,460 --> 01:14:55,569
source and so that's what this pepper

1783
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:59,468
program does is you grow the peppers and

1784
01:14:55,569 --> 01:15:02,049
it provides pollen so that the adults

1785
01:14:59,469 --> 01:15:04,029
can have pollen lay their eggs on those

1786
01:15:02,050 --> 01:15:05,619
pepper plants reproduce and then they'll

1787
01:15:04,029 --> 01:15:07,960
leave and then they'll go out into the

1788
01:15:05,618 --> 01:15:10,089
crop and look for things like thrips

1789
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:11,710
they'll also find things like spider

1790
01:15:10,090 --> 01:15:14,529
mites and other pests I've seen them

1791
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:17,288
even you know feed on foliar aphids and

1792
01:15:14,529 --> 01:15:19,179
they can help really suppress pest

1793
01:15:17,288 --> 01:15:21,969
levels now granted I am way

1794
01:15:19,179 --> 01:15:23,260
oversimplifying this this is not a I'm

1795
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:24,489
going to grow some peppers and just

1796
01:15:23,260 --> 01:15:26,800
throw them out there it is a

1797
01:15:24,488 --> 01:15:29,828
commitment-- you there's you know a

1798
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,619
strict regiment on how you do this the

1799
01:15:29,828 --> 01:15:34,029
timing and all kinds of stuff which we

1800
01:15:32,618 --> 01:15:37,569
don't have time to cover today but I

1801
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:38,859
think if any of the potential plants

1802
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:41,679
bankers

1803
01:15:38,859 --> 01:15:45,189
I think that's the one that might have

1804
01:15:41,679 --> 01:15:47,590
the most potential for cannabis but you

1805
01:15:45,189 --> 01:15:49,118
know we need to you know get trials set

1806
01:15:47,590 --> 01:15:51,010
up and see if it works

1807
01:15:49,118 --> 01:15:52,479
have you seen anything with cover crops

1808
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:54,940
with people running cover crops

1809
01:15:52,479 --> 01:15:58,718
underneath cannabis as a would that be a

1810
01:15:54,939 --> 01:16:01,118
potential detriment in terms of being a

1811
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:04,779
plant host for some of these pests

1812
01:16:01,118 --> 01:16:06,309
I bet inside or outside production you

1813
01:16:04,779 --> 01:16:08,380
know I've seen it in bold I've seen

1814
01:16:06,310 --> 01:16:10,420
mostly outdoor production with cover

1815
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:12,819
crops but I have seen guys running in

1816
01:16:10,420 --> 01:16:16,779
containers large containers or beds

1817
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:20,710
using cover crops as a living mulch well

1818
01:16:16,779 --> 01:16:23,439
outside yeah outside I would be you know

1819
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:24,609
you know they're doing it in big AG big

1820
01:16:23,439 --> 01:16:27,309
AG is doing it today and lots of

1821
01:16:24,609 --> 01:16:29,109
vegetables you see it in landscapes and

1822
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:31,090
stuff and it's basically providing you

1823
01:16:29,109 --> 01:16:34,569
know food resources for other

1824
01:16:31,090 --> 01:16:36,520
beneficials inside you better know what

1825
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:39,399
you're doing because again it could

1826
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:43,810
become a harbor for your pests as well

1827
01:16:39,399 --> 01:16:45,729
and that's why you just can't say oh I'm

1828
01:16:43,810 --> 01:16:47,409
just going to throw this plant in here

1829
01:16:45,729 --> 01:16:50,019
because you know could be an alternate

1830
01:16:47,408 --> 01:16:52,448
host for disease again I alternate host

1831
01:16:50,020 --> 01:16:55,300
for your pests I would be very leery

1832
01:16:52,448 --> 01:16:58,689
about doing something like that

1833
01:16:55,300 --> 01:17:01,090
indoors yeah you know and unless you you

1834
01:16:58,689 --> 01:17:03,129
know are really on top of it would the

1835
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:04,539
same be said for most mulches or even

1836
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:06,429
mulching with the plant leaves through

1837
01:17:04,539 --> 01:17:10,359
the families that are dead directly off

1838
01:17:06,429 --> 01:17:13,420
the plant I would not want to do that

1839
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:16,509
because if there's spider mite eggs on

1840
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:18,520
there other pests and if they can find

1841
01:17:16,510 --> 01:17:21,789
their way off there and go right back up

1842
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:25,659
onto the plant that's sanitation you

1843
01:17:21,789 --> 01:17:27,670
always want to get rid of any disease

1844
01:17:25,658 --> 01:17:29,319
plant material do not throw in a garbage

1845
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:31,569
can and let it sit in your greenhouse

1846
01:17:29,319 --> 01:17:34,118
for a day or two it has to be out of

1847
01:17:31,569 --> 01:17:37,000
that facility you've got to get it out

1848
01:17:34,118 --> 01:17:39,279
okay and I know that everything that

1849
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:42,719
you're saying is very general then a lot

1850
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:45,880
of the if we were to talk about specific

1851
01:17:42,719 --> 01:17:47,730
pests or specific beneficial insects

1852
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:50,739
they require a lot more knowledge than

1853
01:17:47,729 --> 01:17:52,269
you have time or energy to share today

1854
01:17:50,738 --> 01:17:55,000
on this podcast but

1855
01:17:52,270 --> 01:17:58,570
can we talk just briefly in just very

1856
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:59,859
general terms about some few major pest

1857
01:17:58,569 --> 01:18:01,750
we talked a little about spider mites

1858
01:17:59,859 --> 01:18:03,729
already but would you be able to cover a

1859
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:06,880
little bit about fungus naps

1860
01:18:03,729 --> 01:18:09,459
yeah fungus gnats used to be a big

1861
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:12,400
problem in greenhouse production but now

1862
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:14,140
that we have a steady supply of really

1863
01:18:12,399 --> 01:18:18,909
good quality beneficial nematodes it's

1864
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:20,920
not so much of an issue unless you're

1865
01:18:18,909 --> 01:18:22,510
growing in you know some of these what

1866
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:25,510
I'll call artificial media's and things

1867
01:18:22,510 --> 01:18:29,079
like rockwool nematodes really aren't

1868
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:32,230
crazy about being in that kind of

1869
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:34,539
environment I think it's a from my

1870
01:18:32,229 --> 01:18:38,109
experience it's easier to manage pests

1871
01:18:34,539 --> 01:18:40,630
when you're growing in you know cocoa or

1872
01:18:38,109 --> 01:18:42,849
you know what we'd call you know a

1873
01:18:40,630 --> 01:18:45,819
potting mix I know

1874
01:18:42,850 --> 01:18:47,620
for ease of growing a lot of people are

1875
01:18:45,819 --> 01:18:51,299
moving to these you know artificial

1876
01:18:47,619 --> 01:18:55,180
medias but it's it's harder to manage

1877
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:56,949
the the pests there with the biocontrol

1878
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:59,409
agents because they don't really like

1879
01:18:56,949 --> 01:19:03,819
being in that artificial environment now

1880
01:18:59,409 --> 01:19:06,250
granted from a chemical standpoint you

1881
01:19:03,819 --> 01:19:07,719
know it for the states that you know and

1882
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:10,359
you got a look at your state and see

1883
01:19:07,720 --> 01:19:15,310
what you can do and that is it but you

1884
01:19:10,359 --> 01:19:17,710
know BT Bacillus thuringiensis Israeli

1885
01:19:15,310 --> 01:19:19,330
incest and that's the strand this is

1886
01:19:17,710 --> 01:19:21,430
where I see a lot of people making

1887
01:19:19,329 --> 01:19:23,409
mistakes there's multiple strains of BTS

1888
01:19:21,430 --> 01:19:26,829
and you've got to have the strain for

1889
01:19:23,409 --> 01:19:31,750
flies which is Israeli incest that can

1890
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:34,600
still work for fly larvae management it

1891
01:19:31,750 --> 01:19:36,369
has to be ingested by the Flies but we

1892
01:19:34,600 --> 01:19:38,950
do have resistant populations out there

1893
01:19:36,369 --> 01:19:42,159
because it's been used so much that you

1894
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:44,529
know it may not work but it is something

1895
01:19:42,159 --> 01:19:46,949
that does have to be ingested and

1896
01:19:44,529 --> 01:19:49,899
typically you know you need to really

1897
01:19:46,949 --> 01:19:51,819
wait about a week before you're going to

1898
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:53,649
see results you'll see your results on

1899
01:19:51,819 --> 01:19:55,539
your sticky cards because you change

1900
01:19:53,649 --> 01:19:57,429
your sticky cards every Monday and you

1901
01:19:55,539 --> 01:19:59,649
date them you don't leave them out for

1902
01:19:57,430 --> 01:20:02,020
two three and four weeks so when I show

1903
01:19:59,649 --> 01:20:05,199
up we have no idea what's going on and

1904
01:20:02,020 --> 01:20:05,740
you're buying good quality sticky cards

1905
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:09,039
from

1906
01:20:05,739 --> 01:20:11,769
companies like bio best has nice sticky

1907
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:13,989
cards Kolbert has nice sticky cards some

1908
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:16,090
really good quality products out there

1909
01:20:13,989 --> 01:20:18,429
I'm seeing the cannabis growers use a

1910
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:22,029
lot of these they look like them they're

1911
01:20:18,430 --> 01:20:24,909
folded and you peel them back I like the

1912
01:20:22,029 --> 01:20:27,250
the sticky cards that have paper on each

1913
01:20:24,909 --> 01:20:29,019
side because you can peel it off one

1914
01:20:27,250 --> 01:20:30,369
week and then the next week you can peel

1915
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:32,230
off the other side and move that paper

1916
01:20:30,369 --> 01:20:34,500
back to the other side so you can't get

1917
01:20:32,229 --> 01:20:36,849
two weeks out of one sticky card and

1918
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:38,649
positioning is important depending on

1919
01:20:36,850 --> 01:20:42,520
what pest you're trying to target I mean

1920
01:20:38,649 --> 01:20:45,339
sticky cards that's like a whole you

1921
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:48,490
know discussion in itself but for fungus

1922
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:51,670
gnats that's really critical to know

1923
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:53,319
what your population is and also when

1924
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,850
you get you can get large sticky ribbons

1925
01:20:53,319 --> 01:20:56,170
that come on rolls now and they'll

1926
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:57,550
they'll string them up through the

1927
01:20:56,170 --> 01:21:00,460
greenhouses for what's called mass

1928
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:03,579
trapping and that's to remove a lot of

1929
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:07,180
the adults and we do know that fungus

1930
01:21:03,579 --> 01:21:10,539
net larvae do feed on the roots of

1931
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:13,690
plants and can convector plant diseases

1932
01:21:10,539 --> 01:21:14,890
so that's why managing them and really

1933
01:21:13,689 --> 01:21:17,109
getting their numbers down is really

1934
01:21:14,890 --> 01:21:19,960
important now I have a friend who took

1935
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:21,849
his stinky cards and put them rather

1936
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:23,920
than being vertically put them

1937
01:21:21,850 --> 01:21:25,720
horizontal beneath right beneath the

1938
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:27,069
canopy and that's how he runs him in his

1939
01:21:25,720 --> 01:21:28,780
room have you seen anyone else doing

1940
01:21:27,069 --> 01:21:31,619
that as a way of catching things going

1941
01:21:28,779 --> 01:21:35,229
up and down well that's that's just

1942
01:21:31,619 --> 01:21:39,039
catching by luck as they you know come

1943
01:21:35,229 --> 01:21:40,959
up the way insects are trapped on sticky

1944
01:21:39,039 --> 01:21:42,939
cards is by the light reflecting off of

1945
01:21:40,960 --> 01:21:45,039
them and so there's lots of discussion

1946
01:21:42,939 --> 01:21:48,699
on outdoor productions which way you

1947
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:51,310
position them and everything but you can

1948
01:21:48,699 --> 01:21:54,039
do that I still like the the horizontal

1949
01:21:51,310 --> 01:21:56,950
positioning near the soil surface that

1950
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:59,079
will attract them up but again lighting

1951
01:21:56,949 --> 01:22:01,329
is a big part of it so would they get

1952
01:21:59,079 --> 01:22:03,279
more light because the top side would be

1953
01:22:01,329 --> 01:22:04,960
completely exposed to light it'd be a

1954
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:08,710
flat surface and then the bottom side

1955
01:22:04,960 --> 01:22:10,329
would be completely shaded I guess by

1956
01:22:08,710 --> 01:22:12,189
catching things that are flying up and

1957
01:22:10,329 --> 01:22:12,760
then the other thing seeing the light on

1958
01:22:12,189 --> 01:22:15,669
the top

1959
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:16,630
give it up describing it possible yeah I

1960
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,369
know I know what you're talking about

1961
01:22:16,630 --> 01:22:18,949
I've seen like interior scapes did they

1962
01:22:18,369 --> 01:22:21,260
cut them in didn't

1963
01:22:18,949 --> 01:22:25,099
narrow strips to kind of hide them in

1964
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:28,550
plant material but hey this is where you

1965
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:31,850
could do a trial do you know some down

1966
01:22:28,550 --> 01:22:34,789
some up and see what you know works best

1967
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:37,130
for you in your growing facility the way

1968
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:38,630
your lighting is positioned okay yeah

1969
01:22:37,130 --> 01:22:40,970
see what you catch sure that would be a

1970
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:43,670
really easy thing to try and compare and

1971
01:22:40,970 --> 01:22:45,140
check out so that was a little bit on

1972
01:22:43,670 --> 01:22:48,279
fungus gnats can we talk a little bit

1973
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:50,539
about Roode a Fitz - just a quick brief

1974
01:22:48,279 --> 01:22:55,039
one-minute thing on rue David's one

1975
01:22:50,539 --> 01:22:57,350
minute okay well this is the rue David

1976
01:22:55,039 --> 01:23:00,619
that the cannabis industry is dealing

1977
01:22:57,350 --> 01:23:03,620
with from what I've seen it's also found

1978
01:23:00,619 --> 01:23:06,769
in the ornamental industry - and has a

1979
01:23:03,619 --> 01:23:10,340
pretty wide host range the problem is

1980
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:11,960
again if you are on a system where you

1981
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:14,420
know you overhead irrigate and they can

1982
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,609
flow out the bottoms of the holes and

1983
01:23:14,420 --> 01:23:19,279
the pots or if you're an ebb and flood

1984
01:23:16,609 --> 01:23:22,819
system you just keep spreading them

1985
01:23:19,279 --> 01:23:25,069
around through your system and I had a

1986
01:23:22,819 --> 01:23:28,789
lettuce grower that had a different

1987
01:23:25,069 --> 01:23:31,130
species but still a rudy fit in an NF t

1988
01:23:28,789 --> 01:23:33,979
system and they shut it down scrubbed

1989
01:23:31,130 --> 01:23:35,659
everything put it back together started

1990
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:39,619
from seed again and they were back

1991
01:23:35,659 --> 01:23:41,239
because all it takes is missing one and

1992
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:44,569
this is what's very dangerous about

1993
01:23:41,239 --> 01:23:48,529
bringing in plants with soil because

1994
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:51,409
it's easy to look on leaves it's harder

1995
01:23:48,529 --> 01:23:53,929
to find pests in the soil and so that's

1996
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:58,939
how these rude aphids are spreading

1997
01:23:53,930 --> 01:24:00,920
around is through routed plugs so do you

1998
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:02,839
have any quick recommendations for

1999
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,690
people that they could look into if they

2000
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:09,170
are dealing with Rou defense so if you

2001
01:24:05,689 --> 01:24:12,250
are not in a state that prohibits but

2002
01:24:09,170 --> 01:24:16,069
Anna Gardner my cotrol wettable powder

2003
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:18,979
that works extremely well we know that

2004
01:24:16,069 --> 01:24:22,039
there's science on that there's there's

2005
01:24:18,979 --> 01:24:24,319
bio works has a sheet how to deal with

2006
01:24:22,039 --> 01:24:26,689
rude aphids using botanic garden but

2007
01:24:24,319 --> 01:24:28,909
unfortunately a gun certain states have

2008
01:24:26,689 --> 01:24:31,009
disallowed it which is it's very

2009
01:24:28,909 --> 01:24:32,599
frustrating because you know we do have

2010
01:24:31,010 --> 01:24:35,840
a good option out

2011
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:39,020
err for managing them there has been I

2012
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:42,350
know some people are recommending using

2013
01:24:39,020 --> 01:24:45,500
some of the soil to hypo aspis miles

2014
01:24:42,350 --> 01:24:49,700
which is now strahle elapses I just have

2015
01:24:45,500 --> 01:24:51,770
not seen it really suppress enough or

2016
01:24:49,699 --> 01:24:54,079
control route if it's again there is a

2017
01:24:51,770 --> 01:24:57,800
difference between oh if I put it in a

2018
01:24:54,079 --> 01:25:00,710
petri dish can it snack on a newly you

2019
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:05,420
know birthed baby a fit and being able

2020
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:07,550
to control a pest and people are taking

2021
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:09,800
what they've seen in a petri dish on a

2022
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:12,199
small scale and extrapolating it to

2023
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:13,640
control and and it just doesn't work

2024
01:25:12,199 --> 01:25:17,000
that way

2025
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:19,130
same thing with Rove beetles I do think

2026
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:24,380
the roe beetles do predate some on them

2027
01:25:19,130 --> 01:25:27,159
but I've just not seen it I get to the

2028
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:31,520
level where I would feel comfortable

2029
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:34,460
still with it at and just you know we

2030
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:36,710
are setting up some trial work looking

2031
01:25:34,460 --> 01:25:38,840
at nematodes but again if you're in a

2032
01:25:36,710 --> 01:25:40,520
rock wall system it's much more

2033
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,100
difficult for those nematodes to be able

2034
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,750
to hold on because nematodes are

2035
01:25:43,100 --> 01:25:48,590
actually semi-aquatic and they need to

2036
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:50,779
be able to move on a water film and they

2037
01:25:48,590 --> 01:25:54,529
move extremely well and you know

2038
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:56,689
traditional you know media and in that

2039
01:25:54,529 --> 01:25:59,989
situation if they could come in contact

2040
01:25:56,689 --> 01:26:03,109
with the aphid possibly it could kill it

2041
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:05,989
but we don't know yet if nematodes truly

2042
01:26:03,109 --> 01:26:08,089
can do that and that's something we're

2043
01:26:05,989 --> 01:26:11,539
setting up a trial right now on oh

2044
01:26:08,090 --> 01:26:13,460
that's great that's great and I would be

2045
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:16,609
remiss that if I didn't at least bring

2046
01:26:13,460 --> 01:26:17,930
up broad mites and Russert mites briefly

2047
01:26:16,609 --> 01:26:19,839
with you as well

2048
01:26:17,930 --> 01:26:21,860
just so just so I can avoid a bunch of

2049
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:26,480
angry emails would you be able to touch

2050
01:26:21,859 --> 01:26:27,859
on those - sure um broad mites in and I

2051
01:26:26,479 --> 01:26:29,059
hate to keep going back to ornamentals

2052
01:26:27,859 --> 01:26:31,670
but you know what we're seeing in

2053
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:34,160
ornamentals can affect vegetable

2054
01:26:31,670 --> 01:26:35,539
production and cannabis this was the

2055
01:26:34,159 --> 01:26:38,239
worst year abroad mites

2056
01:26:35,539 --> 01:26:43,489
I've ever seen in my life in greenhouses

2057
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:46,460
and ornamentals and it was it was pretty

2058
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:48,289
epic I think it was one

2059
01:26:46,460 --> 01:26:49,930
particular variety of plant that

2060
01:26:48,289 --> 01:26:52,819
cuttings were coming in from offshore

2061
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:54,980
it's the same way cannabis is getting it

2062
01:26:52,819 --> 01:26:57,289
you bring your cuttings in or even your

2063
01:26:54,979 --> 01:27:01,159
rooted cuttings and the pest is at such

2064
01:26:57,289 --> 01:27:03,890
a low level it's not detectable and you

2065
01:27:01,159 --> 01:27:05,720
you know you pot them up or you see your

2066
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:08,000
cuttings under a mist system and the

2067
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:11,180
level stays at a dull roar a dull roar

2068
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:13,369
and then all of a sudden turn around and

2069
01:27:11,180 --> 01:27:17,360
you've got a lot of deformed growth and

2070
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:19,849
I think they have spread the broad might

2071
01:27:17,359 --> 01:27:24,439
spread from that one initial plant on to

2072
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:27,350
lots of other crops so you know if you

2073
01:27:24,439 --> 01:27:29,299
bought you know planted hanging baskets

2074
01:27:27,350 --> 01:27:30,650
and brought them into your cannabis

2075
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:31,909
operation there's a chance you could

2076
01:27:30,649 --> 01:27:35,960
spread the broad might that way because

2077
01:27:31,909 --> 01:27:39,439
broad might has many many many hosts and

2078
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:43,250
it's not like where the cannabis Russert

2079
01:27:39,439 --> 01:27:45,679
might has one host it's it's it's very

2080
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:48,640
it's much more what we call cosmopolitan

2081
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:52,159
it's around in lots of different places

2082
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:55,970
from my experience this year we know we

2083
01:27:52,159 --> 01:27:58,099
can manage broad might with a preventive

2084
01:27:55,970 --> 01:28:00,740
program and that's one thing people are

2085
01:27:58,100 --> 01:28:03,320
missing you can't contact me when your

2086
01:28:00,739 --> 01:28:06,829
plants are webbed over you can't contact

2087
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:08,689
me when you have 10,000 you know him

2088
01:28:06,829 --> 01:28:09,710
present mites on a leaf and expect me to

2089
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:12,769
be able to fix it

2090
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:15,050
this is all about prevention the second

2091
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:17,120
you bring a cutting in the second you

2092
01:28:15,050 --> 01:28:18,890
stick it the second you pot it I would

2093
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:22,069
be putting predatory mites out on these

2094
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:24,320
plants and assuming you're going to have

2095
01:28:22,069 --> 01:28:28,519
the problem if you do a preventive

2096
01:28:24,319 --> 01:28:31,309
program it's a lot cheaper than trying

2097
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:33,470
to fix a problem and it's the same thing

2098
01:28:31,310 --> 01:28:34,880
with a hemp Russert mite which is moving

2099
01:28:33,470 --> 01:28:38,119
around through the industries we

2100
01:28:34,880 --> 01:28:41,930
discussed before so easily and it is

2101
01:28:38,119 --> 01:28:43,819
just spreading and spreading and just

2102
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:47,560
assume you're going to end up with it

2103
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:51,500
and so starting a preventive program

2104
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:53,539
early if you go in too many ornamental

2105
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:55,369
operations today when they stick their

2106
01:28:53,539 --> 01:28:58,039
cutting they start on predatory mites

2107
01:28:55,369 --> 01:28:59,630
right then their main nemesis is Western

2108
01:28:58,039 --> 01:29:01,789
flower thrips they

2109
01:28:59,630 --> 01:29:06,109
every year and it's worth the investment

2110
01:29:01,789 --> 01:29:08,630
to treat in propagation over trying to

2111
01:29:06,109 --> 01:29:09,979
cure it in finished product because when

2112
01:29:08,630 --> 01:29:12,020
you have plants that are small and

2113
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:14,178
compact together it's really easy and

2114
01:29:12,020 --> 01:29:16,520
inexpensive to use the predatory mites

2115
01:29:14,179 --> 01:29:19,069
when you've got bigger larger plants

2116
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:20,690
it's much harder to treat and the

2117
01:29:19,069 --> 01:29:22,698
cannabis industry is being too reactive

2118
01:29:20,689 --> 01:29:26,569
they've got to be more pro-reactive

2119
01:29:22,698 --> 01:29:29,000
and as far as which species it depends

2120
01:29:26,569 --> 01:29:31,399
are you an outdoor grow in Oregon are

2121
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:33,829
you going in a greenhouse in you know

2122
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:36,500
Oregon are you growing in a warehouse in

2123
01:29:33,829 --> 01:29:39,619
Florida you know you have to look at

2124
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:42,050
your different growing conditions what

2125
01:29:39,619 --> 01:29:45,679
your pests complex is to be able to get

2126
01:29:42,050 --> 01:29:47,449
the right predatory mite for what you

2127
01:29:45,679 --> 01:29:49,760
need to do and then you've got to look

2128
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:51,678
at is this ash a right is a hanging sash

2129
01:29:49,760 --> 01:29:53,420
a right is a sashay on a stick right do

2130
01:29:51,679 --> 01:29:54,469
you want loose product oh but you know

2131
01:29:53,420 --> 01:29:56,389
loose products you have problems

2132
01:29:54,469 --> 01:30:00,350
sprinkling on the leaf so you may need

2133
01:29:56,389 --> 01:30:02,270
other release system so it I don't make

2134
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:04,789
it too complicated but this is why you

2135
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:07,730
need to work with somebody that knows

2136
01:30:04,789 --> 01:30:11,539
what they're doing and unfortunately

2137
01:30:07,729 --> 01:30:14,000
there's not many people that do and

2138
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:15,139
that's that's the challenge today

2139
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,658
there's a lot of people that will say

2140
01:30:15,139 --> 01:30:20,239
they know and I wish I could clone

2141
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:22,939
myself and you know every state could

2142
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:24,948
have a dozen Susanne's to work but it

2143
01:30:22,939 --> 01:30:27,469
just I can't do that

2144
01:30:24,948 --> 01:30:30,799
technology yet but you gotta get with

2145
01:30:27,469 --> 01:30:33,139
something i somebody sent me a thing

2146
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:35,840
saying you know that someone was

2147
01:30:33,139 --> 01:30:42,469
recommending a to camaris or spider mite

2148
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:45,110
control that no no no I mean just no and

2149
01:30:42,469 --> 01:30:46,819
I've seen that somebody is making that

2150
01:30:45,109 --> 01:30:49,429
recommendations at selling biocontrol

2151
01:30:46,819 --> 01:30:53,059
agents to growing operations and that's

2152
01:30:49,429 --> 01:30:55,750
not that's that no no just it's bad

2153
01:30:53,060 --> 01:30:57,889
recommendation so just to kind of

2154
01:30:55,750 --> 01:31:01,010
summarize what we talked about today

2155
01:30:57,889 --> 01:31:03,079
these bio controls really do work are

2156
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:05,719
effective but they require a lot of

2157
01:31:03,079 --> 01:31:07,670
knowledge and every situation is

2158
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:11,430
different every growing environment and

2159
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:14,369
every every pest requires

2160
01:31:11,430 --> 01:31:17,820
very specific controls and knowledge and

2161
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:19,710
so as a takeaway I guess for growers

2162
01:31:17,819 --> 01:31:22,590
what I want to say is I don't want to

2163
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:24,750
discourage people from using bio

2164
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,940
controls we've established that it's

2165
01:31:24,750 --> 01:31:28,079
fairly complicated but there are

2166
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,460
resources out there

2167
01:31:28,079 --> 01:31:32,159
you mentioned the insector ease and I'll

2168
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:35,609
put up a list of those insector ease it

2169
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:37,439
on the podcast page is there anything

2170
01:31:35,609 --> 01:31:37,859
else you'd like to share for people

2171
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:40,229
though

2172
01:31:37,859 --> 01:31:44,699
just in general regarding bio controls

2173
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:47,159
yes I think with the way regulation is

2174
01:31:44,699 --> 01:31:49,349
going and pesticide testing is going I

2175
01:31:47,159 --> 01:31:51,389
think that the cannabis industry is

2176
01:31:49,350 --> 01:31:54,750
going to be forced more heavily into

2177
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:57,930
more bio control options I think it was

2178
01:31:54,750 --> 01:32:02,069
Delaware there's no pesticides allowed

2179
01:31:57,930 --> 01:32:04,980
at all on cannabis production I'm a

2180
01:32:02,069 --> 01:32:06,329
little nervous about California opening

2181
01:32:04,979 --> 01:32:07,919
up next year I actually think we're

2182
01:32:06,329 --> 01:32:11,159
going to have shortages of biocontrol

2183
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:12,930
agents because even now there are some

2184
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:15,569
issues with being able to get product

2185
01:32:12,930 --> 01:32:17,100
because the demand for the use of

2186
01:32:15,569 --> 01:32:19,109
biocontrol agents and greenhouse

2187
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:21,510
vegetables and ornamentals is just

2188
01:32:19,109 --> 01:32:24,509
skyrocketing and that's due to again

2189
01:32:21,510 --> 01:32:26,610
they're not really able to manage the

2190
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:28,800
pests with even the pesticide products

2191
01:32:26,609 --> 01:32:30,479
they have and you know fine give the

2192
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:33,060
cannabis industry all these chemicals

2193
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:35,129
that the other guys have they'll just

2194
01:32:33,060 --> 01:32:36,510
develop resistance to them also and then

2195
01:32:35,130 --> 01:32:38,400
you're going to be right back where you

2196
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:40,650
started from where you're going to have

2197
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:42,960
to be looking at bio control and some of

2198
01:32:40,649 --> 01:32:46,769
these bio rational products to be able

2199
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:51,510
to manage your pests I will say that how

2200
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:54,840
do why do bio controls not work it can

2201
01:32:51,510 --> 01:32:56,730
be again wrong product so you know you

2202
01:32:54,840 --> 01:32:58,110
don't know truly what your pest is and

2203
01:32:56,729 --> 01:33:01,229
you're releasing the wrong bio control

2204
01:32:58,109 --> 01:33:02,909
agent pesticide residue you've sprayed

2205
01:33:01,229 --> 01:33:04,649
something on your plant that can be

2206
01:33:02,909 --> 01:33:06,539
toxic and just because it's an

2207
01:33:04,649 --> 01:33:09,239
unrealistic product does not mean that

2208
01:33:06,539 --> 01:33:11,369
it is safe with biocontrol agents you

2209
01:33:09,239 --> 01:33:14,880
need to you know understand chemical

2210
01:33:11,369 --> 01:33:18,090
interactions and then product quality

2211
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,970
and again it's getting product to you in

2212
01:33:18,090 --> 01:33:21,840
a timely manner that's viable and and

2213
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:24,510
ready to eat

2214
01:33:21,840 --> 01:33:25,260
and I think that's you know a very

2215
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:28,920
important

2216
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:30,989
part of it too but I've seen some of the

2217
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:34,670
I caught like to call them nozzle head

2218
01:33:30,988 --> 01:33:37,888
some of the most adamant nozzle head

2219
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:40,109
people out there that would never use

2220
01:33:37,889 --> 01:33:43,050
biocontrol are now using biocontrol

2221
01:33:40,109 --> 01:33:44,158
because they realize they have to have

2222
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:46,829
this as part of their pest management

2223
01:33:44,158 --> 01:33:48,359
program not saying pesticides are bad

2224
01:33:46,828 --> 01:33:50,639
I'm not saying you're not going to have

2225
01:33:48,359 --> 01:33:52,948
to spray if use bios and bios are not

2226
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:56,969
right for every single growing situation

2227
01:33:52,948 --> 01:33:59,848
but for the things we know they can do

2228
01:33:56,969 --> 01:34:02,368
you know I think that there's there's

2229
01:33:59,849 --> 01:34:03,960
it's a really really good tool to have

2230
01:34:02,368 --> 01:34:05,969
as long as you use them right and

2231
01:34:03,960 --> 01:34:07,859
understand what you're doing and again I

2232
01:34:05,969 --> 01:34:09,989
can't put you know big bold font

2233
01:34:07,859 --> 01:34:13,380
underline flashing letters you've got to

2234
01:34:09,988 --> 01:34:16,259
work with somebody that knows what what

2235
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:17,699
they're doing and you know I don't think

2236
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:19,590
there's anything wrong with somebody

2237
01:34:17,698 --> 01:34:21,538
coming in and you know they want to work

2238
01:34:19,590 --> 01:34:23,400
with you you know ask them what their

2239
01:34:21,538 --> 01:34:25,800
qualifications are how long have they

2240
01:34:23,399 --> 01:34:29,638
been doing this you know what makes them

2241
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:31,619
qualified because again I've seen a lot

2242
01:34:29,639 --> 01:34:34,679
of people a lot of growers unfortunately

2243
01:34:31,618 --> 01:34:37,139
get bad information from people who you

2244
01:34:34,679 --> 01:34:39,679
know intentions good or not are not

2245
01:34:37,139 --> 01:34:42,260
providing them good quality information

2246
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:44,340
yeah and I would like to see people from

2247
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,480
outside of just the cannabis industry

2248
01:34:44,340 --> 01:34:48,360
that are making these recommendations

2249
01:34:45,479 --> 01:34:50,279
people that have experience in like you

2250
01:34:48,359 --> 01:34:53,098
mentioned working with larger ornamental

2251
01:34:50,279 --> 01:34:56,670
greenhouses and in egg and things like

2252
01:34:53,099 --> 01:34:58,949
that on the on the entomology side yeah

2253
01:34:56,670 --> 01:35:02,489
the one thing I tell cannabis people all

2254
01:34:58,948 --> 01:35:04,259
the time is so poinsettias greenhouse

2255
01:35:02,488 --> 01:35:06,868
growers don't make money off of selling

2256
01:35:04,260 --> 01:35:09,389
poinsettias it's basically a way to keep

2257
01:35:06,868 --> 01:35:11,038
all their employees working through you

2258
01:35:09,389 --> 01:35:11,969
know the winter months and keep

2259
01:35:11,038 --> 01:35:16,288
everything going

2260
01:35:11,969 --> 01:35:20,069
if a ornamental person uses a product on

2261
01:35:16,288 --> 01:35:22,198
a poinsettia you know it has to work and

2262
01:35:20,069 --> 01:35:24,210
be a good product because a poinsettia

2263
01:35:22,198 --> 01:35:27,029
grower is not going to spend two cents

2264
01:35:24,210 --> 01:35:30,599
more for plant for a plant if it doesn't

2265
01:35:27,029 --> 01:35:33,420
work because they can't afford to use

2266
01:35:30,599 --> 01:35:36,179
products that do not work because

2267
01:35:33,420 --> 01:35:38,828
there's almost no if minimal profit

2268
01:35:36,179 --> 01:35:40,359
margin on things like poinsettias so

2269
01:35:38,828 --> 01:35:42,759
so when you look at what points edea

2270
01:35:40,359 --> 01:35:45,789
growers use these you know Bettina garde

2271
01:35:42,760 --> 01:35:47,260
they use root shield I've even had some

2272
01:35:45,788 --> 01:35:50,168
of them using some of the horticultural

2273
01:35:47,260 --> 01:35:53,769
oils we're using predatory mites we're

2274
01:35:50,168 --> 01:35:55,958
using parasites now granted some people

2275
01:35:53,769 --> 01:35:59,109
are still using traditional chemistry's

2276
01:35:55,958 --> 01:36:00,698
with a solid rotation program but many

2277
01:35:59,109 --> 01:36:03,219
of the ornamental growers are being

2278
01:36:00,698 --> 01:36:06,938
forced out of using the Neo Nick

2279
01:36:03,219 --> 01:36:09,458
insecticides which that pressures coming

2280
01:36:06,939 --> 01:36:11,530
from the big-box retailers that are not

2281
01:36:09,458 --> 01:36:13,418
allowing growers to use the Neo Nick so

2282
01:36:11,529 --> 01:36:14,858
they are losing that whole group of

2283
01:36:13,418 --> 01:36:17,078
chemistry's to be able to use which

2284
01:36:14,859 --> 01:36:18,789
poinsettias growers have relied on so

2285
01:36:17,078 --> 01:36:20,228
heavily so they're looking at these

2286
01:36:18,788 --> 01:36:22,179
other replacements and they're actually

2287
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:23,260
going into using a fair amount of

2288
01:36:22,179 --> 01:36:24,519
biocontrol

2289
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:26,949
options not saying they're never

2290
01:36:24,519 --> 01:36:30,369
spraying but you know these biocontrol

2291
01:36:26,948 --> 01:36:32,408
options are working for them and again

2292
01:36:30,368 --> 01:36:35,408
they don't have much wiggle room on a

2293
01:36:32,408 --> 01:36:37,388
plant as far as pricing yeah you know I

2294
01:36:35,408 --> 01:36:39,338
really think bow controls are that are

2295
01:36:37,389 --> 01:36:40,868
the future of the cannabis industry for

2296
01:36:39,338 --> 01:36:43,479
all the reasons you mentioned the the

2297
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:46,538
tested ice pesticide resistant issues

2298
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:48,639
the worker safety I think public

2299
01:36:46,538 --> 01:36:50,559
pressure is going to come in as people

2300
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:54,489
learn more and more about the pesticides

2301
01:36:50,559 --> 01:36:55,989
that are being used and they really do

2302
01:36:54,488 --> 01:36:57,998
work especially when we're talking about

2303
01:36:55,988 --> 01:37:00,148
the mono cropping that's going on

2304
01:36:57,998 --> 01:37:03,538
obviously in the cannabis industry and

2305
01:37:00,149 --> 01:37:07,300
the fact that these large-scale

2306
01:37:03,538 --> 01:37:08,648
horticultural growers are using bio

2307
01:37:07,300 --> 01:37:10,869
controls like you mentioned really

2308
01:37:08,649 --> 01:37:13,359
speaks volumes because they don't have

2309
01:37:10,868 --> 01:37:15,429
the profit margins that a lot of people

2310
01:37:13,359 --> 01:37:17,320
do in cannabis they have to be really

2311
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:18,939
smart with their money so like you

2312
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:20,558
mentioned I really do think this is the

2313
01:37:18,939 --> 01:37:22,959
future and I hope that there will be

2314
01:37:20,559 --> 01:37:26,260
more consultants available down the road

2315
01:37:22,958 --> 01:37:28,269
as this industry blossoms so yeah I

2316
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:30,789
think more people will get more

2317
01:37:28,269 --> 01:37:33,579
experience under their belt I just have

2318
01:37:30,788 --> 01:37:35,228
to be really lucky I just I got in like

2319
01:37:33,578 --> 01:37:38,049
I don't want to say ground level I got

2320
01:37:35,229 --> 01:37:40,059
in it you know sub-basement level to

2321
01:37:38,050 --> 01:37:42,788
this you know when bio control was

2322
01:37:40,059 --> 01:37:47,498
really uncool nobody was interested in

2323
01:37:42,788 --> 01:37:49,898
it and I just really was and you know I

2324
01:37:47,498 --> 01:37:52,069
felt this was the way the industry is

2325
01:37:49,899 --> 01:37:54,020
going to go because of you

2326
01:37:52,069 --> 01:37:56,539
just look at you know the pesticide

2327
01:37:54,020 --> 01:37:59,930
treadmill that you know people get on

2328
01:37:56,539 --> 01:38:02,060
and resistance issues you're going to

2329
01:37:59,930 --> 01:38:05,659
see more companies coming to the United

2330
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:07,520
States bringing products in you look at

2331
01:38:05,659 --> 01:38:09,439
a company like beneficial insectary

2332
01:38:07,520 --> 01:38:12,500
they're based in California they've

2333
01:38:09,439 --> 01:38:15,559
really expanded their production violine

2334
01:38:12,500 --> 01:38:17,600
in California also they produce per

2335
01:38:15,560 --> 01:38:19,520
symbolist they are as far as I'm

2336
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:22,280
concerned the best producer APRA

2337
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:25,130
symbolist hands down and you can order

2338
01:38:22,279 --> 01:38:27,409
the Priscilla's right from them at the

2339
01:38:25,130 --> 01:38:28,640
insector e there and especially if

2340
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:30,079
you're on the west coast I mean they

2341
01:38:28,640 --> 01:38:32,510
bottle in the morning and you get it by

2342
01:38:30,079 --> 01:38:34,550
next morning I mean how how can you you

2343
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:37,730
know beat that on that kind of product

2344
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:39,199
but they're working on becoming more

2345
01:38:37,729 --> 01:38:41,779
efficient at production so they have

2346
01:38:39,199 --> 01:38:46,609
more product available you know there's

2347
01:38:41,779 --> 01:38:48,710
there's more things happening but it's

2348
01:38:46,609 --> 01:38:50,719
just unless you're dialed into the

2349
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:53,630
biocontrol industry it's hard to know

2350
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:55,130
everything that's going on in it and

2351
01:38:53,630 --> 01:38:58,400
unfortunately we're a very very small

2352
01:38:55,130 --> 01:39:01,880
group there's just not a lot of us in

2353
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:03,139
the biocontrol industry so yeah well

2354
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:05,090
thank you again for your time today I

2355
01:39:03,140 --> 01:39:06,700
know you're busy and I I don't want to

2356
01:39:05,090 --> 01:39:09,170
take up too much more of your time so

2357
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:11,659
thank you again and I really appreciate

2358
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:13,970
this and I look forward to seeing you

2359
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:16,460
hopefully at another trade show we're

2360
01:39:13,970 --> 01:39:18,409
talking in your future yes well and

2361
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:20,659
thanks for helping having me and I'm

2362
01:39:18,409 --> 01:39:24,920
going to give myself one shameless plug

2363
01:39:20,659 --> 01:39:28,430
just so you know in March I am working

2364
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:29,480
on organizing right now a we're not sure

2365
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:33,010
if it's going to be a half-day I'm

2366
01:39:29,479 --> 01:39:37,309
trying to pull for a full day biocontrol

2367
01:39:33,010 --> 01:39:38,810
cannabis workshop and it's a they

2368
01:39:37,310 --> 01:39:41,539
haven't we haven't figured out a date

2369
01:39:38,810 --> 01:39:42,830
yet but it's going to be the early part

2370
01:39:41,539 --> 01:39:45,470
of March and it's going to be in San

2371
01:39:42,829 --> 01:39:47,750
Diego it looks like and we're still

2372
01:39:45,470 --> 01:39:51,980
trying to get that all together but I

2373
01:39:47,750 --> 01:39:53,329
think that it's something that if you

2374
01:39:51,979 --> 01:39:55,250
spend a day with me I'm going to make

2375
01:39:53,329 --> 01:39:58,340
your brain hurt by the time you're done

2376
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:59,989
and it's it's going to be a lot of

2377
01:39:58,340 --> 01:40:01,400
information because you know I fire you

2378
01:39:59,989 --> 01:40:03,679
you've been to one of my talks I fire

2379
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:05,960
information pretty fast at you but you

2380
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:09,770
know if we're given this longer time

2381
01:40:05,960 --> 01:40:11,899
we can go more in depth on these kinds

2382
01:40:09,770 --> 01:40:14,600
of things no that would be invaluable in

2383
01:40:11,899 --> 01:40:16,670
fact that are there any other publicly

2384
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:18,260
available talks that you're going to be

2385
01:40:16,670 --> 01:40:22,670
giving in the near future that you could

2386
01:40:18,260 --> 01:40:26,539
you could mention um I'm someone's

2387
01:40:22,670 --> 01:40:29,329
organizing one for Florida but you know

2388
01:40:26,539 --> 01:40:32,719
the Florida market for cannabis is so so

2389
01:40:29,329 --> 01:40:34,488
small that that's not you know not going

2390
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:37,460
to have a lot of you know necessarily

2391
01:40:34,488 --> 01:40:39,349
draw for that but I do you know I will

2392
01:40:37,460 --> 01:40:43,730
say that I'm having more Canas people

2393
01:40:39,350 --> 01:40:47,600
show up at my ornamental workshops and

2394
01:40:43,729 --> 01:40:49,909
other other classes because you can take

2395
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:52,120
you know biology information and

2396
01:40:49,909 --> 01:40:54,649
sanitation information and it does

2397
01:40:52,119 --> 01:40:56,630
transfer over I do

2398
01:40:54,649 --> 01:40:58,488
try really hard to keep up with a

2399
01:40:56,630 --> 01:41:00,170
calendar on my website on bug lady

2400
01:40:58,488 --> 01:41:01,609
consulting I think I have a link it's

2401
01:41:00,170 --> 01:41:05,119
you know where's the bug lady and you

2402
01:41:01,609 --> 01:41:06,949
can go up there and see things that are

2403
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:09,738
coming in the future I'm going to be

2404
01:41:06,949 --> 01:41:12,199
speaking up in Boston I can remember

2405
01:41:09,738 --> 01:41:14,839
next month or the end of this month

2406
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:17,149
actually I think on pesticide

2407
01:41:14,840 --> 01:41:19,130
compatibility and biocontrol information

2408
01:41:17,149 --> 01:41:21,619
and I'm also working on putting together

2409
01:41:19,130 --> 01:41:24,529
for cultivate which is the biggest

2410
01:41:21,619 --> 01:41:26,899
greenhouse trade show in the u.s. that's

2411
01:41:24,529 --> 01:41:29,300
going to be in July the Saturday of that

2412
01:41:26,899 --> 01:41:32,149
show I'm putting together an entire day

2413
01:41:29,300 --> 01:41:36,140
a workshop focusing on biocontrol and

2414
01:41:32,149 --> 01:41:39,738
focusing a lot on insect identification

2415
01:41:36,140 --> 01:41:42,200
and things like that so I do teach stuff

2416
01:41:39,738 --> 01:41:44,689
all over you know they said I've spoken

2417
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:47,269
to canna con I've done some workshops

2418
01:41:44,689 --> 01:41:50,149
out in Oregon I've been in ki and I'm

2419
01:41:47,270 --> 01:41:51,530
just all over the place so well great

2420
01:41:50,149 --> 01:41:54,259
I'll definitely put links to all of that

2421
01:41:51,529 --> 01:41:56,569
on the podcast page so people can find

2422
01:41:54,260 --> 01:41:58,820
the link to your events and that that

2423
01:41:56,569 --> 01:42:00,139
one in San Diego sounds amazing so maybe

2424
01:41:58,819 --> 01:42:02,809
I will try and make it down for that as

2425
01:42:00,140 --> 01:42:04,730
well yeah and we're deciding right now

2426
01:42:02,810 --> 01:42:06,590
about how much we're going to do because

2427
01:42:04,729 --> 01:42:07,968
we want to do any kind of hands-on stuff

2428
01:42:06,590 --> 01:42:11,449
we're probably going to have to limit

2429
01:42:07,969 --> 01:42:14,449
the number of attendees because when it

2430
01:42:11,449 --> 01:42:17,300
gets so big it's really hard to do any

2431
01:42:14,449 --> 01:42:19,849
kind of hands-on anything so you know as

2432
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:21,500
it as it progresses

2433
01:42:19,850 --> 01:42:23,450
you know but we'll have more information

2434
