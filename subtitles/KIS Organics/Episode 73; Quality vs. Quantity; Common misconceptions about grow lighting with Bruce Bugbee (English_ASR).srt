00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,000
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,839
science podcast

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
i'm your host tad hussey of kiss

5
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:24,480
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
discuss

7
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,160
the cutting edge of growing from a

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,679
science-based perspective and drawn top

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,518
experts from around the industry to

10
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,039
share their wisdom and knowledge

11
00:00:31,518 --> 00:00:35,039
my guest this week needs very little

12
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:36,479
introduction if you've ever studied

13
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:37,519
lighting you've probably read some of

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,519
his research

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,680
bruce bugbee is a professor at utah

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,320
state university and president of apogee

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:44,079
instruments

18
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,159
he is internationally known for his work

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,079
with nasa to design food systems

20
00:00:46,159 --> 00:00:49,599
for people living on mars and has been a

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,679
frequent speaker at conferences on

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,239
indoor food production on earth

23
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:56,238
in 2011 he received the governor's medal

24
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:56,959
for science from utah governor gary

25
00:00:56,238 --> 00:00:58,718
herbert

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,480
he has recorded several videos on

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
photobiological principles

28
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:04,478
just search for bugbee agriculture

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:06,478
perhaps his pinnacle achievement is

30
00:01:04,478 --> 00:01:07,438
summarizing everything he knows in a ted

31
00:01:06,478 --> 00:01:10,560
talk entitled

32
00:01:07,438 --> 00:01:13,679
turning water into food

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,560
hi bruce welcome to the show i'm great

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
to be here

35
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,040
ted yeah can we start off uh talking

36
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:21,438
a little bit for listeners who may not

37
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,360
be as familiar with you and your uh

38
00:01:21,438 --> 00:01:27,839
your work in research could you tell me

39
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:27,840
a little bit about yourself

40
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:35,519
i'm a professor at utah state university

41
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:38,399
and specifically a professor in the

42
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:39,519
college of agriculture and more

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,118
specifically

44
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:45,840
my classes are plant physiology

45
00:01:43,118 --> 00:01:47,280
and plant nutrition those are the things

46
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:51,600
i teach in the

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:55,200
research i do uh about

48
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:57,359
close to 40 years ago now i get funded

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,799
very early in my career i got funded by

50
00:01:57,359 --> 00:02:01,519
nasa to

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,680
for plants in space and living on the

52
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:07,199
moon living on mars

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,959
and that got my students and i

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,840
into doing photobiology

55
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,840
way before there was any leds but we

56
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
still had different types of lights and

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,000
filters and

58
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:21,359
we started to study the effects of

59
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,439
spectral quality on

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,560
plants and that's now become a big part

61
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:28,400
of the

62
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,400
research in my lab

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,080
now for listeners who may not be

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,080
familiar with the term

65
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,360
uh correct me if i'm wrong photobiology

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,959
refers to the effect

67
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,480
of light on uh organisms

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,400
or correct like humans plants yes

69
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:47,119
all these things it's a broad it's a

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,159
broad term photo is light and biology is

71
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,239
all of biology

72
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:53,199
so it can be effects of light on

73
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,319
microorganisms

74
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:56,799
effects of light on animals my part of

75
00:02:56,318 --> 00:02:59,518
that is

76
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
heavily focused on light on higher

77
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,879
plants

78
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,480
and even more narrowly effective light

79
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:08,239
on food crops

80
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:11,359
we're not studying um ecology

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,800
of uh in in a forest my colleagues study

82
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,159
those sorts of things but

83
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:19,599
my work is very heavily focused on

84
00:03:16,158 --> 00:03:20,959
economic plants which of course cannabis

85
00:03:19,598 --> 00:03:24,639
is an example of an

86
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,840
economic plant well when it comes to

87
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:28,238
lighting

88
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,439
everyone talks and looks to you it seems

89
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,920
like in the industry

90
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,680
for research and expertise so you have

91
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:38,238
quite that reputation of being sort of

92
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:41,519
that leading expert when it comes to

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,959
lighting and uh and so

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,560
i was really excited to get you on the

95
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
show i've i've heard you speak

96
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,640
multiple times as well as online there's

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,360
some great youtube videos

98
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:53,598
that i'll put links to in the podcast

99
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,159
page that you put out with apogee

100
00:03:53,598 --> 00:03:57,759
you also have a role over at apogee do

101
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,318
you want to touch on that too and

102
00:03:57,759 --> 00:04:05,919
mention the company a little bit

103
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:09,199
yeah in 1995

104
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:12,798
i started to make light meters and and

105
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:15,518
it was really it was in my garage and

106
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,560
i was modifying voltmeters and putting

107
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,239
photodiodes in

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,680
them to measure photosynthetic radiation

109
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,319
and then i subsequently started a

110
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,519
company

111
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:29,680
and the company now has 30 some

112
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,039
employees and you know quite a nice

113
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,600
building here in

114
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:38,639
logan utah and i'm still

115
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,520
intimately involved with the research

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,720
and development

117
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,120
in the company so i

118
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,800
i guess my day job is at the university

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,360
and my weekend job is

120
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,478
my company but the company makes

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,560
instruments

122
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,319
to measure light not surprisingly

123
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,360
because that's a spin-off of my

124
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:59,680
research and different wavelengths of

125
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,680
light spectroradiometers

126
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:08,000
quantum sensors for light so that's

127
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,038
given me an additional ability to do

128
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,959
research to help

129
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:13,759
growers i want to spend the majority of

130
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:17,120
the podcast

131
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,840
talking about i think led lighting and

132
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,360
and some of the research and knowledge

133
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:24,799
you have around that but

134
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,879
let's talk briefly about the equipment

135
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
that apogee sells and what some of the

136
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:31,759
tools are for measuring light

137
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:34,239
in a growing facility and how best to

138
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,240
use them

139
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,639
you know dad i might start this by just

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,479
saying

141
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,918
you can go for probably thirty dollars

142
00:05:40,478 --> 00:05:45,279
you can go and buy a

143
00:05:41,918 --> 00:05:47,519
lux meter or a foot candle meter

144
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:50,559
and those are real cheap and they do

145
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:54,240
give you relative levels of life

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,038
but they weight the colors all wrong

147
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,800
they wait green and not blue and red and

148
00:05:57,038 --> 00:06:01,038
people buy those and measure lights

149
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,000
for plants and they can have very

150
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:04,478
significant

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,478
errors

152
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:12,000
but even beyond that most of us

153
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,199
most people think they can tell how

154
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,800
bright the light is

155
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,960
they look at it and they say that's

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,400
pretty bright and a little brighter over

157
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,918
here

158
00:06:18,399 --> 00:06:25,198
but our the human eye when when there's

159
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:28,318
the light is high the iris contracts

160
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,639
to with just a pinhole and it

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,240
regulates the amount of light getting to

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,840
the retina

163
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:38,240
so if you are inside and you look at a

164
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:41,119
very well-lit room

165
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,280
and you say is this brighter or about

166
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,439
the same as outside or less and

167
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,719
most said no no no no it's a little less

168
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:50,319
in here

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:55,120
and then you take a meter and

170
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,439
a well-lit office might be 10

171
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,598
units of light and the units we use are

172
00:06:57,439 --> 00:07:02,240
micro moles of photons

173
00:06:59,598 --> 00:07:03,680
per meter squared of area per second

174
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,478
just like it was little

175
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,598
invisible marbles falling on a surface

176
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:11,680
it might be 10

177
00:07:07,598 --> 00:07:14,839
in a well-lit office outside

178
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,840
at noon on a sunny day it's 2

179
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:20,478
000. wow 2 000

180
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:20,879
divided by 10 that's 200 times more

181
00:07:20,478 --> 00:07:24,560
light

182
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:28,079
outside and plants respond to that

183
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,918
they grow almost 200 times as fast

184
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:32,399
outside as they would in a well-lit

185
00:07:29,918 --> 00:07:32,879
office and that's just stunning to

186
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:34,638
people

187
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:35,918
when they've never measured light and

188
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,918
they hold the meter

189
00:07:35,918 --> 00:07:40,159
and they walk around and do that they

190
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:42,318
they just can't believe it on that

191
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,039
hundreds of times in my career i've seen

192
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,319
that the light bulb go on for people and

193
00:07:45,038 --> 00:07:48,560
they go my goodness

194
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,400
i didn't know what i was missing and now

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,680
they're measuring light everywhere

196
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:54,159
and the plants do see it and that's one

197
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
of

198
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,520
that's probably the single most common

199
00:07:56,399 --> 00:08:00,478
problem is

200
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:01,038
people under appreciating the amount of

201
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:04,000
light

202
00:08:01,038 --> 00:08:04,560
that plants need and they don't provide

203
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,160
enough

204
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,680
light and then they blame it on the

205
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,319
fertilizer or

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,680
something else when it's just plain not

207
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:15,199
enough light

208
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,840
so that sort of thing is how apogee

209
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,038
started

210
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:21,359
it was i recognized that and i started

211
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,839
making low-cost meters for

212
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,960
people to help people measure light and

213
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:27,119
specifically

214
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:28,560
like for plants which we call

215
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:32,240
photosynthetic

216
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:36,240
radiation and

217
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,158
no that people just kept buying them and

218
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,918
the company got bigger and the products

219
00:08:38,158 --> 00:08:43,120
got better and

220
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:43,679
multiple different kinds of products but

221
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,639
i think

222
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:47,439
to get back to your original question

223
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:49,360
you asked me

224
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,120
something about you know how would you

225
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,240
measure this

226
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,959
and in the simplest sense there's a

227
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,480
single

228
00:08:54,958 --> 00:09:02,239
sensor that makes an electric signal

229
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,120
goes to a meter that integrates

230
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,680
all the colors of light in one sensor

231
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
it's

232
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,919
we call it a quantum sensor because a

233
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,559
quantum is a

234
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:14,559
mole of photons and

235
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:20,319
it's a relatively low cost sensor

236
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:22,159
but it doesn't tell you if you have red

237
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
light or green light or blue light it

238
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,240
just tells you the total

239
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,600
so for that you need a spectral

240
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,919
radiometer

241
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,360
and now the price jumps up to about two

242
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:34,838
thousand dollars

243
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,000
and and depending on the quality of the

244
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,680
spectroradiometer

245
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
but that tells you the individual

246
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:42,799
wavelengths so for research we're always

247
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,920
using spectral radiometers

248
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:49,120
and but for just spot checking things

249
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:50,879
we're just using the quantum sensors

250
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,320
so just a quick summary of a lot of

251
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:54,480
different things but

252
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
um there's a lot of different kinds of

253
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,680
light meters

254
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,519
yeah i wanted to try and recap this so

255
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,278
and please correct me if i get anything

256
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,078
wrong here so when we talk about a light

257
00:10:01,278 --> 00:10:04,000
meter

258
00:10:02,078 --> 00:10:06,559
we want one that's going to be measuring

259
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,799
uh par that 400 to

260
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:09,919
700 nanometer range because that's the

261
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:13,599
range that

262
00:10:09,919 --> 00:10:16,399
is associated with plant growth and

263
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,759
we want to know the intensity i use the

264
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
word intensity i don't know if that's

265
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:20,559
the

266
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,759
best definition the amount of photons

267
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:25,278
that are going to be hitting

268
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:30,000
the meter and and and that tells us

269
00:10:25,278 --> 00:10:31,600
uh the ppfd or uh that longer

270
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
term that you threw out there i've

271
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,240
always used ppfd just because it's

272
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,480
easier

273
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,839
for me but um being able to

274
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,000
measure that as an important tool

275
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,880
because when we talk about

276
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,720
a grow light for example we want to know

277
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:49,360
how far away from that light should we

278
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,120
position our plant based on

279
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,639
the the stage of growth of the plant um

280
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,320
you know how hard we're pushing the

281
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:58,399
plant you know and uh

282
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,519
every every light is going to be

283
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,799
slightly different

284
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,200
so that i think that's an important tool

285
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:07,199
and a facility to be able to know oh boy

286
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,440
if i'm a foot away i'm at 1200

287
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:14,160
ppfd versus two feet away that light

288
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,880
that light intensity falls off quite a

289
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:19,360
bit

290
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,360
yeah yes and then yes

291
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,320
people say that all the time are the one

292
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,600
foot away two feet away three feet away

293
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,160
and um that's almost like sticking your

294
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,159
finger

295
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:31,439
in in orange juice and seeing and

296
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:34,799
licking it and saying oh

297
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,040
i think the ph is ph4 you're not

298
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:40,399
measuring it you're just kind of

299
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:44,719
guessing and an experienced person

300
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,278
can make a reasonable guess but boy

301
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,639
given how sensitive the plants are to

302
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:50,799
the total amount of light

303
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,799
and how fast it changes you can measure

304
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,000
it and go a foot away and it's a

305
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:56,879
different number

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,399
and you just cannot see that we cannot

307
00:11:56,879 --> 00:12:02,240
see that with our eyes

308
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:04,720
that's where light meters come in and

309
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,639
gosh in my experience they're they're

310
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,000
very underutilized

311
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:14,480
in the world of uh indoor agriculture

312
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,519
outside we have we take what the sun

313
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,079
gives us

314
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,799
we can measure it but we can't change it

315
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:22,000
anyway

316
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:24,639
now we just measure it

317
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
the inside we can change it and to

318
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
optimize it

319
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,200
you got to measure it so when we're

320
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,360
talking about light just as an overview

321
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
um we're really talking about a few

322
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,800
different things we're talking about the

323
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:40,799
intensity of the light uh which would be

324
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:42,958
the amount of photons hitting a leaf

325
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,879
or a given point we're talking about the

326
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:47,759
quality of the light

327
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:49,360
in terms of the range and spectrum of

328
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,838
that light and then we're talking about

329
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,680
the

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,519
dli which would be the amount of light

331
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:54,799
that plant's going to receive over the

332
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,759
given

333
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:58,719
photo period when the light is on can

334
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:00,720
you kind of

335
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,759
talk a little bit about those three

336
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,278
things or if there's

337
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:04,799
if there's a major component that i'm

338
00:13:03,278 --> 00:13:08,159
missing here in the summary

339
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:10,559
feel free to add on to that too

340
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,759
well we can certainly break it down into

341
00:13:10,559 --> 00:13:13,919
quantity

342
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:16,078
and quality and both of them are

343
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:20,159
important

344
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:24,479
quantity is under appreciated and

345
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:26,399
quality people over worry about quality

346
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,800
we should be all thinking more about the

347
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,919
quantity of the lights that it get

348
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,919
and less about the

349
00:13:32,078 --> 00:13:35,359
the ratios of colors because the

350
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,480
quantity is a

351
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,639
huge factor all of the meters

352
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,680
measure light they're calibrated to give

353
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,039
you a number

354
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:48,638
per second and and this is all good

355
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:52,078
but what the plants respond to is

356
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,440
the daily light integral which means the

357
00:13:52,078 --> 00:13:56,799
total amount of light

358
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,199
over the day and

359
00:13:56,799 --> 00:14:00,838
meters don't automatically give you that

360
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:02,319
you have to connect it to a little

361
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,440
microprocessor

362
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,920
that adds up the photons and the best

363
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:10,639
analogy is like a rain gauge

364
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:11,278
at the end of the day you want to know

365
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,440
how much a

366
00:14:11,278 --> 00:14:16,480
total it rained in that day and you look

367
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,600
at the total for the day so

368
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,839
you hook your sensors up to a little

369
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,639
microprocessor

370
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,920
it adds them up and and records the

371
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,759
total for the day

372
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:27,198
either gives it to you on a screen or

373
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:30,240
records it

374
00:14:27,198 --> 00:14:33,039
so the daily light integral

375
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,320
is a step above just measuring the

376
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:38,319
instantaneous

377
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
light per second

378
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:45,039
it's if you have electric lights it's

379
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:45,519
possible to say this is what it was per

380
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:48,399
second

381
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,198
my lights were on for 16 hours and

382
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,320
multiply

383
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:55,838
to get the baby light integral as long

384
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:58,800
as the light is exactly constant

385
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
but it's any in a greenhouse anywhere

386
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:03,599
that has variable light

387
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,959
you need to record it and

388
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,360
so that's the intensity and and this

389
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:10,239
the ppfd that you mentioned is stands

390
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,278
for

391
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:17,039
i think you know this but photosynthetic

392
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:19,679
photon flux density

393
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:20,319
and it's the amount of light per unit

394
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:25,120
area

395
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:27,360
per unit time and amount of photons

396
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,879
we try not to call it light because

397
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,839
usually

398
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:34,399
the word light refers to what the the

399
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,839
ratios of colors that people see

400
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,000
um we we in my papers you'll see we

401
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:41,680
rarely use the term light we always say

402
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,240
photon flux

403
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:46,159
because that's more precisely what it is

404
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
even though that sounds

405
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:49,600
very technical after a while you get to

406
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:52,240
use you used to

407
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,639
saying photon flux and then your then

408
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
you can

409
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:58,799
impress people at parties because you

410
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,799
didn't say light you said photon flux

411
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:07,919
but so that's quantity of just the

412
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,720
pure total that the plants get the

413
00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,639
quality

414
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,240
is the races of the colors and

415
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,839
for that to measure that you need a

416
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,560
spectral radiometer

417
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,440
little prism and it divides up the

418
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:22,239
colors of light

419
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,480
and measures them all separately and

420
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,278
that's a good bit more

421
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
sophisticated instrument apogee

422
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:31,679
instrument sells a couple different

423
00:16:28,799 --> 00:16:33,479
models and apogee is always working on

424
00:16:31,679 --> 00:16:35,758
better quality cheaper

425
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:37,600
spectroradiometers

426
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:41,600
there's a now there's a fairly wide

427
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:46,079
array of spec radiometers on the market

428
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:49,600
and oh if you get a lower cost one

429
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:52,719
the optics aren't as as good uh

430
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:55,839
the resolution isn't as good for ev

431
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,120
for example telling

432
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,360
um cyan from blue

433
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,600
or some you know some color some

434
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,360
discrimination of color that a human

435
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,599
could easily see

436
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,879
the the instrument might be not be able

437
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:12,639
to do that

438
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,679
in the lower cost meters but

439
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:18,799
now we get ratios of colors

440
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:24,079
and as everybody knows we can manipulate

441
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:24,078
plant shape with ratios of colors

442
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,480
and i don't know if this is the time to

443
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:34,000
i could make a review of all of that

444
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:36,240
here if that seems appropriate sure

445
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,359
you know i think it relates to a comment

446
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,880
that you made uh

447
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:42,558
on one of your youtube videos and you

448
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:44,960
touched on here too saying that

449
00:17:42,558 --> 00:17:46,000
light quantity is more important than

450
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:50,079
quality in relation

451
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,160
to cannabis i you know we do get caught

452
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,639
up in looking at spectrum when we look

453
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,720
at

454
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:58,880
bulbs when we look at led lights

455
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
but your research is showing that that's

456
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
not as important

457
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,839
or you're not seeing as much variability

458
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:07,279
in plant growth

459
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:09,759
can you talk about that yeah

460
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:11,678
that that's correct quantity is more

461
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:14,960
important than quality

462
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:17,519
and i i think it comes from what we see

463
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,360
our eyes are exquisitely good at seeing

464
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:20,879
tiny differences in color

465
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:22,798
i mean you go to a paint store and

466
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,200
there's what is there 10 to the six

467
00:18:22,798 --> 00:18:26,480
different shades of colors of paint

468
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,600
because we can tell

469
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:32,240
all those colors apart we can tell

470
00:18:29,599 --> 00:18:32,719
those colors apart better than a plant

471
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,038
can

472
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,679
because just because our eyes are so

473
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:41,038
exquisitely tuned to see

474
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,960
shades of colors but our eyes

475
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:46,000
as i mentioned a minute ago our eyes

476
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:47,919
can't really tell intensity very well

477
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,839
so that you then you say well

478
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,960
intuitively no wonder we're so worried

479
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:53,359
about color

480
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,360
and we don't worry about intensity

481
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:58,079
because we worry about what we can

482
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,719
see but for the plants it's really the

483
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:00,639
opposite

484
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,000
the intensity is what determines

485
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,759
photosynthesis

486
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,519
and plant growth and the color

487
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:12,000
for the most part determines plant shape

488
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:13,679
meaning a tall skinny plant a short fat

489
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:17,279
plant those

490
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,280
those sorts of things

491
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:25,839
so if we went through the

492
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:30,320
colors there's

493
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:33,599
really divide them into five categories

494
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:35,599
and that's if we start with ultraviolet

495
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:37,279
those are the photons below 400

496
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,480
nanometers

497
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:41,038
we can barely see those they're they're

498
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,319
just not

499
00:19:41,038 --> 00:19:47,119
visible and of course

500
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:49,119
humans think oh i'll provide it as bad

501
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,959
you got to put on sunscreen

502
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,239
but what we really ought to be thinking

503
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,519
is

504
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
some ultraviolet is good it's just how

505
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:58,400
much

506
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,640
and it some ultraviolet is good for

507
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,000
people because it makes vitamin d

508
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:08,480
and some ultraviolet is good for plants

509
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:12,960
because it makes them tougher and it can

510
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:16,000
trigger chemistry

511
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:20,000
that is associated with flavors

512
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:24,000
in plants so

513
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,599
ultraviolet and now we have uv leds

514
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:31,038
that are they're called uva 360

515
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:32,000
i think the peaks are 365 and 385

516
00:20:31,038 --> 00:20:33,759
nanometers

517
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,240
they're almost visible you can tell

518
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:38,879
they're on but just barely

519
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,159
so can we manipulate those to change

520
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:45,520
flavors in food and quality in plants

521
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,600
and the answer is yes but in the

522
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,079
laboratory it's been harder to do that

523
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:49,839
than we

524
00:20:48,079 --> 00:20:51,359
thought we thought oh this will be

525
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,199
pretty easy we'll just shine these and

526
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:55,199
all kinds of things will change and

527
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
it's not been as easy to do that as we

528
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,440
thought

529
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:02,960
but that's uv the next

530
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:04,720
color up is blue and blue has powerful

531
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,519
effects on plants

532
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,798
sunlight is full of blue light and it

533
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:12,000
makes plants

534
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:14,319
tougher it they synthesize

535
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,720
pigments that protect the plant plants

536
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:20,319
make their own sunscreen

537
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,319
and protects them against uv

538
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,279
but blue helps keep plants short and

539
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:28,798
that's almost always a

540
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:33,440
good thing in plants we have found

541
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:36,558
blue photons can have a bigger effect

542
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,759
on some of these flavor compounds than

543
00:21:36,558 --> 00:21:41,759
ultraviolet

544
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:43,599
protons that's a con contrary to the

545
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:47,839
popular belief that

546
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:50,959
ultraviolet are really powerful but

547
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:54,319
blue blue photons help keep plants short

548
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,038
green photons are sort of they're in the

549
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,720
middle

550
00:21:55,038 --> 00:21:58,640
and you know people say other green

551
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,159
photons they just bounce off that's why

552
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,799
plants look green

553
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:04,159
but that's just a tiny fraction that

554
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:09,440
bounces off

555
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:11,520
green photons are primarily valuable

556
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,880
for the people if you have some green

557
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:16,480
photons in the lights

558
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,200
you can see the plants better and

559
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,159
you can distinguish tiny insects that

560
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,360
are and

561
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,760
tiny disorders diseases

562
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,639
just when they're just barely starting

563
00:22:25,759 --> 00:22:29,200
from

564
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,919
the green light from the led so i'm a

565
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,798
huge

566
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,360
advocate of led fixtures should have

567
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:36,639
more

568
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:38,639
green photons in them so that people can

569
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:42,480
see the plants better and better

570
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,320
diagnose the plants and if they can keep

571
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,240
going just a minute

572
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:51,359
red photons are really well absorbed by

573
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:53,519
plants and they're very efficient the

574
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:56,639
number of photons you get

575
00:22:53,519 --> 00:23:00,240
per watt or per joule of electricity

576
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:04,400
is excellent that's the most efficient

577
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:07,919
led but they're expensive to produce

578
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:11,280
for a manufacturer the leds the red

579
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,480
leds can cost five times as much

580
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:17,200
as a white led so

581
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
we don't always put a lot of red leds in

582
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,759
the fixture

583
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,440
but other than that they're

584
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:24,480
photosynthetically efficient

585
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,038
and they're electrically efficient and

586
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,960
then

587
00:23:25,038 --> 00:23:28,480
as more and more people are coming to

588
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,319
know all the time

589
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:35,360
there's far red photons which are

590
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:38,480
700 750 nanometers

591
00:23:35,359 --> 00:23:40,639
and again those we can barely see

592
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,798
they look like a burner on an electric

593
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,720
stove when you just when you can barely

594
00:23:42,798 --> 00:23:48,240
tell it's on

595
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,720
that's far red light be hard to read a

596
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,359
book

597
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,839
by that amount of light but those have

598
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:57,839
big effects on plants

599
00:23:53,839 --> 00:24:00,558
and mostly they increase stem elongation

600
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:01,439
ah that's not good we don't really want

601
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:04,720
tall

602
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:08,080
plants but in lettuce

603
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:09,278
they increase leaf expansion which is

604
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,798
really a good

605
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:15,839
thing so particularly in lettuce

606
00:24:12,798 --> 00:24:17,038
far red photons really help the plants

607
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:20,399
expand

608
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:22,558
more so it just

609
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:25,200
went went through five colors of light

610
00:24:22,558 --> 00:24:27,200
from uv all the way up to far red

611
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,278
in a fast overview that was that was

612
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,798
perfect uh i did want to go back and ask

613
00:24:29,278 --> 00:24:33,440
some specific

614
00:24:30,798 --> 00:24:35,918
questions regarding these various

615
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:39,038
spectrums

616
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:41,278
in relation to cannabis so

617
00:24:39,038 --> 00:24:42,558
uh you know i know you've talked before

618
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:45,038
about

619
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,639
dark cycles and i know people will use

620
00:24:45,038 --> 00:24:48,640
green lights

621
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,159
typically when they want to go into a

622
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
cannabis room

623
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,799
during a dark cycle have you done any

624
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,400
research to really see i mean

625
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:59,200
they used to say plants don't see green

626
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:01,360
light but i think that's been disproven

627
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,480
um can you touch on that a little bit

628
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:05,199
yes

629
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,038
yes we have and yes that's that's a

630
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,880
common thing we even call green lights

631
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:10,400
safe lights because you can turn them on

632
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,440
the plants won't see them

633
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,559
i can tell you that's completely wrong

634
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,200
plants see that green light almost as

635
00:25:16,558 --> 00:25:22,960
well as blue and red

636
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:26,080
so it's

637
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:28,079
it's really

638
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:30,798
if you have to go in at night just use

639
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:33,278
this gimme light as you can

640
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:34,400
but the green light the plants do see it

641
00:25:33,278 --> 00:25:37,359
at night

642
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:39,360
and in some of our studies they can see

643
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,158
it just as well as the other colors of

644
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,918
life

645
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
which is sort of unfortunate because

646
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,720
wouldn't it be nice to go in there with

647
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,639
the green light and

648
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,319
be able to see the plants and the plants

649
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:52,000
can't tell you're there but

650
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:54,720
they can they do so um

651
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,079
be careful about the using green safe

652
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,159
lights at night

653
00:25:56,079 --> 00:25:59,599
well that's good advice because i know i

654
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,200
bought a green light back when i very

655
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,719
first started growing thinking if i ever

656
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,480
had to go into the room or see the

657
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,360
plants that's what i would use but

658
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,880
it sounds like again you're saying light

659
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:10,798
intensity

660
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,480
is more important than the light

661
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:16,079
spectrum or light quality i guess

662
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,558
in that case yeah yeah so

663
00:26:16,079 --> 00:26:19,599
if you have to use dim light make it as

664
00:26:18,558 --> 00:26:22,960
a green light

665
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:25,839
make it as dim as possible good so

666
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,120
talking about cannabis specifically then

667
00:26:25,839 --> 00:26:31,199
um

668
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:34,239
you mentioned uv you mentioned far red

669
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,080
how did these spectrums affect you know

670
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,440
terpene production cannabinoid

671
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:40,798
production

672
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:42,960
and how important are they because um

673
00:26:40,798 --> 00:26:45,119
like like you just stated you you don't

674
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,159
seem as focused on spectrum as

675
00:26:45,119 --> 00:26:51,678
i would have thought that kind of

676
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,760
you know that's surprising to me uh

677
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,440
so can you touch on like i mean

678
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:59,119
obviously these spectrums

679
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,519
do have an impact on the the morphology

680
00:26:59,119 --> 00:27:02,558
of your

681
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:04,480
of your plant uh so how

682
00:27:02,558 --> 00:27:06,240
what recommendations might you make or

683
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:10,400
areas for research around

684
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,400
you know spectral analysis and cannabis

685
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,558
we are certainly researching cannabinoid

686
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,959
synthesis

687
00:27:14,558 --> 00:27:18,398
full time and and we're also getting

688
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,399
into terpenes

689
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:22,479
but we've got lots more data on

690
00:27:20,398 --> 00:27:26,879
cannabinoid synthesis

691
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:30,720
and we have not found

692
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:34,159
as nearly as big of effects of

693
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:36,399
ratios of colors as we thought we would

694
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,520
you know that many other people this is

695
00:27:36,398 --> 00:27:40,558
you get

696
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:42,079
this will go up with this um now i

697
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,879
didn't say there was none

698
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:48,480
no effect they're just smaller than they

699
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,360
thought they would be uh here's one

700
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:54,399
specific

701
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:57,359
example that growers often observe

702
00:27:54,398 --> 00:28:00,079
because those red leds are electrically

703
00:27:57,359 --> 00:28:02,558
efficient and good photosynthesis

704
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:03,678
many manufacturers put lots of red in

705
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:06,879
their pictures it's real

706
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,600
common now to have white leds with a lot

707
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,960
of red

708
00:28:07,599 --> 00:28:12,398
that's a that's a great combination of

709
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,159
colors because

710
00:28:12,398 --> 00:28:16,000
you get enough white so you can see the

711
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,679
plants you need a little bit of blue

712
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,519
you put some blue in and then you have a

713
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,320
lot of red

714
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:23,519
when that red the fraction of red

715
00:28:22,319 --> 00:28:26,960
photons

716
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:30,000
starts to climb up above

717
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:33,038
maybe 70 percent we

718
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,839
see white tips on the flowers

719
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,480
and and that's a common thing it's real

720
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,720
striking because these big flower buds

721
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,839
and the top half an inch the top

722
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,079
centimeter

723
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:45,359
doesn't have any chlorophyll in it it's

724
00:28:44,079 --> 00:28:49,359
it's

725
00:28:45,359 --> 00:28:52,558
white at best it's light yellow

726
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:56,558
wow this is a striking thing

727
00:28:52,558 --> 00:28:59,038
and many people have reported this

728
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,480
and we have done enough studies on it

729
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,640
now we know that it

730
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,759
only happens when the fraction of red

731
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,240
photons

732
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:11,440
is very high maybe above about 70

733
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,240
uh what we think is happening is

734
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,159
the red photons are god i'm going to

735
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,399
make an analogy they're like dessert

736
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,399
and they're just great the plants soak

737
00:29:18,398 --> 00:29:23,599
them up and they love them

738
00:29:20,398 --> 00:29:24,479
but the plants don't make photo

739
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:26,719
protective

740
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,079
pigments when they have a lot of red

741
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,919
photons

742
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,558
these these are nice photons we don't

743
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:35,440
have to protect ourselves against these

744
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,639
so they don't synthesize photoprotective

745
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,159
pigments

746
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,759
at least in the tips of cannabis flowers

747
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:47,919
and then it causes photobleaching the

748
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:47,919
the light degrades the chlorophyll

749
00:29:48,079 --> 00:29:55,918
so empirically we regularly see it with

750
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,399
high red high fractions of red and we

751
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,960
think that it's

752
00:29:58,398 --> 00:30:02,479
the lack of photoprotective pigments

753
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
plants always have to

754
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,079
synthesize things to protect filter the

755
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:08,079
light

756
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:10,720
and protect the chlorophyll protect

757
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:13,839
other things in the leaf

758
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,679
so that's just a little sidebar story

759
00:30:13,839 --> 00:30:18,398
about those white tips

760
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:20,798
in cannabis flowers under high fractions

761
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:22,639
of red light

762
00:30:20,798 --> 00:30:23,918
so i always thought that was associated

763
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,200
with

764
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:28,159
too high of ppfd now i know cannabis can

765
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,480
handle

766
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,159
very high ppfd uh that kind of leads me

767
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,480
into one of my questions though is like

768
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:39,840
transitioning plants uh from

769
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:43,120
you know different levels of

770
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:45,918
of light i've seen that

771
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:47,439
you know moving from hps to led lights

772
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,480
for example changing that

773
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:53,038
spectrum can have an impact on

774
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:54,319
on your plants um even just you know

775
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:57,519
ratcheting up the

776
00:30:54,319 --> 00:31:00,480
intensity or the photons on a

777
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,319
on a given plant too rapidly seems to

778
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,640
have detrimental effects

779
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,079
do you have any research on or any

780
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,440
information i see i thought plant

781
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:09,038
bleaching was caused by moving

782
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,120
you know a plant that was under fairly

783
00:31:09,038 --> 00:31:14,960
low light let's say you know 400

784
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:19,038
ppfd up to like 1 1200 overnight

785
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,399
you would see that sort of effect but um

786
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:24,798
that is a common thought that it's that

787
00:31:22,398 --> 00:31:27,199
that photo bleaching is either too high

788
00:31:24,798 --> 00:31:28,960
a light or too fast to change

789
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,720
we don't have evidence for either one of

790
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,600
those um

791
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,480
we've grown plants with very high light

792
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:36,798
and the

793
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,759
all the flowers are nice and green um

794
00:31:36,798 --> 00:31:40,000
and and a

795
00:31:37,759 --> 00:31:40,798
lower level of light but a high fraction

796
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,319
of red

797
00:31:40,798 --> 00:31:46,240
the tips turn white so that's far more

798
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,439
related to the fraction of red than it

799
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,399
is to total

800
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,000
intensity that's a non-intuitive thing

801
00:31:50,398 --> 00:31:53,759
because you see bleaching there must the

802
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,798
light must be too high

803
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:58,798
but what it really is is the red photon

804
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:02,480
fraction is too high

805
00:31:58,798 --> 00:32:05,359
now relative to changing light levels

806
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,319
that's common people sometimes lots of

807
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:09,359
growers just

808
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:11,839
very carefully ramp the lights up

809
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:13,359
but when we have done studies with

810
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:15,918
photosynthesis

811
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:17,599
where we're measuring the photosynthetic

812
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:20,159
rate of the leaves

813
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,678
they adapt to new light levels very

814
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:24,720
rapidly

815
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,440
like certainly within one day to a

816
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:33,919
change in light so

817
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:37,120
it's a good idea to to

818
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,200
not change the light too fast but

819
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:40,158
it you don't it doesn't have to be and

820
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,159
our

821
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:43,440
data doesn't indicates it doesn't have

822
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,559
to be as gradual

823
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,840
as most people do it we've gone from

824
00:32:46,558 --> 00:32:50,398
a light level of 300 micromoles to the

825
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:53,839
next day

826
00:32:50,398 --> 00:32:56,398
1200 micro moles and provided

827
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,839
the proper water and nutrients the

828
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:59,918
plants are just fine

829
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:02,798
they jump right up the photosynthetic

830
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:04,240
rate quadruples the light quadruples and

831
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:08,319
the photosynthetic

832
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:11,919
quadruples right away the next day

833
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:14,798
so i wouldn't say

834
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,120
rapid changes in of light don't matter

835
00:33:14,798 --> 00:33:17,440
at

836
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:18,639
all because i because i think they do

837
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,679
but they just don't matter

838
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,600
nearly as much as people think

839
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,038
that's so interesting i i want to touch

840
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,798
on that a little more because i

841
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,720
i remember from my botany classes and

842
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:31,359
this was a little while ago so

843
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,360
i'm a little shaky that uh plants would

844
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,319
have you know shade leaves so light

845
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:38,558
leaves that were the levels of

846
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:41,200
chlorophyll were more adapted to

847
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,879
less lower light conditions and that

848
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,720
would change over time

849
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,600
based on the amount of light that leaf

850
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,519
was receiving

851
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:50,839
what you're saying though is that

852
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,839
cannabis can make these

853
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:58,319
changes just pretty much in

854
00:33:53,839 --> 00:34:01,359
overnight yeah then in a couple days

855
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:04,798
it can change now a shade leaf is a

856
00:34:01,359 --> 00:34:07,359
thinner leaf and a sunleaf is thicker

857
00:34:04,798 --> 00:34:09,119
and a thin leaf doesn't just become

858
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:12,239
thick overnight that's for sure

859
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,280
but the chloroplasts inside the leaf

860
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:15,759
orient

861
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,839
um if you can imagine if you took your

862
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,639
hand and held it flat in low light it'd

863
00:34:17,838 --> 00:34:20,078
be flat

864
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,480
then you give it highlight within

865
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:25,679
minutes the chloroplasts turn on an

866
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,519
edge so that they don't

867
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,878
have so much light shining on them and

868
00:34:27,519 --> 00:34:31,838
then the light penetrates

869
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,279
deeper into the leaf so there's an

870
00:34:31,838 --> 00:34:36,398
example of

871
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:37,599
the change that happens in minutes and

872
00:34:36,398 --> 00:34:40,000
certainly within an

873
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,960
hour as a plant goes from low light to

874
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,280
highlight

875
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:45,358
and then in highlight the next set of

876
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,720
leaves which starts to come out a few

877
00:34:45,358 --> 00:34:50,239
days later

878
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,118
is a highlight leaf so if the plant has

879
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,918
a short-term

880
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,240
adaption that's rapid and then a more

881
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:59,598
profound long-term adaption

882
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,479
to the highlight but i've seen some

883
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,960
really good

884
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:03,519
growers that oh my they inch that light

885
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
up just

886
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:09,599
50 micro moles a day and

887
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,560
i'm thinking they could go much faster

888
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:13,680
than that

889
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:14,159
in in terms of optimizing production per

890
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,440
unit

891
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:19,118
area i mean if you have the capability

892
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,280
of giving them high light

893
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,160
i would give them highlight so that they

894
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,720
can just

895
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:28,719
ramp up faster and start growing faster

896
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:30,000
yeah i've always heard about 10 a day

897
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:32,480
was sort of the

898
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,440
the rule with leds in terms of ramping

899
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,119
them up

900
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:39,920
um it sounds like we could maybe

901
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:41,760
adjust that uh one one question that had

902
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,280
me thinking about was

903
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,119
since we're changing the photo period so

904
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,440
dramatically with cannabis

905
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,240
indoors and that's not really something

906
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,880
that

907
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:54,879
we you know we can change necessarily

908
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,320
how do we best utilize light would it be

909
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:01,920
better to

910
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:05,280
say ramp up the light uh intensity the

911
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,838
the ppfd uh prior

912
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,880
to flipping to a 12 12 cycle while

913
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:11,599
you're still in veg

914
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,000
or is it better to keep the light

915
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,680
because

916
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,199
you're using lower light levels in veg

917
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:18,719
traditionally in the facility

918
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,480
when we make that jump is it better to

919
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,078
do it before switching the photo period

920
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:24,240
or after have you seen any research on

921
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:29,119
that

922
00:36:24,239 --> 00:36:31,439
so this is where is instantaneous light

923
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,240
micro moles per meter squared per second

924
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,079
interacts with daily light integral

925
00:36:34,239 --> 00:36:38,639
because we're always drawing cannabis at

926
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:40,400
18 hour roughly 18 hour photographs make

927
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:42,559
sure it stays in veg

928
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,440
and then we switch to 12 hour photo

929
00:36:42,559 --> 00:36:45,279
periods

930
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,000
so if you didn't change the intensity

931
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,680
you just cut the light by two thirds

932
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:52,960
but going from 18 to six or you cut it

933
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:57,039
to two thirds of

934
00:36:52,960 --> 00:37:00,079
what it was that's a huge change

935
00:36:57,039 --> 00:37:01,519
and given that the plants perform based

936
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,800
on daily light integral

937
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:08,079
you can ramp it way up in

938
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,920
in the uh if they

939
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:12,720
let's see if i did the math you know if

940
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,440
you're at roughly 600 micro moles for 18

941
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:16,639
hours

942
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,280
you'd go to 1 000 micro moles for 12

943
00:37:16,639 --> 00:37:20,000
hours

944
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,880
and the plants would have the exact same

945
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,199
daily light

946
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:24,160
integral even though you increase the

947
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:27,039
intensity it's

948
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:28,239
less time so that i think that's common

949
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,719
to do

950
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,000
um sure you could you could ramp the

951
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,159
light up in veg

952
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:36,880
um but i think the plants will adapt

953
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:40,480
just fine even if you don't do that

954
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,079
okay so keeping the dli closer

955
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,039
yeah keep the dli the same okay

956
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,400
um okay so talking about uh light

957
00:37:47,039 --> 00:37:50,320
intensity there when we

958
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,680
when you mention the amount of micro

959
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:55,838
moles

960
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:58,000
uh what and this is a tricky question

961
00:37:55,838 --> 00:37:59,920
but what are you hearing is optimal for

962
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,719
cannabis i get asked this question a

963
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,440
fair bit

964
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,719
i hear numbers around a thousand up as

965
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,720
high as 1200

966
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,799
i realize that some of your research has

967
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:10,000
shown that cannabis can handle much

968
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,480
higher levels

969
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:13,199
of light but when we're talking about

970
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,199
the cost of

971
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,879
wattage and i realize that you know the

972
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,919
value of the crop

973
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:20,640
you know what you're what you're going

974
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,920
to be able to get for the crop what the

975
00:38:20,639 --> 00:38:23,920
cost of your electricity and your

976
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,519
facility is all of these things are

977
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,960
going to be factors but

978
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:32,239
do you have a general recommendation

979
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,880
for optimal levels

980
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:36,879
sure um now when we say optimal

981
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:44,000
we usually mean an economic optimum

982
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:47,358
yes and the return on investment for

983
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,119
per unit of electric power and then

984
00:38:47,358 --> 00:38:50,719
to be really comprehensive it's the

985
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,920
return on investment for the whole

986
00:38:50,719 --> 00:38:55,279
facility

987
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,240
that all the costs there's so many

988
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,640
fixed costs in a facility you can afford

989
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,559
to be

990
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:03,279
sub-optimal electrically but your

991
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,599
overall return on investments better

992
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,640
because the yield goes up let's say

993
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,440
grams per watt

994
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:14,639
how's that for a standard grams per watt

995
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,119
would be would typically peak

996
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:22,799
at maybe five or six hundred micromoles

997
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:27,838
some really fairly low level of light

998
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:29,920
but if we do grams per watt per meter

999
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:31,599
because you have to calculate the area

1000
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,960
in there okay

1001
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:36,559
now it's going to peak more like 1000 or

1002
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,960
1200

1003
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:40,480
okay because it's the area's in there as

1004
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,519
well

1005
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:45,599
and cannabis as as i pointed out in

1006
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:47,280
previous videos it was just

1007
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:49,599
certainly a highlight crop oh it

1008
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,240
responds just beautifully to some

1009
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:53,119
real highlight so we have pushed it in

1010
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:57,358
some studies

1011
00:39:53,119 --> 00:40:00,640
higher than that pushed it to 1600

1012
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:03,598
and the yield keeps going up but

1013
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:04,960
you had 30 percent more light and the

1014
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,599
yield goes up

1015
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,880
maybe 15 so there's a decreasing return

1016
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:13,359
on investment to

1017
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,838
push it with higher and higher light and

1018
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:19,519
the capital costs go up

1019
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,920
he's got to buy all those lights and

1020
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,800
lots of lots of other input costs go up

1021
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,079
at higher

1022
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:30,560
light levels it also depends on how

1023
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,760
optimal a grower is able to keep the

1024
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:34,318
root zone

1025
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:35,200
the nutrients and water have to be just

1026
00:40:34,318 --> 00:40:38,239
right

1027
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:40,399
all the time if and you don't have much

1028
00:40:38,239 --> 00:40:42,879
margin for error in highlight

1029
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,440
you're driving a race car at 600 miles

1030
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
an hour

1031
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,240
and you better have good tires and good

1032
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:51,039
brakes and a good steering wheel

1033
00:40:48,239 --> 00:40:52,000
and all the other things have to be

1034
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:54,318
co-optimized

1035
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
with that higher knight because it's

1036
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,759
it's harder

1037
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,640
to get everything optimal if the light

1038
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,000
input is real high

1039
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,838
yeah i wanted to touch on that because

1040
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,358
you've you know you've repeatedly said

1041
00:41:03,838 --> 00:41:07,358
that

1042
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,880
in order to run higher light conditions

1043
00:41:07,358 --> 00:41:11,920
you have to have

1044
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:13,358
optimal grow conditions which which

1045
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,760
i just want to be clear you're

1046
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:18,880
referencing more water

1047
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,160
more nutrients more

1048
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,200
co2 i assume um

1049
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:28,000
in order to achieve this i mean let me

1050
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,318
let me clarify that a little first of

1051
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,880
all

1052
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:31,679
you always want to be enriching with co2

1053
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,559
and

1054
00:41:31,679 --> 00:41:35,598
most of the effect is optimal at a

1055
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:38,318
thousand

1056
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:40,240
you get a little bit more to go to 1200

1057
00:41:38,318 --> 00:41:42,719
this is parts per million

1058
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,838
co2 you just always want to be

1059
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,519
optimizing that

1060
00:41:43,838 --> 00:41:51,039
it's lots of advantages and the cost is

1061
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:51,039
tiny to to do then

1062
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,079
nutrients if you're watering

1063
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,318
with a liquid fertilizer

1064
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:02,560
you automatically get more nutrients

1065
00:42:00,318 --> 00:42:05,920
when you go to higher light

1066
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:09,119
because the plant will use more water

1067
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,760
if you if you double the light the water

1068
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:12,480
use

1069
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,079
roughly doubles if your water always has

1070
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,838
the nutrient solution in it is what

1071
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,079
you're

1072
00:42:15,838 --> 00:42:19,119
watering with the nutrient solution okay

1073
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,640
so you

1074
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,400
put twice as much water on you

1075
00:42:20,639 --> 00:42:23,838
automatically put twice as much

1076
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,200
nutrients on

1077
00:42:23,838 --> 00:42:29,039
uh if it's a slow release fertilizer if

1078
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,399
it's coming in some of the ways young

1079
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:32,159
then you do have to increase the

1080
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,599
fertilizer just because you're going to

1081
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:36,879
have a bigger plant

1082
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:41,599
with with higher light so it's

1083
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:41,599
it's getting it right all all the time

1084
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,358
all hours of the day not and especially

1085
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:48,719
water

1086
00:42:45,358 --> 00:42:52,159
just making sure plants not gonna

1087
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:54,239
run out of water so we

1088
00:42:52,159 --> 00:42:56,799
i i work with a facility that did a

1089
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,919
trial a lighting trial

1090
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,599
and they were able to increase their

1091
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:00,800
yields quite dramatically by switching

1092
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,599
from

1093
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,839
double-ended hps over to a full-spectrum

1094
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:09,039
led light

1095
00:43:05,838 --> 00:43:12,318
however they also were looking at using

1096
00:43:09,039 --> 00:43:15,199
you know hps in veg and then

1097
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:17,119
flowering in led and different

1098
00:43:15,199 --> 00:43:20,239
combinations of such so

1099
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,480
so you know using leds for veg and then

1100
00:43:20,239 --> 00:43:26,479
flowering and with hps

1101
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:30,000
and they got significantly different

1102
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,039
yields on the final crop based on

1103
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,440
what that combination of you know

1104
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:38,559
lighting technology was

1105
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:40,159
um how do you have any information

1106
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:42,400
relating to

1107
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:44,159
transitioning from lighting technologies

1108
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,920
one to another i've heard people say

1109
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:50,159
you know going from uh led to hbs is

1110
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,920
fine but going from hbs

1111
00:43:50,159 --> 00:43:55,199
to led is or maybe i'm confusing him now

1112
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:58,800
is a little trickier

1113
00:43:55,199 --> 00:44:02,399
well let's let's take the the old days

1114
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:04,318
before leds with cannabis production

1115
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,440
and in the old days it might have been

1116
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:08,559
like 10 years ago

1117
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,720
i mean it's sorry the old days they

1118
00:44:08,559 --> 00:44:14,159
weren't that long ago

1119
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:17,199
everyone always used metal halide lights

1120
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:18,318
for veg and high pressure sodium for

1121
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:22,399
flowering

1122
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:24,480
do you remember that then oh totally i

1123
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:26,160
yeah and then i use the cmh lights which

1124
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,240
are popular again now because there's a

1125
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:31,920
lot more options on them

1126
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:34,159
um definitely so when you if you ask

1127
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:36,000
people why why do you do that they just

1128
00:44:34,159 --> 00:44:37,199
well that's it's always been done that

1129
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,719
way

1130
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:43,759
but in reality what was happening was

1131
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:47,199
metal halide lights have a lot of 30

1132
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,400
blue photons way high blue photons

1133
00:44:47,199 --> 00:44:53,838
that kept the plants short in veg

1134
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,880
which is a good thing but metal halide

1135
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:57,759
lights are not very

1136
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,160
efficient electrically so when you went

1137
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,240
to

1138
00:44:58,159 --> 00:45:04,960
flowering where the height was already

1139
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,759
mostly established then you could use

1140
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,920
the

1141
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:09,839
high pressure sodium which are more

1142
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,318
efficient electrically and you can give

1143
00:45:09,838 --> 00:45:12,880
them

1144
00:45:10,318 --> 00:45:14,079
much higher light levels so without

1145
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:16,640
knowing

1146
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:18,960
really the underlying reasons people

1147
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:22,078
were doing something reasonable given

1148
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,240
a lot of blue photons to keep them short

1149
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:27,039
keep make the plants short early and

1150
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:29,358
then just using a really efficient light

1151
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:29,358
later

1152
00:45:30,318 --> 00:45:35,920
our studies if anything high pressure

1153
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:38,960
sodium is a near perfect spectrum

1154
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,519
it's four percent blue um it's got

1155
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:44,639
plenty of green it's got some red

1156
00:45:41,519 --> 00:45:45,679
um it's it's a good spectrum for growing

1157
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:48,879
plants

1158
00:45:45,679 --> 00:45:50,480
but now of course leds have passed up

1159
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,760
high pressure sodium

1160
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,960
by quite a bit in efficiency

1161
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:58,560
so they're they're certainly been coming

1162
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,559
on strong

1163
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:03,039
but it really isn't because the spectra

1164
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:05,679
is better

1165
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:07,679
leds with the high fraction of blue blue

1166
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:08,639
photons are not as photosynthetically

1167
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:12,318
efficient

1168
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:13,039
as red photons so you don't want to put

1169
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:15,119
more blue

1170
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,239
in your fixture than you need just

1171
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:18,960
enough to

1172
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:22,078
keep the plants short keep in making

1173
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,838
photo protective pigments

1174
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,280
and that's something we're studying in

1175
00:46:23,838 --> 00:46:29,759
detail now on a range of crops but

1176
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,160
what's the minimum amount of blue and

1177
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,680
it's somewhere between

1178
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:40,318
about three percent and maybe

1179
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:43,440
10 percent depending on plant species

1180
00:46:40,318 --> 00:46:46,639
but a lot of lights have 15 20 even

1181
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,800
25 percent blue

1182
00:46:46,639 --> 00:46:53,039
and that's a that's not an optimal

1183
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:59,519
spectrum for photosynthesis

1184
00:46:53,039 --> 00:46:59,519
um and it may keep the plants too short

1185
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:04,400
um so i want to talk about since we're

1186
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:06,639
kind of getting into this idea of

1187
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:07,519
commercial led lights but before we do i

1188
00:47:06,639 --> 00:47:10,400
had one more

1189
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:13,358
spectral question for you here does the

1190
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:15,358
660 to 680 nanometers play a part in the

1191
00:47:13,358 --> 00:47:16,078
increase of anthocyanin production in

1192
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:18,480
plants

1193
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,720
and is its level too high in current

1194
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,079
grow lights

1195
00:47:20,719 --> 00:47:27,759
um that's 660 to 600 to 680

1196
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:30,680
that's all those are all red photons um

1197
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,240
no they do not uniquely enhance

1198
00:47:30,679 --> 00:47:35,759
anthocyanins

1199
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:38,558
blue photons do blue photons enhance

1200
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:39,839
anthocyanins which are the red pigments

1201
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:42,559
in plants

1202
00:47:39,838 --> 00:47:43,358
and that red pigment is one of the most

1203
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:46,960
classic

1204
00:47:43,358 --> 00:47:50,838
photo protective pigments why do plants

1205
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,920
make red pigments it's to protect them

1206
00:47:50,838 --> 00:47:59,358
against excess light and

1207
00:47:53,920 --> 00:48:01,760
too much protect them against uv light

1208
00:47:59,358 --> 00:48:02,799
those photoprotective pigments absorb

1209
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,200
photons

1210
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:07,200
and they don't cause photosynthesis

1211
00:48:05,199 --> 00:48:09,279
anthocyanins that's

1212
00:48:07,199 --> 00:48:11,598
red lettuce grows slower than green

1213
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,160
lettuce because those red photons are

1214
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:17,359
blocking some of the light

1215
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:20,480
but to more specifically answer this

1216
00:48:17,358 --> 00:48:23,838
red light doesn't trigger them no

1217
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,159
okay it's blue light does that's why my

1218
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:27,358
uh

1219
00:48:24,159 --> 00:48:28,639
purple varieties of uh tomatoes grow so

1220
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:31,920
much slower

1221
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:34,318
than my other tomatoes it seems like

1222
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,599
yeah yeah you get the price to pay for

1223
00:48:34,318 --> 00:48:37,920
that nice color

1224
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,519
yes well higher in antioxidants too

1225
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:41,039
there's supposedly more nutritious that

1226
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:44,400
was the trade off that's right

1227
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:47,119
that's right yeah yeah that's right

1228
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,480
okay well let's talk about commercial

1229
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,519
led lights

1230
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,039
uh how do you go about evaluating them

1231
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:55,199
you know it seems like we've moved to

1232
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,440
full spectrum lights with leds

1233
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:58,239
that we've moved away from that bluish

1234
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,880
purple

1235
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:01,519
color so we can now see our plants again

1236
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,800
which i'm

1237
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:07,440
grateful for what what should

1238
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,160
as a as a grower if i were to outfit a

1239
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,000
facility

1240
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:11,519
what questions should i be asking a

1241
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:16,880
company that makes

1242
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:19,920
led lights so i think the first one is

1243
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,200
just was real simple it's

1244
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,960
what's the cost per watt of fixture

1245
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,558
because the last thing manufacturers

1246
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,599
want you to know is what the fixture

1247
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,800
costs

1248
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:34,318
but obviously if you're getting a

1249
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,559
600 watt fixture and and a 300 watt you

1250
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,000
can pay twice as much for the 600 watt

1251
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:41,680
fixture so

1252
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:44,559
um that's a simple ratio but

1253
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:46,159
knowing what you get cost per one then

1254
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,920
after that

1255
00:49:46,159 --> 00:49:52,239
it's the efficacy of the fixture

1256
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:53,519
which is measured in micro moles per

1257
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:55,199
joule

1258
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,239
but it's really the output of the

1259
00:49:55,199 --> 00:50:01,759
fixture divided by the electrical

1260
00:49:58,239 --> 00:50:02,639
input to the fixture this is explained

1261
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,640
in

1262
00:50:02,639 --> 00:50:06,799
some of my papers and some of my talks

1263
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:06,799
but

1264
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,480
one way to think about this is the micro

1265
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:14,558
moles per second

1266
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,599
out divided by by watts

1267
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:20,160
of the electric input

1268
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:21,838
fixtures can vary quite a bit in that

1269
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:24,639
efficacy

1270
00:50:21,838 --> 00:50:25,679
and if the manufacturer has paid to get

1271
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:28,719
more efficient

1272
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:29,519
leds in there the fixture is worth more

1273
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:33,598
money

1274
00:50:29,519 --> 00:50:36,559
because the the light output is better

1275
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:38,559
so you could also you could say how many

1276
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,280
moles of photons does this fixture put

1277
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:41,599
out

1278
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,480
and how many watts of electricity does

1279
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,640
it

1280
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:46,318
have coming in and then what's the cost

1281
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:49,440
of the fixture

1282
00:50:46,318 --> 00:50:53,440
those are just very fundamental

1283
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:55,039
ratios in considering a fixture

1284
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,200
and lots of people still use high

1285
00:50:55,039 --> 00:51:00,800
pressure sodium because the pictures are

1286
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:04,799
so cheap they're yeah just remarkably

1287
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:08,800
cheap um so after that

1288
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:10,960
after we're dollars and photons out

1289
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,000
one consideration that people need to

1290
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,639
think about is

1291
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:15,679
how much focusing of the light do they

1292
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:18,719
want

1293
00:51:15,679 --> 00:51:20,719
it's possible to make leds very focused

1294
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:23,519
put a lens on the led

1295
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:24,318
and they can be very focused almost like

1296
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,679
a laser

1297
00:51:24,318 --> 00:51:30,000
of light and that's both good and bad

1298
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:31,199
it's good if you know exactly where you

1299
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,039
want the light

1300
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,558
don't shine it on the aisle put it on

1301
00:51:33,039 --> 00:51:36,639
these plants

1302
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,160
but it's extremely difficult to get

1303
00:51:36,639 --> 00:51:42,078
uniform light

1304
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:44,719
if your fixtures are so that focused

1305
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:46,079
so often high pressure sodium we mount

1306
00:51:44,719 --> 00:51:48,838
them up high

1307
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,079
they spread the light out the light goes

1308
00:51:48,838 --> 00:51:52,719
everywhere

1309
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:54,480
and and you say well some of it falls on

1310
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:56,879
the aisles it's wasted

1311
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,559
but it's also real uniform over the

1312
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:01,119
whole crop

1313
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,160
and that's something leds have been

1314
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:04,559
working on is

1315
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:06,318
spreading the light out more not making

1316
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,880
it less focused

1317
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,358
so the photons get spread out over a

1318
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,640
bigger

1319
00:52:09,358 --> 00:52:13,199
area and and the result is more uniform

1320
00:52:12,639 --> 00:52:16,799
light

1321
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:19,679
for the for the plants so

1322
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,720
to summarize this it's really cost of

1323
00:52:19,679 --> 00:52:24,480
the fixture

1324
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:27,759
wattage output efficiency

1325
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:31,358
or or efficacy of the fixture

1326
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:34,480
and then beam spread of the photons

1327
00:52:31,358 --> 00:52:36,558
is it can you want focus photons or do

1328
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,760
you want spread out photons

1329
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,880
thinking about the application

1330
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:46,880
so that the photons are uniform and they

1331
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:49,599
maximally fall on leaf surfaces

1332
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,838
now to further complicate things if i'm

1333
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:53,519
understanding you correctly from

1334
00:52:51,838 --> 00:52:55,440
what you were saying earlier the

1335
00:52:53,519 --> 00:52:58,159
spectrum also

1336
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,280
influences the efficiency of the light

1337
00:52:58,159 --> 00:53:02,799
if there were more

1338
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:04,720
blue leds in the light it's going to be

1339
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:07,440
a less efficient light is that

1340
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:08,078
is that right was i getting that correct

1341
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,960
tip

1342
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,079
well typically we don't put usually just

1343
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,440
blue leds

1344
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:16,559
the blue leds come from white um leds

1345
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,200
but it's a blue

1346
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:21,040
led with a phosphor coating okay that

1347
00:53:19,199 --> 00:53:24,318
fluoresces and gives us white

1348
00:53:21,039 --> 00:53:25,039
light so we don't usually see fixtures

1349
00:53:24,318 --> 00:53:28,800
with just

1350
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:30,800
just blue we see white leds and reds

1351
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,880
those two colors are that's that's

1352
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:36,160
becoming a very common

1353
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,480
led fixture and it's very effective

1354
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:40,879
it's just the ratios of the whites and

1355
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:44,318
the reds

1356
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:45,838
and that ratio will affect efficiency

1357
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,759
yes it does the efficiency rating i

1358
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:50,159
guess the more reds you put in

1359
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:52,240
the the more efficient the light because

1360
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:56,799
the reds are more efficient than the

1361
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:58,479
lights okay so

1362
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,559
this is going to probably be a dumb

1363
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:01,679
question but i'm going to ask it anyway

1364
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:03,760
because

1365
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:05,039
i don't know the answer uh when it comes

1366
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,160
to photons

1367
00:54:05,039 --> 00:54:08,719
and hitting a canopy i've heard claims

1368
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:12,239
that

1369
00:54:08,719 --> 00:54:14,480
you know certain lights are more

1370
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:16,399
more effective at infiltrating a canopy

1371
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,199
as in penetrating deeper so you have

1372
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:20,639
less light

1373
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:22,558
fall off over a given distance

1374
00:54:20,639 --> 00:54:24,159
how does that work is that is that

1375
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,920
accurate are we going to see big

1376
00:54:24,159 --> 00:54:29,519
variations between different lighting

1377
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:29,519
manufacturers on something like that

1378
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,039
and i know there's lots of claims that

1379
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,720
this

1380
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:39,279
two factors affect it and the second one

1381
00:54:36,719 --> 00:54:40,480
people don't often think about the first

1382
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,640
one is green light

1383
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,760
green light penetrates deeper than the

1384
00:54:42,639 --> 00:54:45,679
other colors

1385
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:47,760
because it's reflected off the leaves

1386
00:54:45,679 --> 00:54:50,399
and it bounces around and gets

1387
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,119
lower in the canopy so green light is

1388
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:55,920
helpful

1389
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:59,920
for penetrating canopies but

1390
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:03,920
the bigger factor is the ratio of direct

1391
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:06,400
photons to diffuse photons

1392
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,240
direct photons would be like a sunny day

1393
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,280
where the light's just shining straight

1394
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:11,838
down

1395
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,119
and diffuse photons are like a cloudy

1396
00:55:11,838 --> 00:55:16,239
day when it's coming from

1397
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:18,559
all directions and diffuse light

1398
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,118
penetrates canopies much better than

1399
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,798
direct

1400
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:26,400
light if it's coming from all directions

1401
00:55:22,798 --> 00:55:26,400
let me use an analogy here

1402
00:55:27,039 --> 00:55:33,838
this might have to be with a

1403
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:36,400
flower because i can't really use bbs

1404
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,798
for this analogy but if you were gonna

1405
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:40,960
put put a scoop of flour on a plant and

1406
00:55:38,798 --> 00:55:43,358
you just dumped it straight down

1407
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,119
the flower would stick to the top leaves

1408
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:46,159
and it wouldn't penetrate down to the

1409
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:48,079
lower leaves

1410
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:50,798
but what if you took your scoop a flower

1411
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:54,000
and shook it so it made a cloud of dust

1412
00:55:50,798 --> 00:55:56,079
and that came in all directions

1413
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:58,480
you would get more flour on the lower

1414
00:55:56,079 --> 00:56:02,400
leaves of the canopy

1415
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:05,519
and that analogy is like diffuse light

1416
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:07,519
and high pressure sodium then leads to

1417
00:56:05,519 --> 00:56:08,480
quite diffuse light because a lot of the

1418
00:56:07,519 --> 00:56:11,119
photons

1419
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,960
come out of the fixture sideways and

1420
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,079
they're going into plants

1421
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:18,559
three rows over at a low angle

1422
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,160
and those protons can penetrate the

1423
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:22,079
canopy better

1424
00:56:20,159 --> 00:56:24,960
than direct then ones that shoot

1425
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:28,960
straight down from the top

1426
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:32,000
so fixtures that spread

1427
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:33,679
have a big beam spread spread the light

1428
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:35,838
out better

1429
00:56:33,679 --> 00:56:36,798
lead to more better penetration of

1430
00:56:35,838 --> 00:56:40,639
photons

1431
00:56:36,798 --> 00:56:42,400
into canopies and diffuse light means

1432
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,318
light from multiple directions so it

1433
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,079
comes in sideways it comes in straight

1434
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:48,798
down

1435
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:50,160
that's a that's a bigger factor of

1436
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:53,358
penetrating the

1437
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:56,000
canopy than the color color matters but

1438
00:56:53,358 --> 00:56:59,199
not as much as diffuse photons

1439
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,760
so i'm picturing these photons

1440
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:02,399
i guess uh bouncing off of different

1441
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,880
surfaces

1442
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:07,920
maybe you have a white wall for example

1443
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,880
next to a row of plants

1444
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,039
or bouncing off of leaves and possibly

1445
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,480
penetrating deeper that way

1446
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:16,480
do these photons

1447
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:21,759
so as i understand the spectrum defines

1448
00:57:19,679 --> 00:57:23,440
the the speed of the photon is that

1449
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,880
correct

1450
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,838
um not the speed it's the wavelength

1451
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,720
the wavelength okay they all travel at

1452
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:32,719
the speed of light

1453
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,200
it's the it's the well that's not as

1454
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,000
obvious as it might seem but

1455
00:57:39,199 --> 00:57:42,960
but it's the uh the wavelength of the

1456
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:45,760
vibration

1457
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:46,318
level of the photon so the vibration

1458
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,480
level

1459
00:57:46,318 --> 00:57:49,519
i guess i'm picturing like this at this

1460
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:51,599
agitation

1461
00:57:49,519 --> 00:57:53,199
does that allows for different levels of

1462
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:56,079
penetration

1463
00:57:53,199 --> 00:57:58,399
into a leaf or off or bouncing off of a

1464
00:57:56,079 --> 00:57:58,400
surface

1465
00:57:59,199 --> 00:58:07,199
um let me here's another analogy

1466
00:58:03,838 --> 00:58:10,480
this this is a confusing thing this this

1467
00:58:07,199 --> 00:58:14,239
frequency of the electrons

1468
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:17,599
if we had blue photons or high energy

1469
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:19,358
and high energy would be like a bunch of

1470
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:21,599
third graders

1471
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:22,480
and as the wavelength gets longer these

1472
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:24,798
the

1473
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,480
you could consider it by analogy the

1474
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:28,960
photons are getting older

1475
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:30,639
and by the time you get out to red

1476
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:34,000
photons

1477
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:36,480
they're like a 70 year old they are not

1478
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:39,760
moving as fast as the third graders

1479
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:43,760
you know and bouncing around everywhere

1480
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:45,920
but both of those get

1481
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:47,280
that's that's an analogy for energy of

1482
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:50,318
the photons

1483
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,798
but the plant doesn't care what the

1484
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:55,920
energy level of the photon is

1485
00:58:52,798 --> 00:58:57,838
one high energy third grader photon

1486
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,838
causes the exact amount of

1487
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:03,759
photosynthesis as one

1488
00:58:59,838 --> 00:59:04,239
low energy longer wavelength photon

1489
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:07,200
after

1490
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:08,318
it's absorbed okay photosynthetic

1491
00:59:07,199 --> 00:59:11,199
pigments

1492
00:59:08,318 --> 00:59:12,159
but no that it's just a matter of

1493
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:15,199
absorption and

1494
00:59:12,159 --> 00:59:17,598
blue photons and red photons are

1495
00:59:15,199 --> 00:59:18,960
very highly absorbed right in the

1496
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:21,519
surface of the leaf

1497
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:23,599
they don't bounce off so they don't

1498
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:26,079
penetrate the canopy

1499
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:29,200
green protons bounce off and they rattle

1500
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:33,119
around and they penetrate deeper

1501
00:59:29,199 --> 00:59:33,919
so at what point then do we determine

1502
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:37,519
that a leaf

1503
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:38,798
is a is a nutrient sink versus a

1504
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,559
photosynthetic

1505
00:59:38,798 --> 00:59:45,358
benefit to a plant is there a

1506
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:47,119
certain you know ppfd if we're using a

1507
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:48,239
light meter where we could hold it down

1508
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:52,079
and say okay

1509
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:53,919
we're getting down to 400 or 200 ppfd

1510
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:56,240
here underneath the canopy these these

1511
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:59,519
leaves need to go

1512
00:59:56,239 --> 01:00:02,558
yep for sure people spend

1513
00:59:59,519 --> 01:00:05,358
a lot of time pruning canopies we

1514
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:06,160
we don't prune we've been the reason we

1515
01:00:05,358 --> 01:00:09,358
don't prune

1516
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:12,159
is those old leaves automatically

1517
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,279
translocate their nutrients and their

1518
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:16,318
carbon

1519
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:19,599
up to the younger leaves of the canopy

1520
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:22,239
they they don't die and fall off and

1521
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:25,119
take all these resources with them

1522
01:00:22,239 --> 01:00:27,039
they they move it to the younger leaves

1523
01:00:25,119 --> 01:00:30,640
and if you take those off

1524
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:32,880
you're removing nutrients and and

1525
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:35,440
carbon compounds that could be used by

1526
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:39,760
the top of the canopy

1527
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,639
now we do prune when we have inadequate

1528
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,240
air flow

1529
01:00:40,639 --> 01:00:47,279
for disease reasons pruning really helps

1530
01:00:44,239 --> 01:00:49,679
move air and minimize disease

1531
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,119
but many people prune thinking that

1532
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:54,239
those old leaves are bad

1533
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:57,599
for the plants get them out of here

1534
01:00:54,239 --> 01:01:00,159
but we get very high yields without

1535
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:01,720
pruning because those leaves are

1536
01:01:00,159 --> 01:01:04,879
translocating

1537
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:06,399
re-mobilizing their resources into the

1538
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,920
top of the canopy

1539
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,440
and if you cut them off they can't do

1540
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:11,200
that

1541
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,639
i'm picturing like a fruit tree in the

1542
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:16,879
fall where it sends its sugars back into

1543
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:18,798
the plant itself for stores for the for

1544
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:19,119
winter to make it until the next year is

1545
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:21,440
that

1546
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:24,798
essentially what you're that referencing

1547
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:27,039
yeah no that's exactly right

1548
01:01:24,798 --> 01:01:28,559
those leaves that fall off of all trees

1549
01:01:27,039 --> 01:01:30,880
not just fruit trees

1550
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:33,040
don't have very many nutrients in them

1551
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,280
the plant took them back in

1552
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:38,318
before winter and stored them in the

1553
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:41,760
trunk of the tree

1554
01:01:38,318 --> 01:01:43,119
so i i have so many questions but i'm

1555
01:01:41,760 --> 01:01:44,559
going to narrow it down to just a couple

1556
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,680
more so i don't keep you on the phone

1557
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:48,480
too much longer

1558
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:49,679
yeah i think we're coming up in a little

1559
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,679
over an hour already

1560
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:53,039
all right this will be fast so uh real

1561
01:01:51,679 --> 01:01:55,358
quick i'm seeing

1562
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:56,639
lenses on more and more leds have you

1563
01:01:55,358 --> 01:02:00,239
done any research

1564
01:01:56,639 --> 01:02:02,400
with the use of lenses to focus light

1565
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:04,719
in relation to cannabis or indoor indoor

1566
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:08,480
plants

1567
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:11,038
yes um it's if we think of lenses as

1568
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:14,079
focus electron also spread it out too

1569
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:17,599
depends if the lens is convex or concave

1570
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,039
um but as a very general rule i see more

1571
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,920
fixtures where they're spreading the

1572
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:24,640
light out to get a more uniform

1573
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,119
amount of photons in a canopy and also

1574
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:27,038
to help

1575
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,240
kind of get those sideways photons

1576
01:02:27,039 --> 01:02:31,920
penetrating

1577
01:02:28,239 --> 01:02:33,038
deeper in the canopy so this is a type

1578
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,358
of lens that

1579
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,720
does the opposite of focusing it it

1580
01:02:35,358 --> 01:02:39,519
unfocuses the

1581
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:41,279
photons and spreads them out more

1582
01:02:39,519 --> 01:02:45,199
sideways

1583
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:47,680
okay so how useful then is really uh

1584
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,199
changing spectrum in in light some

1585
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,759
lights give you the ability to do that

1586
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:52,719
other lights don't the ones that don't i

1587
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:54,079
hear

1588
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,078
the common things saying growers are

1589
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,760
more likely to you know

1590
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:59,280
screw things up than actually make any

1591
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:02,559
benefit based on where our current

1592
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,798
research is on lighting spectrum

1593
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,240
do you have thoughts on that tuning

1594
01:03:04,798 --> 01:03:09,038
tuning the lights

1595
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,759
comes at the cost of the total number of

1596
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:12,240
photons

1597
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,240
as it comes at the cost of fixture

1598
01:03:12,239 --> 01:03:15,759
efficiency

1599
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:18,000
when you when you start adjusting them

1600
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,240
it's it's always takes a little bit more

1601
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:24,480
electricity to do that

1602
01:03:20,239 --> 01:03:26,719
um and even though it's possible to

1603
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:28,559
change the spectrum over time and and

1604
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:32,480
there's if you do that you can

1605
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:35,760
have benefits but gosh

1606
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:38,639
if for me i would take a fixed spectrum

1607
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:40,480
that then and i would take the total

1608
01:03:38,639 --> 01:03:42,400
intensity of photons i would

1609
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,000
take an efficient fixture that gave me a

1610
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:45,920
lot of light

1611
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:50,159
rather than one where i could change the

1612
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,159
colors that gave me less light

1613
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:56,798
so as a rule of thumb

1614
01:03:53,519 --> 01:04:00,719
i like fixed spectra because you get

1615
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,719
more light per unit of electricity

1616
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:05,119
now research-wise is another matter sure

1617
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:07,679
you know we

1618
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,480
change colors all the time in research

1619
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:13,440
but that's different than production

1620
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:14,318
that makes sense yeah so this is my very

1621
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,400
last question

1622
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:17,679
what future research are you most

1623
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:21,200
excited about uh

1624
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:21,199
right now in the world of lighting

1625
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:29,038
oh we are continuing to

1626
01:04:25,358 --> 01:04:31,038
investigate ultraviolet light

1627
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:33,200
and there's lots of kinds of ultraviolet

1628
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:36,640
all the way down to uvc

1629
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:37,598
using uvc potentially for short bursts

1630
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,719
of time

1631
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:43,519
for disease control and also to keep

1632
01:04:40,719 --> 01:04:43,519
plants short

1633
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,200
the studies on the potentially

1634
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:54,880
beneficial effects of uv they're just

1635
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:57,118
understudied we also have a series of

1636
01:04:54,880 --> 01:05:00,480
studies going on with the minimum

1637
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:03,760
amount of blue light that plants need

1638
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:06,639
uh we're doing a lot lots of work on

1639
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:08,240
light pollution at night how much light

1640
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:10,879
can the plants can cannabis

1641
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:12,159
tolerate cannabis is real sensitive to

1642
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,920
light pollution

1643
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:18,000
and do the colors matter at night

1644
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:20,720
that's another thing that's an active

1645
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:23,199
area of research

1646
01:05:20,719 --> 01:05:25,118
and then we talked about variable

1647
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,038
spectra over the life cycle

1648
01:05:25,119 --> 01:05:28,160
we're more interested in variable

1649
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:31,280
intensity

1650
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:33,440
over the life cycle when we put more

1651
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:35,440
photons on when could be

1652
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:39,358
be putting less photons on that's

1653
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:41,838
another active area of research for us

1654
01:05:39,358 --> 01:05:42,960
yeah i can imagine you know maximizing

1655
01:05:41,838 --> 01:05:47,599
or optimizing

1656
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:49,920
your light efficiency would have huge

1657
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:51,200
ecological impact on this industry in

1658
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:53,039
terms of the amount of

1659
01:05:51,199 --> 01:05:55,199
electricity that we're potentially you

1660
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:57,280
know quote unquote wasting

1661
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,960
uh with the way we're growing right now

1662
01:05:57,280 --> 01:06:00,640
and it's gotten more efficient

1663
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,159
compared to where it was 10 years ago

1664
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:04,078
but i'm excited to see what you guys

1665
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:07,838
come up with on that

1666
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:08,798
yeah yeah well it's yeah it's exciting

1667
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:11,599
stuff

1668
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,480
it's a it's a it's a cannabis is a new

1669
01:06:11,599 --> 01:06:16,240
crop

1670
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:18,240
sensitive to light so and

1671
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:19,519
boy it's so high value we can afford to

1672
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,598
grow it indoors

1673
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,960
under electric lights and then take

1674
01:06:21,599 --> 01:06:25,920
advantage of all the

1675
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:27,599
control we have over delivering light to

1676
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:29,039
the plants

1677
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:30,640
yeah well i sure appreciate your time

1678
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:31,200
today i learned quite a few things

1679
01:06:30,639 --> 01:06:34,078
myself

1680
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,439
