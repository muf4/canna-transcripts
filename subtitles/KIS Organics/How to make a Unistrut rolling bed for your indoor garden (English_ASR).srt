1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,879
so I recently visited Collective

2
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:11,798
elevation in Boseman Montana and I saw

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,879
that they had these awesome rolling beds

4
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:17,000
in the trays and I asked them about how

5
00:00:14,878 --> 00:00:19,278
they built these and basically they

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,839
created these Unistrut frames here's an

7
00:00:19,278 --> 00:00:24,518
example of some fixed ones that they

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:26,118
sent me also for this video and uh I

9
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:28,159
decided to try and make a rolling one so

10
00:00:26,118 --> 00:00:30,320
this is also from them as well the

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,558
rolling one that they did here now my

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,480
first attempt uh was an utter failure um

13
00:00:33,558 --> 00:00:37,679
I did not build it correctly and so I

14
00:00:36,479 --> 00:00:39,279
wanted to make this video to kind of

15
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:40,359
show you guys what I did wrong and how

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,200
to do it

17
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:44,719
better so my first stop was Home Depot

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,480
you can get everything you need there

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:49,760
with the exception of the tray or flood

20
00:00:47,479 --> 00:00:51,599
tables themselves um everything else I

21
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:54,519
got came from Home Depot and this is an

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,120
example of the Unistrut right here so

23
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,719
the next step was cutting everything to

24
00:00:56,119 --> 00:01:00,358
the proper size that I needed uh for me

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,039
I found the grinder worked the best best

26
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,159
but uh if you're handy you may have

27
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,400
other options I did try a metal blade in

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,000
my miter saw as well but whatever you

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,840
decide to do make sure that you use

30
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,759
proper protective gear um for cutting

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,799
all the

32
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:16,319
metal now there's a few different ways

33
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,560
to attach these I went with these spring

34
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:21,798
nuts uh the first time I did it I did

35
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,320
not use these and it failed miserably so

36
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:25,479
I think this was a good step up and in

37
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:28,199
the right direction um and they're not

38
00:01:25,478 --> 00:01:29,679
that expensive now the thing with them

39
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
that is a little bit tricky is you kind

40
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:36,520
of have to hold them put pressure up get

41
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,879
everything in position and then add the

42
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:40,000
bolt and then you're pushing down

43
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,039
against the tension of the spring uh

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,680
which is a little bit tricky um I'm not

45
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,920
going to lie this took me a little bit

46
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,479
to get it right um and this was

47
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,040
definitely a hassle because you're

48
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:50,399
you're pushing up with like in here I'm

49
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,920
pushing up with my left hand pushing

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,718
down with my right right hand and then

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,200
trying to tighten the socket at the same

52
00:01:53,718 --> 00:01:58,718
time uh but once you do get it started

53
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,960
it becomes pretty easy and then you can

54
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:03,359
adjust it and line every everything up

55
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,718
uh just the way you want it and it does

56
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,800
hold uh really securely once you have it

57
00:02:05,718 --> 00:02:10,159
in place so if you do have access or the

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,520
ability to use these you know and you'd

59
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:14,719
have a simple socket set um I definitely

60
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:16,920
think that's the way to

61
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:19,080
go okay so once you've built out the

62
00:02:16,919 --> 00:02:21,079
basic frame like you saw before I added

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,440
these casters that I had picked up at at

64
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:25,959
Harbor Freight um a while back and so I

65
00:02:24,439 --> 00:02:29,079
put those on there they're attached at

66
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,680
two points from underneath um and this

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,519
was the way I put on Wheels I think I

68
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,560
put on uh six wheels alog

69
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:39,200
together now I also want to give a shout

70
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,280
out to Greg lson uh he came up with

71
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:44,479
another design using these connectors

72
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,439
and he's using this in his facilities

73
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:49,318
he's able to get three connections then

74
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:51,158
with his casters and one recommendation

75
00:02:49,318 --> 00:02:53,238
that he did make that I thought was a

76
00:02:51,158 --> 00:02:54,840
good one was to use larger casters

77
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,599
that's something I didn't do and if I

78
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,120
could go back and rebuild it um I

79
00:02:56,598 --> 00:03:01,158
totally would because uh once I got the

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
soil in there there uh after building

81
00:03:01,158 --> 00:03:06,759
this bed um it was frankly really really

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,158
heavy and hard to move with that much

83
00:03:06,759 --> 00:03:10,518
soil in there I put about a yard and a

84
00:03:08,158 --> 00:03:12,919
half of total soil on here once I was

85
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:14,039
done uh but I want to show you guys uh

86
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:15,518
this is what it looked like with the

87
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:17,759
tray on there and then this is what it

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,519
looks like today with the soil um you

89
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:22,158
can see that it's it's working um it is

90
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:23,719
hard to move but because I don't have to

91
00:03:22,158 --> 00:03:25,479
move it very far I'm just moving in and

92
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:27,039
out it's okay um I'm not going to be

93
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:29,919
moving it very often it's just when I

94
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:32,919
prune so um this is going to work out

95
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:32,919
great for me hope this

96
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:36,639
helps
