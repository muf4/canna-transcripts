1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,240
last night

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,919
so sorry click yeah no problem so we had

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:09,240
our first snowfall last night but that

4
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:11,798
doesn't change the topic of of what I'm

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,559
going to speak about uh what I want to

6
00:00:11,798 --> 00:00:21,559
present to you is the updated soil food

7
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:24,640
web uh this is a uh uh a a talk that

8
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:27,358
basically goes through the science

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,560
behind organic gardening and at the end

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,118
of an hour you're going to know

11
00:00:28,559 --> 00:00:33,399
everything you need to know uh to be a

12
00:00:31,118 --> 00:00:36,159
fabulous organic Gardener and reasons

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,679
why you would not want to be uh a

14
00:00:36,159 --> 00:00:42,038
chemical Gardener but in any case I call

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:45,359
it the updated soil food web um let's

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,359
see if I can get this to

17
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:51,599
work H with all the practice we had in

18
00:00:48,479 --> 00:00:54,599
co uh I guess I got to put play yeah

19
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,600
yeah that might make some

20
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,680
sense all right there we go now I have

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,118
to do an adjustment h crazy um I don't

22
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:08,159
know if you can see that uh I I am the

23
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:10,040
author of uh let me just get this I'm

24
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,040
sorry about this

25
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:14,880
folks again with all the practice we had

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,080
during coid you'd think once it's over

27
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:21,798
we'd get it right okay so um I am the

28
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:24,560
author of uh uh the teaming with

29
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,400
microbes series uh and as a result I had

30
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,759
a Trilogy uh and I called myself Lord of

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,439
The Roots because I thought that was

32
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:33,759
kind of funny uh um and then uh these

33
00:01:31,438 --> 00:01:36,118
are the the books in the trilogy GE is

34
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,840
doing it again

35
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:42,560
uh I can fix

36
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,118
that sorry folks so the trilogy it turns

37
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,840
out uh was not enough because we did

38
00:01:45,118 --> 00:01:49,759
have coid and I had nothing else to do

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,399
so I wrote a a a fourth book uh and now

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,519
I have a

41
00:01:51,399 --> 00:01:58,840
quadrilogy um and the the books

42
00:01:54,519 --> 00:02:01,879
basically deal with the fact that plants

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,359
produce exudates things that drip out of

44
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:06,959
the root system uh by using their

45
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:09,439
photosynthetic energy and by putting

46
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:13,000
together the nutrients that it obtains

47
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:15,359
from the soil and these are the exudates

48
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,959
a great picture of the exudates and

49
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,720
these exudates attract

50
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:25,120
microbes and these microbes uh are what

51
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:27,280
run our Gardening System now you know I

52
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,360
could talk about it using this slide but

53
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,239
it's a little ununderstandable so let me

54
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,280
let me go this way uh make it a little

55
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,000
bit more understandable about 50% or so

56
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,280
of the photosynthetic energy of a plant

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,598
is used to produce things that drip out

58
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,080
of the roots you're sweating your sweat

59
00:02:43,598 --> 00:02:49,679
is the exact same thing it's an exudate

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,519
these exudates drip out of the roots and

61
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:57,080
they're designed by the plant to to

62
00:02:52,519 --> 00:03:00,039
attract bacteria and fungi because the

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:03,000
bacteria and fungi don't uh produce prod

64
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:05,280
their own carbon they love these

65
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,479
exudates because these exudates are full

66
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,360
of carbon so they're they're right there

67
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,679
next to the roots in what's known as the

68
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,920
rizosphere and they're eating away

69
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,959
having a great time and then Along Comes

70
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:21,839
their predators nematodes and protozoa

71
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,799
and the nematodes and protozoa eat the

72
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,799
fungi and the bacteria because they also

73
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,640
need carbon and there is carbon

74
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,879
contained now in those fungi and

75
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:34,039
bacteria as a result of eating the

76
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:37,280
exudates uh and the Nemos and protozoa

77
00:03:34,039 --> 00:03:39,798
devour these fungi and bacteria uh and

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,479
then they excrete the excess that they

79
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:48,080
don't need and what they excrete turns

80
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:51,598
out to be uh plant usable nutrients they

81
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,280
break down the fungi and bacteria into

82
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:57,039
nutrients that are usable by the plant

83
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,719
they actually have an electrical charge

84
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:01,798
put on them so that they can go into the

85
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:04,438
the plant and that's that's basically

86
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,760
the soil food web uh that we that we

87
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:10,479
learned in 2006 it was popularized by uh

88
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,959
a woman named Dr elen Ingam uh but even

89
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,560
that's a little too confusing uh so let

90
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,920
me let me let me show it this way and

91
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,639
then then of course you've got the the

92
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:19,519
the little guys the Nemos and the

93
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,040
protozoa get eaten by bigger guys all

94
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,079
the way on up the chain um so let's

95
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,199
let's look at it this way a bunch of

96
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:28,839
trees it's a Friday afternoon this is

97
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:30,919
Fox Island uh and these trees are

98
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,719
sitting around talking to each other uh

99
00:04:30,918 --> 00:04:34,478
through the worldwide web and one of

100
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,680
them says let's have some Japanese food

101
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,439
tonight and and a little one says we did

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,478
that last week let's have some Mexican

103
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:43,519
and the third one says no no let's have

104
00:04:41,478 --> 00:04:45,800
French but the big tree wins and so

105
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:47,839
they're going to have Japanese food uh

106
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,478
these are the roots of those trees let

107
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:52,599
me put them in root position and and all

108
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:55,918
that they have to do in order to get the

109
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,520
Japanese food is produce an exudate that

110
00:04:55,918 --> 00:05:00,560
they drip out into the into the soil

111
00:04:58,519 --> 00:05:04,000
right there in the RIS spere and they

112
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,879
attract the Japanese fungi and bacteria

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,800
that they that they are going for now if

114
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,959
one of the plants had said American food

115
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:14,478
and and and they decided to have

116
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:16,560
American food they would change the

117
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:19,079
exudate the plants are capable of

118
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,560
changing the exudates uh and dripping

119
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:25,318
them out and attracting American food so

120
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,120
they can change the exudates in order to

121
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:31,520
obtain nutrients and results that they

122
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,519
need this is this is an amazing thing

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,359
because we look at plants they can't

124
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:39,240
walk they can't run away uh they can't

125
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,360
gather things but they can uh produce

126
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,759
these exudates which do all sorts of

127
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:47,160
things uh for the plant right there in

128
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:49,360
the soil so this is the soil food web uh

129
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:51,400
that we learned back in the very early

130
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,560
days this is the basis of teeming with

131
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:56,000
microbes my first book which has been

132
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,160
translated now into 10 languages not

133
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,160
because it's a great book but because

134
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,360
this is how the we we we learned that

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:08,400
the plant feeds itself not through

136
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:10,919
Miracle Grow you know not through Peters

137
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:14,038
uh but through their own natural system

138
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:16,839
and it it got the name micro mediated

139
00:06:14,038 --> 00:06:20,199
solulab isation of soil

140
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:22,918
nutrients 2006 so this is teeming with

141
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:25,400
with bacteria and it's again a very

142
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:27,918
simple system the little guys get eaten

143
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:31,159
by the bigger guys uh and there's all

144
00:06:27,918 --> 00:06:34,038
sorts of of of consumption and Decay and

145
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,919
you end up getting nutrients uh which go

146
00:06:34,038 --> 00:06:39,240
into the soil and go into the plants

147
00:06:35,918 --> 00:06:42,639
it's a very simple system all right so

148
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:45,199
then uh several years later uh it became

149
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,240
very clear that we needed to amend that

150
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:52,000
view because there was something else

151
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:55,360
going on involving those fungi so it was

152
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,800
called micro risal fungi SYM symbiosis

153
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,479
now you remember those bacteria and

154
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,160
those fungi that that are attracted by

155
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:07,399
those exudates well some of the fungi

156
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,520
don't get eaten instead they get called

157
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:14,000
by the plant the plant sends out a

158
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:18,240
signal and they enter into the plant and

159
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,680
they move between the cells of the plant

160
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,800
and they transfer nutrients which they

161
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:29,478
obtain from the soil uh into the plant

162
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:31,639
in return for the exudates that they get

163
00:07:29,478 --> 00:07:35,240
so this is a picture of micro risal

164
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:38,160
fungi entering into a uh a root and

165
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:40,280
getting in in into the insides uh and

166
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:44,280
it's just a it's just a a fascinating

167
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:47,638
thing and it turns out that about uh 90%

168
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:49,478
of plants form this symbiotic

169
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,199
relationship and we've known about it

170
00:07:49,478 --> 00:07:53,680
since the

171
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,759
1890s uh but we were never able to

172
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,038
really duplicate the fungi and so it had

173
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:01,000
no commercial application and if there's

174
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:03,759
no commercial application scientific

175
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:07,000
research often slows down to to a

176
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,158
standstill um this is a picture of a of

177
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,240
of one of the seven different kinds this

178
00:08:09,158 --> 00:08:14,000
is an important kind that Associates

179
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:17,120
with your trees and around all your tree

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,360
roots are these hyle sheets these fungal

181
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:22,598
hyle sheets and then some of these

182
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:26,038
fungal go inside and they and they form

183
00:08:22,598 --> 00:08:29,079
uh structures in between the plant root

184
00:08:26,038 --> 00:08:31,199
cells uh and and they're very elegant

185
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:34,158
now they've been very studied uh there

186
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,800
are some 300 or so different kinds we're

187
00:08:34,158 --> 00:08:38,360
capable of making eight to 16 of them I

188
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,158
don't I can't remember what the exact

189
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:43,959
number is but they they sleep around and

190
00:08:41,158 --> 00:08:47,600
so one particular type of Micro risal

191
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:50,399
fungi will will infect and that's the

192
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:53,480
right word uh many different kinds of

193
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:57,159
plants this is the kind that uh does the

194
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:59,360
again the trees uh and then uh this is

195
00:08:57,159 --> 00:09:01,958
sort of a depiction of what what is

196
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:04,959
really going on you have all of these

197
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:07,879
wonderful small micro risal fungi that

198
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:11,838
are able to go out into the soil in an

199
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:14,480
area where the uh plant root itself

200
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,120
can't reach because it's too big and

201
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,519
they collect phosphorus and water uh

202
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,000
these are the things that they bring

203
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,600
back and they bring it back to the plant

204
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,519
and the plant says thank you very much

205
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,399
here's some exate go back and get me

206
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:30,639
more and they have this wonderful uh

207
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,879
symbiotic

208
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:35,120
relationship uh and and it's a good

209
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:38,039
thing they do because again the the root

210
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,240
itself goes into the soil uh but it it

211
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:44,439
forms a depletion Zone uh and and so by

212
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,959
having these micro risal fungi go out

213
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:50,480
into the into the soil it extends the

214
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:52,439
reach of the root itself uh which is an

215
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,759
important thing obviously because you

216
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,880
don't want plants growing in the

217
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,600
depletion Zone because there only other

218
00:09:55,879 --> 00:10:00,120
choice is to just simply grow Down

219
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,159
Deeper uh and and leaving all these

220
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:05,120
great nutrients there all right so this

221
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:07,399
is how a micral fungi Works in if you

222
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,320
don't have a telescope to watch it so

223
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:11,519
you've got a bunch of seedlings two of

224
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:14,120
them sitting out in the sun again Fox

225
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,039
Island uh and one of them says GE I

226
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,000
would really like a baloney sandwich and

227
00:10:17,039 --> 00:10:24,078
so uh what does it do well it mixes up

228
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,839
uh the right exad dates it puts those

229
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:32,120
exudates out into the soil and it

230
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,320
attracts the kind of fungi that it needs

231
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,759
to make a baloney sandwich which it does

232
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:40,079
and it delivers it to the seedling the

233
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:42,639
seedling now has established this

234
00:10:40,078 --> 00:10:45,319
relationship the relationship continues

235
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:47,200
and the seedling grows as a result of

236
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,519
the work that the micro risal fungi is

237
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:52,879
doing in return for getting those

238
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:56,078
exudates so this is a very important uh

239
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:59,519
addition to the basic 2006 soil food web

240
00:10:56,078 --> 00:11:02,879
picture uh and uh these these micro

241
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,839
risal fungi do some really fun things uh

242
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:07,240
they can they can associate with an

243
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:09,680
individual plant or they can associate

244
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:12,720
with more than one plant and form that

245
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:15,439
web uh it's not quite the it's not quite

246
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:17,560
the worldwide web that that been

247
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,680
described in the news but you do get

248
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:23,638
sharing between uh individual micro

249
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:27,359
risal fungi and and different

250
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:29,560
plants all right so that was about 2010

251
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,720
that was called micro risal fund

252
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:33,638
fungal

253
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,720
symbiosis uh and then we started to

254
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:39,799
learn about something known as endic

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:43,680
bacterial Sy symbiosis and this is the

256
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:45,359
basis of my uh uh fourth book uh this

257
00:11:43,679 --> 00:11:47,120
would be the second book I would read

258
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,079
incidentally after teaming with microbes

259
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,720
if you were reading the series because

260
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:54,159
it's such an important new addition to

261
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,360
the way the soil food web works so let's

262
00:11:54,159 --> 00:12:01,078
let's get into that uh it's called endid

263
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,360
meaning inside Endo fidic plant inside

264
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:06,039
the plant bacterial

265
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,278
symbiosis uh and it features something

266
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:14,559
known as risasi root eating uh a

267
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:17,919
discovery that was made back in 2010 in

268
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:20,838
Australia by a bunch of scientists

269
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:24,159
working at the University uh Southern

270
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,600
University I think it was and uh what

271
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:30,799
they discovered was was uh that there

272
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:34,399
were bacteria just inside plant roots

273
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:37,799
which they thought occurred as a result

274
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,000
of plant root cells engulfing these

275
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:44,639
bacteria uh and they called that Riso

276
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,639
fagi and unfortunately they ran out of

277
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,919
they called it Riso Fiji or something of

278
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,480
that sort because they had an Australian

279
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:53,599
accent but uh I call it Riso fagi uh and

280
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,278
and unfortunately they ran out of

281
00:12:53,600 --> 00:13:00,199
funding and so the whole concept just

282
00:12:56,278 --> 00:13:05,320
sort of languished until uh 20

283
00:13:00,198 --> 00:13:08,599
2018 uh when uh scientists at at ruter

284
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:11,079
University picked up this discovery and

285
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,600
and using new kinds of microscopes

286
00:13:11,078 --> 00:13:16,799
really figured out what was going on and

287
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:19,519
it is a Whopper uh so let's let's go

288
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:21,240
into it so again some of those fungi

289
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,120
don't get eaten they form the micro

290
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:26,399
risal fungus that are attracted by the

291
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,919
exudates and some of those bacteria they

292
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:34,600
also uh don't get eaten uh they form uh

293
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:37,000
what's known as the resid fezy cycle um

294
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:40,959
so I want to first point out that

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,078
bacteria incredibly small this is the uh

296
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:48,119
uh proverbial uh

297
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:51,719
pin and there are the bacteria on the

298
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:54,799
tip of the pin uh so they're incredibly

299
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,399
small they're everywhere they multiply

300
00:13:54,799 --> 00:14:00,198
every 20 minutes uh they're fascinating

301
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,240
uh and we don't we don't really study

302
00:14:00,198 --> 00:14:04,439
enough we study dinosaurs we don't study

303
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,278
things like microbes that are important

304
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,920
um but but these are really incredible

305
00:14:06,278 --> 00:14:10,039
so I want you to keep this picture in

306
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:13,639
mind as we go through some of these next

307
00:14:10,039 --> 00:14:16,559
next slides uh so the bacteria are

308
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,159
attracted by that exudate and here are

309
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:22,638
some bacteria Bunches of bacteria that

310
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:25,480
are attracted to the root tip of a of a

311
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:29,360
plant uh and they're they're there and

312
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:31,560
they're devouring up uh the the days now

313
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,000
a lot of these are going to get eaten by

314
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:37,078
nematodes uh and and protozoa but but

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,759
this is before that that has

316
00:14:37,078 --> 00:14:43,399
occurred and what happens is uh uh they

317
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:47,560
form a bacterial slime when you have a

318
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,679
bunch of bacteria they they form a slime

319
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:52,119
in order to be able to hide from their

320
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:54,838
predators and in order to be able to

321
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,600
trap food sources and so uh that's why

322
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:58,720
you brush your teeth in the morning they

323
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,560
have a slime on it you have to use

324
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:04,440
energy in order to remove that slime and

325
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:06,758
it's a real protective layer these

326
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,399
certain bacteria these rasop fagi

327
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:11,320
bacteria are living in the slime with a

328
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:13,639
bunch of other bacteria some of which

329
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:16,040
are going to get eaten and they smell

330
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,079
something very familiar they smell a

331
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:22,599
popcorn smell uh and this popcorn smell

332
00:15:19,078 --> 00:15:26,239
indicates to them that there is a empty

333
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:28,319
slime facility right next door and they

334
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,159
should go live there because there won't

335
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:35,078
be so much competition and so they move

336
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:38,480
into that new slime area attracted by

337
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:40,758
this smell only uh if there isn't a

338
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:45,120
slime area what they end up doing is

339
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:49,839
breaking through these very thin walls

340
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:51,480
at the tip of roots very very thin walls

341
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:54,480
and they break through it thinking

342
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:56,759
they're going into a new slime colony

343
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,199
and they break through these cell walls

344
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:02,720
and they end up in a particular spot in

345
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:04,799
the cell that's known as the par plasmic

346
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,600
space now I'm throwing a lot of science

347
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:09,758
at you so again I try to make it easy

348
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
the

349
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:16,838
parasmo this is the guts of the cell and

350
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,240
there's this little area around here the

351
00:16:16,839 --> 00:16:22,800
easiest thing to think of is tofu this

352
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:25,278
is the cell wall this is the guts of the

353
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:28,599
cell and there's the water all the way

354
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:30,799
around there that's the

355
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:33,079
these bacteria back through they smell

356
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:35,519
that popcorn smell they're attracted

357
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:38,159
Again by the plant itself just like the

358
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:42,159
micro risal fungi are and they back into

359
00:16:38,159 --> 00:16:45,000
this periplasmic space where they find

360
00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:48,679
themselves and in the perlas space they

361
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,799
can they live and they multiply because

362
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:52,758
every 20 minutes they multiply so after

363
00:16:50,799 --> 00:16:54,919
20 minutes of being in there they're

364
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:57,039
doubling their numbers and they're

365
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:58,759
cycled there's a little cyclosis going

366
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:02,838
around inside the cell that moves moves

367
00:16:58,759 --> 00:17:05,519
stuff around uh and this moves as well

368
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,959
and so here you can see uh here's

369
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:09,119
another picture different kind of

370
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:14,519
bacteria different kind of plant cell

371
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:17,359
but these are those uh um endic Riso

372
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:19,439
ryop fagy bacteria all right so they're

373
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:22,558
inside there and when they get in there

374
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,798
the plant goes H I don't really I I got

375
00:17:22,558 --> 00:17:29,440
to be careful I don't want these guys to

376
00:17:24,798 --> 00:17:34,000
take over and kill me and so the plant

377
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:39,480
sprays the bacteria with something known

378
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:42,839
as a Ross a reactive oxygen series um

379
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,038
Ross is quite simply uh what causes

380
00:17:42,839 --> 00:17:48,279
sunburn when you get sunburned it's

381
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:51,440
because your cells are producing uh a

382
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:54,519
Ross to protect themselves from the UV

383
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,159
rays well they produce a Ross to protect

384
00:17:54,519 --> 00:18:00,599
themselves from these bacteria and in

385
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:02,120
fact I even found a Ross with a sunburn

386
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:05,319
just so that we could tie everything

387
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:08,519
together all right anyway uh they this

388
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:12,038
Ross has the effect of stripping off the

389
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:16,519
bacteria's cell wall and so the bacteria

390
00:18:12,038 --> 00:18:19,919
end up without cell walls and the plant

391
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:23,918
cell absorbs the nutrients that were the

392
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,240
bacterial cell wall and use them to grow

393
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:28,840
which is a pretty amazing thing now the

394
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:31,798
bacteria as you can imagine

395
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:34,079
uh that they don't like to get sprayed

396
00:18:31,798 --> 00:18:37,240
and it's it's it it does a couple of

397
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:40,240
things it it it stresses them out uh but

398
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:42,000
by the same token I should add it also

399
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,440
stresses out the plant and if the

400
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,798
plant's not careful and sprays the wrong

401
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,640
or the too higher concentration of Ross

402
00:18:48,798 --> 00:18:53,158
uh it it hurts itself and so by spraying

403
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:57,440
the Ross on the

404
00:18:53,159 --> 00:19:01,000
bacteria it has to strengthen its own

405
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,519
cell and so the plant becomes stronger

406
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,319
as a result of these bacteria and so

407
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,200
they get this induced stress resistance

408
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:10,879
which lives throughout the plant for the

409
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,558
rest of the plant's life that makes the

410
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:17,240
plant stronger now it also turns out

411
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:19,599
that the bacteria don't like it and so

412
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,440
they do two things the first thing they

413
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:24,480
do is they produce ethylene ethylene

414
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:27,240
causes the plant cell it's a phyto

415
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:30,919
hormone and it causes the plant cell to

416
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:33,960
stretch and then they also produce

417
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:36,038
nitrate uh so the ethylene and the

418
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,759
nitrate uh

419
00:19:36,038 --> 00:19:42,558
react and and weaken the

420
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:45,079
Ross they produce different things that

421
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:47,359
weaken the Ross so that even though

422
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,839
they've lost their cell walls they're

423
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:53,399
not going to get killed by uh continued

424
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,038
application so it weakens the Ross uh

425
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:58,400
and these walless bacteria continue to

426
00:19:56,038 --> 00:20:00,679
cycle in that parap plasmic space and

427
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:04,840
they continue to multiply as they

428
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,120
produce this stuff the cell is

429
00:20:04,839 --> 00:20:11,079
stretched uh and they take a little bit

430
00:20:07,119 --> 00:20:15,399
of carbon these bacteria uh and and they

431
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:17,759
they form a cycle uh which is very very

432
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,080
important uh in order for the bacteria

433
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,319
to keep alive and in order for the plant

434
00:20:20,079 --> 00:20:25,439
to keep alive these Cycles form uh and

435
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:28,558
the cell continues to stretch the

436
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:32,120
bacteria continue to multiply and they

437
00:20:28,558 --> 00:20:36,639
produce their ethylene and the uh

438
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:39,000
protection that they produce is actually

439
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,120
nitrous they take nitrogen from the air

440
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,319
now they're inside the plant and they

441
00:20:41,119 --> 00:20:47,158
fix that

442
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:50,319
nitrogen uh to to form nitrix oxide uh

443
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:52,480
which also weakens the Ross and so they

444
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:54,918
got this ethylene and this nitrious

445
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:58,159
oxide weakening the Ross what they're

446
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:02,240
doing is they're fixing nitrogen in

447
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,000
inside the plant cell just like risia

448
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,759
bacteria do uh but this is completely

449
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,880
different this is inside the plant cell

450
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:12,640
and it turns out that if the razif fasy

451
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,278
Cycle's going on up to

452
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,080
40% of the nitrogen that a plant uses

453
00:21:16,278 --> 00:21:22,640
I'm going to repeat that 40% of the

454
00:21:19,079 --> 00:21:26,399
nitrogen that a plant uses comes from

455
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:31,080
this internal nitrogen fixation which we

456
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:33,278
had no idea was going on before 2018 so

457
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:35,639
if you haven't ever heard of this before

458
00:21:33,278 --> 00:21:38,200
it's because no one has in fact I would

459
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:43,320
say you're probably you're

460
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,120
probably a group of uh 4,000 people who

461
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:46,798
may know about Raz of fagi but

462
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:48,558
everybody's going to learn about it so

463
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:50,319
what you've got again this is the

464
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:53,000
depiction this is the parap plasmic

465
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:56,038
space the bacteria are moving around and

466
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,119
they're being cycled around and inside

467
00:21:56,038 --> 00:22:01,519
uh the from the par space is a membrane

468
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,158
and all the goodies that are inside uh

469
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,038
the chloroplast and all that kind of

470
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:07,440
stuff so but we're interested in this

471
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:10,079
area right here and you continue to get

472
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:12,360
growth as they are as these bacteria are

473
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:15,038
cycled around

474
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:17,759
multiplying uh and again they're very

475
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:19,599
very very small uh and they they

476
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,558
multiply and they begin to form

477
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:25,599
structures like this this is a

478
00:22:21,558 --> 00:22:27,399
multiplied walless bacteria um and

479
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,119
they're they're all throughout the thing

480
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,798
and then they to form like this they

481
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:33,599
begin to to conglomerate you get more

482
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:36,000
and more of them because you continue to

483
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:39,839
get this multiplication and they begin

484
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,759
to clog up the the pathway so to speak

485
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:46,000
uh and and back up against the the the

486
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:48,798
wall of the cell uh and when they back

487
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,960
up against the wall of the cell the

488
00:22:48,798 --> 00:22:55,440
ethylene concentrates against that wall

489
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,960
and forms a

490
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,400
tube and these are the tubes that are

491
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:05,000
they're being formed off of the main

492
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,400
cell of a of a root

493
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,240
tip if you look carefully here you can

494
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:12,519
see this is this is with the tube see

495
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:14,400
the tube being formed and it's just it's

496
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:17,400
there you see a little bit of the tube

497
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:20,480
here it's not a brand new cell it's part

498
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:25,200
of this cell right here it's this little

499
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,798
hair that grows out of the root wait a

500
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:32,400
minute it is it's a root here

501
00:23:28,798 --> 00:23:36,000
so here's a shocker folks every single

502
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:39,640
root hair you've ever seen has bacteria

503
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,558
in it why do I know that because the

504
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:45,400
bacteria are what cause root hairs we

505
00:23:43,558 --> 00:23:47,399
were all brought up to believe that root

506
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:50,360
hairs grow so that the plant can get

507
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:55,240
nutrients they go out into the soil blah

508
00:23:50,359 --> 00:23:58,038
blah blah well that's not true they grow

509
00:23:55,240 --> 00:24:00,319
because they're putting these bacteria

510
00:23:58,038 --> 00:24:03,798
into them they're getting bacteria

511
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:06,200
filled uh they happen to be very thin

512
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:08,400
walled and I did a tremendous amount of

513
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:10,120
study again because it was Co and

514
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,400
because I I had the ability to be able

515
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:16,158
to do it these are very thin wall

516
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,200
structures and they open up and so

517
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,320
there's no wonder that if you read

518
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,919
teeming with nutrients one of the other

519
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:24,759
books I wrote which talks about how

520
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:26,799
plants take nutrients in the nutrients

521
00:24:24,759 --> 00:24:30,679
are able to move through these

522
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:33,720
incredibly thin walls and so they do

523
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:36,640
take up nutrients but they are formed by

524
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:38,919
bacteria for a completely different

525
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:41,679
purpose because what happens is they

526
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,399
continue to multiply as they move into

527
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:46,240
these cells so they're in the cells and

528
00:24:44,398 --> 00:24:48,879
they begin to multiply and they get

529
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,120
glomerate up at the tip and this blue

530
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:53,960
indicates that there's nitrogen being

531
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:57,479
produced uh from these little guys

532
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:02,079
that's the dye and then all of a sudden

533
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:05,440
they are blown out of the tip of that

534
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:08,720
growing tube which we call a root

535
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,240
hair and they go back out into the soil

536
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:15,679
and here they are conglomerating in the

537
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:18,159
in the tip and boom out they go and here

538
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:22,480
they are blown out into the soil these

539
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,799
are walless bacteria so are these uh and

540
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:30,000
and they grow back their cell wall and

541
00:25:25,798 --> 00:25:35,319
in two or three days they move back into

542
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:37,640
a new root cell and form new root hairs

543
00:25:35,319 --> 00:25:41,798
and it doesn't happen just once as that

544
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:45,120
root hair grows you get explosion after

545
00:25:41,798 --> 00:25:47,960
explosion after explosion and and then

546
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:50,839
they go back into the soil and they grow

547
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,558
back their cell wall this is this is

548
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,398
completely amazing stuff to most people

549
00:25:53,558 --> 00:25:59,440
they work they eat they travel they

550
00:25:56,398 --> 00:26:02,359
repeat they go back is in an incredible

551
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,919
system it's now called the Razzo fasi

552
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:09,038
cycle it has been observed obviously uh

553
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:15,159
in many different ways if you remove the

554
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:18,038
bacteria you do not get root hairs wow

555
00:26:15,159 --> 00:26:21,159
unbelievable uh so what we used to think

556
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:23,158
is that is that the the plant by

557
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:25,480
producing the exudates and putting the

558
00:26:23,159 --> 00:26:27,919
exudates out into the soil was sort of

559
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,120
farming uh you know and then and then it

560
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:33,000
would it would Gather in in the fall it

561
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:34,798
would bring in all the nutrients uh and

562
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,079
and and that was it but we what we're

563
00:26:34,798 --> 00:26:41,519
learning is they also are hurting uh so

564
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:43,319
they're ranchers as well as farmers and

565
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:47,038
they go out and they bring these

566
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:50,319
bacteria in they Shear off the walls uh

567
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:52,359
they eat a an occasional leg of lamb uh

568
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:55,599
and and then they put them back out into

569
00:26:52,359 --> 00:26:58,038
the paddock to grow back the wool again

570
00:26:55,599 --> 00:27:01,199
uh it's absolutely an unbelievable thing

571
00:26:58,038 --> 00:27:04,119
it's known as Razo fagi you may not have

572
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:06,759
ever heard of it you will hear lots

573
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:10,678
about it because it turns out that it's

574
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:14,038
a very useful research tool and

575
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,798
potentially an unbelievable substitute

576
00:27:14,038 --> 00:27:18,119
for actual chemical fertilizers so

577
00:27:16,798 --> 00:27:22,440
that's what the world's been looking for

578
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:26,519
for a long time now those razazi

579
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,200
bacteria that move in are Endo fidic

580
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:33,960
bacteria and as these roots begin to

581
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:36,720
grow you end up with little cracks in

582
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,519
the main root itself and because

583
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,839
bacteria are everywhere and because

584
00:27:39,519 --> 00:27:44,918
bacteria are always looking for an

585
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:46,959
advantage over other bacteria so that

586
00:27:44,919 --> 00:27:49,000
they can go to a place where they can

587
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,399
breed without predators and where they

588
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,319
can eat without competition these there

589
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:58,678
was a bunch of bacteria uh that would

590
00:27:55,319 --> 00:28:02,240
have been eaten perhaps by uh nitos and

591
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:06,278
protozoa that sneak in the cracks that

592
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:09,159
form when these root hairs form as well

593
00:28:06,278 --> 00:28:12,359
and so they sneak in they're very very

594
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:15,760
small and then they're capable of moving

595
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:19,519
throughout the plant in the phome or the

596
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:22,919
xylem uh and even in the a aop

597
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:26,519
apoplastic Pathways in between cells and

598
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,159
so you end up with endic bacteria

599
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:32,159
throughout the roof root and they move

600
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:34,519
into the plant itself some move in

601
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,840
through stomata but most of them come in

602
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:40,399
through the root

603
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:44,918
system uh and some of them end up in the

604
00:28:40,398 --> 00:28:48,439
flour and as the flow is forming seeds

605
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:52,320
they get trapped in the seed and they're

606
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:54,320
inside the seed so that when the seed is

607
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:58,519
planted in new

608
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:59,639
soil the seed brings with it the kinds

609
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:03,480
of

610
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:07,840
bacteria that it needs in order to grow

611
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:11,120
properly again an unbelievable Discovery

612
00:29:07,839 --> 00:29:14,599
uh there are corn plants uh species that

613
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:17,918
are 400 years old and if you plant one

614
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:20,639
today it has the same bacterial mix or

615
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:23,360
very close bacterial mix to what it had

616
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,240
400 years ago because it carries its

617
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:30,319
seeds this is this is probably where

618
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:32,519
trir comes from not the soil but the

619
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:34,720
microbes that are that are in the plant

620
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:37,519
that come from the soil and get passed

621
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,480
on uh it's it's an amazing amazing thing

622
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:42,440
while we're studying and so you get you

623
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,399
get the bacteria they get trapped uh

624
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:46,840
when the plant germinates the bacteria

625
00:29:44,398 --> 00:29:49,158
move into the soil uh as some of them

626
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:51,879
end up as Riso fazzy bacteria some of

627
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:55,240
them end up as endophilic bacteria uh

628
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:57,559
and it's a beautiful beautiful system um

629
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,480
these bacteria these endophytic bacteria

630
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:03,278
are capable of producing hormones and so

631
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,720
they produce uh the key hormones that

632
00:30:03,278 --> 00:30:07,919
you need for plant growth now the plants

633
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:11,399
obviously can produce these as well but

634
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:14,360
when they get assisted by uh these uh

635
00:30:11,398 --> 00:30:18,398
bacteria it's a it's a wonderful thing

636
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:20,240
and and why would a bacteria do this it

637
00:30:18,398 --> 00:30:23,518
would produce these things inside a

638
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,120
plant because it's it's tricking the

639
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:28,839
plant into allowing it to live inside

640
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:30,798
the plant so it's the plant says oh yeah

641
00:30:28,839 --> 00:30:33,319
I get some oxin out of this well gee I

642
00:30:30,798 --> 00:30:35,759
get some ethylene out of this uh and

643
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:38,519
I'll let these guys stay here uh you

644
00:30:35,759 --> 00:30:41,000
know and the bacteria gets to live

645
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:43,359
without the competition it gets a a

646
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:47,159
source of food without competition and

647
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:49,719
everybody lives happily ever after um so

648
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,720
you end up with uh all sorts of things

649
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:56,399
as a result of these bacteria the stress

650
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:59,038
that's created uh causes some wonderful

651
00:30:56,398 --> 00:31:02,038
things to happen uh this induced

652
00:30:59,038 --> 00:31:05,278
systemic resistance but you also get all

653
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,398
of these things uh occurring as well as

654
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,679
a result of these bacteria moving in and

655
00:31:07,398 --> 00:31:12,319
I might add some some fungus

656
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,600
particularly yeasts do the same thing

657
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:17,038
they're not micro risal they act like

658
00:31:14,599 --> 00:31:19,678
these bacteria and and they they go

659
00:31:17,038 --> 00:31:22,359
through an endophytic uh phase of their

660
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:25,519
life um and these endophytic bacteria

661
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:28,199
help plants to deal with abiotic stress

662
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,558
they can they can lower the freezing

663
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,278
point of water or raise the freezing

664
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:36,119
point of water excuse me uh they can

665
00:31:32,278 --> 00:31:39,038
help a plant deal with salt uh with

666
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:41,518
flooding uh with drought they can they

667
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:44,359
can help plants deal with with pathogens

668
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,038
that are attacking them uh the the the

669
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:50,240
plant can selectively allow in a

670
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:52,798
bacteria that's able to take out uh some

671
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:56,480
of its pathogens it's it's a it's a

672
00:31:52,798 --> 00:31:58,918
wonderful terrific uh uh uh defense

673
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,599
system if you can get the bacteria to do

674
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:04,320
your fighting for you you all you give

675
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:05,879
up is a little bit of space and maybe a

676
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:08,759
little bit of

677
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,559
carbon some of these some of these uh

678
00:32:08,759 --> 00:32:13,839
bacteria are capable of doing things

679
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:16,038
like cleating iron and so uh they'll

680
00:32:13,839 --> 00:32:18,038
enter into a plant root they'll live

681
00:32:16,038 --> 00:32:20,558
inside the plant and when the plant is

682
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:22,839
is either got too much iron or doesn't

683
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:25,359
have enough iron uh they can hop out

684
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:27,359
into the soil where they can gather up

685
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:29,158
all the iron together or arsonate

686
00:32:27,359 --> 00:32:32,000
together so that it doesn't go in and

687
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,360
poison the plant uh so they they do all

688
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,599
sorts of uh wonderful things um there

689
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:41,918
are Tad and I were talking just the

690
00:32:38,599 --> 00:32:44,678
beginnings of endophytic bacteria that

691
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:48,080
are that are producible and are

692
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:51,278
available these top ones up here are are

693
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:53,879
are things that you can get uh at uh

694
00:32:51,278 --> 00:32:56,398
cannabis grow Stores um they're

695
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:58,639
beginning to be use them this one fixes

696
00:32:56,398 --> 00:33:01,000
nitrogen uh there's different kinds

697
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:02,638
depending on what areas you are you you

698
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,359
live in there's one from Brazil and

699
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:08,439
Russia etc etc this one is one that

700
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:11,398
people are beginning to look at uh the

701
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,759
these can be stored relatively easy this

702
00:33:11,398 --> 00:33:15,079
requires freeze drying so that people

703
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:18,240
are trying to figure out how to use

704
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:21,038
these things but what big industry has

705
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:24,558
discovered is that that it's possible to

706
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:26,319
find and to isolate endophilic bacteria

707
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:28,319
that do things to your plant that you

708
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:31,359
need them to do so for example if you're

709
00:33:28,319 --> 00:33:33,879
growing a tomato and you you end up with

710
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,959
powdery mildew all the time on that uh

711
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,679
if I if if research has it proper

712
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,720
they're going to find the right

713
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,759
bacterium to to put into the soil so

714
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:47,519
that it goes into the plant and fights

715
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:49,398
off that uh powdery Milo so that you

716
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:50,679
don't end up getting that problem

717
00:33:49,398 --> 00:33:52,719
they're not doing it for me and you

718
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:54,880
they're doing it for the big guys but

719
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:57,600
it'll it'll it'll come down to our level

720
00:33:54,880 --> 00:34:00,200
no question about it and these three

721
00:33:57,599 --> 00:34:04,480
are already on or getting close to our

722
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,440
level uh just as ryia bacteria have come

723
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,480
down to our level you can find risia

724
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,079
bacteria nitrogen fixing bacteria

725
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,719
wherever you you buy legumes as a

726
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:19,599
inoculant for your your peas and and

727
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:22,878
other legumes um so the really obvious

728
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,280
takeaway plants really are in control

729
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:26,519
whether you whether you go by the

730
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,760
original soil food web or you move all

731
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:30,398
the way through to the modern view of

732
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,760
the soil food web which includes the

733
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:35,799
razif fagi they're in control and we

734
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:38,359
like to think we're in control but when

735
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:41,000
we think that we end up taking actions

736
00:34:38,358 --> 00:34:43,519
that are not necessarily in the soil

737
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:45,679
food web's best interest we interfere

738
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:47,280
with the way the soil food web works and

739
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,480
we end up having to do a lot of work

740
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,679
ourselves as a result of uh taking away

741
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,878
the ability of these invisible microbes

742
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:57,240
to do the work for us so plants are

743
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:59,279
definitely in control uh and and they're

744
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:02,598
amazing uh which is really the most

745
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,599
amazing uh takeaway they they do things

746
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:08,320
we we just completely had no idea that

747
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,480
they were doing we keep getting better

748
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,559
and better at microscopy and as a and

749
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,440
and staining and as a result we're

750
00:35:13,559 --> 00:35:17,759
beginning to see what plants can

751
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,119
actually do uh this is where I usually

752
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,920
pop in and say we've got to stop

753
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,000
teaching our kids about dinosaurs

754
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,760
useless we need to start teaching our

755
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,358
kids about microbes because they impact

756
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,079
everything we do um and they're

757
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:33,799
beautiful they're absolutely stunning

758
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:36,039
and gorgeous and we can make them every

759
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,000
bit as interesting as you know as the

760
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,880
tyrosaurus Rex and all that other kind

761
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,400
of stuff it's amazing to me that a four

762
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:44,280
or fiveyear old kid knows all the

763
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,240
dinosaurs knows even how to spell some

764
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,440
of these incredibly complicated words I

765
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:51,919
can't even say and yet has no idea what

766
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:54,240
a bacteria is um chemicals obviously

767
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,200
have a negative effect uh on endophytic

768
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:58,318
bacteria they throw things out of

769
00:35:56,199 --> 00:36:01,159
balance uh so you got to be very careful

770
00:35:58,318 --> 00:36:03,079
how you use it um you got to use the

771
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:05,440
best practices possible all of the

772
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:08,280
things that that keep a soil food web

773
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,838
alive also help the razoes cycle and

774
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:16,079
endophytic bacteria uh mulches leaving

775
00:36:11,838 --> 00:36:18,480
leaves alone using compost um uh even

776
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,599
compost teas compost extracts these are

777
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,920
all things that that help the soil food

778
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:24,800
web are considered to be best practices

779
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,559
no Roto tilling which breaks everything

780
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,160
up uh and destroys the soil food web or

781
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:32,000
at least uh impacts the soil food web so

782
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,799
that has to rebuild itself and you lose

783
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,358
that time um so all of these things are

784
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:39,119
important you have to feed the soil the

785
00:36:36,358 --> 00:36:41,000
soil is everything um you can test

786
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,440
things my favorite test these days is

787
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:45,639
something called a microbiometer yes you

788
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:47,519
need to have an NPK test every now and

789
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:50,358
then so you know what your soils have in

790
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:52,519
it and what they're capable of doing but

791
00:36:50,358 --> 00:36:55,679
but you need to know whether what you're

792
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:57,759
doing is helping uh the the soil food

793
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,879
web or whether it's hurting it uh go

794
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,760
look at

795
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,880
www microbiometer

796
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,280
docomo test you use your cell phone and

797
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,160
you can tell whether you're increasing

798
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,280
or decreasing the biomass uh you know

799
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:16,879
the bacterial and fungal biomass if it

800
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,440
increases you're doing good and if it

801
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,680
decreases as a result of what you're

802
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:24,559
doing you're doing something wrong um

803
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:27,919
and don't disturb the soil uh prevent

804
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:30,519
compaction no tilling be careful your

805
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,318
soil is the most valuable thing we have

806
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:35,400
uh don't sterilize seeds that's a silly

807
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:38,079
thing to do uh and don't don't

808
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:41,680
necessarily use sterile soil either uh

809
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:43,839
those seeds uh contain the bacteria that

810
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:45,759
your plant needs in order to live when

811
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,639
they germinate you want to have them be

812
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:50,640
able to to do so use mulches uh they

813
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:52,679
provide organic material which all of

814
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:55,559
the soil food we have needs don't Roto

815
00:37:52,679 --> 00:37:58,639
tilt don't toss use soil reuse it it

816
00:37:55,559 --> 00:38:01,159
contains EX Ates it contains bacteria it

817
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:03,960
contains organic material and compost

818
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:07,920
compost compost beautiful stuff use it

819
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,880
all the time um make compost out of the

820
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,400
same plant you're growing uh that that

821
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,240
you know it contains a lot of the

822
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:18,880
goodies uh that your plants used and

823
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:22,399
would use again um and and uh test your

824
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,440
compost some plants because compost has

825
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,480
different kinds of bacteria in it like

826
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,838
verac compost and some plants like

827
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:33,440
thermal compost more which ones I don't

828
00:38:31,838 --> 00:38:36,440
know we got to do the research and this

829
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:38,400
is a you know home scientific experiment

830
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,318
H but you're going to find that your

831
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,318
your broccoli is going to do better in

832
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:44,599
one kind of compost versus the other

833
00:38:42,318 --> 00:38:46,400
because the bacterial composition is

834
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:48,960
different and you'll get different Endo

835
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,519
fiic bacteria uh along with the ones

836
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,318
that that come along with the seed uh

837
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:56,318
that that you're planting um so a not so

838
00:38:54,318 --> 00:38:57,960
obvious takeaways you got to read these

839
00:38:56,318 --> 00:39:00,519
books books folks not because I wrote

840
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,679
them but because this is the science

841
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:06,000
behind organic gardening and if we've

842
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:09,919
learned anything it's that we need to be

843
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,559
organic gardeners we have way too much

844
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:15,039
plastic in our lives we have way too

845
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:16,639
much plastic in our soils for example we

846
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:19,559
don't need to add

847
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:22,000
chemicals we we just have screwed things

848
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:24,239
up so badly we know it we know it's

849
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,440
caused bad things start with teaming

850
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:29,959
with microbes move to teaming with back

851
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:33,079
IIA learn how and then go to endophytic

852
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:36,199
uh fungi and then learn how the plants

853
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:39,640
use all of these things to grow if you

854
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:42,838
do these things you will be a much

855
00:39:39,639 --> 00:39:46,318
better Gardener chemical gardeners are

856
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:49,159
not good gardeners to learn how to use

857
00:39:46,318 --> 00:39:52,000
the soil food web on the other hand is

858
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:54,799
how you become the very best guarder you

859
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:58,400
possibly can be and I say is this the

860
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,079
end probably not there is no question

861
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,920
some other thing is going to be

862
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,960
discovered uh who knew uh in

863
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,680
2017 that you could get 40% of the of

864
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,119
your plant's nitrogen just by simply

865
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:15,759
making sure that the Razo feezy cycle is

866
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:17,800
going on no one and so there's got to be

867
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,400
more stuff out there there are people

868
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,880
looking for this stuff all the time uh

869
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,079
if you're taking notes uh write down the

870
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:29,318
name of Dr Elaine Ingam she is the guru

871
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:32,960
of the soil food web uh write down the

872
00:40:29,318 --> 00:40:36,159
name of Dr James White he is the

873
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,838
gentleman uh at ruter University who has

874
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,679
really refined the razif fazzy cycle um

875
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,599
and that's it folks I appreciate your

876
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:47,199
attention and be happy to answer any

877
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:47,200
questions you

878
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,318
have ah thank you I can't hear you but I

879
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,318
see you're

880
00:40:55,318 --> 00:40:58,318
clapping

881
00:40:58,719 --> 00:41:08,598
oh any questions I can hear you oh okay

882
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:08,599
where there any questions I can relay

883
00:41:08,679 --> 00:41:13,118
or

884
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:16,559
one

885
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,000
out plant a row for the hungry oh how do

886
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:21,239
you find out about plant a row for the

887
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,960
hungry oh I'm glad you asked that um uh

888
00:41:21,239 --> 00:41:27,159
plan R for Hungary is sort of a

889
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:28,519
self-service uh uh program that the we

890
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:31,598
we used to be the garden writers of

891
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:33,800
America we're now the garden Comm Garden

892
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,200
communicators International and if you

893
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:40,440
go to Garden communicators

894
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:42,318
international.com uh you'll find a a a

895
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:45,440
page that talks about plant a row for

896
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:48,519
the hungry all you have to do is share

897
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,039
food with somebody else uh as a club for

898
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:53,159
example just to encourage everybody to

899
00:41:51,039 --> 00:41:55,838
plant one row in their Garden The

900
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:57,879
Gardener takes that food either to a

901
00:41:55,838 --> 00:42:00,480
neighbor that needs it to a church or a

902
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,440
synagogue to a food bank there are

903
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:05,838
places where you can take food to a

904
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:08,079
prison uh the prison gathers the food uh

905
00:42:05,838 --> 00:42:10,318
uh we've got hardware stores that gather

906
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,599
food we've got nurseries you know garden

907
00:42:10,318 --> 00:42:14,960
nurseries where you can bring in excess

908
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:19,200
food they'll take it to the food bank uh

909
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,318
there's no rules to this other than you

910
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:25,118
plant the row you distribute that row

911
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:27,079
somehow and and nothing slips between

912
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:29,039
the lip and the cup there's no money

913
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:32,160
involved there's no administrative

914
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:35,318
Services involved this is a peopo people

915
00:42:32,159 --> 00:42:37,598
campaign and it is unbelievable if you

916
00:42:35,318 --> 00:42:39,558
just Google plant a row for the hungry

917
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,480
how many different programs people have

918
00:42:39,559 --> 00:42:43,359
come up with we do it in Canada now as

919
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:47,960
well uh they're beginning to do it in

920
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:51,400
England 35 million people go to bed in

921
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:52,960
North America hungry every single night

922
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:55,200
or at least not knowing where their next

923
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,280
meal is coming this is such an easy

924
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:00,519
thing because G share and because most

925
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:02,359
of us tend to just sort of leave stuff

926
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:04,639
in the garden you know when the snow

927
00:43:02,358 --> 00:43:07,519
comes for the Moose to eat uh and that's

928
00:43:04,639 --> 00:43:07,519
a stupid thing to

929
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:15,920
do yeah um would you expand on the value

930
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:18,839
of cover props that are nitrogen

931
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:21,480
pictures and how they actually make the

932
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:24,599
nitrogen available are you able to hear

933
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:27,920
that Jeff uh not really uh was talk

934
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:29,960
about nitrogen fix in crops can you

935
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:32,519
expand on cover crops and how they make

936
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,000
oh cover crops sure yeah well cover

937
00:43:32,519 --> 00:43:38,119
crops are are are mostly legumes uh and

938
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:40,199
they produce they they produce the

939
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:43,119
nodules that that you're familiar with

940
00:43:40,199 --> 00:43:45,759
and inside those nodules they produce

941
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:47,960
nitrogen a little teeny bit of that

942
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:49,559
nitrogen leaks out into the soil and

943
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:53,159
it's used by whatever plants would grow

944
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:57,240
in there but but what what happens is

945
00:43:53,159 --> 00:43:59,558
the the cover crop dies and when it dies

946
00:43:57,239 --> 00:44:01,959
the nitrogen that's in the cover crop

947
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:05,040
itself particular in the n in the

948
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:07,199
nodules goes into the soil and is then

949
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,599
usable that's why you can plant a cover

950
00:44:07,199 --> 00:44:11,679
crop in the fall it's producing those

951
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,720
nodules it's producing nitrogen for

952
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:17,598
itself and then in the spring you you

953
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:20,318
you you Tamp it over or you or you just

954
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,640
rake it rake it over maybe a little

955
00:44:20,318 --> 00:44:26,239
light tilling uh and that moves that

956
00:44:23,639 --> 00:44:28,519
material into the soil with it with the

957
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,799
dead plant and provides that nitrogen

958
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:33,759
releases

959
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:37,559
it clovers are the most common one you

960
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,359
hear out too right right and by the way

961
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,319
I just I've been testing a new Clover

962
00:44:39,358 --> 00:44:46,239
it's called micro Clover it's not really

963
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:50,119
new uh but it the the new trend uh is is

964
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:52,919
for people to put in uh not Lawns but

965
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:54,680
Meadows to turn their lawns into Meadows

966
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,639
and and one of the easiest ways to do

967
00:44:54,679 --> 00:45:00,000
that is to is to add tremendous amounts

968
00:44:56,639 --> 00:45:04,400
of clover this micro Clover is it only

969
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,880
blooms once a year it's beautiful stuff

970
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:09,800
uh it's worth taking a look at uh but it

971
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:11,800
pumps in nitrogen like crazy and in

972
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:14,960
addition to using it on my lawn I've

973
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:18,519
used it at my tomato plants and I gotta

974
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:20,720
I gotta tell you uh it makes the most

975
00:45:18,519 --> 00:45:24,800
gorgeous tomato plants I've ever seen

976
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:27,959
this mound of beautiful Clover and then

977
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:29,359
after I I harvest the tomatoes like I'm

978
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:32,559
going to kill it so next year they're

979
00:45:29,358 --> 00:45:32,558
going to get the benefit of this

980
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,480
nitrogen um how do you suggest using

981
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:44,318
compost if we're not tilling just as a

982
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,920
top dress yes um the compost and you

983
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:49,759
really don't need very much an eighth of

984
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:52,440
an inch uh is is enough uh an inch is

985
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,559
wow a tremendous amount if you put it on

986
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:58,480
top of the soil uh it the microbes in it

987
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:00,640
has as well as the rain Etc uh work it

988
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,358
work the microbes down into the soil

989
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:05,960
down into into the growing zone and

990
00:46:03,358 --> 00:46:08,318
couple two three four or five months um

991
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,838
so yeah just put it right on the surface

992
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:13,000
um it has a in places like Anchorage and

993
00:46:10,838 --> 00:46:16,039
I you know you get a little bit of cold

994
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:18,159
weather um it acts as a little bit of an

995
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:20,159
insulation layer we we like to put the

996
00:46:18,159 --> 00:46:23,399
compost down and then put leaves on top

997
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:26,519
of it as mulch uh so that it holds the

998
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:29,880
temperature in the soil uh to to 29 to

999
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:32,400
30 degrees in our Frost Zone um and it

1000
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:34,280
and it and it just it it raises the

1001
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:36,838
frost zone so that we don't get quite as

1002
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:39,880
deep of frust Etc I love compost it's

1003
00:46:36,838 --> 00:46:42,599
great stuff and Tad makes some very good

1004
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,599
compost by the

1005
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,159
way if I can follow up on that I've also

1006
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:51,119
read studies though that are showing

1007
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,960
that we're getting too much organic

1008
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:56,160
material in a lot of our garden soils

1009
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:58,358
because of all the comes we have yeah

1010
00:46:56,159 --> 00:47:01,598
I've read some of those those too uh you

1011
00:46:58,358 --> 00:47:05,000
know I'm not it's hard for me to let me

1012
00:47:01,599 --> 00:47:07,880
put it this way most most soils most

1013
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,760
regular soils has about one one to two%

1014
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,800
organic matter really good

1015
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:17,040
organic garden bed might have up to 5%

1016
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:20,119
organic matter um you know can you have

1017
00:47:17,039 --> 00:47:21,759
too much organic matter I suppose you

1018
00:47:20,119 --> 00:47:24,318
could if you weren't getting soil

1019
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:26,839
structure you know if you if it was

1020
00:47:24,318 --> 00:47:29,159
replacing individual but it's hard for

1021
00:47:26,838 --> 00:47:32,880
me to to see that I mean I can see how

1022
00:47:29,159 --> 00:47:35,639
how maybe if you use uh manure in your

1023
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:36,559
compost you may end up with too much uh

1024
00:47:35,639 --> 00:47:38,598
you know

1025
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,440
phosphorus

1026
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:44,359
um or too much potassium that would be

1027
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:46,639
probably a more thing but yeah I don't I

1028
00:47:44,358 --> 00:47:50,078
don't buy into it

1029
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:53,799
frankly thank you that doesn't mean I'm

1030
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:55,559
right but I just don't buy into it I I

1031
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:59,839
put as much compost down as I've grown

1032
00:47:55,559 --> 00:48:02,160
in in directly in compost uh i' i' I had

1033
00:47:59,838 --> 00:48:04,759
organic matter all the time I never rake

1034
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:08,000
a leaf uh unless it's for putting down

1035
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:10,760
on the garden I grow potatoes in just

1036
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:13,519
leaves which is all organic matter they

1037
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,359
do just fine so yeah I have a hard time

1038
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:17,719
but again these are scientific papers

1039
00:48:15,358 --> 00:48:20,078
people Linda Chalker Scott Etc you know

1040
00:48:17,719 --> 00:48:22,799
they write these things and there's got

1041
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:24,640
to be some validity to it but but I I

1042
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:27,318
haven't had that

1043
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:30,759
problem

1044
00:48:27,318 --> 00:48:34,199
yeah I saw a picture of red worms and

1045
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:38,200
I've never fully used to Advantage the

1046
00:48:34,199 --> 00:48:41,879
um castings that I generated in my worm

1047
00:48:38,199 --> 00:48:43,919
bin what's what's a good way to

1048
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,519
distribute that

1049
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,559
stuff and what is the value of the worm

1050
00:48:47,519 --> 00:48:53,440
casting as far as who's living in can

1051
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,440
you hear that yeah so in other words how

1052
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,440
do you collect the worm castings and and

1053
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,679
and what do you use them on no how do I

1054
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:03,240
best use them I've got masses of them

1055
00:49:01,679 --> 00:49:04,960
she's got a lot but how do you how do

1056
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,118
you best utilize them and what's the

1057
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:09,639
value of them right well I use them in

1058
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:11,200
two different ways we we also keep worms

1059
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:14,318
in fact now that we see the snow I'm

1060
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:18,118
gonna have to move it inside um you can

1061
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:21,719
use them in in by putting them in liquid

1062
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:24,318
um and and sort of making a worm compost

1063
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:26,798
extract and using using that liquid on

1064
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:29,639
Plants um I don't know I don't know

1065
00:49:26,798 --> 00:49:33,358
really why I do that but sometimes I

1066
00:49:29,639 --> 00:49:35,960
do otherwise I I put it right on my

1067
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:38,480
plants now you got to be careful because

1068
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:42,199
they will contain you know little worm

1069
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,679
cast little eggs um and so uh you got to

1070
00:49:42,199 --> 00:49:45,279
make sure you got the right worms you

1071
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:49,558
don't want that new worm that's moving

1072
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:51,920
in that does the fast squiggly Wiggly um

1073
00:49:49,559 --> 00:49:53,880
I'm not a particularly big fan of of

1074
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,639
adding night crawlers if you don't

1075
00:49:53,880 --> 00:50:00,400
already have night crawlers in there

1076
00:49:56,639 --> 00:50:03,000
um the red wigglers see seem to be safe

1077
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:05,079
uh but but I sometimes I wonder whether

1078
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,760
we're really you know doing the right

1079
00:50:05,079 --> 00:50:09,680
thing by using them uh but but using the

1080
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:14,040
castings themselves does make a lot of

1081
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:17,399
sense uh they contain a concentration of

1082
00:50:14,039 --> 00:50:19,639
the nutrients that is higher than what

1083
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:21,440
went into the worms so it's I don't

1084
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:24,039
remember exactly what the numbers are

1085
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:26,400
it's x amount of times more phosphorus x

1086
00:50:24,039 --> 00:50:28,639
amount of times more nitrogen x amount

1087
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,760
it's got higher concentrations of the

1088
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:33,679
nutrients that you want for your plants

1089
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,680
and that's why it's so

1090
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:40,960
good there there is research on uh

1091
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,639
adding worm castings to potting soils

1092
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,639
for example and they found up to like uh

1093
00:50:43,639 --> 00:50:48,239
I think 15% by volume and again this

1094
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,318
depends on the quality of castings and

1095
00:50:48,239 --> 00:50:53,239
things like that but they actually got

1096
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:55,599
increased biomass production growth

1097
00:50:53,239 --> 00:50:58,719
disease protection um so the wor

1098
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,160
castings have a lot of benefits in in

1099
00:50:58,719 --> 00:51:02,598
soils in general yeah yeah yeah and I

1100
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:05,679
would think they you know because they

1101
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:08,519
contain so many nutrients they raise the

1102
00:51:05,679 --> 00:51:12,719
bricks the bricks of the plant and if

1103
00:51:08,519 --> 00:51:16,679
the bricks of the plant is over nine or

1104
00:51:12,719 --> 00:51:19,000
10 uh you don't get insects anymore so

1105
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:20,879
yeah it's it's great stuff it's it's

1106
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:23,798
every bit as good as compost it's just

1107
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,280
con one's thermal and and one's

1108
00:51:23,798 --> 00:51:29,159
biological so there's a different mix of

1109
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:29,160
bacteria in

1110
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:36,400
them any other

1111
00:51:33,639 --> 00:51:38,719
questions okay all right well thanks

1112
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,318
Jeff we we let you go then but I really

1113
00:51:38,719 --> 00:51:43,000
apprciate my pleasure my pleasure

1114
00:51:41,318 --> 00:51:44,358
anybody has any questions let me know

1115
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,599
and I always tell people if you buy

1116
00:51:44,358 --> 00:51:48,920
teaming with microbes and now I'm going

1117
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:51,240
to add in teaming with bacteria and you

1118
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,240
don't like it I'll buy it back at three

1119
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:54,879
times the price because I think it's

1120
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:57,000
that important that you read it and if

1121
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,880
you want to read in French or German or

1122
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:02,159
Slovakian or Turkish Portuguese or

1123
00:51:59,880 --> 00:52:03,559
Spanish we can arrange to get you that

1124
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:07,078
copy

1125
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:11,000
so and audible now huh oh yeah it's on

1126
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:14,039
Audible it's on discs is the same person

1127
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,920
that read John Stewart's book reads

1128
00:52:14,039 --> 00:52:19,519
mine oh

1129
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:22,358
cool all right thank you very much folks

1130
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:25,358
what a great audience thank

1131
00:52:22,358 --> 00:52:25,358
