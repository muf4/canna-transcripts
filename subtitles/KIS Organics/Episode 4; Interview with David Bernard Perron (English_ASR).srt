27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,118
to uh to chat with me hey Tad thanks for

28
00:01:07,478 --> 00:01:12,359
having me yeah so I met David what two

29
00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:14,599
years ago now at canacon and came to one

30
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:16,920
of my talks and we started chatting and

31
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:18,679
I realized David was this wealth of

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,960
information could you maybe tell me a

33
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,000
little bit about your background and how

34
00:01:19,959 --> 00:01:24,000
you came into your current job and what

35
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,759
you do now yeah yeah I remember when we

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,400
first met you were that breath of fresh

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,719
air and that melstrom of craziness that

38
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,159
was my first uh two weeks in the

39
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:35,319
industry so I didn't know that was your

40
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:38,040
first two weeks wow oh yeah it was

41
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,758
pretty interesting so I'm coming from a

42
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,118
an agricultural background Greenhouse

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,239
production background I've been working

44
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:46,680
in Greenhouse production since 2001 when

45
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,158
I was uh 14 years old I think at the end

46
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,920
of my road where I used to grow up in

47
00:01:49,159 --> 00:01:53,479
the countryside it was a greenhouse that

48
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,879
we're doing production of annual flowers

49
00:01:53,478 --> 00:01:58,399
in the winter and the cuttings of poas

50
00:01:55,879 --> 00:02:00,519
during the summer so I was lucky enough

51
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,718
that one of the manager there was also

52
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:07,199
teaching Horticultural uh school close

53
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:08,719
by and he was really interested he

54
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,479
really interested me and got my eyes

55
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:12,719
open and all the science and the cool

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,040
stuff happening uh Beyond in the plants

57
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:18,039
world and the greenhouse management and

58
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:19,519
from the profitability to oh we need to

59
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:21,239
make the plants happy and all that so

60
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,959
that was really the the high opener for

61
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:27,159
me and so I stay in this world that uh

62
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,400
led me also toh do my bachelor degree in

63
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:32,719
plant science and then when I was um

64
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,360
just for fun I was uh growing a lot of

65
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:37,199
mushroom at University uh oyster

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,519
mushroom and all sorts of stuff and when

67
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:41,000
one of the professors so my work I've

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,200
been offered a master in organic

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,519
Agriculture and then ended up in grad

70
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,560
school and from there I was bumming

71
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,039
around every summer on the west coast

72
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,000
because I'm originally from Quebec but

73
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:56,919
uh so I decided to go and establish

74
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,919
myself in the west and meeting someone

75
00:02:56,919 --> 00:03:01,559
rock climbing and then keeping in touch

76
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,878
with him I heard heard of grape wines

77
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,199
through the years and he was doing

78
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:07,598
something with cannabis so I've got in

79
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:11,439
touch with him once I moved to the West

80
00:03:07,598 --> 00:03:13,318
Coast and uh he uh let me into Wester

81
00:03:11,439 --> 00:03:15,878
medical marijuana corporation which is

82
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:18,399
the only certified organic licensed

83
00:03:15,878 --> 00:03:20,000
producer in Canada right now you're

84
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,280
working at this facility right now what

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,799
is your role at the facility so I'm Del

86
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,919
lead agrologist of develop with your

87
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,959
help and advice they are getting growing

88
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,679
program there uh so I got to play

89
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,759
certified Organics so all the growing

90
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:37,760
practices uh nutrient management soil

91
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:40,719
recycling climate control Pest and

92
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:42,479
disease M management scheduling so

93
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:45,080
everything that touched the plant side

94
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,119
of things uh I managed there well so

95
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,480
you've essentially shown and proven that

96
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,759
organic cultivation for cannabis can

97
00:03:50,479 --> 00:03:56,399
work on a large commercial scale yeah

98
00:03:53,759 --> 00:04:00,120
absolutely we are not the largest that

99
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:02,840
being said we're fairly uh fairly small

100
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,680
player in the industry but still we have

101
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,000
one of the strongest brand in Canada

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,959
right now and everywhere we go it's

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,039
always uh a treat to hear it people

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,239
saying that we're one of the best

105
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:16,238
product available out there and you're a

106
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:18,000
firm believer in Organics do the

107
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:21,560
importance of providing clean medicine

108
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,439
to your patients essentially yeah we

109
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:25,839
we've seen it a lot and the more talk

110
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:29,279
about it with other people and when we

111
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:31,399
compare our lab results uh from an India

112
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,879
lab with uh and then has a really great

113
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:36,359
lab in uh on UBC campus that's managed

114
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:39,959
by Jonathan Pig one of the F guys that

115
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:42,919
was one of the first to uh sequence

116
00:04:39,959 --> 00:04:45,159
cannabis genome in Canada we have a very

117
00:04:42,918 --> 00:04:47,799
high tpine contents compared to other

118
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,000
producer uh and the medicine is uh very

119
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,319
clean and people really like

120
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,879
it so I think organic is a big uh thing

121
00:04:54,319 --> 00:05:00,599
behind it to produce that thing higher

122
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:04,240
concentration of medicine than

123
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,600
like more plain vanilla fertilizer can

124
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,879
do so the premise then is that there's

125
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:11,879
more benefit to Organics because we

126
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:15,000
don't know all the mechanisms for which

127
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:18,038
cannaboid are are necessarily the most

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,079
beneficial yeah to a patient and

129
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:21,759
Organics uh can you expand on that a

130
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:25,240
little bit just to explain to our users

131
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:29,000
how the microbiology involved in organic

132
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,600
production can affect tpine um tpine

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,240
levels in in Plants we've seen some

134
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,319
people that are growing with or program

135
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,680
as well that done side by-side trials

136
00:05:35,319 --> 00:05:40,439
growing with Organic methods and with

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,519
some conventional Tre part nutrients

138
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:47,240
with a few additive and if thines and um

139
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:49,318
were higher in the organic production so

140
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,879
the way it works the way I like to see

141
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,280
it so like you mentioned we don't fully

142
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:54,839
understand what's going into the soil

143
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,439
and the reason for that a lot of those

144
00:05:54,839 --> 00:06:00,038
soil microorganism we simply cannot

145
00:05:57,439 --> 00:06:02,759
culture them in the lab so so so it's

146
00:06:00,038 --> 00:06:05,399
hard to study them when we build our

147
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:07,439
soil when we build our living soil the

148
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:09,359
way we see we put all the best player in

149
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:10,918
place then we let the plant choose the

150
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,160
interaction that they want to fize

151
00:06:10,918 --> 00:06:15,000
develop depending on which life cycle

152
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:17,520
they already in vegetative grow bre

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,800
projective stage or they're in the late

154
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:22,879
Cent stage so they're letting the plant

155
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,720
choose whatever it wants from the soil

156
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:26,360
uh encouraging which kind of group of

157
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,120
microbes do they want to encourage

158
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,360
bacteria uh fungi actom my SE they

159
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,120
really get what they need when they need

160
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:37,160
it and we're not force feeding any

161
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,759
nutrients in the plant because they have

162
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:42,000
they are in a plant available form and

163
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,000
they're being pushed in the plant right

164
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,598
now so a lot of people are often asking

165
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,560
me an organic how do you flush your

166
00:06:47,598 --> 00:06:51,079
plant well the thing is we we don't

167
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,240
really flush a plant it's still a

168
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:55,038
concept that I think it's because people

169
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:57,680
put too much nutrients or keep

170
00:06:55,038 --> 00:07:00,318
fertilizing too late in the life of the

171
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,560
plant so we just let the plant what it

172
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,280
do what it does so it's going to pump

173
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,959
some of the sugar from the

174
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:09,878
photosynthesize into the the root

175
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,918
exudate encouraging specific type of

176
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,080
microorganism that he can choose what

177
00:07:11,918 --> 00:07:17,279
type of sugar push into the risos spere

178
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:19,079
and The Roots exate to promote some uh

179
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,638
specific group and then choosing the

180
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,198
type of nutrients they need so we just

181
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,840
put everything in place and then let

182
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,000
nature do its thing so really the plant

183
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:30,279
controls this process it's putting out

184
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,279
exudates into the rizosphere that

185
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:34,519
control for which microorganisms make

186
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:36,799
these nutrients available to the plant

187
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:39,799
to to the best of my knowledge I think

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,680
that's what they do so we don't fully

189
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:43,439
know but the latest research that's

190
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,840
that's what it showed there's also a

191
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:47,719
very interesting thing that I came

192
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:50,119
across recently it's called brazo fagi

193
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,879
just plants engulfing whole

194
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,680
microorganism and translocating

195
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:58,319
translocate those microorganism inside

196
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,478
of vasculature system so there's a whole

197
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,560
broad range of things that plant can

198
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,560
uptake from single ions to whole

199
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,199
microorganism so when

200
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,079
you're selecting in your living so for

201
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:13,240
diversity of different type of food

202
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:14,439
broad variety of input nothing in excess

203
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,598
but a little bit of everything and

204
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,598
you're doing the same thing for your

205
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:20,120
fungi population your bacteria your

206
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:24,560
actom and everything so the plants will

207
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,800
really be able to just have whomever

208
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,680
they choose to have whomever they

209
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,799
potentially evolve with for millions of

210
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,799
years to team up with them and then

211
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:38,958
maximize their genetic potential for

212
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:41,000
yield and also tpine and Medicine

213
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:43,079
profile okay that brings up a few

214
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,440
questions for me one I totally agree

215
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,920
with you with what you're saying here in

216
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,800
regards to uh putting the plant in

217
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:51,399
control uh do you feel though that I

218
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,000
know a lot of Growers out there want to

219
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:55,240
maximize yield and they're really

220
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,278
focused on production yeah do you feel

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:59,519
that you're sacrificing yield by

222
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:03,399
allowing the plant to naturally sesse or

223
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,039
not trying to force feed ionic nutrients

224
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,879
or you know a bottle of nutrient program

225
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:10,159
onto these

226
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:13,838
plants to be fully honest maybe a little

227
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:16,039
bit we heard about those crazy like

228
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,680
above three lounds of light yields

229
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:22,319
sometime that I've yet to see under my

230
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:25,719
organic system I've seen often like two

231
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:28,320
and a half pound and more and profitable

232
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,360
uh yield that I've seen but also the

233
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,480
thing that I think so when we're growing

234
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,759
organically also there's a price premium

235
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,000
attached to that and there's a quality

236
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:39,278
and there's a craftsmanship that goes

237
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,159
behind it so among the strongest brand

238
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:42,720
that I've seen are organic and they've

239
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:45,360
been recognized for the quality of the

240
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,440
products and I've seen good uh

241
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,159
production facility that were producing

242
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:52,800
consistently above three pounds of light

243
00:09:50,159 --> 00:09:54,319
according to them but they were tired of

244
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:57,559
that and they decided to switch to

245
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,200
organic cuz the product was just not the

246
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:01,359
best quality product ever so those guys

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,440
are willing to take a little bit of a

248
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:06,839
yield lust to at first because they're

249
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,519
transition period and all that but still

250
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,120
those guys will make their 2 and a half

251
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:12,639
pound of light and potentially three

252
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:15,560
pounds of light there's also the thing

253
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:18,159
that there's not a lot of uh plants that

254
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:19,599
been bred under organic production

255
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:23,519
system right now all those plants have

256
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:25,000
been done by Growers and small or big

257
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,839
like braiding system but they're all

258
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,039
been under uh chemical nutrients so we

259
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,600
where the microbiome is kind of more

260
00:10:30,039 --> 00:10:34,679
absent from that and uh a lot of the

261
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,879
research we did in the lab uh when I did

262
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:39,679
my

263
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:41,639
master degree were focus around the

264
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:43,479
microbiome that we were living inside

265
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:45,480
the plant the Endo fiic bacteria that

266
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,120
will migrate from one generation from

267
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:49,639
they can be uptaken from the roots and

268
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,879
migrate all the way into the seed of the

269
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:54,320
plant so over a generation of time you

270
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:57,000
can have an accumulation of endo fidic

271
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,680
bacteria into the seed that will make a

272
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,919
plant better suited for organic

273
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:02,278
production system so I think that as

274
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,240
soon as we're going to see breeders

275
00:11:02,278 --> 00:11:07,559
starting to develop for organic strains

276
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:09,959
we're going to see a whole new

277
00:11:07,559 --> 00:11:13,479
Revolution of there and all I think most

278
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:16,159
of those strain like been uh developed

279
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,440
for conventional production system I did

280
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:21,799
not know that so if you're an organic

281
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:23,920
grower finding seeds that are were grown

282
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:26,599
organically uh may actually contain

283
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:29,679
beneficial organisms inside the seed

284
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,759
itself yeah absolutely this just some

285
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:33,879
it's it's a very like the first time we

286
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:35,759
realized that uh with one of my

287
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:37,759
colleague in the lab like I basically

288
00:11:35,759 --> 00:11:40,720
got Shivers all over because this has

289
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:44,120
open so many doors because you can

290
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800
really build up beneficial population of

291
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,360
microorganism inside the plant itself

292
00:11:46,799 --> 00:11:51,199
and also everything that happens about

293
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,600
around the epigenetics level of the

294
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,278
plants whatever that is not Crossing and

295
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,240
remixing of that chain but more what

296
00:11:56,278 --> 00:12:00,439
regulates the regulates the Gene's

297
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,320
expression can be affected from one

298
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:07,120
generation to another so epigenetics can

299
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,639
be a very strong tool to adapt plant to

300
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:12,440
organic gring system to be to make them

301
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:14,480
more responsive to

302
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,760
broader range of interaction with

303
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,519
microorganism different type of

304
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:20,879
nutrients instead of just like available

305
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,360
ions like they've been selected

306
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:25,198
forever now this just brings up an

307
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
unrelated question that I've been I've

308
00:12:25,198 --> 00:12:30,198
been kind of curious about uh there's a

309
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,278
lot of talk about degradation of genetic

310
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:36,240
potential in plants with uh cloning over

311
00:12:33,278 --> 00:12:37,838
a series of years or successively over

312
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
time what what have you seen with your

313
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,000
background um in terms of that being

314
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,760
being a potential

315
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,879
problem I it's not something that I've

316
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:51,039
personally touch that much yet uh I've

317
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:54,679
been mostly focusing on uh interg P

318
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:57,838
managent nutrients and soil over the

319
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:59,198
last few years but it's it's like you

320
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,360
mentioned it's something that we keep

321
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:04,159
hearing like the losing of vigor and all

322
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,959
that what I I have observed personally

323
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:09,240
it's the Vigor of a newly selected seed

324
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:11,838
or mutter plant when you germinate a lot

325
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,839
of seed there is definitely a lot of

326
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:16,839
vigor there under their organic

327
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,279
production system we did uh two pounds

328
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,560
of light without CO2 when we just

329
00:13:19,278 --> 00:13:23,919
started and used terrain from seed

330
00:13:21,559 --> 00:13:26,719
there's some increased Viger there so

331
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:27,879
but I I just don't know to be honest but

332
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,360
it seems something that people have

333
00:13:27,879 --> 00:13:32,799
observed so there might be something

334
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:35,240
there the why and the the how I'm not

335
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,838
exactly too sure but I think we've seen

336
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:39,519
that like with uh with funi in the lab

337
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,880
that's something that we observe is like

338
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,959
if you keep feeding the same kind of a

339
00:13:42,879 --> 00:13:47,000
sugar to the fungi and you reproducing

340
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:50,838
it under a petri dish it's going to

341
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:52,559
become lazy frer type of sugar so when

342
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:56,600
you're going to bring back from uh let's

343
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,439
see a m agar on a petri dish to a wood

344
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,800
substrate or sometime they get lazyy

345
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:03,920
they lost kind of chemical Matrix did

346
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:07,399
digested or substr it might be something

347
00:14:03,919 --> 00:14:10,759
like that that uh we see in in Mom's

348
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,320
kept under a longer longer term that's

349
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,120
interesting I heard some speculation

350
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,680
from a friend of mine who went online by

351
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:19,480
the name of spur and he talked about the

352
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:22,319
potential for genetic degradation when

353
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,759
cloning off of uh unhealthy mother

354
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,278
plants that it actually had the

355
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:28,879
potential to change the the genes itself

356
00:14:26,278 --> 00:14:30,360
in the future uh the future clone but I

357
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:32,399
have haven't seen a lot of research on

358
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,240
that one way or another myself there's

359
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,958
definitely something out there that can

360
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:40,919
happen to the epigenetic level that that

361
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:44,239
I was talking earlier so over time the

362
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:45,639
plants will over and under regulate some

363
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,198
genes because it been let's say you have

364
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:50,600
a mom that's been growing for 15 years

365
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:52,879
sometimes those string have been passed

366
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:56,000
from one grow to another one cut from

367
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:58,480
one plant there's some level of control

368
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,600
the plants adapt itself to what they see

369
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,120
so

370
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,040
I I don't know more than that but it's

371
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,799
something that people have talked about

372
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,958
then some old strain that I've seen

373
00:15:05,799 --> 00:15:10,519
people growing the old

374
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,599
original baaba Pink Kush that we see a

375
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,399
lot here in

376
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,639
BC some people are doing very well with

377
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,360
it and other people say ah plus the

378
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,959
Viger that cut is too old and people are

379
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,278
talking about back Crossing and doing

380
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:26,838
some stuff to get the Vigor back and but

381
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:28,399
keeping the same story by pupping you

382
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:31,360
seeds so but it's something I haven't

383
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,519
dabbled to much with but it seemed to be

384
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,039
there well let's get back into your area

385
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:38,440
of expertise then yeah uh so one thing

386
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:41,120
that I want to touch on is when you were

387
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:43,839
talking about grower switching over to

388
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:46,679
the style of growing that you're doing

389
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:50,000
and that you may not push yield quite as

390
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:51,399
far as you would adding ionic nutrients

391
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,759
uh one of the things that we didn't talk

392
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:56,278
about was all of the labor savings and

393
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:58,440
nutrient savings that you're

394
00:15:56,278 --> 00:16:01,799
experiencing oh yeah and that that's

395
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:04,920
huge as much as trying to up production

396
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:07,399
uh reducing your expenses is and and

397
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:08,679
labor is is a huge aspect of that can

398
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:10,879
you talk a little bit about some of

399
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:13,078
those benefits yeah absolutely I'm glad

400
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:14,759
you bring that up because we all hear

401
00:16:13,078 --> 00:16:16,519
about the pound per light but you don't

402
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:20,199
hear a lot of people talking about

403
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,959
margins and coming from commercial

404
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:24,078
agricultural background it's that's all

405
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:26,078
people talk about like some parer some

406
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:28,719
farmer will take a yield loss and not

407
00:16:26,078 --> 00:16:30,239
plow their field one year because fuel

408
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,278
is too cheap they're going to reduce

409
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,120
their yield but overall they're going to

410
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:36,120
make more money because they save on

411
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:39,440
fuel at the beginning of the season

412
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,759
so there's this old aspect where you

413
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:44,880
we're using living soil you don't have

414
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:48,680
to mix bottle of nutrient daytoday

415
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:51,078
anymore or way less than mixing

416
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:53,198
everything phing you have to take from

417
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:56,078
like five some sometimes 10 different

418
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:58,958
buttles to make your nutrient mix uh we

419
00:16:56,078 --> 00:17:00,758
do dub dress once or sometime twice

420
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,919
string old growth cycle and that's about

421
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,240
it for us so the labor savings are huge

422
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:08,599
so all you have to do after that is to

423
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,359
irrigate your so uh you don't push a lot

424
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,359
of like salt in your irrigation system

425
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,038
so you get less clogging we don't use a

426
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,479
lot of those what's clogging mostly

427
00:17:15,038 --> 00:17:20,519
emitters it's potassium sulfate uh that

428
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:23,078
reacts with phosphorus fertilizer so we

429
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:26,480
don't have clogging of the line so much

430
00:17:23,078 --> 00:17:30,519
so there's huge saving just there also

431
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:33,319
when you buy um single nutrients uh like

432
00:17:30,519 --> 00:17:35,319
say you buy just your alal just your

433
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:37,279
rock phosphate and stuff like that

434
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:39,599
they're so cheap buy the kilo compared

435
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:42,639
to those other fertilizer and sometime

436
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:45,359
the ferti fertilizer value is is higher

437
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:48,240
so in case of federan blood meal we're

438
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:51,558
going to pay two to $3 a kilo and

439
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,960
they're 14% phosphorus which is still

440
00:17:51,558 --> 00:17:55,639
expensive agricultural word but in the

441
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,440
Cannabis world that's dirt cheap for

442
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,360
nitrogen yeah you have a high value crop

443
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,600
so you can afford to put put on these

444
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:03,759
nutrients at optimal levels yes you

445
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:05,399
bring up a good point though let's talk

446
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:07,119
a little about bottle of nutrients and

447
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,320
what your background and thoughts and

448
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:11,038
experience are with that and how a lot

449
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:14,079
of Growers are using them and you've

450
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:16,879
managed to grow for a fraction of the

451
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:18,639
cost uh without using bottle nutrients

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,880
yeah yeah in term of nutrients from

453
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,640
starts to finish uh we're about couple

454
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,200
Cent per gram worth of nutrients uh in

455
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:29,480
her product the B nutrients what I've

456
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,798
seen from that seen everything for

457
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,200
people growing outside they're going to

458
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:36,400
have incomplete nutrients because people

459
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,319
want to carry just one part nutrients so

460
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,759
um the nutrient won't be complete uh

461
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:42,759
because when you mix calcium and

462
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:44,879
phosphorus at high rate into a bottle

463
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:47,200
they precipitate they go out of solution

464
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:50,039
and they're not plant available so this

465
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,679
is why we have sometime several bottle

466
00:18:50,038 --> 00:18:53,919
nutrients but when you go in the

467
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,480
aricultural industry you never see those

468
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,840
kind of nutrients what you see is like

469
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:00,720
single salt if you're not organic so

470
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:04,558
you're going to buy like U

471
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,240
potassium monop potassium phosphate so

472
00:19:04,558 --> 00:19:10,240
05030 and stuff like that that come in

473
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:12,240
pounds of uh like in bags of 50 pounds

474
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,079
and then you just dilute that in tank a

475
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,880
tank B so basically what you're doing is

476
00:19:14,079 --> 00:19:18,798
you're making those every bottle that

477
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,679
you have in your um your shop that

478
00:19:18,798 --> 00:19:23,400
you're buying on shelf you're making

479
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:27,559
giant tanks of that in your greenhouse

480
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,640
and you're paying so much cheaper for

481
00:19:27,558 --> 00:19:32,639
for that because they been premixed for

482
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,679
you and also you're not shipping water

483
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,320
around anymore so most of those bottled

484
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:37,919
nutrients the primary ingredient is

485
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:41,000
going to be water they're diluting them

486
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:45,120
down well I mean they're only 3%

487
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,440
sometime 5% of a nutrient uh so the rest

488
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:50,399
of the 10 the 90% must be water most of

489
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,080
the time yeah we were talking before we

490
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,360
started the podcast about how you don't

491
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:55,678
really know what's necessarily in those

492
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,479
bottled of nutrients and you had

493
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,320
mentioned you don't like to use products

494
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,759
where you don't know yeah what's in them

495
00:20:00,319 --> 00:20:03,038
similar to what you put in your body do

496
00:20:01,759 --> 00:20:05,839
you want to expand on that it's just

497
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:09,558
when we uh we know so much about what

498
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:11,959
goes in our soil we uh de develop those

499
00:20:09,558 --> 00:20:15,038
this living biology of your in your soil

500
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:18,000
and all of that uh so I know what my

501
00:20:15,038 --> 00:20:21,400
nutrient test is and when sometimes you

502
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,960
you see those nutrient additive and that

503
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,919
they're not necessarily used for their

504
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:26,679
main nutrient but they might have a

505
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:29,159
normal charge they might have

506
00:20:26,679 --> 00:20:32,159
microorganism and there's just like

507
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,720
they uh Market it as like growth and

508
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,000
answer B driving and you have a picture

509
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:39,600
of a giant Frosty bot on it and when I

510
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,599
don't know exactly what's in there I

511
00:20:39,599 --> 00:20:44,439
find it hard to put that in a system

512
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:47,599
that we've built and we fully understand

513
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:49,480
and we know how it reacts to things so

514
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:52,359
or also sometime there's just not

515
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,640
certified organic and we can't use them

516
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:57,199
but just as a general with some grow

517
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,720
Growers are saying when we do I do a

518
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,679
little bit of Consulting I have this

519
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,519
problem here what should I add oh this

520
00:21:00,679 --> 00:21:06,000
is this type of they have an iron

521
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:08,519
deficiency or a boron

522
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,759
deficiency they don't know what to add

523
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:12,759
for that because there's nothing on

524
00:21:10,759 --> 00:21:15,798
their bottle that says used this for

525
00:21:12,759 --> 00:21:18,359
iron deficiency or sometime they will

526
00:21:15,798 --> 00:21:21,158
have a lot of other nents with a little

527
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:23,639
bit of iron so it's hard to pinpoint

528
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:25,840
problems and assess and specific cation

529
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,600
those btal nutrients yeah here in

530
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,119
Washington uh when I got my soil

531
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:32,079
registered as a fertilizer it's really

532
00:21:30,119 --> 00:21:35,079
interesting so I I did a guaranteed

533
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:38,839
analysis for nitrogen phosphorus

534
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:42,079
potassium calcium uh so on the label it

535
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:44,319
says what a minimum amount would be but

536
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:47,359
as a fertilizer company you don't have

537
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:50,759
to say yes what a maximum is so I could

538
00:21:47,359 --> 00:21:54,199
have I could have 10% potassium in there

539
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,879
and claim 3% and I'd be okay as far as

540
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,840
the Washington State Department of egg

541
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,799
is concerned and I don't they don't you

542
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:02,599
don't know what the iron manganese any

543
00:21:59,798 --> 00:22:05,839
of those other you know secondary

544
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:08,119
elements are and so as a grower it can

545
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:09,959
be I think it can be a real challenge

546
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:11,278
unless you get an independent soil test

547
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,278
to really know what you're putting on

548
00:22:11,278 --> 00:22:15,480
your plant yeah absolutely and sometimes

549
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:17,759
those product are better off like uh

550
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,120
having more product in there than less

551
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:22,158
because you know so if they only have

552
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:24,199
like 1% phosphorus when they claim they

553
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:27,360
had five that's a problem but when they

554
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,840
say minimum guaranteed analysis and it's

555
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:32,719
five and you you have 10 sometime it's a

556
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:35,079
problem as well so yeah and especially

557
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,640
for other product that I'm not going to

558
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:38,119
name any brand but there's some product

559
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,720
that's been recalled off the shelf

560
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:44,038
because they were not sell as pesticide

561
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,839
there were just as a they would held for

562
00:22:44,038 --> 00:22:48,879
spiderm let's see but it was fully

563
00:22:46,839 --> 00:22:50,879
perrines that were in the product and

564
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,600
they were being on the shelf for years

565
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,360
and nobody knew what there was and there

566
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:56,558
there just never been checked before and

567
00:22:54,359 --> 00:22:59,439
turns out it was purr and was an

568
00:22:56,558 --> 00:23:00,960
unregistered pesticide use on a crop

569
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,919
this is dangerous for yourself your

570
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,960
labor and your end user as well that's

571
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
that's a huge problem here in the states

572
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,759
I know for fact that a lot of Growers

573
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:11,000
are using things that they're not

574
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:14,000
supposed to use too even even something

575
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,839
they're aware of so things like Eagle 20

576
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,919
Avid exactly you're obviously you guys

577
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:23,319
are uh highly regulated by the Canadian

578
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,120
government and you're managing to do uh

579
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:28,519
deal with all of these problems without

580
00:23:25,119 --> 00:23:30,239
using any chemical pesticides so what

581
00:23:28,519 --> 00:23:32,119
what do you use for pm and mites and

582
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,000
things like that how do you manage these

583
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:36,479
these problems so the IPM program we

584
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,679
have the integrative Pest Management

585
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,839
it's one of the Cornerstone of our all

586
00:23:38,679 --> 00:23:44,038
our production so for spider mites and

587
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:48,240
any insects and all that we do use

588
00:23:44,038 --> 00:23:51,480
beneficial insect so we use a lot of P

589
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:55,038
felus personalis to control spym Cal

590
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:56,519
fornicus predetor M uh we use SW key to

591
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:59,000
control for

592
00:23:56,519 --> 00:24:01,960
thrips and we use a th

593
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,759
coriaria and hpo apsis for controlling

594
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:07,679
fungus nuts uh so we have we're able to

595
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:10,400
achieve like a perfect level of control

596
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,159
with uh those beneficial insects when I

597
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:16,038
started to work uh at wer medical at

598
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:19,559
first they were tents on some of the

599
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:21,839
plants a fully spider Webb bud and stuff

600
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:24,798
like that guys were vacuuming the buds

601
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:26,359
every day but after oh yeah it was

602
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:29,038
pretty intense I've never seen anything

603
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:32,839
like that before but after couple months

604
00:24:29,038 --> 00:24:34,798
and after meeting you and uh ja Palmer

605
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:37,158
that worked with you I'd keep it simple

606
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:39,000
like introducing californicus and a few

607
00:24:37,159 --> 00:24:40,880
other beneficial just changing what they

608
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,759
were using and increasing the frequency

609
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
and rat we were able to completely get

610
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:47,720
rid of spider mites after one full cycle

611
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:50,000
throughout our facility and we've seen

612
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:52,519
the odd little damage here and there but

613
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,599
I've never sprayed a single insect to

614
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:57,679
side in my uh in my shop over two years

615
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:58,918
wow that's amazing and you bring up a

616
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,919
good point to

617
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:03,480
uh I think I think it's important that

618
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:06,440
listeners realize that these things are

619
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,120
not instant uh no instant Treatment

620
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,038
Solutions and it does take a little bit

621
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:11,798
of time for these populations to build

622
00:25:10,038 --> 00:25:14,398
and you do have to apply them at at

623
00:25:11,798 --> 00:25:16,639
higher levels cannabis is a very sticky

624
00:25:14,398 --> 00:25:19,719
plant they're crawling to tricomes they

625
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,799
spend time cleaning themsel up uh or

626
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,839
maybe they even get high I don't know

627
00:25:21,798 --> 00:25:25,278
but there it's a very when you work with

628
00:25:23,839 --> 00:25:26,918
a plant yourself you feel it on your

629
00:25:25,278 --> 00:25:29,640
glove and your skins I can't imagine

630
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:31,120
crawling through a forest of Tricom to

631
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,360
try to find

632
00:25:31,119 --> 00:25:37,359
food but well tricomes are a natural

633
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:39,918
defense system by the plan yeah uh yeah

634
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:41,918
absolutely that being said I feel feel

635
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,360
like it was fairly easy for us to get

636
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,320
rid of that but I was there every day

637
00:25:43,359 --> 00:25:49,240
checking on that and have a have a

638
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:52,678
academic background doing that uh but

639
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:54,759
when I went and introduced that same

640
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:57,120
identical integrated Pest management

641
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:59,879
system and other shop we didn't add

642
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,839
always ice the same success rate so the

643
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,520
way you implement that system the way

644
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:05,639
you have your work flow through your

645
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:08,519
facility is also very important so

646
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:10,320
moving from infested to clean ARA so

647
00:26:08,519 --> 00:26:12,359
start and work in the clean area at

648
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:15,720
first when you get there during the day

649
00:26:12,359 --> 00:26:17,839
hair nets and changing boots we do

650
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,720
change the clothes from one room to

651
00:26:17,839 --> 00:26:22,599
another we just put a lab coat on and

652
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:25,440
change our airet gloves and disinfect

653
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:28,359
your boots that that's huge we have I

654
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,240
have some Growers here that that were

655
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:32,319
working in Greenhouse we started to do

656
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,640
the biocontrol insect program we had

657
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:38,558
really good success in the vegetative a

658
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,640
little bit tougher in uh flowering but

659
00:26:38,558 --> 00:26:43,599
we we were pretty sure that after one

660
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:46,000
cycle they would be pretty clean but

661
00:26:43,599 --> 00:26:48,038
then on the next cycle things got worse

662
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,599
and we're scratching her headed trying

663
00:26:48,038 --> 00:26:52,480
to figure out what happened and all that

664
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:55,319
to finally realize that it's the bamboo

665
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,319
stick that the grower was using so as a

666
00:26:55,319 --> 00:27:01,398
a steak so he took the bamboo from

667
00:26:58,319 --> 00:27:03,359
harvesting a flower room that were

668
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:05,239
infested with Spiderman and put that

669
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:06,798
into the new veg plants that were going

670
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,278
in there even though he clean the room

671
00:27:06,798 --> 00:27:12,918
and all that the spider might run away

672
00:27:10,278 --> 00:27:14,759
from the predatory insects they crawl

673
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,679
inside the bamboo stick come out when

674
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:21,839
it's u in a in a new room so we have

675
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:24,480
super high infestation right from spider

676
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:26,759
right from the GetGo so there's little

677
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:30,120
details like that that if you don't pick

678
00:27:26,759 --> 00:27:33,079
on early or Fe don't know it's just hard

679
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:35,479
to manage but so your workflow out your

680
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:37,798
labor and people move from one room to

681
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,360
another it's super important everything

682
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:41,240
also super important from your your

683
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,199
mother room where you start there

684
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,038
starting with clean product I usually

685
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:48,798
just double the rates of insect uh in my

686
00:27:47,038 --> 00:27:50,720
mother room compared to the rest of my

687
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,398
facility which has already kind of

688
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,798
doubled compared to the rest of the

689
00:27:52,398 --> 00:27:57,038
industry just to make sure that we're

690
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:58,319
starting with clean product all the time

691
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:59,919
that's a really good point I never want

692
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:02,240
thought ofak that was such a

693
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:04,320
heartbreaker at at our farm uh being in

694
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:07,120
a greenhouse and being out essentially

695
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:09,200
outdoors I find it's a very different

696
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,639
situation uh we can plant a lot of

697
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,600
pollinators around the property a lot of

698
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:16,159
uh a lot of plants that attract

699
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:17,918
beneficial insects and so I may see a

700
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,640
might here or there but then I'll also

701
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,000
see a ladybug and I'll see beneficial

702
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,600
insects and you don't have the same

703
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,720
outbreak problems that you have to deal

704
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:29,079
with in a closed facility like what

705
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:31,200
you're what you're unfortunately just a

706
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:33,038
past insect make it in in a clo

707
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,640
environment all the time they all often

708
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:38,038
they will make it in from your staff or

709
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:40,679
yourself if you're going and working in

710
00:28:38,038 --> 00:28:43,119
another production facility or if you

711
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:44,960
have some guys that have their personal

712
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:47,199
production license at home they will

713
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,600
drag the spiderm mites and thrips in

714
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,558
there yes let's talk powdery mildew and

715
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:53,798
fungal diseases a little bit here yeah

716
00:28:51,558 --> 00:28:56,519
what's your uh game plan on that powdery

717
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:58,759
milu so cleaning the room very well

718
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:01,278
between psycho one little thing that

719
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:04,240
we've started to do our I've started to

720
00:29:01,278 --> 00:29:07,000
OZO in my rooms between cycle so just an

721
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,359
overnight we shut shut off any exhaust

722
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,519
we keep the fan recirculating everywhere

723
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:13,879
and we have an ozone generator in there

724
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:16,000
on a timer you got to be very careful

725
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:17,480
with that because ozone is very toxic to

726
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,200
people so you don't want to be in the

727
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:22,319
room you don't want to have to have any

728
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,360
of your stuff in there but ozone will uh

729
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:27,678
disinfect everything on contact cuz it's

730
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:30,599
so oxidative it just rips electron from

731
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:33,798
everything it's going to go in Nicks and

732
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:36,558
micro cracks and just kill everything so

733
00:29:33,798 --> 00:29:39,398
that's a pretty good one so using

734
00:29:36,558 --> 00:29:41,158
hydrogen peroxide doing like a fation or

735
00:29:39,398 --> 00:29:43,759
fold your spray of the wall and

736
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:45,600
everything if you don't have the time to

737
00:29:43,759 --> 00:29:48,519
clean every pieces of dust and

738
00:29:45,599 --> 00:29:50,398
everything getting rid of any wood in

739
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:52,679
your growing room is also a good one

740
00:29:50,398 --> 00:29:55,319
pretty hard to disinfect wood and making

741
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:57,080
sure you have the least surface area

742
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:59,678
possible aside your your plant and

743
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:01,918
you're growing meat Med so any overhead

744
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:05,080
structures if you have a lot of wire or

745
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,080
anything that can Harbor spores if you

746
00:30:05,079 --> 00:30:10,639
can get rid of it get rid of it they

747
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:12,639
easy to clean room but that's for

748
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,080
prevention uh or cleaning your room

749
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,559
between cycle for prevention on the

750
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,558
plants with there's very few program

751
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:21,918
product that we can use in in Canada

752
00:30:19,558 --> 00:30:24,480
here there's a actinovate which is a

753
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,360
bacteria problem with actinovate is if

754
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,960
you spray two lights on your crops

755
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,479
you're going to create a false positive

756
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,919
for your microorganism test uh microbial

757
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:36,399
test post Harvest test so you got to be

758
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,480
careful that you're again starting very

759
00:30:36,398 --> 00:30:42,558
early starting on your mom rotate

760
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:43,960
through we have actinovate also uh mstep

761
00:30:42,558 --> 00:30:45,278
which is potassium bicarbonate it's

762
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,240
going to change the pH in the leaf

763
00:30:45,278 --> 00:30:50,319
surface make it harder for the plant to

764
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,880
for the Spore to germinate those are the

765
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:56,158
two that you can use a sulfur vaporizer

766
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:58,559
are also another good one but make sure

767
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,600
you turn them off for late flowering

768
00:30:58,558 --> 00:31:02,638
stage otherwise you going give a pu

769
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:05,599
taste your product those are all stuff

770
00:31:02,638 --> 00:31:08,319
that we can use but also it's to stay on

771
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:11,398
top of it but also compost tea is a

772
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:14,079
really good one but again be very

773
00:31:11,398 --> 00:31:15,839
mindful of your micr test Don't Spray

774
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:18,480
any of that when you have a room in

775
00:31:15,839 --> 00:31:21,638
flowering or anything past week two

776
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,038
because that's uh that's a super highly

777
00:31:21,638 --> 00:31:26,798
charged microbal spray if you use a

778
00:31:24,038 --> 00:31:29,079
composting foler so what it will do it

779
00:31:26,798 --> 00:31:32,158
will basically put probiotics in the

780
00:31:29,079 --> 00:31:33,879
leaf so you're going to have a the goal

781
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,320
when you're applying compost as a foil

782
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:38,000
it's basically just to colonize your

783
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:39,038
Leaf surface even if your microorganism

784
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,679
that you're going to put in there are

785
00:31:39,038 --> 00:31:43,278
not going to do anything actively

786
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,880
beneficial for the plants or actively

787
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:48,278
5pm it's like having a a room that's

788
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:50,080
already so crowed that nobody else can

789
00:31:48,278 --> 00:31:52,960
get in so you're trying to have a big

790
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:55,240
party of microorganism so big that uh

791
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:57,679
the powdery M you is left on the porch

792
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,120
cuz it's too crowded in there so what do

793
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:03,159
you do when you have a plant that

794
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:05,678
obviously has uh pm and you're let's say

795
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:08,519
midflower what's your protocol then oh I

796
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,000
just hope it's not going to happen but

797
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,679
what we did we did some uh hydrogen

798
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,480
peroxide spot spraying we're usually

799
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:19,159
going to get rid of that plant but we're

800
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,880
going to before we touch or do anything

801
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:23,240
we're going to spray it down with the

802
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,760
hydrogen peroxide which will only kill

803
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:28,599
the spores hydrogen peroxide won't kill

804
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:32,119
the live melium of PM so what we would

805
00:32:28,599 --> 00:32:34,278
do we would uh bag it up and do um and

806
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:37,719
just get rid of it and uh hope for the

807
00:32:34,278 --> 00:32:40,319
best but we can take a little bit of PM

808
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:42,000
uh if it's not causing too much uh crop

809
00:32:40,319 --> 00:32:43,918
loss of stress like that and we're we're

810
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,720
going to do like a super thorough clean

811
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:50,200
up other rooms but uh it's it's so far

812
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:53,558
finger cross it haven't happened to us

813
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:55,960
we also use a UV lights in our hbac

814
00:32:53,558 --> 00:32:58,879
system so air systems constantly

815
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,840
recirculating so by having UV lights

816
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,639
just household UV light they're super

817
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:05,798
cheap they're you can get one for other

818
00:33:03,638 --> 00:33:07,359
100 bucks it's just going to sterilize

819
00:33:05,798 --> 00:33:09,119
the air that flows around it so it's

820
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:11,839
going to consistently decrease your

821
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:13,518
Airborne Spore count in your room of any

822
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,079
microorganism so that's another good

823
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,038
preventive thing to have at all time and

824
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:20,119
then genetics plays a key role

825
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:22,200
absolutely so if ever you're doing a

826
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:25,158
little bit of breeding again at the

827
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,159
epigenetics level if your parent plants

828
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:29,360
have been subjected to M you or if

829
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,600
you're doing breeding and trying to

830
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:35,240
breed for mili I would suggest just

831
00:33:31,599 --> 00:33:37,038
infect your plant when they're um in

832
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:39,038
their in your breeding tent or whatever

833
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:41,558
you're using to breed just infect your

834
00:33:39,038 --> 00:33:44,000
plant with milu if you if you if you can

835
00:33:41,558 --> 00:33:46,398
afford that and just let them breed

836
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,038
seeds under PM condition and then those

837
00:33:46,398 --> 00:33:50,879
seeds will be more resistant to uh PM

838
00:33:49,038 --> 00:33:53,158
just from the epigenetic side you can do

839
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,120
that another generation and you're going

840
00:33:53,159 --> 00:33:58,240
to have like already you have built-in

841
00:33:55,119 --> 00:34:00,518
resistance in your plant for a Deb

842
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,880
and some strains are just like so weak

843
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,759
for PM it's just like you can't even

844
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,799
grow them they're going to get PM no

845
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:09,559
matter what so let's talk about yeah

846
00:34:06,798 --> 00:34:12,280
let's talk about humidity air flow and

847
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:14,639
pruning then in terms of helping reduce

848
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,440
fungal pathogen one thing that I've seen

849
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,919
too often unfortunately it's Growers

850
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:22,838
trying to mitigate fungal Problems by

851
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:25,279
keeping their room super dry you're

852
00:34:22,838 --> 00:34:27,358
going to see like 40% humidity level

853
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,440
which stresses the plant can geop parize

854
00:34:27,358 --> 00:34:30,239
your year yield and all that whereas if

855
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,679
you

856
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:34,799
prune the bottom of your plants for

857
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:38,159
yourself we're doing a kind of sea of

858
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,839
green uh so we need to have a the good 6

859
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,800
in off the soil clean up do you have a

860
00:34:40,838 --> 00:34:45,599
good air flow and there but if you have

861
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:48,399
bigger plants the leafing and keeping

862
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,200
them not like blasting with a fan but

863
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:52,000
air flow moving through them it's very

864
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,918
important what you want to get rid of

865
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,838
it's this due point when you have your

866
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,358
lights coming on and off where your

867
00:34:55,838 --> 00:35:00,838
temperature is dropping you have a lot

868
00:34:57,358 --> 00:35:02,960
of moisture in the air as the air cools

869
00:35:00,838 --> 00:35:06,279
down and compacts and then you have this

870
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,280
do point and high humidity

871
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,079
level and this is when your stoms pour

872
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:14,440
your stom are still open on your Leaf

873
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,800
surface it's very humid in the air and

874
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,000
then you're going to have a spor PM

875
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:21,359
germinating and making it into a

876
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,358
stomatal space and infecting the plant

877
00:35:21,358 --> 00:35:26,000
this window of infection that you want

878
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:28,880
to get rid of so some I think that's the

879
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:31,639
gavita that have like sunrise Sunset

880
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,119
setting on them seems to be a good way

881
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:36,440
to get rid of that du Point ourself

882
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:38,480
we've been doing that by having a couple

883
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:41,599
extra lights on a separate timer in a

884
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,800
room that would stay for an extra 15 to

885
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:47,000
half an hour on where the main the rest

886
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:49,720
of the light have been shut down you

887
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,119
could also set up your timer to uh

888
00:35:49,719 --> 00:35:54,000
refresh uh the air when your lights are

889
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:56,240
shutting off so you're going to have

890
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,800
more cool hair moving into your room

891
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,318
instead of having that warm air are

892
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:03,039
cooling down and then just dumping all

893
00:36:00,318 --> 00:36:05,318
that uh humidity back on your plants so

894
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:07,719
those kind of uh those kind of things

895
00:36:05,318 --> 00:36:09,880
that's really interesting I know I see

896
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:13,039
at our farm we always see PM whenever we

897
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:15,640
have a a big fluctuation in humidity so

898
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:17,679
where we have uh a sunny day followed by

899
00:36:15,639 --> 00:36:19,838
a really rainy day or vice versa then

900
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:22,598
we'll typically see PM over the

901
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:24,639
following week on all of our Sash and

902
00:36:22,599 --> 00:36:26,359
things like that and and the same with

903
00:36:24,639 --> 00:36:28,960
with cannabis we'll see people running

904
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:31,960
you know you go from uh a veg cycle

905
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,039
where they may be at I don't know 60 65%

906
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:36,280
humidity and then switching into flow

907
00:36:34,039 --> 00:36:38,480
and just dropping that humidity to 40%

908
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,160
it's a huge shock for the plants oh yeah

909
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:43,280
and uh I I want to save humidity for G

910
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,679
Palmer when I get him on here because

911
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,920
he's got some really interesting

912
00:36:44,679 --> 00:36:49,639
thoughts on it yeah yeah ja's pretty

913
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:51,880
sharpen that there I still have yet to

914
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:54,400
try a lot of uh the cool stuff you came

915
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:56,760
across with yeah so I wna I want to save

916
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,000
that that piece but I'm really excited

917
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,680
to talk about it I guess I I want to ask

918
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,159
you too are you reusing your soil or how

919
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:05,279
are what is the workflow in terms of uh

920
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:07,199
plant size you mentioned that you're

921
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,280
doing sea of green yeah can you talk a

922
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:11,118
little more about about all that and and

923
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,640
then also uh well I want to talk to you

924
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,838
more about a little about soil mixing

925
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:15,679
and nutrients too but we'll get into

926
00:37:13,838 --> 00:37:18,358
that in a sec so yeah we we just started

927
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:21,919
to reuse our soil friendly uh we move

928
00:37:18,358 --> 00:37:24,279
into rolling beds so we have tables that

929
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,519
R rolls side to side in our room so we

930
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:29,200
occupy more of our floor space instead

931
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:31,079
of having five Allway in the room that

932
00:37:29,199 --> 00:37:32,919
allowed us to walk between a row of

933
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:35,039
putts now we have just one Allway that

934
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,440
we move wherever we want it into a room

935
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:42,000
and we have uh beds of soil that are

936
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:45,720
about 8 in Deep by four and 4 and 1/2t

937
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,318
wide by 50t long with a a smart po

938
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:51,480
custom liner in them and they're all in

939
00:37:48,318 --> 00:37:53,599
aluminum trellis so we got really the

940
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:56,240
all the surfaces of the soil are exposed

941
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:58,079
to air so we get completely aerobic

942
00:37:56,239 --> 00:38:00,159
condition in our soil

943
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,359
and since we it's a lot of work to move

944
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:06,118
soil into do bed we've uh we're reusing

945
00:38:03,358 --> 00:38:07,719
the soil uh before we were not we were

946
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:10,640
just giving it away to some local

947
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,639
organic grower or soil but now we're

948
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:15,199
reusing or soil when we find that it

949
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:17,159
just gets better the more cycle we do in

950
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:19,639
it the first cycle are pretty good but

951
00:38:17,159 --> 00:38:21,759
the second cycle especially if you're

952
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,960
careful with the the tilling we don't

953
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,640
till it completely we just mix in the

954
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,480
first two three in of soil when we're

955
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:31,400
weend to and that if we have to reimen

956
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,159
that's all based on a soil test we just

957
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,200
mix those nutrients into the first two

958
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:37,318
three Ines of soil we leave the the rest

959
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:40,399
of the soil undisturbed not to disturb

960
00:38:37,318 --> 00:38:42,199
that melium that runs throughout the

961
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,480
whole soil and when we're replanting our

962
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:49,759
plants we're just reconnecting to that

963
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,719
melum which is the internet of our uh

964
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,440
growing beds and then the plants just

965
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:56,959
look the second round and third round

966
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:59,000
they just take off and they look just so

967
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,880
good so you bring up something that I

968
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,358
talked about with Steve Solomon already

969
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,640
and I have an opinion on and yours is

970
00:39:03,358 --> 00:39:06,598
going to be a little different so I want

971
00:39:04,639 --> 00:39:08,318
to hear it I know this whole no till

972
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:11,800
concept is really popular right now with

973
00:39:08,318 --> 00:39:14,559
indoor Growers yeah and living soils my

974
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,119
take on it is no till is not totally

975
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:18,039
accurate because we're not tilling the

976
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:19,800
soil like we would agricultural land

977
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:22,159
which is very very disturbing to the

978
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,560
microorganisms yeah but when you're

979
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:26,078
growing plants uh a little larger than

980
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:29,480
you are where the root systems are

981
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:31,839
getting down you know know 6 8 in a foot

982
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:34,679
down into the soil how do you get the

983
00:39:31,838 --> 00:39:35,960
nutrients down into that area of the

984
00:39:34,679 --> 00:39:38,279
rizosphere

985
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:40,280
quickly in terms of a grow cycle because

986
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,599
traditionally in agriculture you know

987
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,920
you could till it in or top dress it you

988
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,640
have 68 months or that off season for

989
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:49,400
those nutrients to work their way down

990
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:51,039
into the soil yeah uh we don't have that

991
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,160
luxury you know typically you're

992
00:39:51,039 --> 00:39:56,880
replanting you know 24 36 hours later in

993
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:58,440
some cases yeah so if you weren't doing

994
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,000
a SE green do you think you would have

995
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,960
the same would you need to till the

996
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:06,000
nutrients in further or would you still

997
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:07,920
stick to that 2 3 in if if I had deeper

998
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:09,519
soil I would go maybe a little bit

999
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:11,318
deeper and you just you don't want to

1000
00:40:09,519 --> 00:40:14,318
turn into you don't want to turn your

1001
00:40:11,318 --> 00:40:17,239
soil surface into a brick I mean we're

1002
00:40:14,318 --> 00:40:19,480
using sometime a lot of different uh

1003
00:40:17,239 --> 00:40:21,559
Rock Dust glacial rock dust or basalt

1004
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:24,400
rock dust and of of course if you're

1005
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:27,358
using iate of that in just only 2 in of

1006
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,400
soil it doesn't look like super nice

1007
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:32,119
fluffy rated soil in more so it's a bit

1008
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,480
of a judgmental call of that I'm not

1009
00:40:32,119 --> 00:40:37,079
going to say I'm using no till uh no

1010
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:38,920
tail I think like you mentioned really

1011
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:41,000
coming from the agricultural system I

1012
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:43,440
think there's beneficial to break up the

1013
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:46,559
soil a little bit but I haven't done the

1014
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,318
side by side test completely but to me

1015
00:40:46,559 --> 00:40:51,679
like if I have to leave a layer of soil

1016
00:40:48,318 --> 00:40:53,719
and disturb it's I'm fine with that I

1017
00:40:51,679 --> 00:40:55,399
think it's it's potentially good but it

1018
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:57,399
doesn't mean that I don't want to

1019
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:58,800
disturb myself so I want to disturb my

1020
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,920
so this is little less bustable it's

1021
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,480
going to increase microbial activity

1022
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:06,639
braking your soil and some stuff uh

1023
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:08,199
mostly aerobic bacteria will Thrive

1024
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,440
after you do that so how deep are your

1025
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:12,879
beds again I missed that sorry uh just

1026
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:14,440
uh 8 in deep okay and so you're putting

1027
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
the nutrients in the first few inches

1028
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:18,480
and then running a sea grain in the

1029
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,440
first half and the first half of the

1030
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,400
soil then with the with proper

1031
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:24,119
irrigation they're going to go down in

1032
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:26,599
there but also another cool thing that

1033
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:28,240
you can do is you can add worms to your

1034
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:29,960
beds and they're going to move your tub

1035
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:32,078
dress up and down for you that's a

1036
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,720
really good point yeah or I found if you

1037
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,079
use worm castings they typically have uh

1038
00:41:34,719 --> 00:41:39,078
cocoons in there already and eggs and so

1039
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,200
you don't even need to necessarily add

1040
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:43,280
worms they seem to just show up lot

1041
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:45,919
cases yeah or just add them they're

1042
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:48,040
pretty cool guys free Labor All right so

1043
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,639
uh let's talk let's talk specific

1044
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:54,358
nutrients now uh when I was talking to

1045
00:41:50,639 --> 00:41:56,480
Steve my experience and uh he seemed to

1046
00:41:54,358 --> 00:41:57,960
agree with me uh is that cannabis seems

1047
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:59,838
to be a pretty po potassium hungry

1048
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:02,039
plants what are you finding are the

1049
00:41:59,838 --> 00:42:05,159
major nutrients cuz this whole idea of

1050
00:42:02,039 --> 00:42:08,358
you know nitrogen in in nitrogen veg

1051
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:10,358
phosphorus and Bloom and apply cowm is

1052
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:12,559
sort of the been the standard for the

1053
00:42:10,358 --> 00:42:14,719
industry forever but it's really not

1054
00:42:12,559 --> 00:42:16,599
that uh really not that accurate yeah

1055
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:18,239
potassium is uh you're going to see it

1056
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:21,160
fairly fast and even though you have

1057
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:23,519
like level of potassium that sound like

1058
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:26,159
absurd for under crop like cannabis just

1059
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:28,559
like seems to thrive under those level

1060
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:30,118
what I found myself was done with

1061
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,519
potassium I think we have pretty similar

1062
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:35,838
level of potassium in our so T you and I

1063
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:38,199
but what I've seen a lot myself and i'

1064
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:40,078
I've walked through a lot of program and

1065
00:42:38,199 --> 00:42:41,679
I've seen that it's iron deficiency

1066
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,880
pictures and magazine with plant that

1067
00:42:41,679 --> 00:42:45,879
have iron deficiency I've seen that by

1068
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:47,480
the end of flowering in week two and

1069
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,880
I've see it and cell testing we had

1070
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:51,719
those like big drop in in our program

1071
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,000
might not be true for every growing

1072
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:57,439
program but we were seeing huge drop in

1073
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,559
in iron and we had this like app appic

1074
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:02,079
like paling of the plants when your the

1075
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:04,880
flower is starting to Bud a little bit

1076
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,039
so this is something that we've seen a

1077
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:10,680
lot and we've seen that as soon as we

1078
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:13,440
add a little bit of iron sulfate or

1079
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,960
glacial or basal Ru dust and the plants

1080
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,599
are Greening up already and you have

1081
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:20,280
this big fat stem that develops into a

1082
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:24,200
straw that feeds that bud without paling

1083
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:25,880
that plus of a color the dark green so

1084
00:43:24,199 --> 00:43:27,439
iron was one that I've chased for a

1085
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:29,640
while have you done anything with

1086
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,400
manganese uh Steve speculated that

1087
00:43:29,639 --> 00:43:34,159
manganese would be a good one with

1088
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:36,480
cannabis I yeah I haven't done a lot of

1089
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:38,039
research or work with it I think we we

1090
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,119
quickly talked about that once in the

1091
00:43:38,039 --> 00:43:43,199
past I do use uh manganese sulfate and

1092
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:44,880
manganese I remember I think it was a

1093
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,558
first year the canak and I can't

1094
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,160
remember the name of the guy but he was

1095
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,200
giving a talk about manganes and

1096
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:52,399
importance in hop and cannabis

1097
00:43:50,199 --> 00:43:54,318
cultivation because that's might have to

1098
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,480
be verified by someone else but I think

1099
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:58,000
he mentioned that the enzyme that were

1100
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,838
synthesized

1101
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:03,639
thg and some cannabinoids were using

1102
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:05,078
manganes and the more copy of enzymes

1103
00:44:03,639 --> 00:44:08,000
that were expressed the more manganes

1104
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,839
onry your plant was and I've experienced

1105
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:15,679
from Level from 20 PPM of Manganese

1106
00:44:11,838 --> 00:44:19,039
yellow to 15 PPM of manganese in your

1107
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:21,199
soil and uh that the plant seems to take

1108
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:23,159
it that's not a problem having SE too

1109
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:25,598
much manganese toxicity but I make sure

1110
00:44:23,159 --> 00:44:27,279
that manganese is there because of those

1111
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:28,640
enzyme that's the premise of been

1112
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,559
working with and we had pretty good

1113
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,960
results so and also I think those

1114
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,839
micronutrients are very important into

1115
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:38,159
the quality of your product which is the

1116
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:40,599
iron copper Boron

1117
00:44:38,159 --> 00:44:44,000
manganese uh and zinc because they all

1118
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:46,240
our enzyme co-actor and all of those

1119
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,800
enzyme that developing your cannabinoid

1120
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:50,959
your turpine your flavonoid everything

1121
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,920
that makes the aroma of your plant and

1122
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,440
if they're there and you have the proper

1123
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,280
if you have the proper beneficial life

1124
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,400
that will produce cyer Forest you make

1125
00:44:56,280 --> 00:45:00,720
it plant available then you're really an

1126
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,760
increase in your quality of Aroma you

1127
00:45:00,719 --> 00:45:04,239
said it perfectly uh I kind of wanted to

1128
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,520
change directions cuz you remind me of

1129
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:08,519
something you had turned me onto a

1130
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:11,400
really good source of uh insect frass oh

1131
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:14,119
yeah a few months back and I I think I

1132
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,720
bought like 12,000 lb or something of it

1133
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:18,240
oh my God I got so excited the first

1134
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:20,719
time I see that I've bought a ton still

1135
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,279
still haven't used half of it but I love

1136
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:25,838
it yeah so talk to me about some of the

1137
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,280
benefits of insect frights besides just

1138
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:29,759
the uh NPK associated with it the

1139
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:32,359
microbial life in there it's very

1140
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:34,559
interesting we got it an allies and

1141
00:45:32,358 --> 00:45:36,838
those guys who are manufacturing that

1142
00:45:34,559 --> 00:45:39,800
making that insect frass got it analyzed

1143
00:45:36,838 --> 00:45:43,078
and a micrell charge is three times more

1144
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:46,680
concentrated than warm casting and uh

1145
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:50,760
when we worked with that stuff ourself

1146
00:45:46,679 --> 00:45:53,960
we saw a lot of uh we found an amazing

1147
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:55,839
amazing kenas producer in there so this

1148
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:58,318
this is a bacteria that we haven't

1149
00:45:55,838 --> 00:46:02,639
identified yet I think it got sent out

1150
00:45:58,318 --> 00:46:04,519
for sequencing and that's been um Frank

1151
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,159
gor that I think you've talked with

1152
00:46:04,519 --> 00:46:08,639
that's working with um this

1153
00:46:06,159 --> 00:46:12,239
biotechnology company in Quebec they

1154
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:14,400
found this uh kiteen age production

1155
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:17,838
producing bacteria that what if you're

1156
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:19,760
using shrimp meal crab meal or insect

1157
00:46:17,838 --> 00:46:23,759
meal or anything it's going to break

1158
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:28,559
down those kiteen into oigo Kosen and

1159
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:30,520
oligo Kosen can be S by the plant and

1160
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:34,559
uptake and it's going to trigger

1161
00:46:30,519 --> 00:46:36,358
systemic acquired uh resistance uh that

1162
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:38,839
a plant immune system and the plant

1163
00:46:36,358 --> 00:46:40,960
immune system itself sometime to produce

1164
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:43,880
more secondary metabolite like

1165
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:47,079
cannabinoids and Turin to prevent from

1166
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:50,079
an attack from insects so that was very

1167
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:52,880
interesting to to have that and made us

1168
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:55,400
switch a little bit more toward those uh

1169
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:57,880
filzer that are more rich in kiteen like

1170
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:00,440
shrimp and crab meal so that was pretty

1171
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:02,599
cool and the just the rest of beneficial

1172
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:05,760
life in there there's some really good

1173
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:08,318
basilis cus species that were solarizing

1174
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:11,480
phosphorus so just just a general very

1175
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:14,199
good microbial life the yeah the only

1176
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:16,920
little thing there was some bacteria

1177
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:18,960
that may help nitrogen volatilization

1178
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:22,318
but so we just got to be careful use it

1179
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:23,960
not just dump incredible load of ENC

1180
00:47:22,318 --> 00:47:25,920
fras on your plan you should be all

1181
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:27,720
right but it's it's a pretty good

1182
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,280
product so how much are you using

1183
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:32,078
approximately are you top dressing with

1184
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,440
it or you mixing it in your soil uh both

1185
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,359
so uh I use it as a fertilizer and

1186
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:41,079
microbiol inoculant in soil I use it in

1187
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:42,799
my composte mix and in my top dress as

1188
00:47:41,079 --> 00:47:44,480
well okay wow you're using a lot of the

1189
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,480
stuff I know I know we're going to

1190
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:49,679
export it hopefully I have it now it was

1191
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,480
a great deal because insect frass is so

1192
00:47:49,679 --> 00:47:54,440
expensive here in the states yeah it

1193
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:56,880
think from for whomever is using stuff

1194
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:59,400
like stra and crypo and especially if

1195
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,838
you're reusing your soil it's going to

1196
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:03,160
make your soil the more duration you

1197
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:06,119
more cycle you're going through your

1198
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:08,519
soil the more uh single molecule of

1199
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:09,720
kenas the more kenas you're going to

1200
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:11,679
have the more your kittin is going to

1201
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:13,639
break down the more plant immune

1202
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,558
response you're going to get and I think

1203
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:18,159
that can lead to something pretty cool

1204
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,400
after like three four cycle well I need

1205
00:48:18,159 --> 00:48:21,679
to start uh I need to start

1206
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:23,519
experimenting with it but it's great to

1207
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:25,358
hear you give a really good scientific

1208
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:26,599
explanation for all these benefits okay

1209
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:28,519
I wanted to switch gears for a minute

1210
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:31,599
and talk a little bit more about what's

1211
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:33,480
going on with cannabis up in Canada and

1212
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,920
anything in store for you in the near

1213
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,599
future or your facility everybody's

1214
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:41,200
talking about it um facility that are

1215
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:42,920
being created every uh week it's there's

1216
00:48:41,199 --> 00:48:45,719
still not a lot there are still so far

1217
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,280
only 42 across the whole country but

1218
00:48:45,719 --> 00:48:49,239
more and more are getting certified

1219
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:51,280
getting inspected and it's still only

1220
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:53,479
for medical production but we've

1221
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:55,359
licensed producer have been told that

1222
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:57,199
the medical producer will be allowed to

1223
00:48:55,358 --> 00:48:59,440
sell in a recreational Market market so

1224
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,318
a lot of people are building facilities

1225
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,200
in know to position their s for

1226
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:06,318
recreational market so yeah and there is

1227
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:08,879
very few technical expertise right now

1228
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:11,558
in the industry a lot of uh people that

1229
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,880
have learned under de prohibition uh

1230
00:49:11,559 --> 00:49:15,240
that's so many people that are coming

1231
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,960
from academic or Horticultural

1232
00:49:15,239 --> 00:49:21,838
background so far so there's a need for

1233
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:24,679
labor and worker expertise consult

1234
00:49:21,838 --> 00:49:27,639
thing so it's pretty much uh it's a big

1235
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:29,318
boom right now or current facility we're

1236
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:31,039
going to go 10 times the size that we

1237
00:49:29,318 --> 00:49:34,039
are right now we're going to switch

1238
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:36,279
expend to a 60,000 ft Productions

1239
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:39,480
facility we're also experimenting with

1240
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:41,240
the LED lights from fluence SP gening

1241
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,639
that have some very very interesting

1242
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:45,199
lighting technology yeah I I'm talking

1243
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:47,118
to those guys and see if I can get them

1244
00:49:45,199 --> 00:49:49,239
on here next but I have my first

1245
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,680
shipment from them I just got set up as

1246
00:49:49,239 --> 00:49:52,239
a distributor with them so I have my

1247
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:55,719
first shipment arriving hopefully this

1248
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:57,399
week oh cuz uh awesome yeah cool well uh

1249
00:49:55,719 --> 00:49:59,558
have you spoke with Mitch is a really

1250
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,280
great guy there no I would love an

1251
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:02,720
introduction I've only talked to Michael

1252
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,440
he was going to send that up the chain

1253
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:06,879
though in terms of uh being on this

1254
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:09,639
podcast because I lighting is something

1255
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,400
that I know very little about and I just

1256
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:14,318
pretty much uh when ja said that he had

1257
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,079
talked to you about fluence and then

1258
00:50:14,318 --> 00:50:18,519
done the research himself between the

1259
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,359
two of you guys I took that as as as

1260
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:22,639
pretty much the the best recommendation

1261
00:50:20,358 --> 00:50:25,798
ever so I went ahead and and placed an

1262
00:50:22,639 --> 00:50:27,558
order but I I don't really understand uh

1263
00:50:25,798 --> 00:50:30,679
I always thought LED were way behind the

1264
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:32,599
times and they were the cost and and and

1265
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:34,358
and everything compared to you know HPS

1266
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:37,680
or high-intensity lights just didn't

1267
00:50:34,358 --> 00:50:38,960
seem I agree didn't seem seem to add up

1268
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,558
like we weren't quite there yet you

1269
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,760
think the technolog is there there's

1270
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:46,200
been a big Tipping Point in the industry

1271
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:50,240
yes uh last year so it still depend on

1272
00:50:46,199 --> 00:50:52,000
how much you pay for electricity we pay

1273
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:54,479
electricity is very cheap in BC is like

1274
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,679
4 Cent a kilowatt so it's hard to

1275
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:59,280
justify lights are using wh less those

1276
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:01,960
lights that are using wh less

1277
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:05,599
electricity unless they per perform way

1278
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:08,318
better uh I think in Oregon you get 400

1279
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:10,760
bucks like cash discount I think if

1280
00:51:08,318 --> 00:51:13,358
you're buying LED per fixture so it's

1281
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,359
huge like I just really wish we could

1282
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:17,440
have this kind of program yourself up

1283
00:51:15,358 --> 00:51:19,239
here because it would make those fixture

1284
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:23,119
way more affordable or the same price of

1285
00:51:19,239 --> 00:51:26,759
other fixtures but I've been to their uh

1286
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,280
photo X conference uh last October in

1287
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:31,520
Austin Texas and the amount of expertise

1288
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,720
coming out of the industry and I I did

1289
00:51:31,519 --> 00:51:36,280
the first trial with those their last

1290
00:51:33,719 --> 00:51:38,399
generation of LED that was like a pink

1291
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:41,640
Christmas light looking LED that the

1292
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:43,400
spider X Prov generation but now they

1293
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:45,199
came up with the white LED that are

1294
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:48,280
fully full

1295
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:51,159
spectrum and that are having amazing

1296
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:52,680
performance and wanted really like like

1297
00:51:51,159 --> 00:51:54,440
appeal to me it's when I heard like

1298
00:51:52,679 --> 00:51:57,118
people doing in commercial Greenhouse

1299
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:58,838
production using dery and pull

1300
00:51:57,119 --> 00:52:00,599
their margined with those kind of Lights

1301
00:51:58,838 --> 00:52:03,400
I was oh there's something out there so

1302
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,599
there's basil production facility of

1303
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,920
organic basil production in uh Virginia

1304
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:11,000
they're using those LEDs so and when you

1305
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,680
see they're set up it's pretty amazing

1306
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:17,239
so especially for vertical growing so or

1307
00:52:14,679 --> 00:52:21,318
S was switched to LED and did some

1308
00:52:17,239 --> 00:52:23,439
vertical uh preveda in or mutter room so

1309
00:52:21,318 --> 00:52:26,239
we have a better light quality than

1310
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,880
under T5 the internal the plants are

1311
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:30,039
stack better the plants look more like

1312
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:34,039
they've been growing Under full sun the

1313
00:52:30,039 --> 00:52:35,838
leaf are darker thicker and um Tighter

1314
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:37,480
and uh and turn out and as they're

1315
00:52:35,838 --> 00:52:40,119
producing so little heat you can have

1316
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:43,880
your plant growing very close to those

1317
00:52:40,119 --> 00:52:46,440
uh LEDs and having a ey light intensity

1318
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:49,720
that allowed us to have like way more

1319
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:53,000
floor space in our M rooms so we uh we

1320
00:52:49,719 --> 00:52:56,279
took old Nursery uh Transportation rack

1321
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,920
and then move them onto vertical growing

1322
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,920
rack so they on Wheel we can wheel them

1323
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,400
around the facility they're under LEDs

1324
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:04,200
and then the plants are responding

1325
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,760
pretty well to that they are pricey

1326
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:11,719
though they are but um yeah they are so

1327
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:14,480
but if you look at uh the Instagram of

1328
00:53:11,719 --> 00:53:16,078
the Poetry of plant Nelson is a great

1329
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:21,079
guy that I've met at that conference and

1330
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:23,680
he's pulling 30% THC three pounds of fix

1331
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:26,880
uh 3 o per square foot using those LED

1332
00:53:23,679 --> 00:53:29,639
from fluences Wow and he's close to he's

1333
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,400
not fully fully organic but he's close

1334
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:33,358
to be that's great you know you brought

1335
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,519
up a really good point that I want to

1336
00:53:33,358 --> 00:53:36,960
highlight that what got you interested

1337
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:39,440
in them was the fact that you saw

1338
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,480
commercial egg you know people growing

1339
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,920
plants at much much larger lower margins

1340
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,599
than what you're dealing with

1341
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:48,880
successfully using them is is huge cuz

1342
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,200
you won't find that basil grower using

1343
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,838
Advanced Nutrients or General

1344
00:53:50,199 --> 00:53:54,838
Hydroponics you know the oh God no those

1345
00:53:52,838 --> 00:53:56,719
products can't exist outside the

1346
00:53:54,838 --> 00:53:58,880
Cannabis industry for the most part

1347
00:53:56,719 --> 00:54:00,838
they're just too expensive and you know

1348
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:02,240
agricultures found better options yeah

1349
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,000
yeah yeah I think that's I think that's

1350
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,879
a really good point for listeners to

1351
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,119
take into consideration when evaluating

1352
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:11,838
a product oh yeah just go to your local

1353
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:13,960
Greenhouse go volunteer there for a day

1354
00:54:11,838 --> 00:54:16,599
or just go buy the product directly from

1355
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:18,000
the greenhouse and have a glance at how

1356
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:20,400
they're doing that have a look at their

1357
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:23,400
mixing T their injection system and

1358
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:24,599
stuff like that and uh those guys are

1359
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:27,440
know what they're doing and they're

1360
00:54:24,599 --> 00:54:30,160
pulling way smaller margins than we do

1361
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:33,480
and if like they can sell a pound of

1362
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:35,639
pepper for 50 Cent oldale If you apply

1363
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:37,240
the same principles to cannabis you're

1364
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:38,960
probably going to do good yeah that's a

1365
00:54:37,239 --> 00:54:40,919
really good point and I I love the fact

1366
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:43,119
that you have this uh background in

1367
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:44,838
Agronomy uh that's the one thing I see

1368
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:47,440
lacking and a lot of times in the

1369
00:54:44,838 --> 00:54:49,239
facilities that I visit is they hire

1370
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:51,480
someone who's been growing cannabis you

1371
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:53,558
know for 20 years in a basement and

1372
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:55,119
haven't experienced commercial

1373
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:57,798
agriculture or know what it's like to

1374
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:00,200
scale that they may be really good with

1375
00:54:57,798 --> 00:55:02,798
growing you know with one particular

1376
00:55:00,199 --> 00:55:04,480
line of bottled nutrients but stepping

1377
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:06,000
outside of that can be a real challenge

1378
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,280
if you don't understand what's actually

1379
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:10,280
going into your soil or into your plant

1380
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:13,040
oh yeah and that and the real challenge

1381
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:15,119
is also like employee management and

1382
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,079
scheduling and this is more than just

1383
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:19,838
looking after a few plants there's way

1384
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:22,240
more going on so you manage you're

1385
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:24,719
managing plant and people now so yeah

1386
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,519
yeah it's uh it's a good point yeah and

1387
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:29,038
plants don't shout back at you usually

1388
00:55:26,519 --> 00:55:31,159
so that's why I likeed

1389
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,920
them I really appreciate you taking the
