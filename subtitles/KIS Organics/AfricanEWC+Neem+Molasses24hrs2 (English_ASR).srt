1
00:00:00,709 --> 00:00:06,349
so here's the African compost with the

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,500
molasses and the name and I'm seeing

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:13,580
I've seen like four or five of these

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:18,300
really wide fungal hyphae structures in

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:19,500
in the sample and I just wanted to show

6
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:30,210
you this this is only a 100 times

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:31,920
magnification so I'm wondering exactly

8
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:34,890
what the effects the neem are on the

9
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,809
soil but when I added that in the

10
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:39,799
molasses you can see there's just a ton

11
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:44,939
of growth and again this is it 24 hours

12
00:00:39,799 --> 00:00:49,378
this is the widest diameter fungi I've

13
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:51,320
seen any of my testing so far and

14
00:00:49,378 --> 00:00:56,698
zooming in now so you can see there's

15
00:00:51,320 --> 00:01:00,140
there's a ton of bacteria as well now

16
00:00:56,698 --> 00:01:00,140
we're 400 times magnification

17
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:14,118
so I gotta say the surprise any quite a

18
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:14,118
bit i did not expect to find this

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:27,780
but I think we can safely say that the

20
00:01:23,469 --> 00:01:30,849
addition of neem cake watered in

21
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:34,180
certainly not killing the microbes in

22
00:01:30,849 --> 00:01:38,280
our soil seems to be increasing them

23
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:41,520
especially when I look at it with

24
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,519
molasses in there
