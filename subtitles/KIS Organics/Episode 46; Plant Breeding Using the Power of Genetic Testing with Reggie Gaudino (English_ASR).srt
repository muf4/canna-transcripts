backslash kay is organics my guest this

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,660
week is Reggie Gaudi no Reggie is the

18
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:57,419
chief science officer for steep hill

19
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:59,669
laboratories dr. Godinho oversees all

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,500
scientific research and development for

21
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:03,480
steep hill and is the driving force for

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,790
steep hills genetic research program

23
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,469
doctor Gao Dino directed a team of

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,770
researchers which led to the development

25
00:01:07,469 --> 00:01:13,438
of Gen KITT the first cannabis DNA based

26
00:01:10,769 --> 00:01:14,819
sex kit the research from dr. Gao Dino

27
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:16,859
has been peer reviewed and published

28
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:18,408
linked to important new discoveries in

29
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:21,209
the cannabis industry

30
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,909
dr. godina received his BS in molecular

31
00:01:21,209 --> 00:01:25,618
biology and a PhD in molecular genetics

32
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,990
from the State University of New York at

33
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:29,819
Buffalo and he conducted four years of

34
00:01:27,989 --> 00:01:31,048
postdoctoral research at Washington

35
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,629
University in st. Louis

36
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:36,299
studying transcriptional regulation of

37
00:01:33,629 --> 00:01:38,548
our RNA Reggie was one of the first

38
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:40,409
african-american molecular biologists to

39
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:43,170
enter a ph.d program in the United

40
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,180
States in 1985 I really enjoyed my

41
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,950
conversation with Reggie and we ran out

42
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,990
of time to discuss steep hill and some

43
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:50,549
of his current work I plan on following

44
00:01:48,989 --> 00:01:54,649
up with him for a second part to this

45
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:54,649
interview anyway on to the show

46
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,240
hey Reggie thanks for taking the time to

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,728
come on the show today I really

48
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,919
appreciate it thanks for having me Ted

49
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:07,158
appreciate being able to come on and

50
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,379
talk to your clients or rather your your

51
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,659
listeners yeah well I know we've already

52
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,669
started chatting prior to starting the

53
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:15,289
show here but I wanted to really dive in

54
00:02:13,669 --> 00:02:18,079
talking a little bit about your

55
00:02:15,289 --> 00:02:19,879
background and how you came into sort of

56
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,099
this role in the cannabis industry and

57
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,579
let listeners know sort of who you are

58
00:02:22,098 --> 00:02:28,548
and what you're doing okay so I guess

59
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,680
I'll start by officially who I am I'm

60
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,080
Reggie Dino I'm now the president of

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:37,370
steep hill I've been there going on

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:39,349
almost five years I came in believe it

63
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:41,209
or not as a intellectual property

64
00:02:39,348 --> 00:02:44,689
consultant which was at the time what I

65
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,569
was really doing for a living I had been

66
00:02:44,689 --> 00:02:50,269
I have been for the last 22 years

67
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:53,119
in the intellectual property field going

68
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:56,509
from litigation to prosecution which

69
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,129
means that I started kind of prosecuting

70
00:02:56,509 --> 00:03:02,000
biotech patents or sorry litigating

71
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:04,489
biotech patents

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,799
I was hired because of my scientific

73
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,469
background where there was early

74
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:12,049
technology in the in the biotech

75
00:03:09,469 --> 00:03:14,810
industry was centered around certain

76
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:16,609
things like moving genes from one

77
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,310
organism to another that was what

78
00:03:16,609 --> 00:03:22,370
Monsanto did big time and a number of

79
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:26,329
other early startup biotech outcome

80
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:29,959
companies and there's a technology that

81
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:32,769
requires that you kind of take a gene

82
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:37,000
and re-edit it and by that I mean

83
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:41,000
different organisms use different codons

84
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,739
for calling for an amino acid and by

85
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,590
that I mean certain amino acid let's say

86
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:48,230
alanine which is makes a lot of the

87
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:51,620
proteins that we have in our body there

88
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:55,518
are six different DNA triplets that can

89
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:58,389
code for an alanine any one of them will

90
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,400
bring that amino acid into the into the

91
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:04,609
protein at that spot but different

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,250
organisms use the codons with different

93
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:09,319
efficiency so sometimes when you try to

94
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:11,120
take a gene from one organism you put

95
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:13,098
another organism you get very little

96
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,530
expression even though it should

97
00:04:13,098 --> 00:04:17,629
theoretically work and the way you can

98
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,189
get around that is by taking the codons

99
00:04:17,629 --> 00:04:20,689
and optimizing the codon so that they

100
00:04:19,189 --> 00:04:24,519
look more like the codons that you would

101
00:04:20,689 --> 00:04:28,279
have in the recipient organism so in my

102
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:30,769
PhD work I had done that to build gene

103
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:34,339
expression systems to study what I was

104
00:04:30,769 --> 00:04:36,228
trying to study in my PhD and it became

105
00:04:34,339 --> 00:04:39,529
a big thing in early genetic

106
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:41,538
modification early GMO plants and that

107
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:46,969
was what Monsanto was you know best at

108
00:04:41,538 --> 00:04:48,560
at the time and so my my I went from

109
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:50,030
basically being a scientist to being

110
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,180
more of a intellectual property

111
00:04:50,029 --> 00:04:55,089
consultant for biotech and then I ended

112
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,840
up working at a number of law firms

113
00:04:55,089 --> 00:05:01,159
while I was working at law firm play

114
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,219
ended up getting back into biotech

115
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:06,259
because I went in house at a company

116
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:08,539
called sequin elm which was a big

117
00:05:06,259 --> 00:05:10,848
genomics company and they were the ones

118
00:05:08,538 --> 00:05:15,168
that invented non-invasive pregnancy

119
00:05:10,848 --> 00:05:17,418
testing that used the blood draw from my

120
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:21,198
mother to be able to give it a digital

121
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:22,879
karyotype of the the fetus and there was

122
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,139
a really you know big technology because

123
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:26,810
it helped kind of eliminate

124
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,759
amniocentesis which I don't know if

125
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,389
people know but can have a spontaneous

126
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:35,900
abortion rate of up to like one in 25%

127
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:38,680
so it was a big deal and and while I was

128
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:42,379
there I was still consulting for

129
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,840
portfolio consulting for IP and think

130
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,360
steep hill actually called me initially

131
00:05:44,839 --> 00:05:49,489
to do a review of their intellectual

132
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,340
property or potential intellectual

133
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:53,918
property on their chemistry side and and

134
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:58,158
at the time they were that they had

135
00:05:53,918 --> 00:06:01,189
produced the first near-infrared potency

136
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:03,259
device called the quanta can and so I

137
00:06:01,189 --> 00:06:06,110
was reviewing their their science to see

138
00:06:03,259 --> 00:06:08,449
whether or not they had anything that

139
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:10,129
was still patentable while I was doing

140
00:06:08,449 --> 00:06:12,650
that I found that they had this treasure

141
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:14,000
trove of chemistry they had so much

142
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:18,918
chemical data because they had been

143
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,199
around since 2008 and I was floored

144
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:22,278
because when I asked the question hey

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
what do you guys doing all this data

146
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:25,219
this is I

147
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:26,629
you know what kind of research are using

148
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,180
or what kind of pants are you filing

149
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:31,728
based on this and they looked at me like

150
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,209
I had a third eye hey David

151
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:38,659
and so I was like well this is you know

152
00:06:35,209 --> 00:06:40,819
this is where your IP lies and and I

153
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,370
said in on top of that you could be like

154
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,610
you know you know using this to trend

155
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:49,250
cannabis to identify markers and and and

156
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:50,810
so they actually offered me a job to do

157
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:52,610
that instead of being intellectual

158
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:56,180
property so and that's how I got its

159
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:58,250
seat belt I didn't hurt at the time that

160
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,500
the company does it without that I was

161
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,379
with that sequin elm in my opinion had

162
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,029
made some some really grievous errors in

163
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:07,550
handling their intellectual product

164
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:09,019
property portfolio and I saw that my job

165
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:10,669
was probably going to be diminished

166
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:12,709
there in the near future because of

167
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:14,359
those bad decisions so it was an

168
00:07:12,709 --> 00:07:16,129
opportunity for me to leave and to go

169
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,750
into something really exciting I was

170
00:07:16,129 --> 00:07:19,339
given the opportunity to come in and be

171
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,259
the director in lesser property for them

172
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:23,359
but also the director of R&amp;D and which

173
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:25,610
is kind of the dream job if you're a

174
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,650
scientist right so there is no more

175
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:29,030
powerful or better position than to be

176
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,099
the director of intellectual property as

177
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,668
a director of R&amp;D when you're a

178
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:37,460
scientist right so and so I jumped at

179
00:07:34,668 --> 00:07:44,329
the chance and you know it's it's been a

180
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:47,180
really really beneficial kind of pairing

181
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:49,969
right so I got I got a bunch of data I

182
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:52,400
got there was already some very good

183
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,950
scientist at stevefell that were willing

184
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,209
to to come and do part-time work with me

185
00:07:54,949 --> 00:07:57,769
cuz I started you know they wouldn't

186
00:07:56,209 --> 00:08:00,978
give me them completely so they had to

187
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:02,659
do double duty they were punished to

188
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:04,668
actually for being good so they they had

189
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:06,080
their full-time job and then on weekends

190
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:10,159
or evenings they got to come in and do

191
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:11,750
extra work for me on the R&amp;D side we

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,849
came up with the gen kit which was the

193
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:17,029
first really successful sex test for

194
00:08:13,848 --> 00:08:20,478
cannabis and the rest is history you

195
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:23,929
know we were able to do some really good

196
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:28,009
work and and I think that's what brings

197
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:30,050
me here is is trying to share some that

198
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:31,819
knowledge you know a lot of our data

199
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,479
that we that we publish all in fact

200
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:36,360
first of all all of our data is actually

201
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:42,239
academically oriented right so

202
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:44,068
so we we have a very deep desire to

203
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,660
share what we have learned and what we

204
00:08:44,068 --> 00:08:47,578
learned with the industry right so

205
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:49,409
obviously we have to pay for R&amp;D and so

206
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:50,909
we build more core tests and stuff like

207
00:08:49,409 --> 00:08:53,818
that that people can use to help

208
00:08:50,909 --> 00:08:55,469
themselves breed now ultimately all of

209
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:58,528
our data is published in academic

210
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:01,379
journals and and and then on top of that

211
00:08:58,528 --> 00:09:04,078
once we release data academically we put

212
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:06,959
it all for anybody to get to on OCP so

213
00:09:04,078 --> 00:09:09,359
you know it we are all about sharing our

214
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:11,039
data with the industry and making

215
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,048
everybody better because of it and

216
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:15,088
helping people understand the power of

217
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:18,078
that science and what it can do for them

218
00:09:15,089 --> 00:09:20,040
so what I wanted to ask you was these

219
00:09:18,078 --> 00:09:23,308
genetic markers that you're talking

220
00:09:20,039 --> 00:09:26,248
about essentially what you're saying is

221
00:09:23,308 --> 00:09:28,889
the with using utilizing these markers a

222
00:09:26,249 --> 00:09:32,298
grower with the help of a lab like

223
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:35,009
yourself is able to go back in then and

224
00:09:32,298 --> 00:09:37,048
identify specific traits so there might

225
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:40,350
be a marker associated with a trait

226
00:09:37,048 --> 00:09:44,278
relating to let's say resistance to mold

227
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:46,290
or mildew or yield or plant height is

228
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:47,970
that is that sort of correct in

229
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:50,488
describing what you're what you're

230
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:55,519
saying yes that's absolutely correct

231
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:59,459
so let's take it a step further so and

232
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:04,289
anything that you can observe in the

233
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:08,548
cannabis plant has or is tied to one or

234
00:10:04,289 --> 00:10:11,838
more genes right so every observable

235
00:10:08,548 --> 00:10:16,350
trait which we call a phenotype right

236
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,470
can be it has the potential I don't want

237
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:21,798
the candy but has a potential to be

238
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:25,889
controlled through a breeding program

239
00:10:21,798 --> 00:10:28,379
okay now a plant height so let's take

240
00:10:25,889 --> 00:10:30,959
you know if you look at the classical

241
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:33,058
definition of sativas and indicas right

242
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:36,149
there's the height the height difference

243
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:39,509
right so there are genes that are

244
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:43,458
responsible for internode lanes then you

245
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:47,188
know everything you know flowering time

246
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:49,109
you know trichome development how many

247
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:49,919
trichomes you get per per square

248
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:53,249
centimeter

249
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:56,278
all of those things have some genetic

250
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:58,230
basis now not all the time do you have a

251
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,480
legalize variation so what do I mean by

252
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:03,980
allelic variation allelic variation is

253
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:07,499
the difference between the two right so

254
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:11,129
if you look at a strain that typically

255
00:11:07,499 --> 00:11:12,600
only makes 14 to 18 percent THC versus

256
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:15,359
other newer strains that now make

257
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,548
typically always 25 to 28 percent right

258
00:11:15,359 --> 00:11:19,649
so that's allelic variation it's a

259
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:21,720
difference in the same gene that has a

260
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:23,850
measurable quantifiable difference right

261
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,829
so now if you can find that number or

262
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:28,470
that observation or that color

263
00:11:25,828 --> 00:11:32,868
difference right those are all markers

264
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:35,639
that you can use to be to breed with now

265
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:37,079
the way you tie that back to the genes

266
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,480
in the DNA is through something called

267
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:41,969
genome-wide Association right so you now

268
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,379
you take that marker right and you take

269
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,298
the differences that you oh sorry that

270
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,859
you take that that allele that's

271
00:11:45,298 --> 00:11:49,318
phenotype and then you take the

272
00:11:46,859 --> 00:11:54,089
differences in the spectrum of that

273
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:57,088
thing that you're looking at and using

274
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,709
you know bioinformatics and statistics

275
00:11:57,089 --> 00:12:01,009
and some other stuff when you get large

276
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:03,958
enough populations you can say ah look

277
00:12:01,009 --> 00:12:07,399
more often than not if we if it looks

278
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:11,758
like this it has that DNA that DNA

279
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,110
sequence in this particular region if it

280
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:15,509
looks like that it has a different one

281
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:18,058
and now that's suddenly a genetic marker

282
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:23,938
right so you now assigned a function

283
00:12:18,058 --> 00:12:26,159
right which is the either the the color

284
00:12:23,938 --> 00:12:27,808
the the the amount of THC whatever it is

285
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:29,999
you that's the function and you've

286
00:12:27,808 --> 00:12:31,588
assigned it to a nucleotide and so now

287
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,699
as long as you can file that nucleotide

288
00:12:31,589 --> 00:12:33,779
which you can through a number of

289
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:36,208
different ways and they're you know

290
00:12:33,778 --> 00:12:42,168
different ways of looking at DNA

291
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:45,778
sequencing qPCR you know you know

292
00:12:42,168 --> 00:12:50,188
sometimes you can even look at it

293
00:12:45,778 --> 00:12:53,220
through a non direct methodology right

294
00:12:50,188 --> 00:12:56,068
so sometimes a function is is linked to

295
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:59,309
something you can see but not

296
00:12:56,068 --> 00:13:01,378
necessarily it's not really directly

297
00:12:59,308 --> 00:13:01,730
related so sometimes you get lucky and

298
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:04,759
that's

299
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:07,490
it's called a linkage disequilibrium and

300
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:09,319
so that means that more often than not

301
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,970
you would instead of a random

302
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,510
distribution you see that this thing

303
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:17,870
here always travels with that trait

304
00:13:14,509 --> 00:13:19,639
right and so these are all tools that

305
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,139
the scientists can use to be able to

306
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:23,360
build a breeding program because now

307
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:24,500
when you get DNA from the plant you

308
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,289
don't have to wait for the plant to

309
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:29,929
exhibit that marker like when it's you

310
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,639
know flowered already or you know you

311
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:33,319
don't have to wait for weeks to be able

312
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,480
to see whether or not what the internal

313
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,940
length is really going to be right you

314
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,459
can say oh I know already because it has

315
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:42,769
these gene sequences that tell me

316
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:45,919
already clicked on the Association that

317
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:47,870
I can follow that now and so that's the

318
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:50,328
accelerated format and now that's my

319
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:53,629
genetic modification that's just that's

320
00:13:50,328 --> 00:13:55,819
just good intelligent use of tools using

321
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:58,519
traditional breeding methodology right

322
00:13:55,820 --> 00:14:00,800
so we haven't done anything to the plant

323
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:02,360
we're not doing any genetic modification

324
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,769
we're not we're not doing anything that

325
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:07,190
God wouldn't want us to do with the

326
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:08,810
plant right so but we're just doing it

327
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:11,240
in a more efficient more intelligent

328
00:14:08,809 --> 00:14:12,768
manner right so and so that's the beauty

329
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:16,339
of what's called marker-assisted

330
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:18,919
breeding now here's this the dirty

331
00:14:16,339 --> 00:14:22,819
secret that that if more people had

332
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:26,479
better understanding of true of true

333
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:28,189
agriculture every cannabis farmer for

334
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,500
decades has been building their own

335
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:33,370
mapping populations the most powerful

336
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:37,190
tool that you can use as a breeder and

337
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:40,100
not even realizing it right so everybody

338
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:45,170
who's been at it for a long time has a

339
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:47,540
strain that they've umbral added to self

340
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:49,399
they've picked the best fie nose they've

341
00:14:47,539 --> 00:14:51,259
they've taken that one they've grown

342
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,600
that one they've allowed it to self that

343
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:56,720
you know and so what they've done is you

344
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,940
know traditional breeding they that you

345
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,709
know breeding for a specific you know

346
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:04,910
unique variation amongst the population

347
00:15:02,708 --> 00:15:09,439
when they've done crosses between

348
00:15:04,909 --> 00:15:12,049
different things they that cross is the

349
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,640
base for what we call a mapping

350
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:15,679
population you take two things that you

351
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:18,439
know you put them together and

352
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:19,609
and you look at the offspring from there

353
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,230
the different phenotypes and you

354
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:23,810
categorize them you grow them you you

355
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:26,440
you you you then do other things with

356
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:30,259
them well that's just the same as

357
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:34,399
crossing back crossing intercrossing

358
00:15:30,259 --> 00:15:35,929
right and so every time you do something

359
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,750
like that and you have the controlled

360
00:15:35,929 --> 00:15:41,979
observation you have built yourself a

361
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:45,019
mapping population that now if you have

362
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:47,659
the right amount of observational data

363
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,629
you can pick you can usually find a

364
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:53,838
measurable marker that after a couple of

365
00:15:50,629 --> 00:15:56,570
generations of interbreeding if you can

366
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,580
find a trait you can usually do two or

367
00:15:56,570 --> 00:16:03,250
three crosses and and identify the

368
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:06,350
marker you know pretty pretty well so

369
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:08,600
realistically people have been doing all

370
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:12,080
of the groundwork for their own

371
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,810
marker-assisted breeding populations all

372
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,810
they need now is to take what they

373
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:20,208
already have in terms of observation and

374
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:22,189
familial relation and then get some DNA

375
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:26,269
sequence behind it and they're done off

376
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:28,190
to the races so essentially the the gene

377
00:16:26,269 --> 00:16:32,379
sequence II it just allows for a more

378
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:35,900
precise scientific tool and quantitative

379
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:38,600
analysis of what we're seeing already

380
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:41,750
the breeders have been doing visually

381
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,360
for years yes absolutely right so but

382
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:46,850
but again it's that visual observation

383
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,950
that forms the basis right so it's the

384
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:53,089
data the data always forms the basis for

385
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:54,440
the utility of the gene sequence gene

386
00:16:53,089 --> 00:16:59,410
sequence at the end of the day is just

387
00:16:54,440 --> 00:17:02,029
AG CT right we and it tells you nothing

388
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:04,609
even when you know what the gene does

389
00:17:02,028 --> 00:17:06,318
right it really tells you nothing in

390
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:09,349
terms of breeding yes I know I have a

391
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:13,849
gene that makes you know THCA synthase

392
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,678
right well but then now I have 14

393
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,599
varieties of that same gene that all

394
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,130
slightly different sequences well but

395
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:22,698
they all make KC a synthase so what's

396
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:25,790
the difference right and so now by

397
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:27,949
taking that observational data and

398
00:17:25,789 --> 00:17:28,430
overlaying it onto the the variation the

399
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:30,950
genes

400
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:34,100
sequence that's where we see the power

401
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:35,990
of genetics where we can say ah they all

402
00:17:34,099 --> 00:17:37,459
make the same thing but that one makes

403
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:39,500
it ten percent more efficiently so

404
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:41,090
ultimately if you have that gene in

405
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,369
there instead you're going to end up

406
00:17:41,089 --> 00:17:45,829
with ten percent more THC yeah that's a

407
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:47,419
you know an oversimplification but but

408
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:52,429
that's but that's basically what it is

409
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:57,080
right so so the gene sequence ultimately

410
00:17:52,430 --> 00:18:00,680
is how you follow all the things that

411
00:17:57,079 --> 00:18:02,929
you see and because you can follow it

412
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,840
without having to see it because it's

413
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,090
coded in the DNA you can now crack a

414
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:09,829
seed and at the first true leaf you can

415
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:11,990
tell yourself everything that you want

416
00:18:09,829 --> 00:18:14,389
to know or need to know in terms of your

417
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:17,240
breeding program does it have the allele

418
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:19,340
I want yes keep it no throw it done move

419
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:21,349
on to the next one right so and so

420
00:18:19,339 --> 00:18:24,289
that's it brings efficiency it brings

421
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:27,049
speed think about generational you know

422
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:30,619
propagation so you know we have would

423
00:18:27,049 --> 00:18:33,440
typically you know until we're you know

424
00:18:30,619 --> 00:18:35,179
ready the the plant flowers we really

425
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,620
don't know where we're going with the

426
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:38,000
breeding program you know I've got three

427
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:39,679
I got three fiy knows which one's gonna

428
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,750
be my best one when I cross this well

429
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:48,230
you know nurture plays a great amount of

430
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:49,460
that about in that you know and so we'll

431
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:51,380
talk to touching that a little bit

432
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,569
because because there's this nurtured

433
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:56,000
you know in nature you know genetics

434
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:58,669
versus environment right so those two

435
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,799
things have such a key interplay in

436
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:02,660
cannabis to a degree that is probably

437
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:07,339
not seen in many other plants if any

438
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:10,160
tell you the truth right so but now as

439
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:12,529
long as you have consistency in your

440
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,150
growing regime right so let's just let's

441
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:15,680
just throw that out there and then we'll

442
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:17,420
deal with that later as long as you have

443
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,769
consistency in your growing regime right

444
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:23,900
you can do the all the hard work without

445
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:26,900
ever seeing the outcome of the plant you

446
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:28,759
can pick the ones you want you can force

447
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:31,370
flower them and breed with them with the

448
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:34,519
known breeder pair right because you

449
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:38,719
have the DNA on that one you know get

450
00:19:34,519 --> 00:19:41,029
some seed you know crack those seed and

451
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,028
do the same thing never seeing a flower

452
00:19:41,029 --> 00:19:43,979
but

453
00:19:42,028 --> 00:19:47,519
your traits for four or five generations

454
00:19:43,979 --> 00:19:50,009
right and then finally getting to a spot

455
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:51,839
where this is the genetic combination

456
00:19:50,009 --> 00:19:54,348
that I'm looking for now let me let me

457
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:58,408
grow these out and see what I got right

458
00:19:54,348 --> 00:20:01,019
so so now you are you're not waiting

459
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:04,080
months to breed you're breeding in weeks

460
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:05,969
right and because of that you're getting

461
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,648
four or five generations and so now

462
00:20:05,969 --> 00:20:09,899
suddenly inbreeding and black back

463
00:20:07,648 --> 00:20:12,959
crossing looks like it doesn't every

464
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:15,478
other agricultural setting right it

465
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,450
doesn't have to be you only get two

466
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:19,710
crops a year because you know you got to

467
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,210
see what the flower looks like and

468
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,069
picked from the flower to get the next

469
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:26,190
generate no you don't have to as long as

470
00:20:23,069 --> 00:20:28,888
we know what trait matches what what DNA

471
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,379
sequence all of this stuff becomes you

472
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:33,058
know wrap a generational cycling and

473
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:35,118
then you just look for what you want at

474
00:20:33,058 --> 00:20:38,038
the end and now that is the way to

475
00:20:35,118 --> 00:20:41,968
maximize profits maximize useful space

476
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:44,009
right it and and now if you think of the

477
00:20:41,969 --> 00:20:45,690
palette of genes yes you mentioned

478
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:47,999
earlier you know powdery mildew and

479
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:50,669
other and other pest resistance those

480
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:52,588
are all things that we have by looking

481
00:20:50,669 --> 00:20:54,929
at other agriculture we already know

482
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:57,388
that there are genetic markers for that

483
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,729
like powdery mildew in a rabbit Optus

484
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:02,158
and other in other plants it actually

485
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:05,088
tracks to trichome development there's a

486
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:08,009
mutation in trichomes in a rabbit

487
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:09,509
obstacle mildew well how does that work

488
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:11,098
in cannabis would that be good or bad

489
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:12,358
for us if suddenly our trichomes are

490
00:21:11,098 --> 00:21:14,278
different where all the chemistry

491
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:17,699
happens so those are kind of things that

492
00:21:14,278 --> 00:21:20,848
you we have to you know look at as we

493
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:23,460
tread down these pathways but but you

494
00:21:20,848 --> 00:21:26,338
know agriculture is built on agriculture

495
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:27,838
we already know what genes do what in

496
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:29,548
general other than the cannabinoid

497
00:21:27,838 --> 00:21:31,469
synthase ones because all these genes

498
00:21:29,548 --> 00:21:34,079
exist to other plants we can look to

499
00:21:31,469 --> 00:21:36,269
other plants and say hi in that terpene

500
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,618
gene if you make that change it makes

501
00:21:36,269 --> 00:21:39,149
these terpenes if you make that change

502
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:40,908
to make those terpenes and we can go and

503
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:44,488
we can look for things like that because

504
00:21:40,909 --> 00:21:46,109
we we have homology in the gene

505
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:48,269
sequences because mother nature doesn't

506
00:21:46,108 --> 00:21:51,388
reinvent herself right she uses the same

507
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:54,298
stuff as much as possible and so if you

508
00:21:51,388 --> 00:21:55,740
look at a chirping gene from basil you

509
00:21:54,298 --> 00:21:57,420
know it will

510
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:58,950
a lot like terpene genes from cannabis

511
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,289
sure there are some differences but at

512
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:03,420
least now we've been able to use those

513
00:22:01,289 --> 00:22:05,250
terpene genes from other organisms to

514
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:08,759
find all the terpene genes in cannabis

515
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:16,380
right so so all of this information ends

516
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:19,829
up making breeding and and you know just

517
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:24,390
even phenyl hunting much easier much

518
00:22:19,829 --> 00:22:27,359
faster you know and and that's how we

519
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:30,179
need to be if you think about it because

520
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:35,729
in a very short while when things are

521
00:22:30,179 --> 00:22:37,110
our legal big AG big tobacco big alcohol

522
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:39,089
they're all going to come knocking on

523
00:22:37,109 --> 00:22:41,759
the door and though these are the tools

524
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:44,909
that those people use right they use

525
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:47,400
this kind of stuff so if we're not using

526
00:22:44,910 --> 00:22:49,620
that kind of stuff when they get here we

527
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,630
will be in a much different situation

528
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:53,369
and we'll be in little bit and we will

529
00:22:51,630 --> 00:22:55,710
have lost because we don't know how to

530
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:57,269
do this you bring up a lot of really

531
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,610
intriguing questions I've got a little

532
00:22:57,269 --> 00:23:02,009
list here going but I wanted to touch on

533
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:04,428
this idea that you mentioned here in

534
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:07,650
terms of how how agriculture is already

535
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:11,009
utilizing technology and one of the

536
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:12,660
things that sparked my mind is I have an

537
00:23:11,009 --> 00:23:15,420
edible nursery so we sell a wide variety

538
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:18,179
of vegetables and fruit trees and things

539
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,429
like that and when I am selecting for

540
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,710
plants for my region here in the Pacific

541
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:25,019
Northwest I'm looking at apples and

542
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:27,420
they'll have a list of traits that are

543
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:29,819
consistent across that apple variety so

544
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:31,650
I know that I'm getting scab resistance

545
00:23:29,819 --> 00:23:34,649
when I'm getting this particular tree

546
00:23:31,650 --> 00:23:37,110
and I know that I'm getting say a

547
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:38,940
certain flavor profile when I'm choosing

548
00:23:37,109 --> 00:23:40,379
a Honey Crisp apple but I may have a

549
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,080
little less resistance to mold and

550
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:45,630
mildew so these are all things that we

551
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:48,960
can know very consistently and it's very

552
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:51,059
helpful data for a grower who wants to

553
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,340
grow out that plant now and I love that

554
00:23:51,058 --> 00:23:56,339
we can eventually have this sort of

555
00:23:53,339 --> 00:23:58,230
thing in cannabis - but my concern I

556
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:59,730
guess my question would be if I'm

557
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:00,480
approaching this from a growers

558
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:02,339
perspective

559
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,860
the two things that really stood out to

560
00:24:02,339 --> 00:24:07,470
me is one what am I giving up to this

561
00:24:04,859 --> 00:24:09,359
lab by sharing this data like my wife

562
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:12,269
for example did the 23andme

563
00:24:09,359 --> 00:24:14,419
thing giving up you know essentially

564
00:24:12,269 --> 00:24:16,920
finding out about her ancestry and

565
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:19,110
everything by giving up her genetic IP

566
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,550
and for me that was a that was a

567
00:24:19,109 --> 00:24:22,349
non-starter at this point in time I was

568
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:26,159
like I'm not gonna pay a company to have

569
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:27,809
access to my you know own personal genes

570
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:30,930
at this point in time you know maybe

571
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:32,879
that'll change down the road but what is

572
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:36,060
a grower giving up when they give you

573
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,290
this data you mentioned the OCP for

574
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:39,240
people who don't know that stands for

575
00:24:37,289 --> 00:24:41,819
the open cannabis project and we're

576
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,549
gonna be talking with them here soon as

577
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:45,960
well hopefully as well as candor I have

578
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:47,009
an interview coming up who's approaching

579
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,590
it from a slightly different perspective

580
00:24:47,009 --> 00:24:52,650
but could you just touch a little bit on

581
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:54,389
on sort of what what that looks like

582
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:56,759
from a growers perspective approaching

583
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,400
this like if you're not a geneticist and

584
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,220
you are someone who's just been loving

585
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:05,250
this plant and passionately growing this

586
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:06,839
you know a couple phenotypes that you're

587
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:09,809
really proud of and you want to you want

588
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:13,079
to preserve how would you use this use

589
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:16,409
this sort of the science-based data so

590
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:17,939
wow you you've like opened up not one

591
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:19,830
but several cans of worms so you've

592
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,230
touched on things that relate to

593
00:25:19,829 --> 00:25:25,109
intellectual property and and protecting

594
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:26,430
plants okay and and I think maybe you've

595
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,719
touched on a bunch of these things

596
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:33,420
without even realizing it because

597
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:36,180
they're so tied together so you know

598
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:37,950
let's start with the laboratory and

599
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:40,650
client relationship I think that's

600
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:42,569
that's that's as a as a the guy who's

601
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:44,759
doing this work right like you know XD

602
00:25:42,569 --> 00:25:48,539
bill this is a very important thing and

603
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:51,450
so you know a lot of it has to do it

604
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:53,730
with integrity and upfront transparency

605
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:57,360
right so I tell everybody up front if

606
00:25:53,730 --> 00:26:00,360
you come test for me I use your data and

607
00:25:57,359 --> 00:26:07,549
you and you allow me to use your data as

608
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:07,549
I will to do trending metrics and

609
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:12,840
investigational you know kind of things

610
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:16,350
so that I can understand cannabis in

611
00:26:12,839 --> 00:26:17,819
general that data is anonymized so these

612
00:26:16,349 --> 00:26:19,439
are all things that are in the in my in

613
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:21,899
my intake contract right the data is

614
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,710
anonymized I never I never tried to

615
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:25,288
claim

616
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:26,850
or take control of because again it's

617
00:26:25,288 --> 00:26:28,288
not mine and this is where people have

618
00:26:26,849 --> 00:26:29,908
to understand the patting process if

619
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:32,158
somebody doesn't it doesn't invent

620
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:33,990
something they can't file a patent on it

621
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:36,210
so somebody comes to me with the strain

622
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:38,940
and tells me to test it even if I take

623
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:42,090
that data and I use it in a general and

624
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:44,700
a anonymized way to look at cannabis in

625
00:26:42,089 --> 00:26:47,339
general and to try to trend things in

626
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:50,250
cannabis like you know Varon production

627
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:54,298
or you know CBD versus THC ratios know

628
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:57,450
something so that data by itself does

629
00:26:54,298 --> 00:26:59,730
nothing in the larger group of data it's

630
00:26:57,450 --> 00:27:03,690
very valuable because it allows trending

631
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:07,259
right so so in that respect putting one

632
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,538
data point into 10,000 data points means

633
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:12,658
absolutely nothing and it gives us no

634
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:18,599
power over that that piece of that plant

635
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:21,929
anyway right so now in return for that I

636
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:24,418
if I find that something is unique I let

637
00:27:21,929 --> 00:27:25,440
that client know and say hey here's

638
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,210
something interesting you should

639
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,830
probably do more investigation because

640
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,600
we found this about your plant when we

641
00:27:28,829 --> 00:27:32,490
looked at it versus everything else you

642
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:34,829
have something unique right so without

643
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:37,200
that ability to look at that we would

644
00:27:34,829 --> 00:27:39,288
never have been able to find THC v we

645
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,819
were the first to report HCV right so

646
00:27:39,288 --> 00:27:44,220
and that says that we did Doug Veron

647
00:27:41,819 --> 00:27:46,349
Doug Ferran became a thing because we

648
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:47,730
went to Doug and said hey you don't you

649
00:27:46,349 --> 00:27:48,959
may not know this but this is a really

650
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:52,679
special plant you should do something

651
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,100
with it and so that's and that's the

652
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:59,399
power of being able to use the clients

653
00:27:56,099 --> 00:28:03,240
data to be able to trend but then giving

654
00:27:59,398 --> 00:28:05,158
that client the information back say we

655
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:07,019
used your data we found there is

656
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:10,620
something special about yours here it is

657
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:13,019
go go down right so there has to be that

658
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:15,569
ability to do those things for anybody

659
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,639
to get any usefulness out of science in

660
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:19,740
general in the cannabis industry right

661
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,159
if everybody if everybody if nobody

662
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,740
wants us to do that kind of work then we

663
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:27,740
can't help them do better right so

664
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:32,880
unfortunately there's also you know a

665
00:28:30,028 --> 00:28:36,950
whole integrity responsibility thing

666
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:39,660
right so anybody who would then try to

667
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:42,000
monopolize that information and then try

668
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:44,430
to do their own work you know to go

669
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,759
around is somebody who brought them data

670
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,960
you know I think is we're having a

671
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,369
different conversation we're not talking

672
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,740
about science now we're talking about

673
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:57,569
the integrity of an individual and their

674
00:28:52,740 --> 00:29:00,059
philosophy and and I think you know one

675
00:28:57,569 --> 00:29:02,669
one needs to be asked the question you

676
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:04,649
know what are you going to do with my

677
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:06,150
data right yeah I think that's a

678
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:08,940
perfectly valid question for anybody

679
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,769
going to a lab to ask and and that lab

680
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:12,120
should be transparent and it's answer

681
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:14,129
and I say I'm going to do research with

682
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:15,719
your data to be able to help you know

683
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,660
build markers so people can do

684
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:22,319
marker-assisted breeding right so you

685
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:26,519
know and and there's also you know

686
00:29:22,319 --> 00:29:29,069
whether or not that person then would

687
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:32,190
would be interested in and and doing a

688
00:29:29,069 --> 00:29:36,659
release of their data so if I have

689
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:38,880
actually asked clients said hey you know

690
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,920
using some of your data in conjunction

691
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,870
with everything else you know we have

692
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,850
noticed that you guys happen to have

693
00:29:42,869 --> 00:29:46,859
something very unique you know we would

694
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:48,809
like to be able to publish on it you

695
00:29:46,859 --> 00:29:50,159
know we would like to make you

696
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:52,529
co-authors with us because this is

697
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:55,259
you're fine so you know so that is

698
00:29:52,529 --> 00:29:57,059
something that again you know we did all

699
00:29:55,259 --> 00:29:58,529
the work we did all the investigation we

700
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,169
did the sequencing on our own dime right

701
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:03,059
so a lot of this work we've done on our

702
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:05,039
own dime because you know so that we

703
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:07,109
could build an offering right I want to

704
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,319
start at 23andme for for the cannabis

705
00:30:07,109 --> 00:30:13,379
industry right so but to do that right

706
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:16,259
you know I have to have a base of

707
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,120
information like there was with you know

708
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:20,579
the human genome project right so there

709
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:22,799
was thousands of human genomes that that

710
00:30:20,579 --> 00:30:25,619
were had to be sequence before 23andme

711
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,720
could start a 23andme you had to have a

712
00:30:25,619 --> 00:30:29,849
reference genome so we're in the process

713
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:32,069
of building that reference genome as are

714
00:30:29,849 --> 00:30:34,799
no other of other labs right to be able

715
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:37,409
to do exactly these kind of things which

716
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,269
will overall end up benefiting the

717
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:42,330
industry right so there's this

718
00:30:39,269 --> 00:30:44,430
give-and-take and people have to be able

719
00:30:42,329 --> 00:30:47,220
to buy in at their level if you want

720
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:50,060
your data to be included then you you

721
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,650
you approach the lab and say hey

722
00:30:50,059 --> 00:30:55,250
like to work with you you know and then

723
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,810
back and then and you know and there are

724
00:30:55,250 --> 00:31:00,230
ndas we don't share in the feel of

725
00:30:56,809 --> 00:31:02,029
things so so anybody that I think Phil

726
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:03,710
deals with there's NDA is we don't tell

727
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,569
anybody else we don't show anybody else

728
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,650
their data their data is their data they

729
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:10,429
get to do whatever they want with their

730
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:12,769
data and then we put their data in an

731
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:16,430
anonymized form into our overall you

732
00:31:12,769 --> 00:31:18,980
know kettle that gives us the stuff that

733
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:21,080
we do which we then do go and patent by

734
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:23,870
the way right so now after I have all

735
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:28,039
this data I now build tools

736
00:31:23,869 --> 00:31:31,519
I build methods of of being able to

737
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:34,369
follow different genetic markers like

738
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,309
you know using HRM or you know or qPCR

739
00:31:34,369 --> 00:31:39,949
or their deep DNA diagnostics it's like

740
00:31:37,309 --> 00:31:41,779
the bracket 1 bracket 2 so I'm not

741
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:44,450
patenting the DNA sequence

742
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:47,119
I'm patenting a method to identify this

743
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,799
particular trait that we have gone

744
00:31:47,119 --> 00:31:50,299
through and I tend and with all of the

745
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:53,269
other work that we've done been able to

746
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:56,089
pull out of the ether right because

747
00:31:53,269 --> 00:31:58,460
again at the end of the day it's AG CT

748
00:31:56,089 --> 00:32:01,250
and until you put chemical data in

749
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:03,410
conjunction with DNA data and you do

750
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,599
advanced biostatistics and

751
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:08,090
bioinformatics you have no answer right

752
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,189
so that's the invention that we put into

753
00:32:08,089 --> 00:32:12,740
it right and so and and we share that

754
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:14,960
information by making it public now

755
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:18,069
everybody who would like to breed for

756
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,850
that trait can breed for it you know

757
00:32:18,069 --> 00:32:25,429
using this tool and we help people build

758
00:32:22,849 --> 00:32:28,459
their own unison and and this is where

759
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,900
it can go one step further where it then

760
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:32,420
becomes something that's very private

761
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:34,250
and doesn't go to the populace right so

762
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:36,650
now when somebody builds their old

763
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:38,869
mapping population because it's their

764
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:41,150
mapping population and it's only related

765
00:32:38,869 --> 00:32:44,599
to the crosses they've made when we

766
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,700
define markers for them it is their

767
00:32:44,599 --> 00:32:49,899
marker because unless somebody else has

768
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,950
built that same exact cross that

769
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:53,990
information won't be useful to anybody

770
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:55,970
else so there's there are different

771
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:57,769
levels so there's the what comes out

772
00:32:55,970 --> 00:32:59,390
that is generally useful for people and

773
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:01,069
then there's the other stuff that will

774
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:03,500
only ever be useful to the person who

775
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:03,990
actually contracted for that work does

776
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:07,200
that make

777
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,000
I think so so in an effort of full

778
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,509
transparency you're a full for-profit

779
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,480
company you are you know this equipment

780
00:33:12,509 --> 00:33:17,700
the science all of these salaries this

781
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,370
all costs a heck of a lot of money and

782
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:24,210
so what you're looking to do is collect

783
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:26,069
as much anonymous data as possible with

784
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:28,799
the goal of creating these markers and

785
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:30,419
then like you said once you have let's

786
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,129
just say in theory our marker for

787
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:34,230
powdery mildew resistance you've

788
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:38,190
discovered this genetic marker you could

789
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:40,890
then use and sell and patent that marker

790
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:42,960
as a way of generating money by saying

791
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:44,130
ok hey I can analyze your plant and tell

792
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,840
you right away if it's going to have

793
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:48,660
powdery mildew resistance because I've

794
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:51,000
I've established this this particular

795
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:54,779
proprietary marker is that is that

796
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,970
correct so so I cannot so I can't patent

797
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:00,899
the marker because the marker is a gene

798
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:04,500
which is a natural thing what I can

799
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:07,890
patent is a is a unique process of

800
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,570
identifying that gene and that alleles

801
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:13,890
on that gene right so what I do is I

802
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:17,490
build a very specific fluorescent tag

803
00:34:13,889 --> 00:34:20,639
that identifies that allele right and I

804
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:22,769
say ok my patent is on a method of

805
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,539
identifying this allele using this

806
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:29,309
methodology and making this this

807
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:31,860
consulting or or making this you know

808
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:35,309
outcome call which is you know

809
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:37,559
recommending to use certain plants that

810
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:39,779
have that marker to in a breeding

811
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:42,329
program right so that's a very specific

812
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:45,030
thing that I can go after I cannot go

813
00:34:42,329 --> 00:34:46,920
after the actual marker in the gene

814
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,000
because it's a naturally occurring thing

815
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:52,380
that occurs in the plant

816
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:55,500
unless of course I use gene editing and

817
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:57,840
make that make a change but then I would

818
00:34:55,500 --> 00:35:00,960
have to show that that change did not

819
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:03,150
already exist in nature to be able to

820
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,650
claim that I made it and I could claim

821
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,070
that because that would be an artificial

822
00:35:04,650 --> 00:35:10,559
DNA sequence at that point so so that's

823
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:12,809
where this conversation with tools like

824
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:16,079
CRISPR come into play then with gene

825
00:35:12,809 --> 00:35:17,759
editing is that correct yes exactly and

826
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,980
that's where you get into

827
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,890
genetic modification right so now and

828
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:25,679
even that is a kind of gray area right

829
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:27,989
because in the old days GMO meant you

830
00:35:25,679 --> 00:35:29,669
took a gene from one organism you put in

831
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:31,409
another organism you put a non

832
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,369
naturally-occurring gene and then orgasm

833
00:35:31,409 --> 00:35:35,519
right now

834
00:35:32,369 --> 00:35:39,990
genetic modification CRISPR you are

835
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:44,460
changing a naturally-occurring gene to a

836
00:35:39,989 --> 00:35:47,279
form that either augments or fixes you

837
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:50,340
know mutations and so it is it really

838
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:54,150
technical at a-- fication you know I'd

839
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:56,400
say at this point it's it's out of

840
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:58,320
regular regular breeding now you're

841
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,480
actually manipulating with DNA and so

842
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,640
that is genetic modification but it's a

843
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,210
different genetic modification then we

844
00:36:02,639 --> 00:36:08,429
we originally thought of when back in

845
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:12,630
the day when then clean CRISPR didn't

846
00:36:08,429 --> 00:36:15,659
exist right so but yes it's a completely

847
00:36:12,630 --> 00:36:17,460
different set of tools one is an

848
00:36:15,659 --> 00:36:19,799
identification set that allows you to

849
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:21,269
make intelligent breeding choices but

850
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:23,850
you still use traditional breeding

851
00:36:21,269 --> 00:36:25,710
methodology the other one allows you to

852
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:27,118
go in and say okay I'm gonna do this

853
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,309
differently I'm gonna go in I'm going to

854
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:31,410
rewrite the entire code so that it's

855
00:36:29,309 --> 00:36:35,489
only what I want I'm going to do a

856
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:37,759
single a single pass

857
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:42,829
you know stabilization which is

858
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:46,290
something called half-half lloyd haploid

859
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:50,210
or double haploid kind of mating and

860
00:36:46,289 --> 00:36:52,320
that's it works in some plants

861
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:54,349
apparently it may or may not work in

862
00:36:52,320 --> 00:37:00,480
cannabis I've heard different reports

863
00:36:54,349 --> 00:37:07,139
but it allows you to go from a unique or

864
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:09,750
a phenotype to a truly stabilized strain

865
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:12,029
in not what we not what we call

866
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,789
stabilized but truly stabilized as in

867
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:19,380
you know it will only ever produce one

868
00:37:14,789 --> 00:37:21,809
set of germ plasm you know overnight

869
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,420
basically and in in in one double

870
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:27,840
haploid mating you get you go to

871
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:31,670
complete stability and in one one-shot

872
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:33,260
so which is a tremendously useful tool

873
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:36,170
and we can get it to work in cannabis

874
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:38,000
because that has been the traditional

875
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:43,760
drawback of in the cannabis industry

876
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:45,079
anyway right so we we kind of exist in

877
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,090
the periphery of agriculture and

878
00:37:45,079 --> 00:37:49,340
cannabis believe it or not right so when

879
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:51,380
we when we talk about a hybrid and

880
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,630
that's one hybrid in cannabis we're

881
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:56,390
actually using a very bastardized form

882
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:59,150
of what it is done in real agriculture

883
00:37:56,389 --> 00:38:04,400
and real agriculture and f1 hybrid comes

884
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:06,680
from taking a stabilized father and a

885
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,099
stabilized mother right and then making

886
00:38:06,679 --> 00:38:11,839
that cross from two stabilized parents

887
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:14,029
well that almost never happens in

888
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:15,800
cannabis right so we're breeding we're

889
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:18,440
breeding hybrids with HUD with other

890
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:21,019
hybrids that have no characterization

891
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,460
and then so now we really have no clue

892
00:38:21,019 --> 00:38:24,500
of the mess that we've made in the

893
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:26,869
cannabis industry right but we do not

894
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:31,300
really do traditional agriculture as as

895
00:38:26,869 --> 00:38:35,179
you would come from big AG right so so

896
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:39,769
what we cannot do is we cannot become a

897
00:38:35,179 --> 00:38:42,169
seed company based industry until we get

898
00:38:39,769 --> 00:38:45,320
to that point where we have the ability

899
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:48,680
to say parent a when bred with a parent

900
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:52,150
B will only give you this set of

901
00:38:48,679 --> 00:38:54,109
outcomes right now we can talk about

902
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,930
stabilizing through breeding stabilized

903
00:38:54,110 --> 00:38:59,329
means that when you breathe when you

904
00:38:56,929 --> 00:39:01,069
sell cross a stable I truly stabilized

905
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:04,159
strain you'll get four or fewer

906
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:06,559
phenotypes back right and a true

907
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:09,619
breeding strain means that you know when

908
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:13,070
you when you do cross a and cross B you

909
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:15,589
will only ever get offspring you know C

910
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:18,380
there is no possibility because they are

911
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:20,390
so stabilized now that double haploid

912
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:22,700
thing allows us to go to that true

913
00:39:20,389 --> 00:39:24,409
stabilized in one fell swoop right which

914
00:39:22,699 --> 00:39:27,289
is awesome if we can get it to work in

915
00:39:24,409 --> 00:39:30,920
the industry and and that will allow us

916
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:33,110
to now do something that would would

917
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:36,829
otherwise take us a long time and that's

918
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:39,440
build a a seed population now where we

919
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:41,480
can become a seed based industry and so

920
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:43,639
where we can now take a bag of seed

921
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,929
throw it out in the field and everything

922
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:47,118
we get back we'll look

923
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:50,779
almost identical right that's where we

924
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,510
have to be to be able to transcend this

925
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:55,040
clone based industry we will not exist

926
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:57,559
as a clone based industry it is not

927
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:00,440
possible to scale that right even with

928
00:39:57,559 --> 00:40:04,339
tissue culture clone based industries

929
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:06,519
would be hugely expensive to the point

930
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:11,779
where almost being prohibitively so ok

931
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:14,750
and the you know and and that's why big

932
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:17,630
AG exists as a seed based economy right

933
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:20,389
so and cannabis at some point will need

934
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:23,119
to get there for us for scalability

935
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:27,078
right now there will always be the need

936
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,210
for these these you know craft craft

937
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:31,010
breeders the ones that are coming out

938
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:33,500
with new varieties and then taking the

939
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:35,690
time to breathe and stabilize right so

940
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:40,489
there's there's still this underlying

941
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:43,849
breeding cultivation innovation portion

942
00:40:40,489 --> 00:40:46,939
that we'll have to then adopt some of

943
00:40:43,849 --> 00:40:49,818
these techniques to be able to produce

944
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:54,318
in a in a way that will allow us to

945
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:56,960
maintain our relevance in this industry

946
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:59,210
right again this is the backdrop of this

947
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,000
is Monsanto and down all these big AG

948
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:04,400
and Altria and all these guys they know

949
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:06,829
how to do big AG they do it better than

950
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,960
us and if they get us there first

951
00:41:06,829 --> 00:41:12,559
they will cut us out of this industry

952
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,630
right having done research in a monsanto

953
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:17,690
building in Saint Charles Missouri in my

954
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:20,869
post-op let me tell you it's a scary

955
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:23,420
thought to see what we do and think of

956
00:41:20,869 --> 00:41:25,338
as agriculture and what they do and what

957
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:28,220
they think of as agriculture you bring

958
00:41:25,338 --> 00:41:29,389
up a lot of really good points and one

959
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,669
of the some of the things that I'm

960
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:34,848
struggling with here with this is one as

961
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:36,680
we become more stable you talk about a

962
00:41:34,849 --> 00:41:39,019
stabilized male or a stabilized female

963
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:40,909
or you know stabilized seed how much

964
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:43,639
genetic diversity are we potentially

965
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:46,368
risking on losing that we don't know the

966
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:48,289
medical benefits of still I know like

967
00:41:46,369 --> 00:41:49,730
you said you just discovered THC v

968
00:41:48,289 --> 00:41:53,480
well how likely would that plan have

969
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:55,909
survived in a big AG scenario and how

970
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:58,789
much of a the medical community are we

971
00:41:55,909 --> 00:42:01,998
potentially doing a disservice to

972
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:06,349
by moving too rapidly towards I guess

973
00:42:01,998 --> 00:42:10,098
that that direction so those are awesome

974
00:42:06,349 --> 00:42:14,028
questions let me tell you so let me

975
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:16,068
answer by it by saying we already are

976
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:19,130
facing some of that because we don't we

977
00:42:16,068 --> 00:42:20,958
already don't know what we've lost so a

978
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:26,499
paper was recently published that showed

979
00:42:20,958 --> 00:42:31,728
that there are certain subspecies of CBD

980
00:42:26,498 --> 00:42:33,858
lineage compounds that so by that I mean

981
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:37,278
minor cannabinoids that come off of the

982
00:42:33,858 --> 00:42:40,278
CBD synthase tree that we do not see in

983
00:42:37,278 --> 00:42:43,099
the THC side and that is most likely

984
00:42:40,278 --> 00:42:45,650
because of the intense breeding form or

985
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:47,749
THC has lost some of the minor

986
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,849
cannabinoid genes along the way right so

987
00:42:47,748 --> 00:42:51,649
we've already done that because of the

988
00:42:49,849 --> 00:42:54,709
way we have gone about breeding in the

989
00:42:51,650 --> 00:42:56,239
cannabis industry there's no reason why

990
00:42:54,708 --> 00:42:58,969
we wouldn't see the same minor

991
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,219
cannabinoids across the board in both

992
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:04,068
CBD and THC because we see some of the

993
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:06,259
same minor cannabinoids already like we

994
00:43:04,068 --> 00:43:09,650
see Varun's on both the CBD and THC side

995
00:43:06,259 --> 00:43:12,769
we see or señal on both the TAC and CV

996
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:16,548
so that means that there was a mimicry

997
00:43:12,768 --> 00:43:18,408
or symmetry in the two trees and some of

998
00:43:16,548 --> 00:43:21,108
that has been lost because we have not

999
00:43:18,409 --> 00:43:22,640
used chemistry and or science to do our

1000
00:43:21,108 --> 00:43:24,348
breeding we've used the seat of our

1001
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:27,288
pants and I think I said this earlier in

1002
00:43:24,349 --> 00:43:30,019
the talk where you know you know when

1003
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:32,839
when the only metric is did I get higher

1004
00:43:30,018 --> 00:43:35,358
than before you know there's only

1005
00:43:32,838 --> 00:43:37,849
there's only one way to look at it right

1006
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:42,588
so and so you have no idea what has been

1007
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:46,699
lost along the way already so the other

1008
00:43:42,588 --> 00:43:48,489
part of that would be so yeah again it

1009
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:53,179
would have to be an intelligent

1010
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:57,469
science-based you know project where you

1011
00:43:53,179 --> 00:44:00,499
you use chemistry to identify the

1012
00:43:57,469 --> 00:44:02,929
different classes and make sure that in

1013
00:44:00,498 --> 00:44:05,178
these in these breeding programs these

1014
00:44:02,929 --> 00:44:08,659
classes weren't lost and then you you

1015
00:44:05,179 --> 00:44:10,999
and and establish libraries where you

1016
00:44:08,659 --> 00:44:11,710
can go back to land races and other

1017
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:14,469
things like

1018
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,420
and then try to keep breeding back going

1019
00:44:14,469 --> 00:44:18,549
back far enough where before the loss of

1020
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:21,519
these things right so as long as you

1021
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:26,890
have a stable land race or you know

1022
00:44:21,519 --> 00:44:28,659
ancient stock population right consider

1023
00:44:26,889 --> 00:44:30,848
it like the heirloom the guys who still

1024
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:33,460
breed heirloom tomatoes right so you

1025
00:44:30,849 --> 00:44:34,930
know as long as you have that part of

1026
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,990
the community still there or a

1027
00:44:34,929 --> 00:44:41,259
repository for that you'll never really

1028
00:44:37,989 --> 00:44:44,318
lose it as long as it is maintained and

1029
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,780
it is what you know at least you know

1030
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:48,759
you do see increases and you and you and

1031
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:50,500
and that gets back to traditional

1032
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:52,630
agriculture as well at some point you

1033
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:54,760
have to back cross to an original parent

1034
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:57,130
because you do tend to lose things or

1035
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,780
you do tend to lose resistances and that

1036
00:44:57,130 --> 00:45:01,630
kind of stuff right so you always mean

1037
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:03,760
to you know you always give it a booster

1038
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:06,130
shot of original DNA kind of thing right

1039
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,750
and to kind of bring that the vigor back

1040
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:10,630
up because now you've created a hybrid

1041
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:12,280
again but you created a hybrid going

1042
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,858
back to the one of the original parents

1043
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:16,990
so you're keeping it all in the family

1044
00:45:14,858 --> 00:45:19,150
but getting some of that hybrid vigor

1045
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:22,808
back by going to an older to an older

1046
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:25,838
you know ancestor right so so as you

1047
00:45:22,809 --> 00:45:28,569
know I mean so agriculture has learned a

1048
00:45:25,838 --> 00:45:31,929
lot on itself I think you know over the

1049
00:45:28,568 --> 00:45:33,670
evolution of Agriculture as we know it

1050
00:45:31,929 --> 00:45:36,009
right I think we've seen some of these

1051
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:37,630
things and and if you look at white

1052
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:39,790
peaches inside the United States right

1053
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:41,289
so that that industry almost died for

1054
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:43,420
exactly that reason everything became so

1055
00:45:41,289 --> 00:45:46,480
interbred you know and they lost the

1056
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:48,460
original stock that white peaches or I

1057
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,809
think there are more white peaches grown

1058
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,190
outside of the United States than there

1059
00:45:49,809 --> 00:45:53,500
are in United States and in the United

1060
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:57,309
States was you know I believe is where

1061
00:45:53,500 --> 00:46:00,309
white peaches originated right so you

1062
00:45:57,309 --> 00:46:03,040
know so you know so we hopefully have

1063
00:46:00,309 --> 00:46:05,650
learned enough I'm somewhat making an

1064
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:09,818
assumption you know but I think you know

1065
00:46:05,650 --> 00:46:11,980
as long as we maintain ancestral

1066
00:46:09,818 --> 00:46:16,568
populations we won't have to worry about

1067
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:20,139
the loss of diversity you know and and

1068
00:46:16,568 --> 00:46:24,940
now you know it it also becomes

1069
00:46:20,139 --> 00:46:27,789
important for us to begin to educate

1070
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:31,240
to force people in the government to

1071
00:46:27,789 --> 00:46:33,759
allow more medical research without

1072
00:46:31,239 --> 00:46:35,349
without understanding what the targets

1073
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,970
are right we have no reason to move

1074
00:46:35,349 --> 00:46:39,299
forward right there is no reason to do

1075
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:42,849
advanced medical Rita or chemical

1076
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:44,860
analysis if you know we're going to be

1077
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:46,420
told that you know well Big Pharma's

1078
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:48,190
taking it away or you know or it'll

1079
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:49,720
never be a medicine because well you

1080
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:52,030
know then we might oh just keep it

1081
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:53,349
recreational and and then we should

1082
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:56,650
focus on things like terpene and

1083
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:57,789
experience right but um but you know we

1084
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,550
already know that there's medicinal

1085
00:46:57,789 --> 00:47:03,730
benefit so now we have to have science

1086
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:05,920
catch-up right it cannot be the steep

1087
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:08,110
hill or the Philo's or the medicinal

1088
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:11,550
genomic think about it the entire

1089
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:14,260
industry has been has been supported by

1090
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:16,840
bootstrapping it right the reason why I

1091
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,300
have to patent and and build tests and

1092
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:21,010
charge money for it is because I can't

1093
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:22,630
get federal grants to do the basic

1094
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:24,880
research that was done in the human

1095
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:28,240
genome project or with Brassica oleracea

1096
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:30,340
which is you know and other oil rape

1097
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:31,349
seeds and broccoli and cauliflower and

1098
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,490
all those kind of things right so

1099
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:35,559
they've done genome sequencing they've

1100
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,809
done terpene profile they know all of

1101
00:47:35,559 --> 00:47:39,130
the the important chemicals that come

1102
00:47:37,809 --> 00:47:43,150
out of different plants except for

1103
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:45,670
cannabis and so without that impetus for

1104
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:48,670
federal federally funded research right

1105
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:50,680
we will always be behind the 8-ball and

1106
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:53,619
it's going to be really difficult for us

1107
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:56,199
to to understand this plant in its

1108
00:47:53,619 --> 00:47:59,409
entirety rapidly right and I think at

1109
00:47:56,199 --> 00:48:01,949
this point that's what we only we as an

1110
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:06,789
industry to come together and kind of

1111
00:48:01,949 --> 00:48:08,529
find a way to to you know put the final

1112
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:10,539
nail in the prohibition coffin right

1113
00:48:08,530 --> 00:48:13,269
make this let's blow the lid off of it

1114
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:16,630
and get money into it because you know

1115
00:48:13,269 --> 00:48:19,599
there are so many avenues right so there

1116
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:21,519
is not a single part of the of the

1117
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,759
cannabis plant and now when I say

1118
00:48:21,519 --> 00:48:27,309
cannabis I mean hemp and or you know

1119
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,230
recreational varieties the roots have

1120
00:48:27,309 --> 00:48:32,049
their own set of compounds we find

1121
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:34,719
terpenes and other cannabinoids that are

1122
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:36,970
only expressed in the roots right there

1123
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:38,379
you know and if you go back and look in

1124
00:48:36,969 --> 00:48:41,829
the history of cannabis

1125
00:48:38,380 --> 00:48:44,829
there are you know there are Shama

1126
00:48:41,829 --> 00:48:46,809
shamanic or you know medicine man kind

1127
00:48:44,829 --> 00:48:48,940
of stuff where they do make poulos's of

1128
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:50,380
the roots of cannabis or or a

1129
00:48:48,940 --> 00:48:52,000
combination of the leaves in the roots

1130
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:53,140
right so because they understood then

1131
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,090
that there were medicines that came out

1132
00:48:53,139 --> 00:48:56,980
of different part of the plans right I

1133
00:48:55,090 --> 00:48:58,720
know in this kitchen said the genetics

1134
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:03,400
right so why is the genic so important

1135
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:06,219
well you know we can now start to breed

1136
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:08,980
very specific cannabis plants for very

1137
00:49:06,219 --> 00:49:11,049
specific maladies if we have the

1138
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:12,849
corresponding medical research the kind

1139
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,800
of soap that's going on would cancer

1140
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:18,069
cell line work in Israel that kind of

1141
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,590
stuff right so you know and then after

1142
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:23,590
taking flower and or whatever else in

1143
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:25,780
extracting now we have fiber and even if

1144
00:49:23,590 --> 00:49:28,120
we don't have fiber we have pulp to make

1145
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:30,910
chem creat or or some of the best best

1146
00:49:28,119 --> 00:49:32,799
paper in the world right so there is so

1147
00:49:30,909 --> 00:49:36,369
much there are so much that can be done

1148
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,550
with this plant right and to not be able

1149
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:42,369
to exploit every avenue of this planet

1150
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:45,100
including high-tech right at one point

1151
00:49:42,369 --> 00:49:47,049
you know we there was a big push on

1152
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:49,299
graphene as a superconductor well guess

1153
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:51,340
what graphene died when they found that

1154
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,289
the best graphing came from hemp like

1155
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,300
four or five years ago a paper came out

1156
00:49:53,289 --> 00:50:00,579
that said there's the graphene from hemp

1157
00:49:55,300 --> 00:50:02,260
is unparalleled and so and so now you

1158
00:50:00,579 --> 00:50:06,009
know it's funny you don't hear about

1159
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:07,360
graphing anymore so so they're they're

1160
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:09,040
they're there's a lot of work to be done

1161
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:11,800
right and and the chemistry and the

1162
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,779
genetics is just part of it because you

1163
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:16,600
know in order to exploit it in order to

1164
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:18,160
get optimization for growing and this is

1165
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:19,509
where I had said I was going to throw

1166
00:50:18,159 --> 00:50:22,420
something out there before and get back

1167
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:24,070
to it but now if you take the same

1168
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,269
genetics and you grow at ten different

1169
00:50:24,070 --> 00:50:26,740
ways you're going to get a bunch of

1170
00:50:25,269 --> 00:50:28,719
different answers right so there's

1171
00:50:26,739 --> 00:50:32,019
enough plasticity in the genome of the

1172
00:50:28,719 --> 00:50:36,869
plant that you already see right you

1173
00:50:32,019 --> 00:50:40,119
already see that you have to have

1174
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:42,509
nurture being very well controlled to

1175
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:45,429
get a to get the semblance of a

1176
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:48,970
consistent product on the outbound

1177
00:50:45,429 --> 00:50:52,009
flower right if you in two different

1178
00:50:48,969 --> 00:50:53,149
rooms change temperature change you

1179
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:54,680
you're going to end up with different

1180
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:58,220
terpenes in this even though they had

1181
00:50:54,679 --> 00:51:00,129
the same genetic base so now that that

1182
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:02,679
leads to a whole other level of stuff

1183
00:51:00,130 --> 00:51:05,750
which is more science based

1184
00:51:02,679 --> 00:51:08,389
investigation to optimize rights and so

1185
00:51:05,750 --> 00:51:10,280
that we can get consistency we can start

1186
00:51:08,389 --> 00:51:12,710
to look like a real medical industry if

1187
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:13,970
we do it the right way yeah that's

1188
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:15,289
that's great I was hoping you would

1189
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:17,779
touch on that because I just did an

1190
00:51:15,289 --> 00:51:20,000
interview with Jeremy plum recently and

1191
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,640
that was something that he mentioned in

1192
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:26,119
as a goal of him and his company over at

1193
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:29,179
proof and so essentially when you're

1194
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:30,799
getting a genetic marker establishing a

1195
00:51:29,179 --> 00:51:33,919
gender marker genetic marker what you're

1196
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,900
looking at is a range because like you

1197
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,670
said the chemo type expression can vary

1198
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,349
across these different environments so

1199
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:43,010
you're just looking for a marker that is

1200
00:51:39,349 --> 00:51:46,279
most likely to create a certain outcome

1201
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:48,110
is that right yeah so it's about

1202
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:52,519
potentials right so at the end of the

1203
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:54,710
day you know we have we might have an

1204
00:51:52,519 --> 00:51:56,809
allele that then you know says oh this

1205
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:58,429
is gonna make you know it's always going

1206
00:51:56,809 --> 00:52:01,070
to be I'm a higher end of production of

1207
00:51:58,429 --> 00:52:03,980
THC right but you know but that higher

1208
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,500
end is a relative thing right so if you

1209
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,820
take plant a implant B with different

1210
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,920
genetics and plant B is the high

1211
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:12,530
producer yeah it will be higher than

1212
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:14,450
plant a but if you grow it the wrong way

1213
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,830
it'll be higher than plant a but it'll

1214
00:52:14,449 --> 00:52:20,089
still not hitting this full potential

1215
00:52:15,829 --> 00:52:24,110
right so so ultimately genetics is about

1216
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:26,930
identifying potential right and the

1217
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:29,000
nurture is a big part of it so there has

1218
00:52:26,929 --> 00:52:31,609
to be you know an understanding of that

1219
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:34,219
interplay so we can identify which

1220
00:52:31,610 --> 00:52:36,710
alleles for each gene gives you the best

1221
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:39,009
potential now we have to back it up with

1222
00:52:36,710 --> 00:52:41,000
optimization of that growing potential

1223
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:41,660
that's a really good explanation I

1224
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,989
appreciate that

1225
00:52:41,659 --> 00:52:47,809
so changing direction a little bit here

1226
00:52:44,989 --> 00:52:50,299
you've talked about you've talked about

1227
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:53,750
science you talked about Monsanto big

1228
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:55,789
egg where this industry is headed and I

1229
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:58,519
don't think there's an answer to this

1230
00:52:55,789 --> 00:53:01,519
it's a big ethical dilemma but for me

1231
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:04,429
personally you know I'm an organic guy I

1232
00:53:01,519 --> 00:53:05,070
struggle with a lot of what's going on

1233
00:53:04,429 --> 00:53:08,549
right now and

1234
00:53:05,070 --> 00:53:10,620
egg already but I see tools like CRISPR

1235
00:53:08,550 --> 00:53:12,269
and I feel like it's an avalanche I I

1236
00:53:10,619 --> 00:53:15,839
know they're going to be used I mean

1237
00:53:12,269 --> 00:53:19,679
we've already seen it be used in a you

1238
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:21,870
know human female in China illegally and

1239
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:23,369
I know it's gonna happen with cannabis

1240
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:27,900
at some point down the road it's

1241
00:53:23,369 --> 00:53:30,449
unavoidable it already did so tweed has

1242
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:33,510
a patent that they submitted on a

1243
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:35,579
genetic app knockout of THC that was

1244
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,080
made using CRISPR the patent ready been

1245
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:40,710
filed so it's already been done cannabis

1246
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:44,009
wow I didn't know that yeah so how do

1247
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:48,300
how does someone with like say my values

1248
00:53:44,010 --> 00:53:50,820
or my background around genetics and

1249
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:52,500
genetic modification how do how do we

1250
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:54,210
approach an industry like this and still

1251
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:56,239
say relevant or is it even possible to

1252
00:53:54,210 --> 00:54:03,929
stay relevant with what science is doing

1253
00:53:56,239 --> 00:54:06,509
well so again there there are there are

1254
00:54:03,929 --> 00:54:09,960
different levels of genetics right so

1255
00:54:06,510 --> 00:54:12,150
you know not all genetics ends up at

1256
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:14,039
CRISPR right so a lot of the tools that

1257
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:17,579
you know that I'm talking about you know

1258
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:19,409
you you you use them to screen your

1259
00:54:17,579 --> 00:54:20,819
seeds right and then and then after you

1260
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:22,739
find the population you want to work

1261
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:24,120
with and everything else is the old way

1262
00:54:22,739 --> 00:54:28,109
look wait the way that you're saying the

1263
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,359
organic way right so I don't you know I

1264
00:54:28,110 --> 00:54:32,460
think it's a level of comfort and a

1265
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:36,920
level of understanding and I think I

1266
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:36,920
know this gets back to the you know

1267
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:41,969
understanding the science talking to the

1268
00:54:39,630 --> 00:54:44,190
labs and and and trusting the people

1269
00:54:41,969 --> 00:54:45,599
right so at the end of the day we're

1270
00:54:44,190 --> 00:54:47,280
we're really just people right so we

1271
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:49,409
decide we're geeks and whites in white

1272
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:51,000
coats right but you know we love the

1273
00:54:49,409 --> 00:54:55,799
plant - that's why we're doing the

1274
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:57,630
research and so you know not everybody

1275
00:54:55,800 --> 00:55:02,070
is out there to steal somebody else's

1276
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:04,410
thing right so and and and again a

1277
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:07,260
better understanding of the patent world

1278
00:55:04,409 --> 00:55:09,839
would help as well so so so as long as

1279
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:11,190
you have documented evidence that you

1280
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,780
created this thing and you went to

1281
00:55:11,190 --> 00:55:14,400
somebody to ask for genetic sequence

1282
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:16,530
right as long as you have that

1283
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,150
interaction you can prove that they

1284
00:55:16,530 --> 00:55:18,940
didn't do it and at that point so they

1285
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:20,410
can't patent it

1286
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,608
even if they try to patent it you can

1287
00:55:20,409 --> 00:55:25,838
beat it so so that there's that level of

1288
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:29,039
understanding because also to the level

1289
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:32,529
of understanding that you know you know

1290
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:35,858
good science helps make better better

1291
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:39,040
plants it doesn't have to be taken to

1292
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:40,690
the I'm trying to use CRISPR and gene

1293
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:45,940
edit and it doesn't have to be taken to

1294
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:48,220
the level of you know you know I want to

1295
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:50,050
put some other gene in cannabis to make

1296
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,368
it you know I want to put the psilocybin

1297
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:52,750
gene in cannabis right so I'm sure I

1298
00:55:51,369 --> 00:55:55,329
believe it I'm sure somebody's out there

1299
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:58,869
trying to do it I'm sure you know but

1300
00:55:55,329 --> 00:56:01,269
but um you know so so it there are

1301
00:55:58,869 --> 00:56:02,500
different levels of genetics right and I

1302
00:56:01,269 --> 00:56:04,929
and I think that's an important

1303
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:07,179
distinction in industry because you know

1304
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:10,088
it allows people to buy in at the level

1305
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:13,539
that they want and and that means that

1306
00:56:10,088 --> 00:56:16,599
you know it's possible to use tools to

1307
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:18,630
become a better breeder to increase your

1308
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:22,240
your generation time to be able to

1309
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:25,390
improve you know your Fino hunting right

1310
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:27,879
to be able to keep good notes and say ah

1311
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:30,400
now I have a genetic lineage I know

1312
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:32,050
these guys do these things I have

1313
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:36,039
something that I can follow that trait

1314
00:56:32,050 --> 00:56:39,099
and now you know it also allows you to

1315
00:56:36,039 --> 00:56:40,119
handle larger larger amounts of projects

1316
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:42,338
you know one of the things that that

1317
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:44,470
we've been told a lot is it's tough to

1318
00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:47,619
work to do because the pheno Hutton gets

1319
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:49,689
so large well now you can manage ten

1320
00:56:47,619 --> 00:56:51,880
different crosses if you're only dealing

1321
00:56:49,690 --> 00:56:54,309
with a few things because you can screen

1322
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:56,829
for the right answer right so you know

1323
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:59,019
but again it's you're plugging in

1324
00:56:56,829 --> 00:57:03,430
science on top of traditional breeding

1325
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:05,139
and growth right you know we didn't even

1326
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:06,759
touch on tissue culture but so where

1327
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:09,789
this tissue culture fortune fit end is

1328
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:11,619
tissue culture to biotech for the

1329
00:57:09,789 --> 00:57:14,650
industry I see a lot of people talking

1330
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:16,420
about that so but tissue culture is like

1331
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:18,329
the gateway drug for genetic

1332
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:21,010
modification believe it or not right so

1333
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:23,440
you have to have tissue culture to do

1334
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,790
genetic modification so you know so

1335
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,380
where do you draw the line and I think

1336
00:57:24,789 --> 00:57:29,699
that's an important distinction and I

1337
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:32,680
think the the industry really needs to

1338
00:57:29,699 --> 00:57:35,048
understand the what is available

1339
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:37,629
what the things do and how they can be

1340
00:57:35,048 --> 00:57:41,108
used so that they can be comfortable

1341
00:57:37,630 --> 00:57:43,088
with what inevitably has to happen or we

1342
00:57:41,108 --> 00:57:44,858
will be sitting on the side watching

1343
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:47,469
Monsanto and those guys do it because

1344
00:57:44,858 --> 00:57:50,858
they use all of this and on top of that

1345
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:53,828
they probably will use CRISPR - yes so

1346
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:56,288
essentially not all science is bad we

1347
00:57:53,829 --> 00:57:59,470
need to understand that science in order

1348
00:57:56,289 --> 00:58:01,839
to make the right decisions in how we

1349
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:03,038
move forward as an industry and realize

1350
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:04,778
that there are people that will come

1351
00:58:03,039 --> 00:58:06,609
into this industry from big AG to have

1352
00:58:04,778 --> 00:58:08,619
no problems utilizing whatever tool is

1353
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:12,730
available to allow them to make money

1354
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:14,380
and be profitable right and I would just

1355
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:16,358
add so you've kind of created these

1356
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:18,130
levels so level one would be hey this is

1357
00:58:16,358 --> 00:58:21,788
an analytical tool that you're giving us

1358
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:25,028
it's like a microscope or a shovel or

1359
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:26,920
fertilizer it's just another way to make

1360
00:58:25,028 --> 00:58:29,230
a decision about your plant in your in

1361
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:30,760
your environment and that's sort of what

1362
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:32,469
you guys are doing right now it's steep

1363
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,089
hill it sounds like in terms of this

1364
00:58:32,469 --> 00:58:36,250
data collection and then if we go to the

1365
00:58:34,088 --> 00:58:37,690
next level we could talk about you know

1366
00:58:36,250 --> 00:58:40,358
something like CRISPR where we're not

1367
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:41,798
taking frog DNA or psilocybin II said

1368
00:58:40,358 --> 00:58:44,108
and putting it into cannabis but we're

1369
00:58:41,798 --> 00:58:45,818
you know we're making changes within the

1370
00:58:44,108 --> 00:58:47,858
DNA code itself and that's something

1371
00:58:45,818 --> 00:58:49,719
that I don't know quite how I feel on I

1372
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,940
have a lot of feelings and emotions on

1373
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:53,980
it but I haven't sorted them out yet but

1374
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:54,789
then I guess the last level would be

1375
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:57,400
what you're talking about we're

1376
00:58:54,789 --> 00:59:00,849
inserting entirely foreign DNA into the

1377
00:58:57,400 --> 00:59:02,170
plant and that to me doesn't doesn't

1378
00:59:00,849 --> 00:59:05,019
feel right I don't know if that'll ever

1379
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:06,700
quite feel good but I realize that it's

1380
00:59:05,019 --> 00:59:09,099
still gonna happen someone's gonna do it

1381
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:10,808
right like I said I'm sure somebody's

1382
00:59:09,099 --> 00:59:12,730
thinking about it right so but but but

1383
00:59:10,809 --> 00:59:15,519
but I went to weigh in too because I

1384
00:59:12,730 --> 00:59:18,670
feel like you so I'm a traditional

1385
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:21,250
flower guy dude I'm not a big favor I

1386
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,108
mean I Drive vapor I'm not a big you

1387
00:59:21,250 --> 00:59:26,679
know oil guy I'm not a big animal guy

1388
00:59:23,108 --> 00:59:28,119
you know and so I'm and as a sign so I'm

1389
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,328
traditionally pretty much a purist as

1390
00:59:28,119 --> 00:59:33,519
well as a traditionalist right so so I

1391
00:59:30,329 --> 00:59:36,970
believe that the tools the first level

1392
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:39,309
is acceptable right I in my opinion do

1393
00:59:36,969 --> 00:59:40,689
not think we need CRISPR in the industry

1394
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:42,910
I think we can accomplish everything

1395
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:45,278
that we can we want including knockouts

1396
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:47,019
without CRISPR right so will it make it

1397
00:59:45,278 --> 00:59:49,360
faster absolutely

1398
00:59:47,019 --> 00:59:50,829
but I also know that CRISPR isn't

1399
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,510
unproven science and there are papers

1400
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:55,329
out there that suggestion to use CRISPR

1401
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:58,420
you make mistakes elsewhere right and

1402
00:59:55,329 --> 01:00:02,349
I'm completely and I'm completely you

1403
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:03,940
know well I mean I don't want to say I'm

1404
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:05,829
completely against but but I would I

1405
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:07,090
would say that I weigh in kind of group

1406
01:00:05,829 --> 01:00:08,920
to it with group three as well

1407
01:00:07,090 --> 01:00:10,660
I don't think that's necessary I don't I

1408
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,980
do not think that we need to be taking

1409
01:00:10,659 --> 01:00:14,949
other genes from other organisms and

1410
01:00:11,980 --> 01:00:17,320
putting them in cannabis maybe there

1411
01:00:14,949 --> 01:00:19,000
will become some gene that and the with

1412
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,650
when added to cannabis makes cannabis

1413
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:23,469
like this one or drug in that a case

1414
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:26,039
like that maybe maybe alright but but

1415
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:29,409
the you know that would have to be some

1416
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:31,659
hugely you know you know beneficial

1417
01:00:29,409 --> 01:00:33,849
thing you know that we find right so but

1418
01:00:31,659 --> 01:00:36,519
again you know there's nothing wrong

1419
01:00:33,849 --> 01:00:39,009
with using a little advanced science to

1420
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:46,719
augment traditional breeding methodology

1421
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:48,460
so unfortunately we had to end our

1422
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:50,439
interview a bit abruptly due to other

1423
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:52,000
time commitments I wanted to get more

1424
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:53,500
information from Reggie regarding the

1425
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:54,670
process of how a grower can begin

1426
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:57,039
testing their plants if they were

1427
01:00:54,670 --> 01:00:58,960
interested as in what's required how

1428
01:00:57,039 --> 01:01:00,610
long it takes how much it costs and

1429
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,530
learn a little bit more about steep hill

1430
01:01:00,610 --> 01:01:04,090
I plan on following up with a second

1431
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:06,400
part to this episode in the near future

1432
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:07,420
but that was Reggie Gaudi know and

1433
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,730
you're listening to the cannabis

1434
01:01:07,420 --> 01:01:11,349
