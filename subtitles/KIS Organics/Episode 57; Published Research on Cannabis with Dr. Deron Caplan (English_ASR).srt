00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,759
science podcast

4
00:00:18,269 --> 00:00:23,189
I'm your host tad hussy of KISS organics

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,420
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,550
cutting edge of growing from a

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,199
science-based perspective and drawn top

8
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:30,330
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,309
share their wisdom and knowledge as you

10
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:34,439
probably already know very little

11
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:37,109
research exists on cannabis and much of

12
00:00:34,439 --> 00:00:38,939
it is not shared openly I was so excited

13
00:00:37,109 --> 00:00:41,579
to see these papers and doctoral thesis

14
00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:43,349

00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,270
earn a PhD with research focused on

30
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,259
cannabis production Dr Kaplan has

31
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,969
written and published several

32
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,728
peer-reviewed articles on cannabis

33
00:01:20,969 --> 00:01:25,319
production focusing on irrigation

34
00:01:22,728 --> 00:01:27,900
growing media fertilization and

35
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:29,819
propagation he has testified on cannabis

media outlets including CBC nature and

41
00:01:38,578 --> 00:01:43,798
Rolling Stone magazine now onto the show

42
00:01:41,688 --> 00:01:47,489
hi Darren thanks for coming on the show

43
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,630
today hey thanks for having me yeah why

44
00:01:47,489 --> 00:01:50,759
don't we start off giving lists there's

45
00:01:48,629 --> 00:01:53,280
a little bit of your background and how

46
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:57,750
you got into essentially cannabis

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,009
research in your PhD yeah so I've kind

48
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:02,430
of always been interested in plant

49
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:04,200
science and horticulture specifically I

50
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,700
studied environmental science and

51
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,530
undergrad and when I was looking for

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:09,509
graduate research it was about the time

53
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,640
when you know they were talking about

54
00:02:09,508 --> 00:02:13,739
legalizing cannabis for recreational

55
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:16,049
purposes in Canada

56
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:18,330
and I was talking to some perspective

57
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:20,130
advisors and one of them was considering

58
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,870
doing some research in cannabis my who

59
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:24,650
became my advisor doctor you've been

60
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,090
saying at the University of Guelph and

61
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,129
what was so exciting to me about

62
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:33,060
cannabis not that I was so involved in

63
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:35,519
the in cannabis specifically but there's

64
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,500
no research on the horticultural any

65
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,100
horticultural production aspects of

66
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,349
cannabis and you know for for a new

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:46,949
scientist starting in an industry where

68
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:48,629
you could kind of learn so much so

69
00:02:46,949 --> 00:02:50,129
quickly and kind of decide what you want

70
00:02:48,629 --> 00:02:51,900
to learn was was incredibly exciting for

71
00:02:50,129 --> 00:02:55,019
me so it was kind of an obvious choice

72
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,430
and kind of the rest was history I got

73
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,040
deep into cannabis and I've been in the

74
00:02:56,430 --> 00:03:03,150
industry for about five years doing and

75
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:04,650
a nothing but yeah that's so cool that's

76
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,219
the thing I love about it too is there's

77
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:09,480
so much to be discovered there's so few

78
00:03:07,219 --> 00:03:11,310
horticultural plants and crops that are

79
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,739
even out there anymore that don't have

80
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:16,650
quite a body of research around them so

81
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:18,990
I I too am really passionate about the

82
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:20,700
fact that you you can do a lot of really

83
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:24,570
exciting work and really discover stuff

84
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:27,089
pretty quickly with cannabis yeah it's

85
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:28,349
really amazing yeah well you know what

86
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,289
why don't we just dive right in with

87
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:35,729
some of these papers one of the first

88
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:36,599
ones here is entitled let's see here let

89
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,549
me make sure I have the right one in

90
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,379
front of me Oh optimal rate of organic

91
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:42,570
fertilizer during the vegetative stage

92
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,639
for cannabis grown in two core based

93
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:46,109
substrates do you want to talk a little

94
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:47,969
bit about that study and kind of give a

95
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,370
give listeners little background and and

96
00:03:47,969 --> 00:03:52,770
just to be clear I will put links to all

97
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:55,469
of these studies that people really want

98
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:59,159
to dive into the details of them they'll

99
00:03:55,469 --> 00:04:03,689
be available on the podcast page okay

100
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:06,359
yeah so the the first study that I did

101
00:04:03,689 --> 00:04:08,370
in my my graduate research was on

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:11,670
growing substrates and on organic

103
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:13,950
fertilization and so because there was

104
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:16,229
so little research there was almost

105
00:04:13,949 --> 00:04:18,870
nothing on fertilizer or on growing

106
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:20,819
media for that was cannabis specifically

107
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,019
kind of started from ground up so we

108
00:04:20,819 --> 00:04:27,060
looked at determining optimal fertilizer

109
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,569
or fertilization rates for cannabis

110
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,980
during

111
00:04:27,569 --> 00:04:31,889
both the vegetative stage and the

112
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:34,920
flowering stage and we also custom

113
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,769
formulated growing substrates for both

114
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,500
of those stages to coincide with those

115
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:42,209
fertilizers and we were working with a

116
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,029
licensed cannabis producer in Ontario

117
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:47,250
called vivo cannabis and they were

118
00:04:45,029 --> 00:04:49,319
supporting all this research and they're

119
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,639
using you know they what kind of wanted

120
00:04:49,319 --> 00:04:53,339
to improve their systems and so we

121
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,779
tailored our research somewhat to try

122
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,979
and help them but also just trying to

123
00:04:54,779 --> 00:05:00,569
increase the you know the body of

124
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:03,090
knowledge on these topics great so tell

125
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:06,599
me a little bit about sort of how you

126
00:05:03,089 --> 00:05:07,769
establish the the methodology here and

127
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,330
what you were what you were exactly

128
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:13,169
testing so you mentioned you were using

129
00:05:09,329 --> 00:05:15,269
cocoa core based media for your

130
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:17,550
substrate and then you fed different

131
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,990
levels of organic fertilizer can you

132
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,870
talk about what that organic fertilizer

133
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:24,810
was how you fed it and a little bit

134
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:26,910
about maybe the growth chamber yeah for

135
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,769
sure so all of these trials were in

136
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,900
controlled environment growth growth

137
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:33,479
chambers and these are just very large

138
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:34,829
kind of walking growth chambers that you

139
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,509
can really tightly control the

140
00:05:34,829 --> 00:05:39,089
environments and that's very important

141
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:41,879
for making these results applicable to

142
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:43,679
no other growing environments because if

143
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:45,329
you have a lot of variability elsewhere

144
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,459
it's hard to kind of tease out the

145
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:49,319
effects of the fertilizer or if the grow

146
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:51,539
growing medium which you know for

147
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:53,399
example if the lighting is not uniform

148
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,610
the lighting will probably have a much

149
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:59,489
stronger effect than the fertilizer

150
00:05:55,610 --> 00:06:01,170
so we custom developed these two growing

151
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:04,710
media with different container

152
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:06,150
capacities so one of them was with a

153
00:06:04,709 --> 00:06:08,669
higher container capacity meaning that

154
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:11,159
it holds more water after it's saturated

155
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:13,319
and then one with a lower container

156
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,140
capacity so these are often considered a

157
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,939
high porosity or you know there's promix

158
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:19,889
HP which is a high porosity growing

159
00:06:17,939 --> 00:06:21,810
medium that's an example of one so we

160
00:06:19,889 --> 00:06:23,939
formulated these two based on their

161
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:26,819
container capacities to see if cannabis

162
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:28,439
prefers a dryer growing medium or a

163
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,399
wetter growing medium and we did that in

164
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:34,800
both vegetative and flowering stages and

165
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:36,599
then as in a full factorial experiment

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,918
we applied five different fertilizer

167
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:41,580
rates to each of these growing mediums

168
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:44,129
and

169
00:06:41,579 --> 00:06:45,478
we did that during we did a whole

170
00:06:44,129 --> 00:06:47,579
experiment during the vegetative stage

171
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:49,430
and in another publication we did it in

172
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:51,659
the flowering stage with two other

173
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:55,500
growing mediums that we also developed

174
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:58,259
and from that we teased out what the

175
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,418
optimal rate of a complete fertilizer is

176
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:04,830
for both of these stages in these

177
00:07:00,418 --> 00:07:06,508
growing mediums okay and one thing I

178
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:08,279
want to highlight from your paper this

179
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:10,830
is a direct quote actually from that you

180
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:14,219
pulled out relating to the work of dr.

181
00:07:10,829 --> 00:07:16,258
Zhang your adviser he mentioned

182
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,460
different substrates have different

183
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:19,500
physical and chemical properties

184
00:07:17,459 --> 00:07:21,658
therefore it is essential to fertig

185
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,800
eight plants accordingly a to ensure an

186
00:07:21,658 --> 00:07:27,478
adequate root zone environment so the

187
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,819
big takeaway I think is that we need to

188
00:07:27,478 --> 00:07:33,060
realize that this study is very specific

189
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:34,590
to coco coir in the environment that you

190
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,990
had created and we can't necessarily

191
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:39,448
extrapolate this data across peat moss

192
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,879
and rock wool and and ebb and flow

193
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:44,400
systems and things like that but that

194
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:46,319
you were able to get you know a good

195
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:49,859
foundation for some possibilities for

196
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,538
NPK levels for for cannabis and during

197
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:56,098
the vegetative state that's right it is

198
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:57,810
one thing about these papers these these

199
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:59,879
publications or any horticultural

200
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,038
research for that matter is that they're

201
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:03,689
designed in that they're there they

202
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:05,038
should be widely applicable but

203
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:06,418
obviously there's limitations so

204
00:08:05,038 --> 00:08:08,218
depending on your growing system if

205
00:08:06,418 --> 00:08:10,740
you're using like you say you know a

206
00:08:08,218 --> 00:08:12,899
hydroponic growing system with rock wall

207
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,348
compared to something like what we used

208
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:18,508
with organic nutrients and coco coir

209
00:08:16,348 --> 00:08:21,300
you're gonna have a very different

210
00:08:18,509 --> 00:08:23,520
effect but the general trend is probably

211
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:25,800
applicable so what we found is that

212
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:28,709
there is you know there is a maximum

213
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,270
yield at a certain certain nutrient

214
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,739
concentration of this organic nutrient

215
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:34,348
so you're going to find decreasing

216
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,299
yields after a certain rate and you can

217
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:38,209
use the you know the salt content in the

218
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,429
substrate maybe as an indicator of that

219
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:44,158
and also we found that if you fertilize

220
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:45,449
too much then you're actually getting a

221
00:08:44,158 --> 00:08:47,610
dilution effect on some of the

222
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,190
cannabinoids and that's probably

223
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:52,500
applicable kind of across the board it's

224
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,900
because it's likely a response to high

225
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,789
salinity in the growing media

226
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:59,789
yeah I saw that I thought that was

227
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:04,379
really interesting so what would you say

228
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:05,639
based on your you know the environment

229
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:08,639
that you created here with nutrients

230
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:11,850
what did you find to be the optimal sort

231
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:15,620
of NPK level for cannabis based on this

232
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:18,269
test result in cocoa core with your Seco

233
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:21,269
so we didn't actually look at different

234
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:23,338
NPK levels this was one complete

235
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,990
fertilizer from the vegetative stage and

236
00:09:23,339 --> 00:09:27,450
a different complete fertilizer for the

237
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:31,370
flowering stage and what we looked at

238
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:33,870
was the the rate of that fertilizer so

239
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:35,250
basically we're determining if cannabis

240
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:37,610
was a you know heavy feeder a light

241
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:40,889
feeder in general in this one cultivar

242
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:44,509
specifically and we weren't actually

243
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:47,870
looking at all about the the NPK ratios

244
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:51,088
okay so you had a specific NPK

245
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:52,679
fertilizer and you weren't look you were

246
00:09:51,089 --> 00:09:54,720
looking at just the concentration that

247
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:56,759
you fed that fertilizer what was optimal

248
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,399
that makes sense so you're not

249
00:09:56,759 --> 00:10:01,169
necessarily looking at how to adjust you

250
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,629
know nitrogen phosphorus potassium and

251
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:05,278
the variety of other anions and cations

252
00:10:03,629 --> 00:10:08,820
to the plant can uptake but rather just

253
00:10:05,278 --> 00:10:12,659
whatever concentration was best in your

254
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,810
environment that's right so based on

255
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:17,639
that I wanted something you mentioned

256
00:10:15,809 --> 00:10:19,379
there I just wanted to highlight you

257
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:21,120
mentioned that you think salinity has an

258
00:10:19,379 --> 00:10:25,458
effect but that you actually saw a

259
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:28,519
decrease in certain cannabinoids and THC

260
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:31,799
when you hit a certain level of

261
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:35,819
fertigation can you just talk a little

262
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:39,469
bit more about that that's right so we

263
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:41,970
found that up to a certain point the

264
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,920
increasing fertilizer would increase the

265
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:48,000
yield would increase cannabinoid content

266
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:49,588
and and that was positive but after a

267
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,509
point after a certain point there was

268
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:55,890
decreasing returns and then after at a

269
00:10:54,509 --> 00:11:01,110
fairly high rate we'd actually found a

270
00:10:55,889 --> 00:11:05,129
dilution of we found th c th CA and CB

271
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:07,730
GA in this cultivar those all decreased

272
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:10,458
when you that's right

273
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,110
certain concentration and you know just

274
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:15,189
to kind of expand out on that I'm

275
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:19,310
curious why you chose organic fertilizer

276
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,649
because it's so much more common in you

277
00:11:19,309 --> 00:11:25,309
know in academic research to use mineral

278
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,809
salts or chemical fertilizers for the

279
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,819
you know ability to really control

280
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:32,929
uptake can you talk a little bit about

281
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:35,199
that yeah that was a fairly difficult

282
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:37,278
choice one one part of that was that the

283
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:39,289
producer that we were working with was

284
00:11:37,278 --> 00:11:41,028
growing organically so we wanted to

285
00:11:39,289 --> 00:11:42,198
match what they were doing to help to

286
00:11:41,028 --> 00:11:43,250
you know they were fighting the project

287
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:45,289
we wanted to help them as much as we

288
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:47,208
could but we also had a you know

289
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:49,939
environmental aspect to this we're using

290
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:52,578
cocoa coiour because a lot of growers

291
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:53,709
are are moving towards cocoa coiour as

292
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:56,269
an environmentally sustainable

293
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:59,958
alternative to peat I won't get into

294
00:11:56,269 --> 00:12:00,799
that that argument but it's some

295
00:11:59,958 --> 00:12:04,250
consider it more environmentally

296
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:06,469
sustainable and we want to have that

297
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:09,100
angle and yes it would have been more

298
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:11,000
widely applicable if we did salt wood

299
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,519
for information we're actually doing

300
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:18,440
that now at in the same lab but we want

301
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:22,549
to focus on you know this being

302
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,560
completely organic and sustainable okay

303
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:28,129
yeah I mean the coco coir versus peat

304
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:30,169
argument could go for an entire podcast

305
00:12:28,129 --> 00:12:32,750
and I have my opinion and I'm sure you

306
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:36,649
have one too so we won't get into that

307
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,250
too much but I guess my question really

308
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:42,740
not to is how how do you feel nutrient

309
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:45,409
uptake relates to the ability to do

310
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:49,310
these research this research with an

311
00:12:45,409 --> 00:12:50,809
organic nutrient I mean a lot of what of

312
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:52,429
the growers that I work with are doing

313
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:55,489
and I know you're good friends with

314
00:12:52,429 --> 00:12:58,338
David David Bernard Peron who's a friend

315
00:12:55,490 --> 00:13:01,909
of mine as well the idea of putting in a

316
00:12:58,339 --> 00:13:05,810
lot of these dry amendments in meal

317
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:07,519
forms directly into a living soil and

318
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:09,018
not really having as much control over

319
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,879
uptake you know that you have that

320
00:13:09,019 --> 00:13:14,269
nutrient cycling process that's being

321
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:16,970
really driven by plant exudates and you

322
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:19,578
know microbial activity how does that

323
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:22,430
factor in when you're trying to do

324
00:13:19,578 --> 00:13:25,338
research or how that might impact I

325
00:13:22,429 --> 00:13:29,179
guess the results of you know of a study

326
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:30,769
like this using organic fertilizer yeah

327
00:13:29,179 --> 00:13:32,958
studying organic fertilizer is

328
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:35,839
incredibly complex as I'm sure you know

329
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:36,859
because from listening to your podcast I

330
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,880
know you're very familiar with that

331
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:42,230
would that work it's there's a million

332
00:13:40,879 --> 00:13:44,328
factors and it's very hard to control

333
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:46,459
for them and so my opinion it's at this

334
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:50,479
point it's impossible to control for a

335
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:53,379
lot of those factors it's really kind of

336
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,980
just finding a solution that works and

337
00:13:53,379 --> 00:13:57,500
understanding that we're not going to

338
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:59,240
understand why it works at this point in

339
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,759
time and you know leaving that for a

340
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,289
little bit later when we have some more

341
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:06,409
time to tease apart you know the

342
00:14:03,289 --> 00:14:08,088
microbial interactions how nitrogen

343
00:14:06,409 --> 00:14:10,909
breaks down and the different forms of

344
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:13,279
nitrogen and other macro micronutrients

345
00:14:10,909 --> 00:14:14,600
it's fairly complex but growers still

346
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:17,389
need to have answers to these questions

347
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,699
now because they are growing organically

348
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:23,180
and they still need these you know

349
00:14:19,698 --> 00:14:26,389
practical practical research to support

350
00:14:23,179 --> 00:14:29,269
their activities I like that so

351
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:30,889
essentially what what you're doing is

352
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:35,620
looking for trends like you mentioned

353
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:38,568
that can be sort of possibly

354
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:41,870
extrapolated are used across other forms

355
00:14:38,568 --> 00:14:45,110
of growing I know with with the work I'm

356
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:47,299
doing with Ben Higgins and Nate over at

357
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:49,938
gold leaf gardens what we try and do is

358
00:14:47,299 --> 00:14:52,370
say okay living soil this microbial

359
00:14:49,938 --> 00:14:54,318
diversity that's just one variable and

360
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,659
we can't control it we can't fully

361
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:59,028
understand it but we can control for it

362
00:14:56,659 --> 00:15:00,969
and say that all you know all of our

363
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:04,370
replications are going to be in a

364
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:07,459
similar soil mix with you know similar

365
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,490
microbial levels and biomass and then we

366
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:12,799
can make one change in say lighting or a

367
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:15,079
cultivar or our nutrient levels in that

368
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:16,879
system and then try and figure out sort

369
00:15:15,078 --> 00:15:18,019
of a trend based on that but we're not

370
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,419
like you said we're not going to fully

371
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:22,159
understand exactly how the process is

372
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:24,588
working and and that's one of the

373
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,419
challenges I find with any organic

374
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:28,279
research is a lot of a lot of

375
00:15:26,419 --> 00:15:31,509
researchers don't want to do that work

376
00:15:28,278 --> 00:15:34,090
because they can't control every aspect

377
00:15:31,509 --> 00:15:36,039
plant growth you kind of some of it is

378
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:40,060
up to sort of that microbial response

379
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:42,519
and interaction exactly it becomes much

380
00:15:40,059 --> 00:15:44,409
more kind of applied science than than

381
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:45,970
pure science and that for a lot of

382
00:15:44,409 --> 00:15:48,699
researchers that's fairly difficult

383
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:50,649
because again we don't know much about

384
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:53,500
cannabis so you know why not start from

385
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:54,789
the beginning but we also you know all

386
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,279
of North America jumped into this

387
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:59,049
industry and we have hundreds of

388
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,759
hundreds and hundreds of growers who are

389
00:15:59,049 --> 00:16:02,349
already it will already need this

390
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,689
information so giving them something

391
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:07,330
that's useful for me at this point is a

392
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:10,110
little bit more important than really

393
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,940
understanding every single aspect of it

394
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,289
yeah I love that so what would be your

395
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,550
you know I know we've talked about a

396
00:16:14,289 --> 00:16:17,740
little bit but what let's just say what

397
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:20,709
were your big takeaways from this paper

398
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,440
and then we'll you know also the

399
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:25,690
flowering paper so essentially a very

400
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,310
similar trial but looking at organic

401
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:29,980
fertilizer rates during the flowering

402
00:16:27,309 --> 00:16:31,859
stage what would be your big sort of

403
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:34,769
like highlight points for growers

404
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:36,970
looking at the the research that you did

405
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:39,549
yeah so I'll break it down by growth

406
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:44,139
stage so in the vegetative stage we

407
00:16:39,549 --> 00:16:47,259
found that cannabis can tolerate a range

408
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:49,419
of growing media parameters so we had

409
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:52,210
the wetter substrate and the drier

410
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:55,179
substrate performed well in both we

411
00:16:52,210 --> 00:16:56,980
found a relatively high rate of organic

412
00:16:55,179 --> 00:17:00,279
fertilizer to be optimum so if you're

413
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:00,700
looking at milligrams of nitrogen per

414
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:02,470
liter

415
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,838
you know equivalent of a complete

416
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:06,578
fertilizer it's on the high end compared

417
00:17:04,838 --> 00:17:09,549
to most other crops so if you're looking

418
00:17:06,578 --> 00:17:11,078
at if you know your your nitrogen rates

419
00:17:09,549 --> 00:17:14,588
for tomatoes for example an organic

420
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:15,730
fertilizer you can probably fit it in

421
00:17:14,588 --> 00:17:18,309
with that or you know maybe even a

422
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:20,199
little bit higher so that's as a general

423
00:17:18,309 --> 00:17:23,588
rule that's I think that's fairly

424
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:26,170
applicable kind of across the board in

425
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:28,960
terms of the flowering stage we had some

426
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:32,160
more complex results so again we had

427
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,569
increasing fertile increasing yield with

428
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,090
increasing fertilizer rate and that was

429
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:39,579
for both growing substrates but we found

430
00:17:37,089 --> 00:17:43,000
that the dryer growing substrate the

431
00:17:39,579 --> 00:17:45,339
higher porosity one produced 13 or 11

432
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,549
percent higher yields and

433
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:51,429
also larger plants so it's likely that

434
00:17:48,549 --> 00:17:55,869
cannabis in the flowering stage prefers

435
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:57,820
a drier substrate and to put that in

436
00:17:55,869 --> 00:17:59,019
context because it's a drier substrate

437
00:17:57,819 --> 00:18:00,970
it needed to be irrigated more

438
00:17:59,019 --> 00:18:02,769
frequently so it's hard to tease apart

439
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:04,779
whether it was increased irrigation

440
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:07,569
frequency that it likes or whether it

441
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:09,759
likes drier substrate but either way

442
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:15,039
you'll have the same effect by using a

443
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:18,819
drier substrate and anecdotally we've

444
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:22,869
been doing a lot more with blue mats

445
00:18:18,819 --> 00:18:25,179
which is an osmosis based system that

446
00:18:22,869 --> 00:18:28,779
regulates moisture temperature moisture

447
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:31,450
level in soil and keeps it even so it's

448
00:18:28,779 --> 00:18:33,700
a sort of a drip drip irrigation system

449
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,900
that is based off of the moisture

450
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,240
content of the soil so you're

451
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:40,300
maintaining it within a very small range

452
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:44,009
and we've you know again this is just

453
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,990
some some really preliminary work with

454
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:49,269
gold leaf but we found actually

455
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:53,430
substantially increased yields by that

456
00:18:49,269 --> 00:18:55,750
more frequent watering and were the

457
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:57,670
hypothesis is that we're getting better

458
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:59,650
nutrient cycling because the microbes

459
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:01,560
are being held in a range of moisture

460
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:04,900
content that is optimal for them to

461
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,159
cycle these nutrients for the plant but

462
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:11,800
again this is all really preliminary

463
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:14,140
preliminary research that makes a lot of

464
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,759
sense to be honest and kind of looking

465
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:17,910
into the literature on this subject I

466
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:20,079
did quite a bit of research on

467
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:22,410
irrigation for cannabis as well and I

468
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:24,519
think we'll talk about that later but

469
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:27,150
increased frequency that has a lot of

470
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:29,349
benefits not just under microbial

471
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,880
populations but also just in making

472
00:19:29,349 --> 00:19:32,459
nutrients more available because most

473
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,110
nutrients are actually transported

474
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,210
through mass transport with with the

475
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:38,649
water so it's if there's more water than

476
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:40,740
more likely that the plant can uptake

477
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:43,810
nutrients so that makes a lot of sense

478
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:46,569
okay that's interesting so one of the

479
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:48,399
things though about your about this to

480
00:19:46,569 --> 00:19:51,159
studies that I I thought I noticed that

481
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,830
you highlighted was that the yield

482
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:56,290
increased with the increasing fertilizer

483
00:19:53,829 --> 00:19:58,449
rate with one of them the what you call

484
00:19:56,289 --> 00:19:59,170
you to HP your yield rich reached a

485
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,549
maximum

486
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:03,670
and in the you to yield increased

487
00:20:00,549 --> 00:20:04,720
literally do you want to just touch on

488
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:05,710
that a little bit in terms of your

489
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,299
yields and I know you mentioned that

490
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:10,390
your yields were a little bit lower than

491
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:11,740
what you've seen as an industry standard

492
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:15,160
or what you were using for an industry

493
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:17,019
standard that's right so in terms of

494
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,910
that that kind of plateaued that we saw

495
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,119
in the dryer substrate and that's the

496
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:24,580
you to HP in general the yield was

497
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:28,329
higher so we believe that it was able to

498
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:30,220
reach a plateau and and so there was you

499
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:33,309
kind of see more of a maximum at that

500
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,660
point and we don't think that the the

501
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:38,799
letter substrate actually reached that

502
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:40,720
plateau so that is kind of how we or how

503
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,460
we explain that difference in the trend

504
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,460
with increasing fertilizer rate and on

505
00:20:45,509 --> 00:20:51,029
unyielding on pH to a little bit can you

506
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:54,189
talk a little bit about sort of your

507
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:57,329
what you noticed in terms of pH range

508
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:59,590
and how that might have affected yield

509
00:20:57,329 --> 00:21:03,399
off the top of my head I can't recall

510
00:20:59,589 --> 00:21:05,889
the ranges that we found were optimum

511
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:09,190
but we generally found that during both

512
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,820
growth growth stages that cannabis had a

513
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:13,840
fairly wide range of pH tolerances and

514
00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:16,599
we didn't character we didn't do

515
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:18,789
nutrient issue nutrient analysis to

516
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,349
quantify that but just being

517
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,970
horticultural scientists we have a

518
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:25,419
fairly general idea of when our plants

519
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:28,000
are are their nutrient deficient so

520
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,259
they're showing signs of high or low pH

521
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,970
and it's generally believed that you

522
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:35,859
want to keep cannabis a no play tight

523
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:37,269
range of pH especially with hydroponics

524
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:40,990
but we found that there was almost no

525
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:43,180
difference with a higher or lower pH

526
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,069
range quite a bit outside of the normal

527
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:46,600
range

528
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:50,559
yeah anecdotally I've found the same

529
00:21:46,599 --> 00:21:52,269
thing with a lot of a lot of different

530
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,609
soil tests that I've seen I've seen some

531
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:58,990
soil tests where the pH is quite high

532
00:21:54,609 --> 00:22:00,609
very alkaline and yet visually and with

533
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:03,099
with growers their yields are still

534
00:22:00,609 --> 00:22:07,879
quite good it seems to tolerate like you

535
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:10,219
mentioned quite a wide range of pH

536
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:12,080
in your paper here you say within the

537
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:13,819
measured range of substrate pH with a

538
00:22:12,079 --> 00:22:15,589
means of five point one to seven point

539
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:18,169
four in the flowering stage there were

540
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:20,990
no visual signs of pH induced disorders

541
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:24,140
this observation overlaps the acceptable

542
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:27,019
range cited in Caplan at all 2017 of six

543
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:30,980
point seven to seven point two for the

544
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:32,809
flowering stage yeah I'm glad you have

545
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,480
that in front of you yeah yeah so we

546
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,549
yeah we could get quite high in pH and

547
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,950
again there was no visible symptoms of

548
00:22:37,549 --> 00:22:41,000
nutrient disorders though I just thought

549
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,340
that was really interesting so I didn't

550
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,779
want to touch on that but I mean there's

551
00:22:43,339 --> 00:22:46,669
a lot more in these papers I know we're

552
00:22:44,779 --> 00:22:48,079
not gonna cover everything was there

553
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:49,820
anything else you want to talk about

554
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:51,799
those two before we move on to the other

555
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:53,869
two which I think are even more

556
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:57,529
interesting in terms of some of the

557
00:22:53,869 --> 00:23:00,819
results yeah well in the flowering stage

558
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,170
I just want to talk about how the

559
00:23:00,819 --> 00:23:05,839
increasing fertilizer rate influenced

560
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:07,279
some of the cannabinoids and so I

561
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:10,459
briefly touched on this in the beginning

562
00:23:07,279 --> 00:23:14,119
but it wasn't all the cannabinoids that

563
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:17,000
had a dilution effect with increasing

564
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:18,739
fertilizer and it was it's not a

565
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,660
dilution in terms of absolute

566
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:24,410
concentration in the flower but it's a

567
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:29,810
dilution in terms of the grams of THC or

568
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:32,600
THC a or CBG per plant so it's a

569
00:23:29,809 --> 00:23:34,940
function of yield and of concentration

570
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:36,259
and effectively if you're trying to you

571
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:39,110
know if your target is to produce as

572
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:42,349
much THC as THC as possible you have

573
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:44,869
decreasing returns if you are increasing

574
00:23:42,349 --> 00:23:46,579
your fertilizer rate passed the optimum

575
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:48,649
that we figured out and you'd have to

576
00:23:46,579 --> 00:23:49,819
figure out your own optimum in your

577
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,170
production environment but there's no

578
00:23:49,819 --> 00:23:53,629
benefit in terms even if you're in

579
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:55,670
seeing a little bit you know increasing

580
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:57,200
yields it's not always better to keep

581
00:23:55,670 --> 00:24:00,019
increasing the fertilizer rate because

582
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:03,890
you're not increasing your THC or your

583
00:24:00,019 --> 00:24:06,710
THC a or your CBG a that's really

584
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:09,500
interesting yeah and the fertilizer that

585
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,660
you used I don't have that part in front

586
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,369
of me right now I it's somewhere in all

587
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,990
these stack of papers but I think it was

588
00:24:13,369 --> 00:24:18,829
around like a four one two four one yeah

589
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:20,539
that's right

590
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:22,000
for the vegetative stage it was a four

591
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:24,950
one point

592
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:33,039
31.7 okay and then for the flowering

593
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:35,390
stage it was a 2.8 and sorry 20.8 3.2

594
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:38,539
that's that's really interesting because

595
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:42,770
I saw another gentleman with a

596
00:24:38,539 --> 00:24:45,319
fertilizer company at a small scientist

597
00:24:42,769 --> 00:24:47,000
convention or Society meeting and he was

598
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:51,169
saying for one one was the levels that

599
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:53,029
he targeted one thing that I found which

600
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:55,070
seems similar to the fertilizer you're

601
00:24:53,029 --> 00:24:57,950
using his potassium seems to be more of

602
00:24:55,069 --> 00:25:01,069
a controlling variable for overall plant

603
00:24:57,950 --> 00:25:02,600
yield than phosphorus because I know

604
00:25:01,069 --> 00:25:03,980
that in this industry everyone thinks we

605
00:25:02,599 --> 00:25:06,679
need more and more phosphorus for

606
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:09,559
flowering but it seems to be massively

607
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:12,470
over applied based on the research I've

608
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,990
I've seen I can you touch a little bit

609
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:16,190
about I know we thought we need to talk

610
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:18,140
about nitrogen too but let's talk about

611
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,549
phosphorus and potassium and sort of

612
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,390
what your findings are with cannabis yes

613
00:25:21,549 --> 00:25:26,149
I'm not a mother

614
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm not incredibly familiar with this

615
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:31,490
but in my kind of general impression is

616
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:34,250
that phosphorus is often over applied in

617
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:35,750
agriculture and that's because it

618
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:39,319
doesn't do all that much damage if you

619
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,549
over apply it but there's a certain you

620
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:43,399
know there's certain low range that

621
00:25:40,549 --> 00:25:44,930
you'd probably have equal equal results

622
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,070
with but I'd say if you were to double

623
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:47,990
or triple it you might have the same

624
00:25:46,069 --> 00:25:49,189
results and you know for a grower

625
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:50,480
doesn't make much of a difference but

626
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,870
for the environment for example

627
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,150
phosphorus is one of the most damaging

628
00:25:52,869 --> 00:25:57,889
components of fertilizer and so it

629
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:02,360
really does have some implications if

630
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:03,830
we're over utilizing phosphorus yeah

631
00:26:02,359 --> 00:26:05,419
that's a I'm glad you mentioned the

632
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,429
environmental impacts because to me

633
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:10,400
that's the that's the biggest reason for

634
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:12,230
us to limit phosphorus because we are

635
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,220
the cannabis industry is a big culprit

636
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:18,309
of that can we talk a little bit about

637
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:21,289
nitrogen because I asked you a question

638
00:26:18,309 --> 00:26:23,139
off air about how when you read these

639
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:25,389
papers it's all correlated around

640
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:27,820
nitrogen or and

641
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,050
per liter get in and you kind of

642
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,939
explained that to me a little bit

643
00:26:29,049 --> 00:26:35,829
further can you kind of reiterate that

644
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:39,880
for listeners yeah so in both of these

645
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:42,339
publications we express nitrogen in in

646
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,530
milligrams or we express fertilizer rate

647
00:26:42,339 --> 00:26:47,769
in milligrams of nitrogen per liter and

648
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:50,079
that's a common terminology in these

649
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:52,049
types of papers and it's basically just

650
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:54,669
if you you have to look back at the

651
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:56,349
analysis of the fertilizer and it's a

652
00:26:54,670 --> 00:26:58,450
relative amount of that fertilizer it

653
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:59,769
doesn't really have to do I'm not you're

654
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,440
not actively changing the amount of

655
00:26:59,769 --> 00:27:04,029
nitrogen in in the ratio it's just how

656
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:06,070
much of that how much total of that

657
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:07,509
fertilizer are you applying so it's

658
00:27:06,069 --> 00:27:10,029
important to keep that in mind and these

659
00:27:07,509 --> 00:27:12,099
papers are not about rates of nitrogen

660
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:14,500
there were about rates of organic

661
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:16,750
fertilizer and they're not about

662
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:19,380
identifying the type of nitrogen you're

663
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:21,670
not distinguishing between nitrates or

664
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:24,730
ammonia you're looking at that's

665
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:27,009
strictly total nitrogen you said that's

666
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:30,240
right but the ratios are available in

667
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:33,129
the publication of ammonium and nitrate

668
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,289
yes and then the other thing I noticed

669
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:39,270
when looking at that fertilizer mix it

670
00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:43,299
was quite low in trace trace minerals

671
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:45,309
the you know copper manganese right yeah

672
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:49,149
of those do you think that could have

673
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:51,639
had some sort of effect on the on the

674
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,730
trial itself or overall plant growth or

675
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:57,250
yield to my recollection we actually had

676
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:01,420
a micronutrient additive in both of

677
00:27:57,250 --> 00:28:02,950
these in all the fertilizers and I I

678
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,150
know for sure you had one in the

679
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:05,950
flowering one you might have been

680
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:09,490
vegetative and I just totally missed it

681
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:11,230
that's probably the likely culprit yeah

682
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:12,490
and even if it was if there wasn't one

683
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,410
in the flowering stage it was only a

684
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:17,170
period of maybe 20 days so it's very

685
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:18,759
unlikely to see micronutrient issues in

686
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:21,039
such a short period but in the flowering

687
00:28:18,759 --> 00:28:22,180
stage definitely it was necessary it

688
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:25,059
would have been necessary at least we

689
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:27,519
didn't try without it but just based on

690
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:29,230
experiences like you necessary so we

691
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,450
could do further there's plenty of

692
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:35,009
further research to do in general but

693
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:38,210
but around like optimal NPK levels

694
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:42,650
optimal fertilizer concentrations

695
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:45,620
various substrates and optimal trace

696
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,720
mineral levels that you know for for

697
00:28:45,619 --> 00:28:49,849
cannabis yeah

698
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,380
oh there's honestly so much to be done

699
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:54,709
I'm very interested in looking at the

700
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:56,480
different NPK ratios and looking at

701
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:59,990
people you know actually teasing out

702
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,630
ideal pH ranges and substrate salinity

703
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:06,470
levels is really important you know

704
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:08,570
irrigation all that and and keeping it's

705
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:10,009
really important again to reiterate it's

706
00:29:08,569 --> 00:29:12,889
important to keep in mind that it's kind

707
00:29:10,009 --> 00:29:14,269
of a whole system's approach where you

708
00:29:12,890 --> 00:29:16,190
have to if you change your fertilizer

709
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:19,579
you also have to adjust your irrigation

710
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:21,650
and your growing medium and your your

711
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:23,359
lighting and the vapor pressure deficits

712
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:24,800
in the environment and the co2 and

713
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:27,259
everything has to kind of be understood

714
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:28,609
as a whole and if you do portray the

715
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,289
research in a way where you're

716
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:32,539
expressing all those things it's easier

717
00:29:30,289 --> 00:29:35,210
to take that information and apply it

718
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:36,740
elsewhere that's a really really good

719
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:39,500
point yeah I'm glad you mentioned that

720
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:41,779
and this is a little bit of a sidebar

721
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:43,160
but I just want to remind listeners that

722
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:46,730
there's there are people out there that

723
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,170
claim they know you know the optimal

724
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:49,730
amount of manganese a cannabis plant

725
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:52,910
needs or the optimal amount of zaker

726
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:54,319
or all of these different all these

727
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,570
different minerals but really the

728
00:29:54,319 --> 00:29:58,009
research just hasn't been done and so if

729
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:59,809
they're that confident I would be a

730
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:01,490
little bit concerned about about what

731
00:29:59,809 --> 00:30:03,710
they're actually saying or sharing

732
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:05,779
because I know you didn't know quite a

733
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,370
bit of research trying to find research

734
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:10,700
and they're just it just doesn't exist

735
00:30:07,369 --> 00:30:12,729
so I would just caution listeners around

736
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,309
in that regard when people make

737
00:30:12,730 --> 00:30:18,470
conclusive comments regarding this crop

738
00:30:16,309 --> 00:30:19,879
or this plan yeah that's really

739
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:21,890
important and that's the number one

740
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,860
issue I run into working with growers

741
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:27,590
like I do now so it's just for context

742
00:30:24,859 --> 00:30:29,000
these two publications were there put a

743
00:30:27,589 --> 00:30:32,629
couple years ago they were the first

744
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:35,329
publications on fertilizer rage and you

745
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:38,200
know in indoor cannabis pretty much ever

746
00:30:35,329 --> 00:30:42,379
so there's really nothing out there

747
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,779
that's you know in my opinion of any

748
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:47,360
validity other than these and whatever

749
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:48,740
comes next and for for fertilizer

750
00:30:47,359 --> 00:30:50,089
companies to be basing their claims off

751
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:52,009
of unless they're doing really rigorous

752
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:54,740
R&amp;D

753
00:30:52,009 --> 00:30:56,329
yeah which is possible and and there are

754
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,950
people doing research and a lot of it

755
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:00,949
they'll just claim as proprietary and

756
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,500
not share it but most likely at least

757
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,509
what I've seen in the fertilizer bottle

758
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:08,329
nutrient industry around cannabis is a

759
00:31:05,509 --> 00:31:10,609
lot of it is just speculation and claims

760
00:31:08,329 --> 00:31:13,369
and snake oil versus actual science to

761
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:15,319
support what they're doing and I'd love

762
00:31:13,369 --> 00:31:17,509
to talk to you about that as well after

763
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:18,829
the fact because in my current position

764
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:21,679
I'm working with

765
00:31:18,829 --> 00:31:24,199
Hawthorn gardening company which now

766
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:27,669
which is acquired general hydroponics

767
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,600
and botanic air all sorts of other

768
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:32,900
companies that service the cannabis

769
00:31:29,599 --> 00:31:34,548
industry and my role is going to be to

770
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:36,410
do exactly what we're talking about and

771
00:31:34,548 --> 00:31:37,849
try and figure out what makes these

772
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,610
products work how can we make them

773
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:42,199
better and how can we develop new

774
00:31:40,609 --> 00:31:45,769
products that are based off of good

775
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:46,940
science rather than just claims well why

776
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:49,099
don't we just touch on that now and then

777
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,440
come back to these last two papers you

778
00:31:49,099 --> 00:31:53,779
mentioned at Hawthorn you know they are

779
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:58,340
they I believe they're a subsidiary of

780
00:31:53,779 --> 00:32:00,109
Monsanto now of Scots yes I apologize

781
00:31:58,339 --> 00:32:01,129
you're right of Scots no association

782
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:03,500
with mums

783
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,080
that's true i yeah you're you're 100%

784
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,839
correct on that I apologize

785
00:32:05,079 --> 00:32:10,819
well they do sell they do sell Monsanto

786
00:32:08,839 --> 00:32:13,490
products right so there is a partnership

787
00:32:10,819 --> 00:32:15,619
there but not yeah they have a license

788
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,019
for Roundup I believe yeah for the

789
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:19,819
glyphosate yes okay so I'm glad we rated

790
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:21,769
that but when we're talking about these

791
00:32:19,819 --> 00:32:24,649
companies that are coming into the

792
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:28,069
cannabis industry like like Scott's yeah

793
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:29,750
and funding around research in terms of

794
00:32:28,069 --> 00:32:31,250
who can afford funding how do you see

795
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,769
you know one of the questions I had for

796
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,210
you that I mentioned off air was what do

797
00:32:33,769 --> 00:32:37,369
you see is the future of academic

798
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:39,048
research with cannabis is funding going

799
00:32:37,369 --> 00:32:41,079
to be an issue and who's going to drive

800
00:32:39,048 --> 00:32:43,730
really that funding once you have

801
00:32:41,079 --> 00:32:45,558
legalization both here on the federal

802
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:49,130
level both here in the United States and

803
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:50,839
in Canada yeah you know it's a very

804
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,150
exciting time for research in cannabis

805
00:32:50,839 --> 00:32:56,389
in my personal opinion I've never found

806
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:58,970
there to be limitations on funding in

807
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:01,940
Canada specifically on academic research

808
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,259
for cannabis we have lots of working

809
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:06,279
with the University of Guelph we had

810
00:33:03,259 --> 00:33:08,289
lots of growers approached us and also

811
00:33:06,279 --> 00:33:11,319
vendors of specific products that want

812
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:12,759
to prove their claims and coming to

813
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:14,950
university is a really great way of

814
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:16,599
doing that and supporting a graduate

815
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:19,269
student or supporting some independent

816
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:21,669
research to be able to actually you know

817
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,069
make the claims on your bottle or on

818
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:26,230
your container make them mean something

819
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,428
and so that's happening a lot and I

820
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:31,210
think there's a lot of potential for

821
00:33:27,429 --> 00:33:33,519
both both companies and for academic

822
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:34,960
researchers to to bring some validity to

823
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,679
some of these products and some of these

824
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,990
claims and there's a lot of work to be

825
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:44,620
done and it seems to be happening so I

826
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:47,440
know that Scott's in acquiring all these

827
00:33:44,619 --> 00:33:49,389
companies they you know they're a

828
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,140
company that that backs all of their

829
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:53,950
claims and you know that's a very

830
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,000
established company and if they're going

831
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:56,289
to say something on their bottle they

832
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,859
have to they have to be able to

833
00:33:56,289 --> 00:34:02,409
substantiate it and so now we're doing

834
00:33:59,859 --> 00:34:03,729
that work for all of these these

835
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,019
products they're being marketed to the

836
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:08,050
cannabis industry and so we're gonna

837
00:34:05,019 --> 00:34:10,179
have that kind of like level of rigor in

838
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:15,970
in the products that are being sold by

839
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:17,289
Hawthorne okay and just to be totally

840
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:20,199
transparent here as someone who's not a

841
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:22,690
huge fan of some of these larger

842
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,569
companies you know like Scott's and

843
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:28,450
Hawthorne in terms of their role in the

844
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:30,609
industry which is separate from the

845
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:31,809
quality of their products or the

846
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:35,378
research they're doing I want to make

847
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:38,710
that very clear I'm not a huge fan of

848
00:34:35,378 --> 00:34:43,210
glyphosate for one but if we're talking

849
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:46,809
about if we're talking about university

850
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:49,809
research around products and let's just

851
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:52,449
take you know a general hydro grow

852
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:54,009
formula for example I think it's awesome

853
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:56,648
that research is being done to improve

854
00:34:54,010 --> 00:35:01,119
the quality of that product how do you

855
00:34:56,648 --> 00:35:03,368
other companies compete and not be run

856
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,200
out of the industry assuming that they

857
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:06,640
can't afford you know the hundreds of

858
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:12,339
thousands of dollars that may go into

859
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:14,319
setting up a university trial so there's

860
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:17,320
various ways you can do it you know if

861
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:19,840
you if you hire a scientist on your team

862
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:21,940
who's you know a well-respected

863
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,320
horticultural scientists to do trials on

864
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:26,349
your product and you can produce white

865
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:29,200
papers or even publications yourself and

866
00:35:26,349 --> 00:35:31,779
prove that they're valid then that's

867
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:33,969
just as good there's definitely an edge

868
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:35,920
and having you know we have a 40,000

869
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:39,159
square foot purpose-built research

870
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,680
facility with dozens of grow rooms and

871
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:44,170
you know all these resources which you

872
00:35:41,679 --> 00:35:45,730
know in in our purposes and for Hawthorn

873
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:49,360
and for flower which is the company that

874
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:51,039
I actually work for you know there's

875
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,450
obviously an edge and we're gonna be

876
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,769
able to answer these questions faster

877
00:35:52,449 --> 00:35:55,750
but it doesn't mean that it's impossible

878
00:35:53,769 --> 00:35:57,610
for some of the smaller players to be

879
00:35:55,750 --> 00:36:00,429
able to do the same work to the same

880
00:35:57,610 --> 00:36:01,720
rigor I think that's a really good point

881
00:36:00,429 --> 00:36:03,719
so there's no there's nothing to stop

882
00:36:01,719 --> 00:36:05,859
other people from doing you know

883
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:07,809
research collection or data collection

884
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:09,910
their own research I mean we're doing

885
00:36:07,809 --> 00:36:13,659
our own research down and gold leaf

886
00:36:09,909 --> 00:36:14,859
through through that facility but you're

887
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:19,179
told you're totally right about that and

888
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:21,519
I think well I just I think it's great

889
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:23,409
that there is more research and you know

890
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,789
where that money's coming from can be a

891
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:26,500
little bit challenging for people but

892
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:29,079
the end of the day like as long as that

893
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:31,090
research is published it becomes useful

894
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:32,980
information that everyone can kind of

895
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:34,480
draw from draw from and improve our

896
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:37,300
overall body of knowledge around this

897
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:39,490
plant do you see all the research though

898
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:42,010
being published on the sorts of work

899
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:46,029
they at least what you're doing there in

900
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:48,610
Canada yeah there's definitely gonna be

901
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:49,900
some some of Italy released a lot of it

902
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,430
will be kind of for the technical

903
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,470
service reps to be able to inform the

904
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:55,179
the people that were selling to or the

905
00:36:53,469 --> 00:36:56,379
Hawthorn is selling to you know what

906
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,259
they're using and how to use it

907
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,670
but right now it's you know we haven't

908
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:03,310
we haven't been any of this work yet

909
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:05,019
still coming up but there's definitely

910
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:07,659
plans to be to put some of this out and

911
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:09,219
to do some peer-reviewed peer-reviewed

912
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,409
publications and really to increase the

913
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:13,209
body of knowledge because it you know in

914
00:37:11,409 --> 00:37:14,559
my in my opinion if you if you have

915
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,420
these resources it's kind of a

916
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:18,730
responsibility to be increasing the body

917
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:22,360
of knowledge for everyone not just you

918
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:23,860
know making claims on bottles so would

919
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:27,010
you say as a scientist you're more of

920
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:29,920
like I guess um I don't know a product

921
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:32,079
atheist in the sense that you're you're

922
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:34,329
most interested in just furthering

923
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:35,679
the amount of research and knowledge in

924
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:38,709
the industry around around this

925
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,239
particular crop and and Hawthorne is

926
00:37:38,708 --> 00:37:41,678
able to provide you with a level of

927
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:44,949
funding that allows you to do that

928
00:37:41,679 --> 00:37:46,900
research yeah let me clarify my position

929
00:37:44,949 --> 00:37:48,188
and with the the Hawthorn flower and

930
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,079
everything like that so i'm i'm the

931
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:51,938
director of plant science at flower

932
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,119
which is a licensed cannabis producer

933
00:37:51,938 --> 00:37:56,978
and basically Hawthorn has partnered

934
00:37:55,119 --> 00:37:59,439
with flower to build this facility so

935
00:37:56,978 --> 00:38:02,798
we're experts in facility building

936
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:04,659
management cultivation specifically for

937
00:38:02,798 --> 00:38:08,708
cannabis and we're probably the foremost

938
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:11,348
experts in the world in that area so my

939
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:13,389
specific role is not necessarily to to

940
00:38:11,349 --> 00:38:16,028
be doing the the Holford research but to

941
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:16,838
ensure that everything like to work with

942
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:19,088
them to make sure everything they're

943
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:22,208
doing makes sense for in terms of

944
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:23,920
cannabis and not just you know not moms

945
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,768
or ornamental is that maybe they've done

946
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,489
research with before and so yeah so I'm

947
00:38:26,768 --> 00:38:32,018
not I'm not stuck with any products or

948
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:33,938
anything that I just want to make sure

949
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:37,508
that science is being done well and that

950
00:38:33,938 --> 00:38:38,949
it's you know widely applicable and that

951
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:41,438
people can actually gain something from

952
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,880
all of this yeah for sure please don't

953
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:44,498
take my comments is trying to give you a

954
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,939
hard time about any of this I don't know

955
00:38:44,498 --> 00:38:49,958
I'm not okay well cool I'm glad we I'm

956
00:38:48,938 --> 00:38:51,759
glad we touched on that because I think

957
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:53,409
that's important and I think that's

958
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:55,208
something this is a little bit of a

959
00:38:53,409 --> 00:38:56,678
tangent but when we look at research and

960
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:58,419
how its funded I think that's something

961
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:59,949
that you should always consider to when

962
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:01,959
you're looking at research is who's

963
00:38:59,949 --> 00:39:05,679
paying for that study and why are they

964
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:07,598
doing that can sometimes create a little

965
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,429
bit of bias around results but at the

966
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:10,809
end of the day it's still more useful to

967
00:39:09,429 --> 00:39:13,420
have that information out there and have

968
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:15,880
something be peer reviewed I think is

969
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:18,309
really important yeah I agree

970
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,199
so alright let's dive into these other

971
00:39:18,309 --> 00:39:21,339
papers that I'm actually really excited

972
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:24,759
to talk about do you want to do the

973
00:39:21,338 --> 00:39:27,369
propagation one or the the stress

974
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:31,509
testing that you did let's talk

975
00:39:27,369 --> 00:39:33,568
propagation first cool okay well you

976
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:35,978
want to just give me the some of the

977
00:39:33,568 --> 00:39:37,478
what she set up with this trial and and

978
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:40,478
what some of the highlights were kind of

979
00:39:37,478 --> 00:39:42,009
abstract yeah so so this trial came

980
00:39:40,478 --> 00:39:44,379
about basically you know working with

981
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:45,610
vivo and working with other cannabis

982
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:47,920
producers and observe

983
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,360
some of the horticultural practices that

984
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,680
they were doing as we were doing other

985
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,940
research you know we're working on the

986
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:55,149
fertilizer stuff and working on the

987
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:57,550
growing media work we found that some

988
00:39:55,150 --> 00:40:01,539
things maybe didn't make sense to us as

989
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:02,920
a horticultural scientists and just with

990
00:40:01,539 --> 00:40:05,230
you know basically understandings in

991
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:08,650
plant physiology and propagation for

992
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:10,389
example is and what with this paper we

993
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:12,010
looked at propagation so we found some

994
00:40:10,389 --> 00:40:14,109
interesting practices

995
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:16,270
one of those was that growers are often

996
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:18,010
cutting the tips of their of the leaves

997
00:40:16,269 --> 00:40:21,519
off of their clones before they're

998
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:22,900
cloning them we also found that there

999
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,849
was a lot of kind of widely held

1000
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,220
strongly held beliefs that you had to

1001
00:40:24,849 --> 00:40:31,630
take cuts from a certain area of the

1002
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:33,129
plant and we just wanted to kind of you

1003
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:34,960
know test it out and see what's right

1004
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:38,170
because a lot of these growers have been

1005
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,970
doing it for decades and they're their

1006
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:42,300
knowledge is incredibly incredibly

1007
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:44,169
valuable especially in the absence of

1008
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,670
what the literature there's no

1009
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:49,180
literature so we really have nothing to

1010
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:51,099
base to base our horticultural knowledge

1011
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:53,649
on so we wanted to kind of tease apart

1012
00:40:51,099 --> 00:40:56,679
some of these factors that growers were

1013
00:40:53,650 --> 00:41:00,910
regular regularly choosing to go with

1014
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:04,569
and so we did a fairly large trial on

1015
00:41:00,909 --> 00:41:07,049
how to improve the success and quality

1016
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:09,820
of cannabis stem cuttings or clones

1017
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:12,220
looking at four factors we looked at the

1018
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:14,380
number of leaves on the plant on the

1019
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:17,019
cutting we looked at whether the tips of

1020
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:19,210
the leaves were removed or not and we

1021
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:20,559
also looked at the position of the

1022
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,360
cuttings so are they're from the top or

1023
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:24,369
the bottom of the plant the apical or

1024
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:26,050
the basal region and we looked at two

1025
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:28,239
rooting hormones one was an organic

1026
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:32,610
willow based extract and one was a

1027
00:41:28,239 --> 00:41:34,989
traditional IBA rooting hormone yeah

1028
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:36,640
great so what did you find and when you

1029
00:41:34,989 --> 00:41:38,500
say the cutting the tips of the leaves

1030
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:42,609
you're talking about you define that as

1031
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:44,619
removing 30% of the of the leaf from the

1032
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:46,150
outside most growers are going to know

1033
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:47,739
exactly we were talking about cuz I mean

1034
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:49,150
it's something I did the very first time

1035
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:51,759
I cloned because I was told that's what

1036
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:55,539
you were supposed to do exactly yeah

1037
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,710
yeah what did you find with this so I'll

1038
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:59,469
start off with the most interesting

1039
00:41:56,710 --> 00:42:01,570
finding basically we found that cut

1040
00:41:59,469 --> 00:42:04,089
the tips of the leaves in pretty much

1041
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:08,500
every situation reduced routing success

1042
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:10,510
by about 20% and as a as a plant

1043
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,489
scientist it makes sense here you're

1044
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:13,930
damaging the plant you're causing a

1045
00:42:12,489 --> 00:42:17,608
wound and you're reducing the

1046
00:42:13,929 --> 00:42:22,269
photosynthetic area in a way that's

1047
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:23,920
that's also that's also think you could

1048
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:26,320
decrease the the area the number of

1049
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:28,059
leaves which is has the same effect of

1050
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,380
removing the tips of the leaves if

1051
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:31,509
you're just looking at leaf area but

1052
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:34,030
you're causing a wound as well so it

1053
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,619
kind of made sense and it was really

1054
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:36,580
interesting and you know we've talked a

1055
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,050
lot of growers and they've already

1056
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:40,329
change their practices based on this

1057
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:42,820
publication so I was really really happy

1058
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:45,519
to find that some of the other findings

1059
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:48,609
are also interesting we found that in

1060
00:42:45,519 --> 00:42:50,230
terms of rooting qualities so not just

1061
00:42:48,608 --> 00:42:52,059
if they root it or not but kind of how

1062
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:55,000
many roots the plants produce after they

1063
00:42:52,059 --> 00:42:58,599
rooted we found that two leaves had

1064
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:00,280
quite a bit higher rooting quality than

1065
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:04,059
sorry three leaves had higher rooting

1066
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:06,730
quality than two we also found that the

1067
00:43:04,059 --> 00:43:08,409
ivy a based rooting hormone drastically

1068
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:10,690
increased their rooting success which we

1069
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:12,730
kind of expected but that doesn't mean

1070
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,990
that there's not an organic alternative

1071
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,639
it just means that this specific project

1072
00:43:13,989 --> 00:43:19,838
product didn't didn't work very well and

1073
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:23,559
yeah the biggest finding there was the

1074
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:25,358
the cutting of leaf tips yeah that's a

1075
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:27,279
huge one so the way it was described to

1076
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:29,588
me was you want to cut the leaf tips off

1077
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,170
because you want the plant to focus its

1078
00:43:29,588 --> 00:43:35,949
energy on rooting not so much on

1079
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:37,240
photosynthesis and and trying to grow so

1080
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:40,210
that's that was why you're supposed to

1081
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:42,279
do it yeah but what but what you're what

1082
00:43:40,210 --> 00:43:45,608
you're saying is you do not science

1083
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:49,420
shows based on this study do not cut the

1084
00:43:45,608 --> 00:43:51,369
leaf tips that's right so there's two

1085
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,500
there was two reasons that I've heard

1086
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:54,910
for for doing for this practice the

1087
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,369
first is exactly what you just said is

1088
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:59,529
focusing the energy if plants don't

1089
00:43:57,369 --> 00:44:01,150
focus energy that's not really how

1090
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:02,470
plants work and but I've heard that a

1091
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,690
lot the other one that makes a lot more

1092
00:44:02,469 --> 00:44:08,199
sense is just reducing clutter in the

1093
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:09,820
propagation environment so if you're

1094
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:11,409
growing in a dome if you're if you're

1095
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:13,420
rooting in it under a dome of high

1096
00:44:11,409 --> 00:44:15,969
density that's using a rock loss

1097
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:17,680
for example then you're going to run

1098
00:44:15,969 --> 00:44:20,289
into issues with dancing off and and

1099
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:22,809
root pathogens and if the leaves are

1100
00:44:20,289 --> 00:44:24,880
really congested and shading each other

1101
00:44:22,809 --> 00:44:26,619
or touching each other then it's more

1102
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,369
likely that you're going to proliferate

1103
00:44:26,619 --> 00:44:32,739
these root pathogens and so reducing the

1104
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:38,049
leaf area makes a lot of sense in that

1105
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:40,419
situation but if you have fewer leaves

1106
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:43,060
we found that you don't have a lower

1107
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:44,829
rooting success rate you'll just have a

1108
00:44:43,059 --> 00:44:46,360
slightly lower root quality so that's

1109
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:49,059
kind of the way to mitigate that problem

1110
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:50,829
is just to have fewer leaves instead of

1111
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:54,009
actually damaging the roots because then

1112
00:44:50,829 --> 00:44:55,869
your even your opening wounds to let the

1113
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:59,350
pathogens in and it's a whole other

1114
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:01,869
situation so it's better to remove an

1115
00:44:59,349 --> 00:45:04,299
entire leaf than it is to cut the leaf

1116
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:06,730
tips if you need to reduce it and then

1117
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:08,200
you didn't really touch on humidity that

1118
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:09,789
was the other thing the other reason I

1119
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:12,099
heard now that you kind of reminded me

1120
00:45:09,789 --> 00:45:13,929
was that it'll reduce the amount of you

1121
00:45:12,099 --> 00:45:17,860
know transpiration and humidity under

1122
00:45:13,929 --> 00:45:18,940
that dome situation yeah so when you're

1123
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:21,010
when you're taking cuttings they don't

1124
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,320
have any roots so if with vegetative

1125
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,500
stem cuttings literally all the moisture

1126
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,050
to keep those plants from wilting is

1127
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:30,730
coming from the environment and so you

1128
00:45:29,050 --> 00:45:32,519
do want to maintain very high levels of

1129
00:45:30,730 --> 00:45:35,079
humidity but with that humidity comes

1130
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:35,980
higher instances of root pathogens

1131
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:39,009
because they also like that high

1132
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,030
humidity so you just want it to be you

1133
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:43,510
want to be humid with good air

1134
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:45,070
circulation and you don't want the the

1135
00:45:43,510 --> 00:45:46,570
plants to kind of be touching solid

1136
00:45:45,070 --> 00:45:49,140
surfaces or touching each other because

1137
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:51,070
then you have these pockets of

1138
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:53,170
condensation on the leaves and that's

1139
00:45:51,070 --> 00:45:57,280
really the worst situation for for root

1140
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:59,800
pathogens so maybe we need to design our

1141
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:03,390
propagation spaces to be a little bit

1142
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:05,320
better spacing in between the clones

1143
00:46:03,389 --> 00:46:08,099
rather than that's right

1144
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:10,750
other other options for controlling that

1145
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:13,420
yeah so that's what I've seen a lot of

1146
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:14,889
growers and move towards that in just

1147
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,220
spacing out they're clones more but then

1148
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:20,500
you need you know 2 or 3 times larger

1149
00:46:18,219 --> 00:46:22,719
propagation environment so what I've

1150
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:25,090
been working towards the flower which I

1151
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:27,250
can't discuss too in too much detail but

1152
00:46:25,090 --> 00:46:29,200
it's just ways of

1153
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:30,280
mitigating control in the environment

1154
00:46:29,199 --> 00:46:31,809
such that you can have those high

1155
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:35,170
densities and still produce very high

1156
00:46:31,809 --> 00:46:36,279
quality cuts and all you have to do is

1157
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:39,430
you know control the environment a

1158
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:42,099
little bit now from an organic

1159
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:45,239
perspective what do you think about the

1160
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:48,220
possibility of testing other types of

1161
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:50,019
organic rooting hormones things like

1162
00:46:48,219 --> 00:46:54,189
what would I be found naturally in kelp

1163
00:46:50,019 --> 00:46:55,869
or I know people use a lot of micro

1164
00:46:54,190 --> 00:46:59,170
eyes'll fungus which I'm not convinced

1165
00:46:55,869 --> 00:47:02,530
makes any difference on a in a cloning

1166
00:46:59,170 --> 00:47:04,119
situation but I know some people have

1167
00:47:02,530 --> 00:47:05,560
made claims around that I'd be curious

1168
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:07,840
to hear your opinions around micro

1169
00:47:05,559 --> 00:47:09,039
eyes'll fungus and then aloe is another

1170
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,530
one that I've seen a lot of people

1171
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,659
moving towards with cloning can you talk

1172
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:15,280
about any of those as options for at

1173
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:18,489
least some some new research or anything

1174
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,320
you know about them so all I can say is

1175
00:47:18,489 --> 00:47:24,579
that I didn't find anything in the

1176
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:26,080
literature to suggest any other organic

1177
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:27,819
alternative rooting hormones that

1178
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:29,799
actually work and obviously don't work

1179
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,210
because especially with organic just

1180
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,099
like we talked about previously that

1181
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:35,679
there's very hard to research on that so

1182
00:47:33,099 --> 00:47:38,440
often people will just find a product

1183
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,629
their practice and it'll work and those

1184
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:44,710
continue doing it and you know that kind

1185
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:46,510
of gets overseen by the by by scientists

1186
00:47:44,710 --> 00:47:49,179
so there's probably something that works

1187
00:47:46,510 --> 00:47:52,869
I haven't seen anything else that that

1188
00:47:49,179 --> 00:47:56,259
works anywhere near as well as as a an

1189
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:59,050
oxen based burning hormone but I would

1190
00:47:56,260 --> 00:48:01,780
love to see it if someone if someone

1191
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:03,640
figures something out so we need further

1192
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:05,349
research on that sort of thing is

1193
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:08,108
essentially where we loaded first for

1194
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:09,940
sure yeah cool well any other highlights

1195
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:11,469
from the the propagation one I know we

1196
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:12,639
didn't touch on it for very long but I

1197
00:48:11,469 --> 00:48:14,980
think you really nailed all the big

1198
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:18,129
points there was anything else you

1199
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:19,929
wanted to highlight from that um the one

1200
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:22,900
one small point that I didn't touch on

1201
00:48:19,929 --> 00:48:24,730
was that there was no difference in in

1202
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,920
rooting success or route quality from

1203
00:48:24,730 --> 00:48:28,570
based on where you took your cuttings so

1204
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,059
from the apical region of the basal

1205
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:32,559
region to the top or the bottom and

1206
00:48:30,059 --> 00:48:34,299
that's really interesting because again

1207
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,588
that's a commonly held belief that

1208
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:39,250
taking cuttings from the top of the

1209
00:48:35,588 --> 00:48:40,779
plant will give you a better rooting

1210
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,340
success and that's that

1211
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,890
actually found it on something in other

1212
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,780
plants that is the case but in this

1213
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:49,869
situation to play was not the case for

1214
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:52,000
cannabis that is really interesting you

1215
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:53,619
know one other thing I want to touch on

1216
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,139
to that you mentioned is and this is a

1217
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,639
quote from the paper cuttings from

1218
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:59,769
juvenile plants generally have improved

1219
00:48:57,639 --> 00:49:03,190
rooting over those from mature plants

1220
00:48:59,769 --> 00:49:05,050
Altamura in 1996 and juvenile plant

1221
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:07,269
materials sometimes has a higher content

1222
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:09,160
of endogenous auxins and other rooting

1223
00:49:07,269 --> 00:49:11,739
promoters compared with mature material

1224
00:49:09,159 --> 00:49:15,730
and you quoted houston and pal 2006 on

1225
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:18,429
that yeah that's basically what it's

1226
00:49:15,730 --> 00:49:21,219
like what I said so other plants have

1227
00:49:18,429 --> 00:49:24,219
more distinct mature and juvenile

1228
00:49:21,219 --> 00:49:29,169
regions that have again more distinct

1229
00:49:24,219 --> 00:49:30,819
levels of hormones such as auxins that

1230
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,400
will influence the way that they root

1231
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:36,610
when you when you take stem cuttings

1232
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,349
from them so again that didn't appear to

1233
00:49:36,610 --> 00:49:40,870
be the case with cannabis but it is a

1234
00:49:38,349 --> 00:49:44,860
case with other plants so do you think

1235
00:49:40,869 --> 00:49:47,460
that there might be a case for keeping

1236
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:50,500
other plants for shorter amounts of time

1237
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:52,210
based on any research that you've done

1238
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:54,639
in terms of you know keeping a mother

1239
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:57,849
plant for six months versus changing out

1240
00:49:54,639 --> 00:50:01,269
your mother plants more frequently any

1241
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:03,150
thoughts on that I'm based on my

1242
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:05,710
research nothing now I haven't seen any

1243
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:08,889
preference either way out like from

1244
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:10,090
experience there is a definitely a

1245
00:50:08,889 --> 00:50:11,819
difference that your if you're working

1246
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,920
with a two three year old mother plant

1247
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:16,420
there there always if there appears to

1248
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:18,099
be difference but the reason for that

1249
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:21,700
I'm really not sure I'm not sure if

1250
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:22,900
there's some kind of you know genetic

1251
00:50:21,699 --> 00:50:26,019
reason or if you just have you know

1252
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,880
increased viral load in in the plants or

1253
00:50:26,019 --> 00:50:29,590
the plants just have these kind of

1254
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,930
accumulated levels of stress which

1255
00:50:29,590 --> 00:50:33,370
changes some of the hormone levels

1256
00:50:30,929 --> 00:50:35,289
there's that's another research question

1257
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:37,569
to be honest okay great

1258
00:50:35,289 --> 00:50:39,340
well let's talk about this paper that

1259
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:41,410
I'm probably most excited about I mean

1260
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:44,980
they're all really really great and

1261
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:47,679
interesting but you know stress is such

1262
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:49,389
an stress response is just such a

1263
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:51,909
fascinating topic when it comes to

1264
00:50:49,389 --> 00:50:53,559
cannabis do you wanna talk a little

1265
00:50:51,909 --> 00:50:54,659
about the the trial that you set up or

1266
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:58,219
the study you

1267
00:50:54,659 --> 00:51:00,480
you worked on here sure yeah so

1268
00:50:58,219 --> 00:51:01,709
basically it's it's pretty well

1269
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:04,409
documented in the literature that

1270
00:51:01,710 --> 00:51:06,480
drought stress specifically is a major

1271
00:51:04,409 --> 00:51:09,719
stimulator of secondary metabolites in

1272
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,030
plants and so a recognizable example of

1273
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:14,399
this is in herbs and spices that are

1274
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:16,440
grown in regions like the Mediterranean

1275
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,170
that are semi-arid so they have

1276
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:23,420
intermittent drought stress and lots of

1277
00:51:19,170 --> 00:51:25,889
sunlight and those factors are linked to

1278
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:28,769
more aromatic herbs and abundant

1279
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:30,559
essential oil in the literature we

1280
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:32,759
didn't find obviously anything on

1281
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,570
drought-stressed cannabis because it was

1282
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:39,090
again nothing but we wanted to see if we

1283
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:41,760
could apply apply a controlled level of

1284
00:51:39,090 --> 00:51:45,660
drug stress to cannabis and see if we

1285
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:47,430
can elicit some some positive response

1286
00:51:45,659 --> 00:51:51,139
in terms of cannabinoid content in the

1287
00:51:47,429 --> 00:51:53,369
in the dry flour or terpene content

1288
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:56,639
that's the general gist of what we

1289
00:51:53,369 --> 00:51:59,569
wanted to do okay and then so how did

1290
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:02,699
you determine the parameters of this

1291
00:51:59,570 --> 00:52:04,830
because one of the things he touched on

1292
00:52:02,699 --> 00:52:07,309
is how drought stress timing is also

1293
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:10,650
really important in terms of minimizing

1294
00:52:07,309 --> 00:52:12,299
yield or dry weight loss and maximizing

1295
00:52:10,650 --> 00:52:15,030
your essential oil yield and

1296
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:17,789
concentrated these metabolites how did

1297
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:22,070
you come up with the you know rates that

1298
00:52:17,789 --> 00:52:26,909
you did yes drug stress is an incredibly

1299
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:29,130
complicated complicated stress to apply

1300
00:52:26,909 --> 00:52:31,079
as I found in doing this research so

1301
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:33,269
there's a lot of ways you can applied

1302
00:52:31,079 --> 00:52:35,699
your out stress and I'll talk about the

1303
00:52:33,269 --> 00:52:39,000
timing as well but in terms of just just

1304
00:52:35,699 --> 00:52:40,319
application of drug stress you you want

1305
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:42,239
to reach a certain level you want to

1306
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:42,840
quantify stress which is a difficult

1307
00:52:42,239 --> 00:52:45,119
thing to do

1308
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:47,010
and you can also apply the stress in

1309
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:48,659
different ways so you can like you were

1310
00:52:47,010 --> 00:52:50,520
saying you can control the moisture

1311
00:52:48,659 --> 00:52:51,480
content like the project that you're

1312
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:53,940
working on you control the moisture

1313
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:56,639
content to a certain level and just

1314
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,019
maintain it at that certain level and so

1315
00:52:56,639 --> 00:53:00,449
that's one way of applying trout stress

1316
00:52:58,019 --> 00:53:03,210
the other way is growing your plants in

1317
00:53:00,449 --> 00:53:05,489
a solution that has a very high level of

1318
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:06,900
salts and that that mimics drought

1319
00:53:05,489 --> 00:53:08,489
stress because the plants can't actually

1320
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,590
uptake water

1321
00:53:08,489 --> 00:53:14,789
but if you're trying to replicate how

1322
00:53:10,590 --> 00:53:17,160
drought stress is I know happened in

1323
00:53:14,789 --> 00:53:20,130
nature it's true gradual substrate

1324
00:53:17,159 --> 00:53:21,779
drying so the soil for example would dry

1325
00:53:20,130 --> 00:53:22,910
to a certain point over time and the

1326
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:25,560
plant would experience stress

1327
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:27,179
incrementally over that periods with you

1328
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:28,259
know experiencing starting with very

1329
00:53:27,179 --> 00:53:30,029
little stress and then more and more

1330
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:32,460
stress until eventually the plants re

1331
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:37,410
watered and so that's what we wanted to

1332
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:40,139
mimic and in terms of the timing we

1333
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:42,480
forget you know again the preliminary

1334
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:44,309
trial it's the first of its kind so we

1335
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,340
wanted to do you know one treatment that

1336
00:53:44,309 --> 00:53:48,920
we thought would have the most effect so

1337
00:53:47,340 --> 00:53:50,940
we looked at when in general

1338
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:53,519
cannabinoids you know how they

1339
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:56,880
accumulate over time and we picked the

1340
00:53:53,519 --> 00:53:59,699
point of maximum accumulation to be the

1341
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:01,710
point when we applied the drought stress

1342
00:53:59,699 --> 00:54:03,839
and that was fairly late in the

1343
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:06,780
flowering stage for the called for that

1344
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:11,130
we use called nebula so when is that

1345
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:13,470
nebula cultivar typically typically

1346
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:15,900
harvested that what sort of day of

1347
00:54:13,469 --> 00:54:18,449
flower and when did you apply the stress

1348
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,869
level the drought stress yeah so it I

1349
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:23,399
believe we harvested at nine weeks after

1350
00:54:21,869 --> 00:54:26,190
changing the light cycle and we applied

1351
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,260
the drought stress at week seven okay

1352
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,358
yeah cuz I've seen you know it's a

1353
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,070
common thread around growers well

1354
00:54:30,358 --> 00:54:34,949
they're well they'll stop watering for

1355
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:36,869
the last week or the last few days or

1356
00:54:34,949 --> 00:54:39,480
they'll do make massive changes with the

1357
00:54:36,869 --> 00:54:41,010
lights I've even heard of people you

1358
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:42,929
know changing the conditions in their

1359
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:45,960
grow room quite dramatically in terms of

1360
00:54:42,929 --> 00:54:49,319
temperature all these different ways of

1361
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:51,119
triggering stress so you went with at

1362
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:53,340
seven weeks you allowed the plants to

1363
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,950
visibly wilt I believe that was one of

1364
00:54:53,340 --> 00:54:58,050
your drought stress indicators and at

1365
00:54:55,949 --> 00:55:02,639
least the most practical one for growers

1366
00:54:58,050 --> 00:55:06,330
to look at what did you find when you

1367
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:07,440
did that so okay in terms of the drought

1368
00:55:06,329 --> 00:55:09,750
stress threshold it's actually

1369
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,090
determining when the plants were

1370
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:14,010
stressed we looked at wilting which

1371
00:55:12,090 --> 00:55:17,400
again is something that growers can

1372
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:19,380
actually see but wilting wilting

1373
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,780
response is not the same between species

1374
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:22,410
so some plants will be very damaged

1375
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,150
before they

1376
00:55:22,409 --> 00:55:26,338
and some will wilt way before they

1377
00:55:24,150 --> 00:55:28,500
experience any permanent damage so it's

1378
00:55:26,338 --> 00:55:31,650
not really a you can't just assume that

1379
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:33,000
it's a good indicator of stress we did

1380
00:55:31,650 --> 00:55:34,950
find that it was a good indicator in

1381
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:36,449
cannabis which is useful now but before

1382
00:55:34,949 --> 00:55:38,669
we couldn't make that assumption so we

1383
00:55:36,449 --> 00:55:43,230
use these these pieces of equipment

1384
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:45,000
they're very high-tech and pieces of

1385
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:46,079
equipment called in situ stem sigh

1386
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:48,989
kilometers and this is something that

1387
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,780
was invented by one of my advisers it's

1388
00:55:48,989 --> 00:55:53,729
it's a device that connects directly to

1389
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:57,030
the vasculature on the stem of the plant

1390
00:55:53,730 --> 00:56:01,469
and it measures in real time the plant

1391
00:55:57,030 --> 00:56:03,089
water water status which is effectively

1392
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:06,989
kind of like that the pulse of the plant

1393
00:56:03,088 --> 00:56:09,449
so if it really needs water that the

1394
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:10,858
water status will change and you can

1395
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:12,750
even you know flick a leaf and you'll

1396
00:56:10,858 --> 00:56:15,679
see in real time a change in the water

1397
00:56:12,750 --> 00:56:18,239
status it's that sensitive so there are

1398
00:56:15,679 --> 00:56:20,219
regardless of wilting there's standards

1399
00:56:18,239 --> 00:56:22,979
in water status that will tell you if a

1400
00:56:20,219 --> 00:56:24,989
plant is stress then we used that as our

1401
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:26,599
drought stress threshold and then

1402
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:29,399
applied that to welding after the fact

1403
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:30,960
that's so cool I wish I wish I could

1404
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:34,079
play around with one of those so it's

1405
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,429
measuring essentially what's going up

1406
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:37,920
and down through the xylem is that right

1407
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:41,250
or am i it's not it's not necessary yeah

1408
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:43,769
that there's someone there there's some

1409
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:45,568
SAP flow meters which measures flow but

1410
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:47,940
this is more measuring water status so

1411
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:50,730
it's a it's a metric of kind of the

1412
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:53,659
water pressure a plant experiences which

1413
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:56,400
the function function of the environment

1414
00:56:53,659 --> 00:56:57,960
law every kind of any change in the

1415
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,579
environment will affect water status so

1416
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:01,440
if you're you know if you change your

1417
00:56:59,579 --> 00:57:03,298
increase your lighting there'll be more

1418
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,519
pressure on the plant to transpire if

1419
00:57:03,298 --> 00:57:07,349
you change your temperature your

1420
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:09,960
humidity or you know your vapor pressure

1421
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:13,349
deficit all of that it all of that kind

1422
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:14,639
of relates back into the water status of

1423
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:17,730
your plant so it's a very good

1424
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:19,500
accumulator of the plants response to

1425
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:23,778
the environment is it's the best that we

1426
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:25,829
know of right now that's really cool

1427
00:57:23,778 --> 00:57:29,940
yeah I didn't even know that something

1428
00:57:25,829 --> 00:57:31,619
like that existed yeah so you also

1429
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,880
looked at relatively fango as that's

1430
00:57:31,619 --> 00:57:35,760
something that growers might be able to

1431
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:36,490
do as well as waiting so so based on

1432
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,630
your research

1433
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:42,489
now you're saying that cannabis does

1434
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:45,610
allow you to use wilting and leaf angle

1435
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:49,269
to show or demonstrate drought stress

1436
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:51,849
which is important out to know it is it

1437
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:53,289
is and it was a way too difficult to

1438
00:57:51,849 --> 00:57:57,969
figure that out but we did figure that

1439
00:57:53,289 --> 00:58:00,099
out so yeah so we found that when when

1440
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:02,739
the leaf angle of if you look at a

1441
00:58:00,099 --> 00:58:04,989
secondary branch and you're looking at a

1442
00:58:02,739 --> 00:58:07,589
fairly large family if the leaf when the

1443
00:58:04,989 --> 00:58:10,649
leaf angle of that fan leave went from

1444
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:16,450
decreased by about 50% from its original

1445
00:58:10,650 --> 00:58:17,650
turgid angle then it was at a level

1446
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:20,409
where was actually experiencing a

1447
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:22,690
significant level of stress so when we

1448
00:58:20,409 --> 00:58:24,969
talk about pete prance we talk about

1449
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:28,510
plant spraying you know with their

1450
00:58:24,969 --> 00:58:31,539
leaves pointing up like that across you

1451
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:33,760
know most cultivars that I've seen you

1452
00:58:31,539 --> 00:58:37,029
know really it's the turgidity of the of

1453
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,450
the of the standard leaf how does that

1454
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:42,930
correlate with plant health or is that

1455
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:45,309
something that you can talk about at all

1456
00:58:42,929 --> 00:58:47,739
yeah well I can I can speculate there's

1457
00:58:45,309 --> 00:58:49,779
again there's no research on that but in

1458
00:58:47,739 --> 00:58:51,729
general that's a sign of just really

1459
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:53,440
heavy transpiration and transpiration

1460
00:58:51,730 --> 00:58:54,969
where the plant has enough water and is

1461
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:58,000
actively transpiring you know there's a

1462
00:58:54,969 --> 00:59:00,159
very high VPD environment and it's

1463
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,420
really pushing out water and often

1464
00:59:00,159 --> 00:59:06,129
you'll see a correlation again

1465
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:09,309
speculation but between that and just

1466
00:59:06,130 --> 00:59:10,599
very healthily transpiring plants cool

1467
00:59:09,309 --> 00:59:13,090
so there there may be a correlation

1468
00:59:10,599 --> 00:59:14,769
there usually may be but I've also I've

1469
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:18,160
also seen cultivars that do that

1470
00:59:14,769 --> 00:59:19,840
regardless so it's okay

1471
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:21,009
not sure what it means that's a good

1472
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,710
point that I'm glad you mentioned that

1473
00:59:21,010 --> 00:59:25,840
cool so let's I want to talk more about

1474
00:59:23,710 --> 00:59:30,940
stress responses and and the numerous

1475
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:32,740
stress stressors that can be in an in a

1476
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:34,000
given grow environment but before we do

1477
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,829
let's talk about your results just

1478
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:38,858
relating to drought stress so what were

1479
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:42,730
your findings in this paper okay so

1480
00:59:38,858 --> 00:59:46,269
after we gradually let the substrate dry

1481
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:50,019
in our drought stress treatment we we

1482
00:59:46,269 --> 00:59:50,570
found that the the photosynthetic rate

1483
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:52,460
was

1484
00:59:50,570 --> 00:59:55,580
drastically reduced over the control so

1485
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:57,710
the plant was really suffering and weary

1486
00:59:55,579 --> 01:00:00,170
wet it and we measured you know all

1487
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:01,220
sorts of parameters during and after so

1488
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,970
we confirmed that there was drought

1489
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:08,689
stress and the most interesting result

1490
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:11,299
was that there was no difference in in

1491
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:13,639
the yield between the control and the

1492
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:15,500
drought stress plants and there were

1493
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:19,299
some increases in some of the important

1494
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:21,889
secondary metabolites so we found that

1495
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:24,620
THC a concentration in the drought

1496
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:28,250
treatment increased by 12% CBD a

1497
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:33,529
concentration by 13% and if you look on

1498
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:36,769
on by yield of the specific cannabinoid

1499
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:39,650
so grams per plant or grams per unit

1500
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:43,009
area we found even even higher increases

1501
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:50,329
so TB da was increased by or CBD a yield

1502
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:51,820
by 43% CBD a yield by 47% and so on

1503
01:00:50,329 --> 01:00:53,929
there was a lot of very interesting

1504
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:56,300
increases by just applying you know

1505
01:00:53,929 --> 01:01:00,649
drought stress once at week 7 in the

1506
01:00:56,300 --> 01:01:01,910
flowering stage that's fascinating I

1507
01:01:00,650 --> 01:01:06,170
don't have much to add to that other

1508
01:01:01,909 --> 01:01:08,989
than I think it it shows just what what

1509
01:01:06,170 --> 01:01:10,579
effect drought stress can have on your

1510
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:12,289
overall yield I mean we don't I don't

1511
01:01:10,579 --> 01:01:16,279
know quite how to apply that across

1512
01:01:12,289 --> 01:01:17,690
other forms of cultivation but I think

1513
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:20,450
that that's just that's just fascinating

1514
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:23,119
that you got such a strong result yeah

1515
01:01:20,449 --> 01:01:24,469
and you know what I'd love to talk about

1516
01:01:23,119 --> 01:01:26,809
kind of the intricacies of that because

1517
01:01:24,469 --> 01:01:29,179
like as you say to apply that elsewheres

1518
01:01:26,809 --> 01:01:32,690
in this situation is even more difficult

1519
01:01:29,179 --> 01:01:35,329
because it's the accumulated stress that

1520
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:37,309
the plant perceives so it's you know the

1521
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:39,139
stress like I said it increases over

1522
01:01:37,309 --> 01:01:41,059
time and it starts from very little to

1523
01:01:39,139 --> 01:01:43,579
quite a substantial amount of stress but

1524
01:01:41,059 --> 01:01:45,049
it's the it's the accumulation of that

1525
01:01:43,579 --> 01:01:47,420
stress that the plant actually perceives

1526
01:01:45,050 --> 01:01:49,640
so if you were to go to wilting point in

1527
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:52,670
a you know in a 4-inch Rockville cube

1528
01:01:49,639 --> 01:01:54,049
for example it would take a day and the

1529
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:55,550
accumulated stress would be vastly

1530
01:01:54,050 --> 01:01:57,440
different from if you're working in a

1531
01:01:55,550 --> 01:02:00,500
three gallon pot with you know a

1532
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:03,170
peat-based growing media that takes a

1533
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:04,309
week before it gets to the same wilting

1534
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:07,039
same

1535
01:02:04,309 --> 01:02:09,170
in point so it's very important to

1536
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:11,570
consider that you know don't just let

1537
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,159
your plants wilt because it's not

1538
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:16,130
necessarily the wilting that does it

1539
01:02:13,159 --> 01:02:19,190
it's that it's a certain amount of

1540
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:20,690
stress over a certain period of time so

1541
01:02:19,190 --> 01:02:22,369
if you apply you know if you get to the

1542
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:23,929
wilting point in six or seven days

1543
01:02:22,369 --> 01:02:26,150
you're more likely to actually see the

1544
01:02:23,929 --> 01:02:29,719
benefits that we saw rather than doing

1545
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:32,840
it in a couple of days for example yeah

1546
01:02:29,719 --> 01:02:37,309
so how do you feel that drought stress

1547
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:39,559
is the best type of stress for cannabis

1548
01:02:37,309 --> 01:02:40,880
or do we even know I mean so one of the

1549
01:02:39,559 --> 01:02:42,679
things I wanted to talk about with you

1550
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:44,990
was there's all these different forms of

1551
01:02:42,679 --> 01:02:46,940
stress in any given grow environment for

1552
01:02:44,989 --> 01:02:48,619
a plant whether its environmental with

1553
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:52,940
you know humidity and temperature and

1554
01:02:48,619 --> 01:02:57,609
VPD whether it's lighting watering the

1555
01:02:52,940 --> 01:03:00,500
pest pressure you know how how do we as

1556
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:02,390
cultivators what sort of applied science

1557
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:04,039
or knowledge is there out there for how

1558
01:03:02,389 --> 01:03:05,900
we sort of control these stress

1559
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:07,969
responses and which may be beneficial

1560
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:10,639
and which may be you know detrimental to

1561
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:12,559
yield health all of those things yeah

1562
01:03:10,639 --> 01:03:14,179
it's a very interesting question and

1563
01:03:12,559 --> 01:03:15,019
I've been very very interested in that

1564
01:03:14,179 --> 01:03:18,230
for a long time

1565
01:03:15,019 --> 01:03:20,960
stress ISM is a kind of dangerous tool

1566
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:23,929
to play with as a grower because it's so

1567
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:26,030
easy to do damage it's it's intuitive

1568
01:03:23,929 --> 01:03:28,219
that stress can be damaging to your

1569
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:29,750
plants and you know even if you're doing

1570
01:03:28,219 --> 01:03:33,109
it late stage after it's fully grown

1571
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:34,429
I've seen decreases in yield decrease in

1572
01:03:33,110 --> 01:03:36,530
cannabinoid content if you're over

1573
01:03:34,429 --> 01:03:38,449
applying stress you know late in the

1574
01:03:36,530 --> 01:03:39,830
game or you know especially if you do it

1575
01:03:38,449 --> 01:03:41,719
too early if you do it during the

1576
01:03:39,829 --> 01:03:42,920
vegetative stage almost across the board

1577
01:03:41,719 --> 01:03:46,219
you're gonna have decreased yield

1578
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:47,450
decrease everything so you really have

1579
01:03:46,219 --> 01:03:50,480
to be careful and do it in a really

1580
01:03:47,449 --> 01:03:52,519
controlled way only apply one stress III

1581
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,639
don't believe anyone who says they you

1582
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:57,679
know they can apply cold stress and felt

1583
01:03:55,639 --> 01:04:00,379
stress and drought stress all at the

1584
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:03,739
same time and know how that's affecting

1585
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:04,910
their plant it's it's vastly more

1586
01:04:03,739 --> 01:04:07,459
complicated than I think anyone

1587
01:04:04,909 --> 01:04:08,719
understands right now so if you're gonna

1588
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:12,380
play with stress I would suggest one

1589
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:17,629
thing just you know just work with one

1590
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:18,190
stressor and be good oh yeah I was just

1591
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:21,250
wanted to add

1592
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:22,929
so what I found from visiting a lot of

1593
01:04:21,250 --> 01:04:26,289
different facilities and such is that

1594
01:04:22,929 --> 01:04:29,289
every facility has some form of stress

1595
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:30,940
already occurring fairly regularly

1596
01:04:29,289 --> 01:04:32,019
there's no perfect environment you know

1597
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:35,380
these growth chambers that you're

1598
01:04:32,019 --> 01:04:36,759
creating are very hard to scale for for

1599
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:39,820
growers when we talk about commercial

1600
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:41,500
production of cannabis yeah so how does

1601
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:42,820
that when we talk about you know you can

1602
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,920
be mentioned applied science how does

1603
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:46,660
that come into play when we're talking

1604
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:48,280
about a facility like if you were a

1605
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:50,859
grower listening to this talk and you're

1606
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:52,720
like wow I hear you mentioned stress I

1607
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:54,519
want to start playing around with stress

1608
01:04:52,719 --> 01:04:56,679
what would sort of be your I mean you

1609
01:04:54,519 --> 01:04:58,420
mentioned some cautions already and just

1610
01:04:56,679 --> 01:05:00,039
trying to go with one form of stress but

1611
01:04:58,420 --> 01:05:05,019
I don't know what do you think about

1612
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:08,529
that yeah so the the grow rooms that I'm

1613
01:05:05,019 --> 01:05:10,659
currently operating in are kind of like

1614
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:13,000
large experimental growth chambers

1615
01:05:10,659 --> 01:05:15,250
they're you know about 1,500 square feet

1616
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:16,719
of grow area and they're very very

1617
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:18,909
controlled so I kind of have unfortunate

1618
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:20,159
that I can play with these but if you're

1619
01:05:18,909 --> 01:05:22,659
operating in a less controlled facility

1620
01:05:20,159 --> 01:05:24,399
the plants perceive a lot of the

1621
01:05:22,659 --> 01:05:28,659
different stresses in the same way so

1622
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:31,090
salt stress cold stress drought stress

1623
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:32,559
they're all effectively just a different

1624
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:34,300
form of drought stress so they're just

1625
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:36,429
limiting water uptake by the plant so if

1626
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:38,680
you have high levels of salt water

1627
01:05:36,429 --> 01:05:40,119
uptake is restricted if you have that

1628
01:05:38,679 --> 01:05:42,879
there's less water so if there's drought

1629
01:05:40,119 --> 01:05:45,039
water uptake is restricted if you if

1630
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,320
it's cold the planets can't transpire as

1631
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,420
much so it's restricting water uptake so

1632
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:51,010
all of it a lot of them are effectively

1633
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:54,190
the same stress then you can just apply

1634
01:05:51,010 --> 01:05:58,360
it in different ways so the easiest way

1635
01:05:54,190 --> 01:06:00,490
I think is in using the salt content in

1636
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:02,590
your growing media so if you do want to

1637
01:06:00,489 --> 01:06:04,449
apply a drought stress or you can just

1638
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:05,980
increase the you know your fertilizer

1639
01:06:04,449 --> 01:06:07,569
content whenever you want to apply that

1640
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:09,460
drought stress so for example if you

1641
01:06:07,570 --> 01:06:11,260
wanted to do it in week seven like we

1642
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:13,449
did in this paper you could increase

1643
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:16,870
that to a point where you're fairly

1644
01:06:13,449 --> 01:06:19,449
confident that the plants will have a

1645
01:06:16,869 --> 01:06:20,920
restricted uptake of water you can even

1646
01:06:19,449 --> 01:06:22,689
you know get let them get to wilting

1647
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:24,849
point that way and then you can relieve

1648
01:06:22,690 --> 01:06:26,559
the stress after the fact so working

1649
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:30,610
with your fertilizer or even if just you

1650
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:32,019
know adding salt into into your

1651
01:06:30,610 --> 01:06:34,030
irrigation mix

1652
01:06:32,019 --> 01:06:37,480
that could be one way of doing it but

1653
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:39,850
again it's kind of playing with fire and

1654
01:06:37,480 --> 01:06:42,490
it's it's best done in a very controlled

1655
01:06:39,849 --> 01:06:44,019
setting and then scaled ups later on so

1656
01:06:42,489 --> 01:06:46,599
I would never recommend to a large scale

1657
01:06:44,019 --> 01:06:49,570
grower to just go and start playing with

1658
01:06:46,599 --> 01:06:50,679
stress yeah and one thing about your

1659
01:06:49,570 --> 01:06:53,140
trial that I thought was an interesting

1660
01:06:50,679 --> 01:06:56,739
decision you made was you were using the

1661
01:06:53,139 --> 01:06:58,719
same level of fertilizer in the water I

1662
01:06:56,739 --> 01:07:00,849
believe if I read it correctly and then

1663
01:06:58,719 --> 01:07:02,739
the plants that were drought stress just

1664
01:07:00,849 --> 01:07:07,239
received less water so overall they

1665
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:09,579
received less fertilizer yeah can you

1666
01:07:07,239 --> 01:07:10,959
give talk a little bit about that and

1667
01:07:09,579 --> 01:07:13,539
because you said yields were the same

1668
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:15,820
across both could there potentially have

1669
01:07:13,539 --> 01:07:17,409
been over fertigation in the other crop

1670
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:19,840
or does your other trial that you did

1671
01:07:17,409 --> 01:07:23,849
sort of validate the fact that the

1672
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:26,950
fertilizer level was appropriate yeah so

1673
01:07:23,849 --> 01:07:29,889
again that's one of the intricacies with

1674
01:07:26,949 --> 01:07:33,309
doing drought stress trials because if

1675
01:07:29,889 --> 01:07:35,079
you are so for example if you weren't

1676
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:37,059
fertig ating and you just didn't

1677
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:40,029
incorporated fertilizer in both

1678
01:07:37,059 --> 01:07:43,389
treatments and you drove stress to one

1679
01:07:40,030 --> 01:07:46,810
and not the other then when the plant

1680
01:07:43,389 --> 01:07:48,579
when the substrate has less water in it

1681
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:51,849
it also restricts nutrient uptake

1682
01:07:48,579 --> 01:07:55,779
because again nutrients are mostly taken

1683
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:57,250
up with water so you can do it that way

1684
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:59,890
or you can further gate where you're

1685
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:04,900
adding nutrients every time you irrigate

1686
01:07:59,889 --> 01:08:06,670
and that way again if your fertig ating

1687
01:08:04,900 --> 01:08:09,820
your control more frequently it's

1688
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:11,320
getting more fertilizer but there's I've

1689
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:13,059
never seen a drought paper that has any

1690
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:15,250
way of mitigating that problem because

1691
01:08:13,059 --> 01:08:17,979
you're always those two factors the

1692
01:08:15,250 --> 01:08:22,359
fertilizer uptake and water uptake are

1693
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:24,548
very very tightly connected so our only

1694
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:26,588
kind of way of negating that effect was

1695
01:08:24,548 --> 01:08:28,479
to look at the other publications that

1696
01:08:26,588 --> 01:08:30,699
we've done and we saw that cannabis

1697
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:33,399
responds similarly to fertilizer rate

1698
01:08:30,699 --> 01:08:35,559
within a specific range and we saw that

1699
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:37,389
both of our the control and the drug

1700
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,450
treatments fell within that range so we

1701
01:08:37,390 --> 01:08:44,319
were fairly confident that it probably

1702
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:46,079
did not influence the yield plus the

1703
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:49,780
fact that the drought tree

1704
01:08:46,079 --> 01:08:51,729
which received less fertilizer actually

1705
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:53,739
had higher yield and cannabinoid content

1706
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:55,569
which we were we would have seen

1707
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:56,889
probably based on our other publications

1708
01:08:55,569 --> 01:08:59,079
that it would have been the opposite

1709
01:08:56,890 --> 01:09:01,900
because we weren't over fertilizing to

1710
01:08:59,079 --> 01:09:03,880
control in any way so okay yeah I mean

1711
01:09:01,899 --> 01:09:05,199
like I think this kind of just goes into

1712
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:07,810
some of the intricacies of trying to

1713
01:09:05,199 --> 01:09:09,489
design sort of a rigorous trial there's

1714
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:11,530
just so many variables that you have to

1715
01:09:09,489 --> 01:09:12,880
look at down and yeah you have to

1716
01:09:11,529 --> 01:09:14,590
consider that kind of thing it's it's

1717
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:15,760
it's there there's definitely a lot of

1718
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:18,610
variables to consider in any

1719
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:19,750
horticultural experiments so yeah and

1720
01:09:18,609 --> 01:09:22,469
you have to when you're looking and

1721
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:25,810
evaluating an experiment I think before

1722
01:09:22,470 --> 01:09:27,310
you know jumping to any conclusions

1723
01:09:25,810 --> 01:09:29,230
you you have to look at the methodology

1724
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:30,670
that they chose to because as a

1725
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:33,159
researcher you're constantly making

1726
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:36,069
those types of decisions into how you

1727
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:37,960
how you're setting up a trial and they

1728
01:09:36,069 --> 01:09:42,219
have effects on your overall results so

1729
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:45,189
I think that's great right so when we

1730
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,960
talk about stress you know anecdotally

1731
01:09:45,189 --> 01:09:50,259
I've mentioned this on the podcast you

1732
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,270
have the guy who has throws out an old

1733
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:53,560
clone or something or not plan on to the

1734
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,930
compost pile and it ends up growing

1735
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:57,640
massively and doing way better out in

1736
01:09:55,930 --> 01:09:59,409
the this horrible you know weather

1737
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:02,710
conditions versus their control indoor

1738
01:09:59,409 --> 01:10:04,420
plants or it turns out being the sad

1739
01:10:02,710 --> 01:10:06,489
looking plant but maybe has the is the

1740
01:10:04,420 --> 01:10:09,250
best cannabis that they've ever grown

1741
01:10:06,489 --> 01:10:13,659
you know in terms of a crop so we know

1742
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:15,310
that stress has an impact do you feel

1743
01:10:13,659 --> 01:10:18,069
like besides drought stress there's

1744
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:20,500
anywhere any other areas of sort of

1745
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:24,009
stress response that we can look at for

1746
01:10:20,500 --> 01:10:27,909
increasing you know some of these some

1747
01:10:24,010 --> 01:10:29,260
of these cannabinoids yeah I think that

1748
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:30,939
like there's a lot of different

1749
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:34,030
stressors that can have some positive

1750
01:10:30,939 --> 01:10:38,529
impacts but isn't it in most of these

1751
01:10:34,029 --> 01:10:40,539
cases you'll see a reduced reduce yields

1752
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:42,639
but higher concentrations of chemicals

1753
01:10:40,539 --> 01:10:44,260
and that's if that's what you want if

1754
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,970
you want like the most potent cannabis

1755
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:47,350
possible then you know grow it healthy

1756
01:10:45,970 --> 01:10:50,020
for a little bit stress at it you'll

1757
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:51,850
have lower yield overall so you're

1758
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:54,310
taking that as a loss but then maybe

1759
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:58,090
you'll have more potent more potent

1760
01:10:54,310 --> 01:10:59,890
flowers so it's a cost benefit for most

1761
01:10:58,090 --> 01:11:03,520
growers so yes it's something

1762
01:10:59,890 --> 01:11:06,400
play with but if you are selling your

1763
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:07,960
flower by yield which generally you are

1764
01:11:06,399 --> 01:11:11,259
maybe it'll sell better if it's a higher

1765
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:13,779
THC content but still total volume is

1766
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:16,869
buy it is buy yield then sometimes it's

1767
01:11:13,779 --> 01:11:19,869
not it's not best to apply stress but

1768
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:21,399
it's really up to the grower now kind of

1769
01:11:19,869 --> 01:11:25,689
what they want to grow and how they want

1770
01:11:21,399 --> 01:11:28,899
to do it yeah so for me this is

1771
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:32,379
challenging so my my thoughts on this

1772
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:34,859
are every facility has a lot of

1773
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:37,000
environmental stress already for plants

1774
01:11:34,859 --> 01:11:38,439
just as a general rule there's no

1775
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,989
perfect facility out there that least

1776
01:11:38,439 --> 01:11:43,359
that I visited so I'm assuming that

1777
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:45,729
every plant is receiving as much stress

1778
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,519
as it probably wants or needs and that

1779
01:11:45,729 --> 01:11:50,739
the goal as someone who works within

1780
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:52,530
cannabis is to reduce the amount of

1781
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:55,659
plant stress we see healthier plants

1782
01:11:52,529 --> 01:11:58,689
less pest pressure you know less less

1783
01:11:55,659 --> 01:12:01,539
drought stress all of those things in

1784
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:03,639
terms of increasing yield because I'm

1785
01:12:01,539 --> 01:12:05,380
just assuming that the plant is going to

1786
01:12:03,640 --> 01:12:06,310
receive stress from you know because

1787
01:12:05,380 --> 01:12:09,520
there's a lot of things that aren't

1788
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:11,410
natural stressors in in the environment

1789
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,690
we want to talk about a cannabis you

1790
01:12:11,409 --> 01:12:15,220
know life cycle outside of cultivation

1791
01:12:13,689 --> 01:12:18,279
we're looking at a plant that's not

1792
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:20,350
cloned it's not transplanted it doesn't

1793
01:12:18,279 --> 01:12:24,250
have its light cycle switch in a you

1794
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:25,480
know for in 24-hour period to something

1795
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:27,670
completely different in the light and

1796
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:31,299
intensity ramped up so quickly how do

1797
01:12:27,670 --> 01:12:33,760
you think that factors into plant stress

1798
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:37,690
or you know cultivation from a practical

1799
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:41,199
perspective yeah I think the general

1800
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:44,439
rule is best to first reduce all the

1801
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:46,239
unwanted stress in in your growing

1802
01:12:44,439 --> 01:12:48,399
environment so like if you're working in

1803
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:50,590
a greenhouse that has variability and

1804
01:12:48,399 --> 01:12:53,229
humidity from one side to the other get

1805
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:54,579
rid of that variability first get rid of

1806
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:57,459
the differences in light intensity

1807
01:12:54,579 --> 01:13:00,460
across your your canopy make it as

1808
01:12:57,460 --> 01:13:02,020
uniform as possible once you get to a

1809
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:04,779
point where you're fairly confident that

1810
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:08,710
you know your canopy is uniform you are

1811
01:13:04,779 --> 01:13:09,819
growing you're not overly stressing out

1812
01:13:08,710 --> 01:13:12,880
your plant when you don't want to be

1813
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:13,479
then there might be benefit in applying

1814
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:15,130
control

1815
01:13:13,479 --> 01:13:17,919
stress but until that point like you say

1816
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:20,949
there's so many stress stressors that

1817
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:23,800
are already occurring to your crop that

1818
01:13:20,949 --> 01:13:27,699
are unwanted it's it's not worth

1819
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:30,360
applying one more okay so just your

1820
01:13:27,699 --> 01:13:32,829
exercise caution at this point in time

1821
01:13:30,359 --> 01:13:34,899
exactly yeah so what do you think about

1822
01:13:32,829 --> 01:13:37,960
natural versus sort of artificial

1823
01:13:34,899 --> 01:13:40,389
stressors and in relation to genetics so

1824
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:43,659
I was talking about with Ben actually

1825
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:47,050
earlier today about this in relation to

1826
01:13:43,659 --> 01:13:49,260
your work so we have these natural or

1827
01:13:47,050 --> 01:13:52,900
sorry unnatural stresses in terms of

1828
01:13:49,260 --> 01:13:56,680
transplanting cloning light changes that

1829
01:13:52,899 --> 01:13:58,689
wouldn't occur in nature but plants may

1830
01:13:56,680 --> 01:14:01,480
have you know certain cannabis plants

1831
01:13:58,689 --> 01:14:03,519
may have been you know evolutionary so

1832
01:14:01,479 --> 01:14:05,799
evolutionarily selected for this based

1833
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:08,980
on the way that we have been propagating

1834
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:12,010
and breeding them you know indoors under

1835
01:14:08,979 --> 01:14:14,469
these lights for numerous you know

1836
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:16,030
decades now how do you think that

1837
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:19,690
factors in when we talk about it from

1838
01:14:16,029 --> 01:14:21,639
like say a genetics perspective yeah I

1839
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:25,509
think it's a dangerous game to start

1840
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:27,520
comparing how plants want to grow

1841
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:30,070
naturally compared to how we can grow

1842
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:32,710
them to controlled environments so the

1843
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:34,509
lab I worked with or I studied with is

1844
01:14:32,710 --> 01:14:36,310
controlled environment research facility

1845
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:38,320
and we grow learn how to you know we

1846
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:41,110
study how to grow plants and harsh

1847
01:14:38,319 --> 01:14:43,689
climates and space and in very very

1848
01:14:41,109 --> 01:14:45,519
controlled environments and basically

1849
01:14:43,689 --> 01:14:47,469
decades of controlled environment

1850
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,020
research have told us that plants if you

1851
01:14:47,470 --> 01:14:51,579
can control the environment to be

1852
01:14:50,020 --> 01:14:53,530
exactly what the plant wants all the

1853
01:14:51,579 --> 01:14:54,970
time it will grow much better you'll

1854
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:57,219
have much higher yields you'll

1855
01:14:54,970 --> 01:15:01,570
completely beat up nature there's not

1856
01:14:57,220 --> 01:15:02,920
even any question about that so I think

1857
01:15:01,569 --> 01:15:05,259
it's a dangerous game to start trying

1858
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:08,170
mimic to trying to mimic exactly what

1859
01:15:05,260 --> 01:15:12,159
nature does or how nature apply stresses

1860
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:13,600
or how date your you know how plants

1861
01:15:12,159 --> 01:15:15,220
grow in their natural environments

1862
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,840
because once you have a general

1863
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:18,369
understanding of how a plant grows and

1864
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,880
you can start tweaking things like the

1865
01:15:18,369 --> 01:15:24,819
co2 concentration the light intensity

1866
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:27,460
you know the light uniformity the the

1867
01:15:24,819 --> 01:15:29,679
when plants receive light the

1868
01:15:27,460 --> 01:15:31,779
spectrum of the light all that if you

1869
01:15:29,680 --> 01:15:33,190
can optimize all those parameters in a

1870
01:15:31,779 --> 01:15:35,529
system that makes sense

1871
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:37,210
you there's no question that you can

1872
01:15:35,529 --> 01:15:39,909
beat out nature and that's been seen

1873
01:15:37,210 --> 01:15:42,279
with you know NASA research trying to

1874
01:15:39,909 --> 01:15:44,289
grow tomatoes to the best of their our

1875
01:15:42,279 --> 01:15:47,170
wheat to the best that it could possibly

1876
01:15:44,289 --> 01:15:48,488
grow its vastly superior to you know

1877
01:15:47,170 --> 01:15:53,109
yields you would see in the field

1878
01:15:48,488 --> 01:15:57,009
it's like steroids with humans so what

1879
01:15:53,109 --> 01:16:00,579
about photo periodic plants have you

1880
01:15:57,010 --> 01:16:04,829
seen anything any research relating to

1881
01:16:00,579 --> 01:16:07,300
that in terms of in terms of genetics so

1882
01:16:04,829 --> 01:16:08,979
that's I know that's more specific to

1883
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:12,640
cannabis than most horticultural crops

1884
01:16:08,979 --> 01:16:14,079
but yeah I'd just be curious cuz because

1885
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,210
I get what you're saying you're saying

1886
01:16:14,079 --> 01:16:19,710
that we can't really necessarily assume

1887
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:22,510
that mimicking nature has any sort of

1888
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:24,460
advantage in terms of yield or plant

1889
01:16:22,510 --> 01:16:27,699
health and that we're able to do it

1890
01:16:24,460 --> 01:16:32,319
quite well in these unnatural what we're

1891
01:16:27,699 --> 01:16:35,340
calling unnatural environments but how I

1892
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:38,380
guess for plants that may be genetically

1893
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:41,260
or evolutionarily brought up to be grown

1894
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:43,119
under a certain environment that seem to

1895
01:16:41,260 --> 01:16:46,119
thrive in this environment is there any

1896
01:16:43,119 --> 01:16:47,890
sort of relation there in terms of other

1897
01:16:46,119 --> 01:16:49,539
crops that have been found too that are

1898
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:54,250
photo periodic that have been found to

1899
01:16:49,539 --> 01:16:57,369
also maybe over time have their genetics

1900
01:16:54,250 --> 01:17:00,760
change for the better when we talk about

1901
01:16:57,369 --> 01:17:03,519
a specific type of cultivation yeah I

1902
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:06,190
think it's been kind of regardless of

1903
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:09,340
that it's been more kind of selection

1904
01:17:06,189 --> 01:17:11,409
breeding selection for cultivars that

1905
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:13,449
perform well in the environments that

1906
01:17:11,409 --> 01:17:14,469
we're growing them in so mm-hmm

1907
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:16,269
it hasn't been done really in a

1908
01:17:14,469 --> 01:17:18,550
controlled way for cannabis you know it

1909
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:20,560
compared to crops like wheat or corn but

1910
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:23,020
it's still been done for decades and

1911
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:24,820
decades where growers will will find a

1912
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:28,690
cultivar that really responds well to

1913
01:17:24,819 --> 01:17:30,309
being triggered in 12 hours so I you

1914
01:17:28,689 --> 01:17:32,199
know in a big phenotype in project that

1915
01:17:30,310 --> 01:17:36,070
we're doing now flower we we've seen

1916
01:17:32,199 --> 01:17:39,670
that some cultivars will will switch at

1917
01:17:36,069 --> 01:17:41,319
just 16 hours and some will only twitch

1918
01:17:39,670 --> 01:17:43,659
at 12 hours and so

1919
01:17:41,319 --> 01:17:45,399
it's likely that breeders of the past

1920
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:50,019
have kind of just selected the ones that

1921
01:17:45,399 --> 01:17:54,039
respond well to the way that is easiest

1922
01:17:50,020 --> 01:17:58,780
or you know safest or most efficient to

1923
01:17:54,039 --> 01:18:01,899
grow them in that's interesting cool

1924
01:17:58,779 --> 01:18:04,109
well I know we talked about a lot today

1925
01:18:01,899 --> 01:18:06,819
was there anything you wanted to add

1926
01:18:04,109 --> 01:18:08,109
regarding the the research that you've

1927
01:18:06,819 --> 01:18:09,909
done or anything you want to touch on in

1928
01:18:08,109 --> 01:18:11,920
terms of upcoming research that you're

1929
01:18:09,909 --> 01:18:14,079
really excited about that you can you're

1930
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,720
able to talk about yeah well in terms of

1931
01:18:14,079 --> 01:18:18,130
upcoming research I'm definitely that's

1932
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:22,119
been kind of on the forefront of my mind

1933
01:18:18,130 --> 01:18:23,619
and so right now I'm acting as the

1934
01:18:22,119 --> 01:18:25,930
director of plant science of flower and

1935
01:18:23,619 --> 01:18:29,559
I'm working with a team of plant

1936
01:18:25,930 --> 01:18:32,200
breeders engineers growers other

1937
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:34,530
horticultural scientists and kind of the

1938
01:18:32,199 --> 01:18:37,479
potential and the backing behind

1939
01:18:34,529 --> 01:18:40,539
improving this crop even just in my kind

1940
01:18:37,479 --> 01:18:43,809
of close circle is incredible so there's

1941
01:18:40,539 --> 01:18:45,279
so many people so interested in learning

1942
01:18:43,810 --> 01:18:47,170
about this crop and improving it and

1943
01:18:45,279 --> 01:18:49,739
there's so much value in doing so for

1944
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:52,359
for a large scale producer like flower

1945
01:18:49,739 --> 01:18:54,849
we have production facilities all over

1946
01:18:52,359 --> 01:18:58,179
the world and one small improvement can

1947
01:18:54,850 --> 01:19:00,490
mean huge increases in yield or in

1948
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:02,409
quality you know you know in our

1949
01:19:00,489 --> 01:19:04,840
Portugal operation where we have you

1950
01:19:02,409 --> 01:19:07,420
know 165 sectors of outdoor space or in

1951
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:09,190
our in our local Kelowna production

1952
01:19:07,420 --> 01:19:12,909
facility where we're growing indoors and

1953
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:14,349
also in Pali tunnels and so there's a

1954
01:19:12,909 --> 01:19:16,829
lot of effort being put into research

1955
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:20,710
and there's so many low hanging fruit to

1956
01:19:16,829 --> 01:19:23,529
grasp for and that's kind of what I'm

1957
01:19:20,710 --> 01:19:25,300
what I'm doing now and what me and my

1958
01:19:23,529 --> 01:19:27,819
team is working on is trying to

1959
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:29,560
understand this plant and how to grow it

1960
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:32,189
better if there's gonna be so much to

1961
01:19:29,560 --> 01:19:34,510
learn and in such a short period of time

1962
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:36,359
yeah well I really I really appreciate

1963
01:19:34,510 --> 01:19:38,949
the research that you've done and

1964
01:19:36,359 --> 01:19:41,559
i-i-i-i thank you for sharing it so

1965
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:42,970
openly and getting it peer-reviewed

1966
01:19:41,560 --> 01:19:45,240
because I think that has a lot of value

1967
01:19:42,970 --> 01:19:47,199
and like you said you're just on the the

1968
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:48,550
cutting edge sort of the tip of the

1969
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:51,579
iceberg for the amount of research that

1970
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:54,130
is that is going to be done and

1971
01:19:51,579 --> 01:19:55,630
I just I'm really grateful that we're

1972
01:19:54,130 --> 01:19:57,279
starting to see this type of thing and I

1973
01:19:55,630 --> 01:19:58,810
hope I can have you back on to talk more

1974
01:19:57,279 --> 01:20:02,170
about it and some of your new research

1975
01:19:58,810 --> 01:20:04,900
and maybe debunk some more of these sort

1976
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:06,429
of myths or practices that may have not

1977
01:20:04,899 --> 01:20:08,198
been beneficial like you mentioned with

1978
01:20:06,429 --> 01:20:11,649
the the cutting the leaves and

1979
01:20:08,198 --> 01:20:13,000
propagation so yeah thank you yes I'd
