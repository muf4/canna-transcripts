welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,079
science podcast i'm your host tad hussey

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,760
of kiss organics this is the podcast

5
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:27,759
where we discuss the cutting edge of

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,519
growing from a science-based perspective

7
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,960
and drawn top experts from around the

8
00:00:29,518 --> 00:00:31,919
industry to share their wisdom and

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,679
knowledge

10
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,920
my guest this week is my dear friend

11
00:00:33,679 --> 00:00:37,920
jeremy plum jeremy was the director of

12
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,760
production science at proof cultivar one

13
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,760
of the most technologically advanced

14
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:44,718
cannabis cultivation facilities in north

15
00:00:41,759 --> 00:00:46,878
america at proof jeremy combined decades

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,879
of cannabis horticultural experience

17
00:00:46,878 --> 00:00:50,878
with cutting-edge technology to deliver

18
00:00:48,878 --> 00:00:53,599
previously unattainable consistency in

19
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,759
both product quality and consumer effect

20
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,679
prior to his leadership at proof jeremy

21
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:59,358
was the co-founder of pharma recently

22
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:01,679
acquainted by rolling stone as one of

23
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,440
oregon's top dispensaries jeremy has

24
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:06,319
served as a cannabis consultant to

25
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:08,560
israel medical cannabis researchers and

26
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:11,199
and as a cannabis policy advisor for u.s

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,400
members of congress he also serves on

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,359
the olcc's rulemaking advisory committee

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,680
in 2015 jeremy co-founded cultivation

30
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:21,840
classic oregon's leading craft cannabis

31
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,680
competition he lives in portland oregon

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,920
with his border collie lucy and when he

33
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,000
can find fewer greater joys than sailing

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,000
on the mighty columbia river now on to

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,159
the show

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
okay

37
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,560
hey jeremy thanks for coming on the show

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,560
again today

39
00:01:37,118 --> 00:01:41,359
hey chad great to be on the show again

40
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,040
thank you so much for hosting

41
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:45,040
you are coming to us all the way from

42
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
ireland you took time out of your busy

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,640
schedule um

44
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,560
and you know a work vacation a little

45
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,960
bit too to

46
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,879
talk to us today about

47
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:58,879
aroma i think was the topic you wanted

48
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:58,879
to tackle um take it away

49
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:03,920
fantastic given that i'm speaking to you

50
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:05,679
from dublin i feel it's appropriate to

51
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,519
start the conversation

52
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,439
with a quote from one of my favorite

53
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:11,199
writers and poets

54
00:02:09,439 --> 00:02:14,000
william butler yates

55
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:17,280
who is also from ireland

56
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,878
he wrote these lines a long time ago but

57
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,159
i think this is really relevant to our

58
00:02:18,878 --> 00:02:22,479
conversation

59
00:02:20,159 --> 00:02:23,520
he says the world is full of magic

60
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:26,159
things

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,400
patiently awaiting for our senses to

62
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:31,120
grow sharper

63
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,280
that little quote is almost i think a

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,599
bit of a mission statement for the

65
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
direction that i'm excited to talk about

66
00:02:35,598 --> 00:02:38,159
which

67
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,598
connects to some of the recent science

68
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:42,079
i've been doing both from the

69
00:02:39,598 --> 00:02:42,959
cultivation and the consumer education

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
side

71
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,360
um so specifically trying to create a

72
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,640
bridge between

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,120
sensory science done in a mature way

74
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:56,079
to the cannabis cultivation efforts and

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,239
to the rich analytical chemistry that we

76
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,360
have access to because i i think i'll be

77
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,920
able to

78
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,200
share means by which it's even more

79
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,158
relevant

80
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:09,039
in a lot of ways than say a focus

81
00:03:06,158 --> 00:03:10,719
narrowly on terpenes and i'll get to

82
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,560
that material but

83
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:15,120
chad i want to start with i actually

84
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,878
have an exciting announcement which has

85
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,719
been forthcoming for some time and

86
00:03:16,878 --> 00:03:20,158
there's been some delays but

87
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:22,878
there is a

88
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:24,158
scientific white paper that is a journal

89
00:03:22,878 --> 00:03:25,598
journal article

90
00:03:24,158 --> 00:03:28,399
that is going to be coming out in the

91
00:03:25,598 --> 00:03:30,399
journal molecules that i have

92
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,680
the privilege of collaborating with dr

93
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,000
edie ray

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,840
and jeremy sackett previous founder of

95
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,080
cascadia analytical

96
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
and 80s grad students who've been

97
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,840
helping to digest

98
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,400
a lot of the data from the cultivation

99
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,878
classic event that i co-founded

100
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,000
like eight years ago something like that

101
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:50,158
um so

102
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,080
the exciting thing is that i you know

103
00:03:50,158 --> 00:03:53,359
when we set out to start cultivation

104
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,680
classic when

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:57,360
i actually was in washington dc on a

106
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,840
cannabis lobbying trip with congressman

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,599
blumenhour trying to think about how we

108
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,878
could support oregon to have its own

109
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:07,518
voice which is a lot about ecology and

110
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:09,840
ethics as well as about

111
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,158
community and education and trying to

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,719
empower all the producers

113
00:04:12,158 --> 00:04:16,560
to understand the cutting edge of both

114
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:17,839
production dynamics and product

115
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
character

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,918
you know i really wanted to open source

117
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:24,400
like all the sort of trade secrets that

118
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,519
were going on as a long time cultivator

119
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:28,000
myself and

120
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:29,839
empower the community to do better and i

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,918
think in many ways we've we've achieved

122
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:34,399
some of that aim but this is really a

123
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:35,918
specific way that has always been

124
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:37,918
something we've been excited about but

125
00:04:35,918 --> 00:04:39,680
just haven't had the resource

126
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:42,319
to follow through on so we've created a

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,439
ton of data because i think as you know

128
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:48,800
cultivation classic is really distinct

129
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,240
from any other cannabis evaluation

130
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,319
competition

131
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,160
um i'm really in love with our

132
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:56,240
colleagues who put on a variety of

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,560
different kinds of cannabis events and

134
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,160
bring the community together and i you

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:02,399
know will never forget my very first

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,120
high times cannabis cup in amsterdam

137
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,079
long time ago late 90s

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,478
but

139
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:10,478
the reality is i also quickly became

140
00:05:08,478 --> 00:05:12,000
aware of the fact that in all of the

141
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:14,319
competitions

142
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,199
you would see these scenes where there's

143
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:20,079
a handful of really amazing judges

144
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,439
usually who are deeply involved and

145
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:22,959
and they're kind of dumped on with a

146
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:25,439
huge amount of samples and they have a

147
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,680
very short period of time there's almost

148
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:29,120
no controls about how they're exploring

149
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,439
those samples

150
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,918
and then various competitors are given

151
00:05:31,439 --> 00:05:36,560
these awards which end up having massive

152
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:38,959
impact in their business and their brand

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,199
development and in many cases

154
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:43,680
i think that we see that inherently

155
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,919
those awards aren't tied to

156
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,199
the sort of quality evaluation you would

157
00:05:45,918 --> 00:05:49,120
hope to see

158
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,960
if you were looking from the outside in

159
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,879
you know you'd really like to see that

160
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:54,638
all of the samples were very thoroughly

161
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:58,560
and rigorously

162
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,639
reviewed in a process that could create

163
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,639
truly differentiated

164
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,319
sort of samples so that

165
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,879
what i mean is you know sometimes the

166
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,879
best products don't win full stop

167
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:09,600
uh that's not always the case of course

168
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:12,159
but

169
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,879
in any case cultivation classic was

170
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,120
a bit of a response to that and

171
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:19,120
i am really proud of the fact that we've

172
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,240
had double-blind

173
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,600
very scientifically rigorous evaluation

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,840
at the event

175
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,520
that it includes agronomic or

176
00:06:25,839 --> 00:06:29,758
agricultural grading

177
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:32,560
i include sensory grading

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,600
it also included the very first versions

179
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
of an ecological energy efficiency

180
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,120
tool called the power score that

181
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
derek smith's organization the resource

182
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,600
innovation institute

183
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,840
brought forward to our event first

184
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,080
and actually the oregon producers who

185
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,198
would fill out really long forms like 14

186
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,519
pages

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,120
talking about energy and water empowered

188
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:59,839
the rii to be more effective nationwide

189
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,720
in having baseline data for indoor

190
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,399
outdoor and greenhouse production models

191
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,080
but we also have some other weird stuff

192
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:10,000
like uh the most important i would say

193
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:12,079
thrust and the organization that's been

194
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,959
led by 80

195
00:07:12,079 --> 00:07:18,000
in that she as a neuroscientist and the

196
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:19,680
dea and a licensed

197
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,478
cannabis researcher

198
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,639
was able to work on the qualitative

199
00:07:22,478 --> 00:07:26,560
patient perspective we can't speak in

200
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,240
patient terms though because

201
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,240
that would run afoul of the fda so we

202
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,079
talk about consumers

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,000
and instead of being able to talk about

204
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:37,680
therapeutic effects

205
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,759
we really talk about consumer enjoyment

206
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,079
that's you know working within the

207
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,800
limitations of our

208
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,918
fractured non-federal regulatory

209
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,759
situation

210
00:07:45,918 --> 00:07:50,240
uh the only way that we could do this

211
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,038
truly clinical level research

212
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,918
you know with trained judges who work

213
00:07:53,038 --> 00:07:54,959
for

214
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:57,839
up to

215
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:00,399
six months in some cases and

216
00:07:57,839 --> 00:08:02,959
have a massive amount of time and

217
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:05,598
purview of of the samples and detailed

218
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:08,079
process and input tools

219
00:08:05,598 --> 00:08:10,000
to summarize their findings so

220
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,519
one of the exciting things is also

221
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,879
simply being able to avoid all the

222
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:16,878
inter-lab variability to choose a single

223
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,360
analytical testing partner

224
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:23,360
to be able to qualify all of those

225
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:25,680
products with a similar baseline

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,199
but what's exciting is the findings that

227
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,918
we're putting forward in the journal

228
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,840
molecules is really the very first bit

229
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:34,000
of the data that's been harnessed at

230
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:37,679
cultivation classic which you know has

231
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,918
been an entirely volunteer run program

232
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,598
and i initially found that with steph

233
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:44,079
barnhart previously of the willamette

234
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,160
week now co-founder of smart cannabis

235
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,040
which became the back end data effort

236
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:48,879
but

237
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:51,439
i think for anybody who saw behind the

238
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:53,759
scenes and was just used to cannabis

239
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,440
competitions being pretty rigged

240
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:58,958
i'd hope that they were kind of blown

241
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,959
away by the level of rigor and blinding

242
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:03,278
to the evaluations that went on i

243
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:06,319
guarantee there's not a close second

244
00:09:03,278 --> 00:09:08,559
currently although i hope there are more

245
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:12,000
we've done a lot of work to map i think

246
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:14,239
the oregon chemoscape by having lots of

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,720
craft producers you know funneling

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,560
through that same process

249
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,560
but i think this first work that's

250
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:22,239
coming out is some of the most exciting

251
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,479
and disruptive

252
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,360
because we find ourselves in a time

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,039
where

254
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,959
i think a lot about the consumers we

255
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
serve as cultivators

256
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:32,958
and the experience that they have when

257
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:35,360
they go into a retail dispensary to

258
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:37,679
acquire the product

259
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,600
the reality is if you come from the old

260
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:41,359
school and you had the privilege of

261
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,159
being very close

262
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,200
to a cultivator who was really skilled

263
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:49,600
you would frequently be able to observe

264
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,800
quality and character in the product

265
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,959
samples

266
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:56,159
that were like vastly better than what

267
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:58,879
you typically see in wholesale

268
00:09:56,159 --> 00:10:01,039
cannabis and retail cannabis in the sort

269
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:02,480
of adult use program

270
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:04,799
this is often

271
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,320
simply because of freshness

272
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,679
is my perspective and i'll say more

273
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,399
about that but

274
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:12,319
the

275
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,879
importance of aroma cannot be overstated

276
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,959
i want to jump to the punchline and

277
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,958
share a couple of the findings

278
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,518
that have actually come up before but i

279
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:24,000
think now are a little sharper it came

280
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,440
out of this research which to the best

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,559
of my knowledge is

282
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,600
the biggest scale clinical trial level

283
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:30,799
quality

284
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,680
study

285
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:36,719
using contemporary products not like two

286
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:39,199
percent moldy nida weed

287
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,839
but really exceptional craft cannabis

288
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,040
produced by organic cultivators in

289
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,160
oregon

290
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:47,278
to then

291
00:10:44,159 --> 00:10:50,319
look at what attributes

292
00:10:47,278 --> 00:10:52,559
are most enjoyable what do the people

293
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,519
which you know are very diverse band of

294
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:56,879
judges in this rigorous setting

295
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,639
what are they enjoying the most about

296
00:10:56,879 --> 00:10:59,519
the product it's a simple question in a

297
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:01,600
way

298
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,879
but when we think back to the retail

299
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,040
experience so consumer walks into retail

300
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:08,240
they see you know things that are high

301
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:10,078
thc

302
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,000
they're talking in terms of indica

303
00:11:10,078 --> 00:11:15,519
sativa hybrid

304
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,240
they're now using terpene dominance

305
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:20,399
and correlating that to personal and

306
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,200
targeted effects

307
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,879
worse there's marketing efforts

308
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:28,480
that use proprietary modalities to

309
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,720
categorize things

310
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,440
into targeted effects

311
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,079
if you peel the veneer you find there's

312
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,440
absolutely zero evidence

313
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:39,759
to support

314
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,680
that kind of marketing language but the

315
00:11:39,759 --> 00:11:43,200
marketers understand that there's a

316
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:44,958
great importance

317
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,079
for the consumers to parse this

318
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:49,919
incredibly diverse landscape of products

319
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,199
into effects

320
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:55,599
so people do want sleep aid they want to

321
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,839
be stimulated and focused

322
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,000
they want to be relaxed and calm they

323
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,160
want to be aroused they want to be

324
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
creative etc

325
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,519
the problem

326
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,480
is that this fundamentally

327
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,360
is

328
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:11,519
deceit let's just call it what it is

329
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:14,159
it's it's an earnest effort to meet

330
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,078
consumer demand but it's early stage

331
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,759
they have no tools or scientific

332
00:12:16,078 --> 00:12:20,638
evidence to support

333
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:22,000
that this flower will cause that outcome

334
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,440
and the other will cause a different

335
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,679
outcome

336
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,079
quickly i want to insert a little micro

337
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,159
thesis here which is my notion of the

338
00:12:28,078 --> 00:12:32,000
effect matrix

339
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:34,159
you know how do you determine what kind

340
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,039
of an effect a product is going to have

341
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,360
well

342
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:38,799
you have an endocannabinoid system it

343
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,440
has a tone

344
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:44,240
it's engendered that tone by virtue of

345
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,360
genetics your genetics as well as your

346
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
diet

347
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,959
there are other things that factor in

348
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,799
but those are giant forces

349
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,879
and i've actually talked with cannabis

350
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,958
clinicians who feel so passionately

351
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:57,600
about the diet component they don't want

352
00:12:54,958 --> 00:13:00,399
to work with phytocannabinoids until

353
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,720
the diet component is better understood

354
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,799
until people work on eating

355
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,959
in a more healthful way

356
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:08,319
because the benefits will be so greatly

357
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:09,759
reduced but

358
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:13,120
in any case

359
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,759
um the endocannabinoid system tone means

360
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,360
that your experience tab is going to be

361
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:20,799
different than mine and every other

362
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:22,560
person in some important way and that

363
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,759
that exact same product will act

364
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,359
differently

365
00:13:23,759 --> 00:13:27,838
that's only one variable in the effect

366
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,320
matrix next up we've got to deal with

367
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,880
the phytochemical inventory so what

368
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,399
chemicals are in this flower

369
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,838
but you're left with this

370
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,639
sort of uncomfortable reality where

371
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:40,079
we're only measuring a tiny fraction and

372
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,320
typically the things that are the

373
00:13:40,078 --> 00:13:43,759
largest molecular weight

374
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,399
in a product

375
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:49,600
um but you do not inherently have the

376
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,639
most bioactive or the best awareness of

377
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,800
the full range of secondary metabolism

378
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,959
and what those compounds can do for

379
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:57,679
people yet we're just so far from that

380
00:13:56,958 --> 00:14:00,319
and

381
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:03,039
a few examples are that you know gas and

382
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,959
fuel smells we now widely understand are

383
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,078
driven by compounds

384
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:10,159
they're detectable to human olfaction at

385
00:14:08,078 --> 00:14:13,679
parts per trillion

386
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:17,278
so for example thials and dilates if you

387
00:14:13,679 --> 00:14:19,120
have in a natural gas line

388
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:22,240
then now you can smell the otherwise

389
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,799
inert explosive gas because it's so

390
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,959
tiny of amount of files needed

391
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,879
to create that sensory awareness that

392
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:31,599
there's danger there's natural gas

393
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:33,759
leaking were being used

394
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,000
dials are rich in a very important

395
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,278
category of aromatic chemistry in

396
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,078
cannabis

397
00:14:37,278 --> 00:14:40,399
and

398
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,559
ultimately at a parts per trillion level

399
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,000
basis you can imagine where

400
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:46,559
25

401
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,120
of a consumer perceived aroma

402
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:52,078
could result in one billionth

403
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,839
of the total chemical inventory

404
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:56,319
of that sample

405
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:58,000
so this is a very important data point

406
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,360
that's certainly not reflected in a

407
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,198
chirping report

408
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,360
but there are many other examples like

409
00:15:01,198 --> 00:15:05,759
how esters with all these tropical and

410
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,919
sweet sugary and fruity notes or the

411
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,278
aldehydes things like green apple and

412
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,759
banana are

413
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:14,078
so prominent or a paper in 2012 that

414
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,480
summarized more than 50 of cannabis

415
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:17,439
aroma being aldehydes

416
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
um

417
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,279
there's all this other categorization so

418
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:23,759
the bottom line is we're measuring a

419
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:25,919
tiny bit of the phytochemical inventory

420
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,319
and we're making too big of a leap about

421
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:29,120
the representation and significance of

422
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,560
that

423
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,879
and when i just look around the other

424
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,758
consumer products i don't see

425
00:15:32,879 --> 00:15:37,600
nearly anybody except for say winemakers

426
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:39,519
being concerned with that in consumer

427
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,920
representation of wine

428
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,360
in brewers in representing that other

429
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:47,679
than to the ultra beer geeks cicerones

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,720
in their representation of beer

431
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:53,120
instead you find pretty commonly sensory

432
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,399
language but i'll save that for a later

433
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,480
risk

434
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,720
the third part of the effects matrix is

435
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,879
that you have dosage and

436
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:03,120
you know dosage is getting increasingly

437
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:05,278
better measured but really dosage is the

438
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,839
biggest variable in determining

439
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:09,679
the intensity of the effect full stop a

440
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:12,000
little tiny bit more and you may be

441
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:14,879
outside of the therapeutic window and

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,159
now result in increased awareness of

443
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,078
pain or anxiety as opposed to

444
00:16:18,159 --> 00:16:21,600
a decreased you know desirable

445
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:23,599
therapeutic outcome

446
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,680
so dosage and titration are huge but

447
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,959
then you have to throw in because we're

448
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:29,278
talking about

449
00:16:26,958 --> 00:16:31,278
altered states of consciousness when

450
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,759
we're evaluating cannabis product

451
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:34,958
qualities you have to deal with mindset

452
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,879
and setting

453
00:16:34,958 --> 00:16:38,239
similar to how the new psilocyte and

454
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:39,838
assisted therapy

455
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,600
modalities are working and you know they

456
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,600
work in curating beautiful music

457
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,040
playlists and having amazing

458
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,879
environments and blindfolds and

459
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:48,480
headphones and therapists

460
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:50,399
they're really working on that component

461
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,199
in a way that cannabis folks

462
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,320
i just genuinely don't see hardly at all

463
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,719
other than

464
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,480
you know a few circles in my life so

465
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:00,800
that's if you want to get to a targeted

466
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,759
effect that's an honest way to educate

467
00:17:00,799 --> 00:17:04,000
people

468
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,558
to you know observe their own experience

469
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,359
and take notes and start to understand

470
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:11,599
uh how to achieve that but the marketing

471
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:14,000
that stands in the way of a normal

472
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,159
consumer walking into a shop

473
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,838
and trying to attain

474
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,199
something that they either just find

475
00:17:17,838 --> 00:17:22,318
enjoyable

476
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,759
or even potentially therapeutically

477
00:17:22,318 --> 00:17:27,119
useful

478
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:28,798
is a giant obstacle currently in the

479
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,319
industry and this is really important to

480
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,240
cultivators

481
00:17:30,319 --> 00:17:34,000
because we're the ones who have to

482
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,319
create these products

483
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,720
we we're trying to you know essentially

484
00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:41,519
work within what is the most genetically

485
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,839
diverse horticultural crop on the planet

486
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:46,480
with tons and tons of different

487
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:48,639
production techniques and variables and

488
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,120
i think in general those of us who are

489
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,080
working hard at it are trying to delight

490
00:17:51,119 --> 00:17:54,719
people

491
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:56,960
we want to make things that are truly

492
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,798
enjoyable and useful but if there's no

493
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,120
measurement or mark

494
00:17:58,798 --> 00:18:02,879
to ascertain what that enjoyment is

495
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,798
correlated to

496
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,360
i think you're left with a lot of people

497
00:18:04,798 --> 00:18:09,359
who are working on a sample size of one

498
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:11,359
taking their own anecdote

499
00:18:09,359 --> 00:18:13,519
and expressing from that position and

500
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:15,918
that's great if you have say you know

501
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,160
the tremendous privilege of being in

502
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:20,080
this industry or since long before was

503
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,600
in industry and it's just been a

504
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:24,639
movement of

505
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:28,319
finding the entire range of possible

506
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,080
sensory experiences in cannabis possible

507
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:34,079
uh there's another great long word uh

508
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:36,879
phenomenologically qualified samples so

509
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:38,879
phenomenology is this idea of you study

510
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,320
your own experience

511
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:43,120
it's that's kind of

512
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:45,678
the gist but that's that's what i've

513
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:47,759
done you know my career in cannabis i

514
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:50,240
have always tried to

515
00:18:47,759 --> 00:18:52,879
understand myself as a baseline and not

516
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,599
project that that is relevant

517
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,200
or valid to others in many regards but

518
00:18:55,599 --> 00:19:01,759
for my own ability to understand what is

519
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:04,080
the most desirable cannabis character

520
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,319
how does that language connect to the

521
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:08,720
idea of product quality

522
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:11,200
and which plants are the most

523
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,558
exceptional plants and what are what is

524
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,759
the range

525
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,279
in the king escape or in the

526
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:18,000
expressiveness

527
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:20,079
of the plants and what are the more and

528
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
less intense expressions

529
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:25,359
of each of the core categories in that

530
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:27,759
range that's a kind of filtering that as

531
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:30,000
cultivators i think you inherently

532
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:31,440
are left with so then jumping back to

533
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,119
the white paper

534
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,558
and then i'll take address

535
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,798
there is a

536
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:39,839
really clear emphasis

537
00:19:36,798 --> 00:19:42,079
in this standout signal of what directly

538
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:45,119
correlates with consumer enjoyment

539
00:19:42,079 --> 00:19:47,439
uh it is very distinct from how you see

540
00:19:45,119 --> 00:19:51,038
cannabis being marketed currently

541
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,160
and it is 100 related to aroma

542
00:19:51,038 --> 00:19:56,240
aroma is different than flavor

543
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,759
when we're talking about sensory science

544
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,558
you know flavor

545
00:19:57,759 --> 00:20:03,038
say we're talking about again a beer or

546
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:05,839
ale and i understand the complexity of

547
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:08,079
correlating cannabis to alcohol but i

548
00:20:05,839 --> 00:20:09,839
just want to use that language because

549
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:12,798
it's very practical from a sensory

550
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:15,839
perspective but flavor has to do with

551
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:18,639
mouth feel or salt sweet

552
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:21,119
umami fat bitter etc

553
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
those things are actually flavor when we

554
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:24,479
really are talking about

555
00:20:22,798 --> 00:20:27,440
the character

556
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,919
of a cannabis flower product especially

557
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,840
we're talking about the aroma most

558
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,640
importantly by far

559
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:35,199
and

560
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,759
in fact thc potency

561
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,240
uh did not positively correlate

562
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:42,798
with consumer enjoyment

563
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,279
seven out of ten judges

564
00:20:42,798 --> 00:20:49,759
preferred samples when blinded and

565
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:52,879
randomized that were under 20 thc

566
00:20:49,759 --> 00:20:55,679
um there's a really important

567
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,919
idea that's at the base of that

568
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,759
which is that you know there's a

569
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:02,400
biosynthesis in the plant that's

570
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,640
creating and manufacturing all of these

571
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,360
different classes of compounds

572
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,120
so when the glucose the sugars and the

573
00:21:07,359 --> 00:21:11,759
photosynthates are

574
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,558
converting at the base of the glandular

575
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,759
head

576
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:18,158
at the tip of the stock of the trichome

577
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:20,000
you'll see this incredible enzymatic

578
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,080
process where the olivetolic acid and

579
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,798
the durano pyrophosphate

580
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:24,240
are

581
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,558
taking that glucose and turning that

582
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,400
into cdga

583
00:21:26,558 --> 00:21:31,678
this is the path by which the

584
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,919
biosynthesis of cannabinoids are created

585
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,640
here's an interesting piece and

586
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,159
this is a bit of a complex one i don't

587
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,080
have all the answers about or anything

588
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:42,880
but i am fascinated that

589
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:46,079
gpp durano pyrophosphate

590
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,559
is used for both the pathway to make

591
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:51,759
cannabinoids as well as to make

592
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:54,639
terpenoids and other aroma components

593
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:56,079
so imagine we're selecting plants for a

594
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,679
wholesale market

595
00:21:56,079 --> 00:22:00,639
that is pursuing

596
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,280
you know thc potency and strain names

597
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,280
correlating to value so if you want to

598
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:07,519
make the most money or make any money at

599
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:10,558
all you'd better have something well

600
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:12,400
north of 25 thc potency

601
00:22:10,558 --> 00:22:14,639
and then think back to the biosynthesis

602
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,200
well we're making decisions

603
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,520
that are essentially resulting in

604
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,840
products that incentivize

605
00:22:19,519 --> 00:22:26,319
the cannabinoid potency

606
00:22:21,839 --> 00:22:27,359
in a hierarchy over the aroma synthesis

607
00:22:26,319 --> 00:22:29,359
but

608
00:22:27,359 --> 00:22:31,199
it does not turn out to be the case if

609
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:35,119
we look at other literature

610
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,080
that thc potency neatly correlates

611
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:39,678
to intensity of effect either

612
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:42,319
there's this fantasy that we're

613
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:46,559
economizing as consumers

614
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:49,038
by purchasing a higher thc rich product

615
00:22:46,558 --> 00:22:50,960
when in fact you find that actually as

616
00:22:49,038 --> 00:22:54,079
you look deeper into the literature

617
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,240
there's numerous anecdotes about people

618
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:58,798
who find that while they love cannabis

619
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,480
and have a lifelong relationship with it

620
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:02,240
when they're consuming those products

621
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,640
they're very high thc

622
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,038
they're both having less desirable

623
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:10,080
experiences less enjoyment

624
00:23:07,038 --> 00:23:12,558
and essentially evoking anxiety that

625
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:14,079
cannabis is fantastic at assuaging in

626
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:16,480
some cases

627
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:19,519
i love intensity of effect i'm in no way

628
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:22,319
trying to diminish the pursuit of strong

629
00:23:19,519 --> 00:23:24,879
experiences i i micro dosing is great

630
00:23:22,319 --> 00:23:26,639
and all but i am somebody who loves the

631
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,840
whole range of expression and really

632
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:30,080
understand

633
00:23:27,839 --> 00:23:32,240
the consumer desire to feel things

634
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:35,199
deeply and richly

635
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:37,599
but the problem is that in our data

636
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,679
you can see which is again i believe to

637
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:42,319
be the most rigorous

638
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:44,400
at scale clinical evidence that i'm

639
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:45,839
aware of on the planet so far and maybe

640
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,840
there's others are always excited to

641
00:23:45,839 --> 00:23:49,759
learn more we need to

642
00:23:47,839 --> 00:23:51,918
do a lot more work ourselves

643
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:53,519
but we see that it really is the case

644
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:56,159
that the aroma

645
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:58,400
correlates with far more enjoyment and

646
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,600
that enjoyment correlates to both

647
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,400
intensity and diversity of effects

648
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:04,158
so

649
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,720
this is the beginning the tip of the

650
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,720
iceberg in terms of trying to tilt

651
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,038
this equation away from

652
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:13,519
uh there's actually a really wonderful

653
00:24:11,038 --> 00:24:16,240
woman named kristen yoder who has

654
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:18,400
a t-shirt line that says cannabis what

655
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,599
is it indica and sativa is lazy

656
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,080
marketing

657
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,678
i couldn't agree more i think this is

658
00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:26,079
one of the most important statements

659
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,880
that we have to attack

660
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:30,720
to get into serving people better but

661
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,760
then as cultivators

662
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,839
being able to produce the most amazing

663
00:24:33,759 --> 00:24:38,720
cannabis products you know on the earth

664
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:41,278
to really focus on the things

665
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,558
that are going to matter the most um

666
00:24:41,278 --> 00:24:44,319
so

667
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,678
uh i should take a breath ted i know

668
00:24:44,319 --> 00:24:47,359
that was the wrong

669
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,440
well i i kind of want to just go back

670
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:51,199
and try and

671
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
summarize and make sure i'm

672
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,759
understanding

673
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,079
uh because you covered a lot of

674
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:57,679
different things um

675
00:24:56,079 --> 00:25:00,798
and and some of the things that i want

676
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,720
to possibly highlight are one you

677
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:06,960
mentioned that we one we don't have uh

678
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:09,278
we don't have the right tools to capture

679
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,919
all of the sensory experiences

680
00:25:09,278 --> 00:25:13,278
analytically that are occurring

681
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,159
in this plant

682
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,919
um you talked about um

683
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,679
thiols and some of these other

684
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,759
aromatic

685
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,120
aspects and and this is some i'm coming

686
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:24,558
from a place of someone who does not

687
00:25:23,119 --> 00:25:27,119
have a very good sense of smell so this

688
00:25:24,558 --> 00:25:28,720
is difficult for me um

689
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:30,399
but

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
i i think that's a really important tool

691
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,159
and then one of the things that the

692
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,600
cultivation classic found that i just

693
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,200
want to re-emphasize that you that

694
00:25:35,599 --> 00:25:38,719
you've mentioned multiple times here is

695
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,519
that the

696
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,960
the most popular or the most coveted uh

697
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,359
cultivar

698
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,278
cultivars were not the highest potency

699
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:50,158
or highest thc so as an industry we've

700
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:51,839
been driving for like more thc more thc

701
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,400
uh but the reality of it when we from a

702
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:57,119
consumer perspective is that uh when

703
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,679
given a blind blind options so they

704
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:01,199
don't know the thc levels in them uh

705
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:03,440
people were consistently choosing ones

706
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,000
that were slightly lower thc and and

707
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:08,400
honestly this i know the alcohol

708
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:11,278
uh correlation is is challenging in some

709
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:14,880
way or comparison but for me i much

710
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:16,720
prefer a lager or an ale over an ipa and

711
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,159
that's because i enjoy the flavor

712
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,120
profile of it

713
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,440
more so than the heavy hoppy

714
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:25,199
bitterness associated with a lot of ipas

715
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,159
even though the alcohol percentage is

716
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,360
lower

717
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,278
i'm going to pay the same amount of

718
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:30,319
money for the

719
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:33,440
the beer

720
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:35,759
and i'm not going to get as much alcohol

721
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,038
which is a lot you know a lot of the

722
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:39,440
driver that for a lot of people and

723
00:26:37,038 --> 00:26:41,519
consuming um

724
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,360
so i think that richness riches of

725
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,558
experiences is an important conversation

726
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,240
there and

727
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:48,319
uh the other thing that i really want to

728
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,319
highlight that you mentioned was this

729
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,079
idea of titration so

730
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:54,240
when you you've talked we've talked

731
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:56,558
about this off air and you talk about

732
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,519
the biggest driver for on the effect

733
00:26:56,558 --> 00:27:01,599
matrix so how your your experience

734
00:26:59,519 --> 00:27:02,639
of smoking that joint or consuming that

735
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:04,719
cannabis

736
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,759
but is really

737
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,038
dosage

738
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:09,278
at the end of the day you know

739
00:27:07,038 --> 00:27:11,679
environment mood

740
00:27:09,278 --> 00:27:13,200
uh cultivar all of those things thc

741
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
percentage are all going to be factors

742
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,000
but but like you've told me multiple

743
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:19,119
times dosage is the biggest factor and

744
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
people should be aware of that when

745
00:27:19,119 --> 00:27:21,678
consuming and i think that's really

746
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,278
important so

747
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,559
how do we address all of these

748
00:27:23,278 --> 00:27:27,038
challenges

749
00:27:24,558 --> 00:27:28,879
then to give us a better model for

750
00:27:27,038 --> 00:27:32,319
understanding

751
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:32,320
our experience with this plant

752
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:38,319
great summary and great question

753
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,038
one quick caveat i want to stuff in

754
00:27:38,319 --> 00:27:42,960
before responding to that is that you

755
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:46,079
know it was a huge revolution to get

756
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:49,840
access to chemistry analytics

757
00:27:46,079 --> 00:27:52,000
i remember when i was with ray bowser at

758
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:54,000
the time of od diesel and there was a

759
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,440
circle of us working around pat

760
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,759
marshall's lab

761
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,038
in wilsonville oregon called sunrise

762
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,278
analytical

763
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,919
this was actually the i believe that

764
00:28:01,278 --> 00:28:06,079
operating well in advance of steep hill

765
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,240
in california and was the first

766
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,798
analytical testing i'm aware of in the

767
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,919
u.s to try to we were looking at 64

768
00:28:10,798 --> 00:28:14,398
compounds

769
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,679
you know and we were really informed by

770
00:28:14,398 --> 00:28:18,479
the way that

771
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,559
phenotypic plasticity was occurring in

772
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,720
our cultivation efforts that

773
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:25,359
a single cultivar

774
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:26,960
taken cuttings from that cultivar shared

775
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:28,319
with different gardeners would produce

776
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
very different

777
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,079
range of chemistry

778
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,240
and that's a really important insight

779
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:35,839
and as growers i think it's really

780
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,399
exciting to talk about analytical

781
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:41,519
chemistry as a metric by which we can

782
00:28:38,398 --> 00:28:43,678
measure performance and etc there's many

783
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:45,839
exciting components there and not to

784
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:48,000
throw it out but what i want to suggest

785
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:50,879
now is that like even when i founded a

786
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,079
dispensary called pharma on uh hawthorne

787
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,679
in portland

788
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:56,558
this was the dispensary of the very

789
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:58,720
first terpene categorization system

790
00:28:56,558 --> 00:29:00,879
first the first dispensaries i'm aware

791
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,480
of that just displayed terpene data for

792
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,559
all flower products

793
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:07,759
uh all tested at one lab was one of my

794
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:09,839
big notions of how do we get people

795
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:12,079
into utilizing cannabis in a way that's

796
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:13,599
like lifelong sustainable relationships

797
00:29:12,079 --> 00:29:15,599
and not just serving

798
00:29:13,599 --> 00:29:17,599
uh one population or another but being a

799
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:19,519
resource for everybody

800
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:21,519
i look back cad and i think

801
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,599
i did the best that i could at the time

802
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,798
and you know and

803
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:27,519
tremendously indebted to dr ethan russo

804
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:29,519
and

805
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,278
raphael mashulim and others who had laid

806
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,839
the groundwork to try to understand from

807
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,759
that perspective but i tell you now i

808
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:37,759
look back and i think

809
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:40,000
it's not that it was a mistake it was a

810
00:29:37,759 --> 00:29:41,440
step in the past

811
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:44,319
that now

812
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,440
i think our whole industry has become

813
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:50,000
overly reliant on very fallible

814
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,558
analytical lab results

815
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,278
the the output we see in an analytical

816
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:56,879
lab result will vary from lab to lab

817
00:29:55,278 --> 00:29:59,278
from crop to crop

818
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,039
in ways that simply are astounding if

819
00:29:59,278 --> 00:30:03,919
you look at the level of data i've been

820
00:30:01,038 --> 00:30:05,839
able to digest over the last decade

821
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,520
i can share with you that it's just it

822
00:30:05,839 --> 00:30:09,519
means very little

823
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:12,000
i there's a particular way to

824
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,000
demonstrate an analytical testing

825
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,278
process that from a consumer perspective

826
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,519
is useful but that's not what's

827
00:30:15,278 --> 00:30:19,359
happening in general it is pretty

828
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:22,398
chaotic when we don't have third party

829
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:24,240
regulatory oversight over lab testing

830
00:30:22,398 --> 00:30:26,798
and when we have even with after the

831
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,200
american herbal pharmacopoeia standard

832
00:30:26,798 --> 00:30:30,000
huge variants and methods

833
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,919
and

834
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,079
in any case what i'm trying to say is

835
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:36,799
what would be far more useful

836
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:39,278
is an accurate sensory expression

837
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:40,639
in describing that and just to take on

838
00:30:39,278 --> 00:30:42,798
beer because i actually love beard i've

839
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,200
been learning a lot from scientists

840
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:47,839
involved with hops in the last years

841
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,000
um you know and beer if you have a lager

842
00:30:47,839 --> 00:30:51,599
that's a brand promise the consumer now

843
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,839
has an expectation

844
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,959
of that brand it should be crisp

845
00:30:53,839 --> 00:30:57,759
refreshing

846
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,159
moderate abv something like five percent

847
00:30:57,759 --> 00:31:02,640
it should be a crystal clear um you know

848
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,159
cold fermented product and there's a

849
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,320
certain range you could find more

850
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,640
biscuits or certain notes that are going

851
00:31:06,319 --> 00:31:11,278
to stand out but that's an expectation

852
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,440
now that the consumer has and the

853
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,919
producer is obliged to fulfill that if

854
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,240
it is a logger if it's a hazy ipa

855
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:20,480
however now we have a product that we

856
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,759
have an expectation it's going to be a

857
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:26,720
viscous liqueur that's thick mouthfeel

858
00:31:23,759 --> 00:31:30,640
with low bitterness with massive hop

859
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,558
aroma and mouth feel characteristics

860
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,600
now as a producer i can work within that

861
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,759
range

862
00:31:33,599 --> 00:31:37,678
and i would say that we haven't moved to

863
00:31:35,759 --> 00:31:39,519
this level of maturity

864
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,278
in the massive amount of genetic

865
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:44,240
diversity we have in cannabis into these

866
00:31:41,278 --> 00:31:45,919
archetypal sensory buckets yet

867
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,480
but you can imagine how much more

868
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:51,120
rewarding it is to people

869
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,360
who are purchasing the products when

870
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:54,558
say they're looking for their peak gas

871
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:56,479
expression

872
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,558
and they look and find that there's a

873
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,278
range of gassy products but in fact one

874
00:31:58,558 --> 00:32:03,839
is much much more expressive as i saw

875
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:05,519
recently at a cultivators curatorial

876
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,759
event in san francisco

877
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,440
the node labs and cultivated industries

878
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:11,759
was involved with there was one product

879
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,200
that was so clearly the dominant dial

880
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:16,000
rich product but then there's like 10

881
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:17,600
others and this one was so much louder

882
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:19,919
but i would say a majority of people

883
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,678
wouldn't have noticed that

884
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:23,440
and that's that's really interesting to

885
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,640
me and then you look to how cannabis

886
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,480
producers

887
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:28,559
curate their products

888
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,960
i hate to say this but as you know a

889
00:32:28,558 --> 00:32:32,240
grower myself it's sort of like we rely

890
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,079
on our own

891
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,200
sense

892
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:37,678
disproportionately because we haven't

893
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,360
studied sensory science

894
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,480
and don't have the tools to make

895
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:43,119
relevant

896
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,960
the language of sensory to the consumer

897
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:47,278
in a way that's very very useful you

898
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,960
said we literally have one person saying

899
00:32:47,278 --> 00:32:52,398
this one's the [ __ ] this is the best

900
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:54,960
product look at you know i i know take

901
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:56,479
it for me and sort of like well yeah but

902
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:58,399
when you look into sensory science you

903
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,919
learn that we all have

904
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:01,518
certain things you can smell and not

905
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,799
smell so well and when you say you can't

906
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,240
smell so well

907
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:05,599
i a little bit want to challenge that

908
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:07,839
because i think

909
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:10,398
the sense of smell is a very subjective

910
00:33:07,839 --> 00:33:12,240
interesting terrain to dive into

911
00:33:10,398 --> 00:33:14,558
and there's an amazing movie for those

912
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:17,519
of you who want to geek out on smell

913
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:19,678
called les parfums that just came out

914
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:22,880
that actually features this protagonist

915
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:25,519
who's a nose she's a perfumer and that

916
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,120
is the most elite uh training you can

917
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,038
find for century on the planet and the

918
00:33:27,119 --> 00:33:31,359
well beneath that is wine well beneath

919
00:33:29,038 --> 00:33:33,759
that is beer cannabis isn't even really

920
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:36,000
on the radar yet i mean it is but it's

921
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:36,798
just not showing up in that way

922
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,960
um

923
00:33:36,798 --> 00:33:42,000
so it's just a great uh sort of

924
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:44,720
exploration of what a nose

925
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,240
must be able to achieve to essentially

926
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,079
uh demonstrate

927
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,880
effectiveness and sensory but in sensory

928
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:53,119
you use typically panels of people

929
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:56,000
uh you know 20 or 30 people would be a

930
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:58,319
pretty ideal uh size group and there are

931
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:00,319
masters who have really taken this on

932
00:33:58,319 --> 00:34:02,079
with incredible discipline

933
00:34:00,319 --> 00:34:03,839
in the world of craft beer that i've

934
00:34:02,079 --> 00:34:05,839
been looking to for a while

935
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:07,599
uh lindsey barr i believe is one that

936
00:34:05,839 --> 00:34:09,918
i'll just throw a name out

937
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:12,559
my good friend nick ziegler who is the

938
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:14,158
head of r d at yakima chief hops there's

939
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:17,199
another great one

940
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:19,440
drew hole is a man who's composed of

941
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,799
sensory science team for the company

942
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,398
true terpenes

943
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:25,440
these people all have real world

944
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:27,440
experience that are you know based in uh

945
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,280
characterizing products from that

946
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,720
perspective but in any case what i'm

947
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,720
trying to say is that

948
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:36,000
it sure would be useful

949
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,878
if as cultivators and as an industry we

950
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:40,159
leaned way more toward the sensory side

951
00:34:38,878 --> 00:34:42,319
of the equation

952
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,119
not to abandon analytics both are

953
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,359
important like for example i'm a breeder

954
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,079
and i'm very privileged to be working on

955
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:52,159
some at-scale hep genetics

956
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,599
program this year in addition to things

957
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:55,760
that i'm doing

958
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,480
still at proof cultivar because i'm now

959
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,560
a consultant and have the ability to do

960
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:02,480
more exciting and different things

961
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:05,440
after having recently found an

962
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,119
unbelievable head grower uh who's named

963
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,280
sam hoefler who i

964
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,440
if those of you who have not listened to

965
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,680
the podcast you hosted with sam

966
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,039
he in one paragraph i think says some of

967
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,199
the most innovative thought about

968
00:35:15,039 --> 00:35:19,119
irrigation practices i've heard that

969
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:20,719
once he came on and

970
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,800
the team has gotten really strong i've

971
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:24,559
been able to focus in areas that i'm

972
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:27,119
looking forward to developing more which

973
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:29,440
is more r d stuff and engagement with

974
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:31,039
the world and different visions

975
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,039
but any case in the hemp breeding you

976
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:34,800
want to have both sensory

977
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,800
and analytics

978
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,560
in your funnel so that you can truly

979
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,280
find those most differentiated plants

980
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,519
but

981
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,240
back to on the importance of aroma

982
00:35:41,519 --> 00:35:46,960
i would say that if you do not have

983
00:35:44,239 --> 00:35:49,679
aroma as a key target and you're working

984
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,199
in say a smokable hemp or a craft flower

985
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:54,639
space

986
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:56,319
then you're really missing the point i

987
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:59,440
hate to say this we have an instagram

988
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,960
culture that looks at frosty flowers and

989
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:04,079
you know i'll never forget when like

990
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,440
this snow was big or when bc like

991
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,760
beesters was coming through and there

992
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,838
was this huge amount of trichomes

993
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,480
and it had no character at all it was

994
00:36:09,838 --> 00:36:15,119
like this inert biomass it had also no

995
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:17,599
effect like it was just it looked so

996
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,838
good and it was so disappointing

997
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,680
we continue to see plants bred from the

998
00:36:19,838 --> 00:36:23,519
white i'm just going to call it out the

999
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,759
white it's a soulless plant to me i've

1000
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:28,559
grown so many versions of it i've grown

1001
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,800
so many hybrids from it yes you'll see a

1002
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:32,960
dominant trait that increases the

1003
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,119
trichome production of this visible

1004
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,679
resin content but it's not about what's

1005
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:39,838
visible it's what's inside that matters

1006
00:36:37,679 --> 00:36:43,199
you can't judge the character of the

1007
00:36:39,838 --> 00:36:45,039
finest wine by looking at the bottle or

1008
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:47,439
looking at the the quality of the skin

1009
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:49,199
of the grape it's absurd

1010
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,760
it's the aroma

1011
00:36:49,199 --> 00:36:52,960
and the magic of all this chemistry but

1012
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,880
you know i think

1013
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,480
actually to just jump for to another

1014
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,400
level of depth

1015
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:00,000
this is partly a reflection on our

1016
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,800
culture right this comes from an

1017
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,838
industrial culture that has been focused

1018
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:07,039
on throughput and quantitative goals in

1019
00:37:05,838 --> 00:37:08,719
many ways

1020
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:11,599
that are very distinct from qualitative

1021
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:14,559
growth like when we bred many different

1022
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:18,240
plants for food systems

1023
00:37:14,559 --> 00:37:21,358
flavor and nutrition and aroma were

1024
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:22,959
nearly left out or were among the last

1025
00:37:21,358 --> 00:37:24,799
items to be considered and that's

1026
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:27,358
appropriate you have to focus on

1027
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:31,039
agronomic targets first

1028
00:37:27,358 --> 00:37:33,598
but to miss what the heirloom tomato is

1029
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:35,599
as opposed to the roma or the not the

1030
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:37,440
roma is actually the tomato but to this

1031
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,599
sort of flavorless you know grocery

1032
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,039
market tomatoes it's just it's we're

1033
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,359
like missing

1034
00:37:41,039 --> 00:37:44,159
this substance in life which is about

1035
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,838
being

1036
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:49,118
present centered

1037
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:51,199
and using your senses as a vehicle for

1038
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,519
enlightenment dare i say

1039
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:55,199
um this little bit correlates and even

1040
00:37:53,519 --> 00:37:58,079
further afield with like

1041
00:37:55,199 --> 00:38:00,719
the fact that we in america especially

1042
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,480
are in a very puritanical culture

1043
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,358
and i think we need to be cognizant of

1044
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:07,760
the impact of that kind of culture

1045
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:09,838
that suppresses the senses that values

1046
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,839
work above all things but you know and

1047
00:38:09,838 --> 00:38:13,759
here i am in europe there's a very

1048
00:38:11,838 --> 00:38:16,480
different balance of power

1049
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,079
here there's a lot more focus if you are

1050
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,000
in various places in europe you go to

1051
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,000
the cheese shop you go to the bread

1052
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,480
maker you go to you think of course

1053
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,440
there's big chains and everything but

1054
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,159
in general there's a much higher sort of

1055
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:32,400
level of development and sensibility

1056
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:35,279
applied to the expression of craft

1057
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,000
products i would say across the board

1058
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,359
and

1059
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,519
i think that's a little bit less

1060
00:38:37,358 --> 00:38:40,480
puritanical and it's a bit of a radical

1061
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:42,400
notion

1062
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:44,639
to embrace the senses but back to that

1063
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,680
yates quote sort of like there's all

1064
00:38:44,639 --> 00:38:49,838
this magic in life and magic is a tricky

1065
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:51,519
word i know for a lot of people

1066
00:38:49,838 --> 00:38:54,320
but i'll just say that there's

1067
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:57,039
surprising depth and dimension

1068
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:59,119
once you choose to focus on the sensory

1069
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,639
experience of a product

1070
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:03,519
that opens

1071
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:06,400
that is its own path you know it's

1072
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:08,880
infinite in its range of expression

1073
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,400
you'll never find all of the possible

1074
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,240
expressions no matter how hard you work

1075
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,440
and i've really tried to do that my own

1076
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:16,879
way in cannabis and i'm now a national

1077
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,320
judge for the national cannabis

1078
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,079
competition i've

1079
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,000
put on these events i've done all these

1080
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,000
things to try to get to a position where

1081
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,639
i can truly qualify

1082
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,519
these different kinds of aroma ranges

1083
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,920
but

1084
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:32,480
it's infinite but that is exciting

1085
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,480
that's where the passion of a cultivator

1086
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,079
comes from me no kidding the most

1087
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,358
exciting thing about cultivation has

1088
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,560
always been discovering a new phenotypic

1089
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,679
expression

1090
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:46,639
and a particular aroma diversity or

1091
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:48,559
intensity that's novel or that enriches

1092
00:39:46,639 --> 00:39:50,480
my sense of what's possible

1093
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:52,000
that is absolutely the key of course

1094
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,199
i've also very much focused on

1095
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,358
therapeutic

1096
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,559
use and having consistent chemotype

1097
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,639
expressions

1098
00:39:56,559 --> 00:40:00,480
because i want to be a resource for

1099
00:39:58,639 --> 00:40:01,358
patients they're using it for quality of

1100
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,679
life

1101
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:06,078
improvement in a reliable way

1102
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:08,480
but the reason i would also

1103
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,960
jump to organic crop production

1104
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,838
being so very important is that

1105
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,000
in decades of cultivation i have always

1106
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:16,799
used both organic cultivation methods

1107
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,719
and

1108
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,760
synthetic mineral salt fertilizers and

1109
00:40:18,719 --> 00:40:25,279
hydro methods i've always done both

1110
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:26,720
but for an elite consumer-focused

1111
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,000
flower brand

1112
00:40:26,719 --> 00:40:30,239
to not

1113
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:32,318
value organic cultivation is it insane

1114
00:40:30,239 --> 00:40:33,199
to me to see this industry develop in a

1115
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:34,719
way

1116
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,399
not just jumping directly into a

1117
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:39,838
critique of the industry

1118
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:42,240
i there's there's this huge miss that's

1119
00:40:39,838 --> 00:40:44,639
going on when we're relying on two-part

1120
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:48,719
synthetic mineral salt fertilizers

1121
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:51,199
with very very thin emphasis on biology

1122
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:53,279
or say rhizophage or

1123
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,919
endophytes you know the endophytic

1124
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,640
organisms that intracellularly

1125
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,200
congregate inside of the plant

1126
00:40:58,639 --> 00:41:03,279
and the fungal networks that the plants

1127
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:06,078
have evolved from the beginning of time

1128
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,160
and partnership and synergy with

1129
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,920
these things clearly

1130
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:12,480
up and down regulate

1131
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,920
aroma synthesis and are a part of the

1132
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,960
equation

1133
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:19,519
i saw this linkedin article recently by

1134
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,000
arroyo who are amazing team doing a lot

1135
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:23,679
of data-driven cultivation support they

1136
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,400
asked what's your favorite media and

1137
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:27,759
there's like it's rock wool

1138
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,000
core

1139
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,760
perlite and another hydroponic substrate

1140
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,639
i believe hydroton

1141
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:37,119
um there was like there was no sort of

1142
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:39,279
uh you know living soil or

1143
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:40,800
biology rich media included and i

1144
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,560
thought what a miss

1145
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,280
like this is absurd that we come to this

1146
00:41:42,559 --> 00:41:47,519
place where a product that has an

1147
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,280
enjoyment that is most increased by

1148
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,719
aroma intensity

1149
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,880
we're using

1150
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:56,159
essentially production methods

1151
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:58,720
that are less effective at evoking that

1152
00:41:56,159 --> 00:42:00,559
kind of passion from the plant and i

1153
00:41:58,719 --> 00:42:02,559
talked to others i mean if you talk to

1154
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,239
kevin jodrey or folks

1155
00:42:02,559 --> 00:42:06,400
been around a long time i think you

1156
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:08,279
consistently hear this message that if

1157
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,639
you're really looking for the best

1158
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:11,760
organoleptic expressions

1159
00:42:10,639 --> 00:42:13,598
the best

1160
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,040
aroma intensity and diversity in

1161
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,400
cannabis

1162
00:42:15,039 --> 00:42:20,000
absolutely need to use uh high biology

1163
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,318
you know whether it's a

1164
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:25,280
biology forward living soil soilless

1165
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:26,318
substrate or you're you know working

1166
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,079
like

1167
00:42:26,318 --> 00:42:30,480
so many amazing farmers like green

1168
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,440
source or you know biovortex or others

1169
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:35,920
using regenerative farm practices

1170
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,000
to really uh support

1171
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:40,480
that sort of uh expression in the

1172
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,960
product and i i wish there was the white

1173
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:44,480
paper that could evaluate that dynamic

1174
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,400
that may well be something i'll get to

1175
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,599
work on in the future because i can't

1176
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:50,880
wait to come out with the kind of

1177
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,480
clarity i can now speak about aroma with

1178
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,318
with regard to organic crop production

1179
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,719
i'm confident that's a significant

1180
00:42:54,318 --> 00:42:59,119
variable and that the industry has

1181
00:42:56,719 --> 00:43:00,959
essentially taken the cheap and easy way

1182
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:04,160
towards you know there's this fear of

1183
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,639
managing the agronomic crop balancing

1184
00:43:04,159 --> 00:43:09,199
of a rich organic program that is

1185
00:43:06,639 --> 00:43:11,598
well-founded it does take a lot of work

1186
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:14,159
so jeremy real quick um a bit of

1187
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,599
rational yeah so you went though

1188
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:19,759
recently with your facility from

1189
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:22,400
uh you know organic bottled nutrient

1190
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,319
program to more of a living soil

1191
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,838
methodology

1192
00:43:24,318 --> 00:43:27,838
essentially moving towards that that

1193
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:30,799
biological aspect that you talk about

1194
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,838
with aroma expression did you notice a

1195
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:33,280
change

1196
00:43:31,838 --> 00:43:35,358
in

1197
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,519
your your cultivars and how they were

1198
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:40,000
expressed when you made that change made

1199
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:41,759
that switch i can speak anecdotally

1200
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,719
about that the reality is we have so

1201
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:46,160
many new cultivars at the same time we

1202
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:48,719
have this new program and the new

1203
00:43:46,159 --> 00:43:50,960
cultivars continue to get more and more

1204
00:43:48,719 --> 00:43:52,239
expressive as my experience okay over

1205
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:55,039
the years

1206
00:43:52,239 --> 00:43:57,118
but yes i just want to say that i think

1207
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,679
that is definitely the case

1208
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,240
but now if we could just shift to well

1209
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:04,159
gosh here organic cultivation can

1210
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,479
improve that expression

1211
00:44:04,159 --> 00:44:09,039
look at what happens after the plant is

1212
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,920
cut and how that veers from say ancient

1213
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:14,480
cannabis culture it would milk the

1214
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,039
freshly grown plant it wouldn't even cut

1215
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:20,079
or harvest that plant but rather you

1216
00:44:17,039 --> 00:44:23,440
know gather charis by hand and create

1217
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:25,760
you know hashish and actually create a

1218
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,599
sort of means of a sort of shelf

1219
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:30,720
stability by using the rind of the

1220
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,880
product itself to capture all of that

1221
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:35,199
freshly milked whole plant phytochemical

1222
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,800
inventory that over time gets more and

1223
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:38,719
more interesting

1224
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,599
but there's this word i love to have is

1225
00:44:38,719 --> 00:44:43,759
fidelity it has low fidelity to the

1226
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,640
flower itself it becomes its own thing

1227
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,880
it's wine it's fermentation almost it's

1228
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:51,440
there's so much going on i know before

1229
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:53,280
frenchie passed there was up to 50

1230
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:55,519
compounds identified

1231
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,519
uniquely in hashish that started with

1232
00:44:55,519 --> 00:44:59,199
the terpenoid hashishin

1233
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,119
that do not exist in the planet that

1234
00:44:59,199 --> 00:45:02,838
were showing up in the interactions of

1235
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,358
all these vocs on the side of the

1236
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:06,559
hashish but that's very distinct from

1237
00:45:05,358 --> 00:45:08,799
rosin

1238
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:11,440
and the solventless outcomes that are

1239
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:14,400
very high fidelity to the flower

1240
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,720
that actually are capturing that but

1241
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,800
here's the problem with flour i think

1242
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:20,639
when you look at even this is a part of

1243
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,440
frenchie's teaching and anybody who's in

1244
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:22,879
the

1245
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,240
sort of hash world

1246
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,160
it's that there's too damn much

1247
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:28,879
oxidative surface area

1248
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,719
the heads of the trichomes are you know

1249
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:33,039
a thin veneer

1250
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:35,199
it's cuticle that easily breaks down the

1251
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:38,559
oxidative forces and

1252
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:41,199
then releases the vocs and the aroma

1253
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:44,078
so i authored a white paper last year

1254
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:47,039
in partnership with dr ethan russo

1255
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:49,200
and we created a novel solvent-less

1256
00:45:47,039 --> 00:45:50,719
process and i should share this with you

1257
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:52,639
too because it has

1258
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,318
in the back part of it i've

1259
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:56,318
open sourced many of the production

1260
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,920
targets we've used at proof

1261
00:45:56,318 --> 00:46:00,400
uh that we've evolved over the years

1262
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,920
with lots of data and insight using very

1263
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:05,760
specific uh whether it's vpd or ppfd or

1264
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,519
every ingredient we use in the program

1265
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,359
including the kiss media

1266
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:11,199
and i mean just

1267
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,880
open source that whole program because

1268
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,480
there's still so much

1269
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:16,640
you can't still can't just implement

1270
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,880
that but anyways in this paper

1271
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:21,679
we showed you the chemistry

1272
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,680
that is in the typical flower sample

1273
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,719
it's very technically dried or dried as

1274
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:30,000
well as it can be um using existing

1275
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:30,799
equipment and and say proof that's

1276
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,039
it's

1277
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,680
above average for where i see a lot of

1278
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:38,559
the drying process in the industry going

1279
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:40,719
you lose that minimum about 50 percent

1280
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:42,400
of the mono terpenes by the time you're

1281
00:46:40,719 --> 00:46:43,919
done with drawing

1282
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,079
but then if we use the language of the

1283
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,880
hops industry they have a word for

1284
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:51,200
spoiled hops or an idea for spoiled hops

1285
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,358
that's related to a loss of more than 50

1286
00:46:51,199 --> 00:46:55,838
of the aromatic inventory

1287
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,440
it's nearly spoiled by the time we

1288
00:46:55,838 --> 00:47:00,000
freaking dry it

1289
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,400
that's a giant issue this is why whole

1290
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,838
plant fresh frozen has become such a

1291
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,160
giant deal

1292
00:47:03,838 --> 00:47:08,799
you see living resin which is you know

1293
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:12,000
hydrocarbon distillate mixed with whole

1294
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,160
plant fresh frozen aromatic fractions

1295
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,639
include more than terpenes of course

1296
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:17,920
blended in and people grossly prefer

1297
00:47:16,639 --> 00:47:19,279
those products and all the consumer

1298
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:21,200
market data

1299
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,839
but that's still nowhere near to the

1300
00:47:21,199 --> 00:47:25,519
qualitative depth of the rosin which you

1301
00:47:23,838 --> 00:47:27,759
know doesn't separate those things out

1302
00:47:25,519 --> 00:47:29,599
or you can but it doesn't have to the

1303
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,520
batters that are i'd say my favorite

1304
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:33,760
versions of high fidelity

1305
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:35,199
aroma forward rosin products

1306
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,839
uh don't

1307
00:47:35,199 --> 00:47:38,960
in any case we uh using ethan's

1308
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:41,519
leadership

1309
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,079
developed a method for cryokeeps it

1310
00:47:41,519 --> 00:47:46,079
actually uses whole plant fresh frozen

1311
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,119
but doesn't go into water hash because

1312
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:51,839
water unfortunately is also another

1313
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,920
solvent and yes even when you're making

1314
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:56,880
water house you're losing a bunch of the

1315
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,680
water-soluble aromatic compounds and we

1316
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:01,280
show you that data it's all in the paper

1317
00:47:59,679 --> 00:48:03,519
and we we paid a lot of money to life

1318
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:06,079
skill labs to be able to

1319
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:07,280
illustrate that actually we preserve

1320
00:48:06,079 --> 00:48:09,920
that 50

1321
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,559
otherwise lost monoterpene inventory

1322
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,519
which on an analytical lab result is the

1323
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,720
best metric to identify from a producer

1324
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:19,440
perspective

1325
00:48:16,719 --> 00:48:20,399
our success at retaining aroma

1326
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:22,240
so

1327
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,680
i i just want to suggest that we're

1328
00:48:22,239 --> 00:48:26,558
moving into a conversation where the

1329
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:29,759
supply chain itself needs to evolve

1330
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:32,319
to support the best quality of product

1331
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:34,000
or vets let's actually distinguish

1332
00:48:32,318 --> 00:48:36,239
quality according to my friend nick

1333
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,358
siegler and i think he's correct uh

1334
00:48:36,239 --> 00:48:42,558
should be more narrowly applied as in

1335
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:45,199
quality analysis and quality control

1336
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:46,839
to particular steps in the producer

1337
00:48:45,199 --> 00:48:49,759
ecosystem

1338
00:48:46,838 --> 00:48:51,599
character is actually a more effective

1339
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:53,599
adjective to describe

1340
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:55,599
the outcome of an organoleptic

1341
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,200
expression so you're dealing with

1342
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:00,000
product character when you're talking

1343
00:48:57,199 --> 00:49:01,838
about aroma really i i sometimes

1344
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,358
mistakenly interchangeably use those

1345
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:05,119
words and i think everybody else does

1346
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:06,558
too but i just think it's important to

1347
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,480
bookmark that

1348
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,000
in any case um

1349
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:12,000
the character

1350
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:14,079
of the product going in the supply chain

1351
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:15,838
once i've cut it down dried it say

1352
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,920
you've dried it not so well well now

1353
00:49:15,838 --> 00:49:19,759
you've lost more than that 50 i'm

1354
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:22,000
talking about and now it's getting

1355
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:23,680
packed and then it's going to go through

1356
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,358
you know the wholesale channels and it's

1357
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:27,519
going to eventually be distributed

1358
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:29,440
through retail and then it's typically

1359
00:49:27,519 --> 00:49:31,679
still in a glass jar

1360
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,838
at least in oregon in our deli style

1361
00:49:31,679 --> 00:49:36,480
often there's lights involved definitely

1362
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:38,719
there's no temperature control involved

1363
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:40,800
and things are oxidating oxidizing

1364
00:49:38,719 --> 00:49:42,558
radically so a quick experiment i did at

1365
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:46,079
home anybody can do this

1366
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:48,960
cut down a fresh freshly dried plant

1367
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:51,920
excuse me cut down a fresh plant dry it

1368
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,480
and then put one section into the

1369
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,720
refrigerator in an airtight light proof

1370
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,880
container and then put another just on

1371
00:49:56,719 --> 00:50:01,519
your shelf at ambient temperature

1372
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:03,760
and my experience is consistently that

1373
00:50:01,519 --> 00:50:05,920
within two to three weeks the flower

1374
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:08,160
that's stored at ambient temperature

1375
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:11,200
does not smell anything like it did when

1376
00:50:08,159 --> 00:50:13,118
all that incredible product character

1377
00:50:11,199 --> 00:50:14,799
was expressed before and most of that's

1378
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,039
lost certain things are more resilient

1379
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:20,160
than others like terpenoline the haze

1380
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:21,440
and jack inspired aromas are very stable

1381
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,920
i have products that have been around

1382
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:25,760
for years in the vault that still smell

1383
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,039
like that terpenoid rich floral

1384
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,079
intensity

1385
00:50:27,039 --> 00:50:30,639
but

1386
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,480
in general the nuance in character goes

1387
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:35,519
and it goes fast

1388
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,920
so you started by drying and then losing

1389
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,079
most then we've kicked it to the curb

1390
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:42,159
past that comparing it to hops which is

1391
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:44,480
like pennies on the dollar

1392
00:50:42,159 --> 00:50:46,639
relative to the wholesale value of the

1393
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,480
cannabis products for mature

1394
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:51,279
premium cannabis flour

1395
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,358
they pack it in mylar zero degrees once

1396
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:55,359
it's you know in noble gases the moment

1397
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:57,199
it's finished drying and they do

1398
00:50:55,358 --> 00:50:59,838
long-term shell stability trials and

1399
00:50:57,199 --> 00:51:01,279
validate when it becomes spoiled and all

1400
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:04,078
the stuff that the cannabis industry

1401
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:06,400
doesn't do or brewers who put fresh beer

1402
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:09,200
out on the pack on the shelf here's pro

1403
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:11,680
tip look at the bottom of a can of beer

1404
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:14,000
you'll see the date it was released

1405
00:51:11,679 --> 00:51:16,719
buy fresh beer and tell me you can't

1406
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,280
taste a difference and not fresh beer by

1407
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:20,959
fresh maybe 30 or certainly under 60

1408
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,880
days but there's beer on the shelf

1409
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,358
that's 90 plus and if you're drinking

1410
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:27,358
say a craft ipa massive difference and

1411
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:30,000
they understand that so if you're like

1412
00:51:27,358 --> 00:51:32,558
ben edmonds at breakside brewery you go

1413
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,800
reclaim your product at day 45 if it's a

1414
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,720
fresh ipa because you don't want to have

1415
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,160
that poor representation of your brand

1416
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,838
we don't see this

1417
00:51:38,159 --> 00:51:42,558
in cannabis yet you just sell it and it

1418
00:51:39,838 --> 00:51:45,599
goes and it's beat to hell and it smells

1419
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:47,599
like alfalfa hay or inert were worse it

1420
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:50,640
had too much moisture now it's got some

1421
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:53,039
blue cheese or ammonia notes so these

1422
00:51:50,639 --> 00:51:54,558
are the off notes that i want consumers

1423
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,639
to look out for

1424
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:58,559
what could we do to change this well

1425
00:51:56,639 --> 00:52:00,639
we would get more advanced with our

1426
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:01,920
drawing using water activity more

1427
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,759
frequently

1428
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,559
we would work more with like the

1429
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:08,559
cryokeef method and these solventless

1430
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:10,559
products that in concentrate

1431
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:12,400
constantly move through a cold chain all

1432
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:14,800
the way to the end point of use

1433
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,400
i am so proud of the rosin that i built

1434
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,079
that proof because

1435
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,400
with this team which includes you know

1436
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:23,359
our incredible hashishin uh fuji

1437
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:25,119
bondwater and uh our operator val and

1438
00:52:23,358 --> 00:52:27,358
this whole great team

1439
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:30,318
we're finally translating the quality of

1440
00:52:27,358 --> 00:52:32,558
that living soil grown led driven you

1441
00:52:30,318 --> 00:52:34,079
know exciting new boutique variety

1442
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,319
cannabis products

1443
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:38,559
all the way to that end point of use if

1444
00:52:36,318 --> 00:52:40,719
you go get a fresh sample batter of

1445
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:43,119
grapple pie it's going to smell

1446
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:44,799
incredibly diverse and dynamic and

1447
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,760
you're going to enjoy that product so

1448
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,880
much more

1449
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,119
typically

1450
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,200
i would say than the flower sample that

1451
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,318
has now gone through non-temperature

1452
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,879
controlled

1453
00:52:52,318 --> 00:52:56,558
uh sort of long-term storage and has

1454
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:58,480
been beaten all around

1455
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:00,720
so here's a simple idea

1456
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,719
i think that we need temperature control

1457
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,639
and airtight vessels

1458
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:06,239
you know this is a contentious issue and

1459
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:09,440
we don't have a ton of time so i can't

1460
00:53:06,239 --> 00:53:11,439
go deeply into debating curing like the

1461
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,920
idea of long curing

1462
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,159
gosh flowers are not hash it's all this

1463
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:18,240
oxidative surface area i can show you

1464
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:20,719
all the analytical lab tests i can show

1465
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:23,519
you my sensory experiences and with big

1466
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,799
groups now that flower becomes usually a

1467
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:27,199
bit fungal

1468
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,800
and highly oxidated and now you're left

1469
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:30,960
with the cannabinoids and you've lost

1470
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:33,200
all this product character i'm not a fan

1471
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,559
of that i know people are i that's more

1472
00:53:33,199 --> 00:53:36,799
of like a

1473
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:39,280
something i can't explain i think people

1474
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:41,839
would benefit the most from the freshest

1475
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,839
version of the flower but in order to

1476
00:53:41,838 --> 00:53:46,318
get there we'll have to use temperature

1477
00:53:43,838 --> 00:53:49,199
controlled environments so ultra premium

1478
00:53:46,318 --> 00:53:50,880
flower i see going in refrigerators or

1479
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:52,239
in a sort of whole

1480
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:54,559
chain and distribution that's

1481
00:53:52,239 --> 00:53:57,519
refrigerated as well as packed

1482
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:00,160
in low oxygen environment you know and

1483
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,079
sustained once it's been well cured but

1484
00:54:00,159 --> 00:54:02,879
the reality is in the supply chain we

1485
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,480
have

1486
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,559
this is where the solventless products

1487
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,318
are pretty remarkable in their ability

1488
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,440
to get all the way to the end point of

1489
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:10,800
use

1490
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:13,760
they're tiny

1491
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,760
and they're also you know expensive but

1492
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,520
they're precious because they do

1493
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:20,720
constantly work to maintain that

1494
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:22,800
integrity of the organoleptic voice and

1495
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:24,480
the aroma intensity but

1496
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:27,680
i think as cultivators it's really

1497
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,679
important to just have aroma in mind

1498
00:54:27,679 --> 00:54:31,519
constantly and and when we think of rob

1499
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:32,960
clark and mojave richmond who talked

1500
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:36,480
often about

1501
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:38,880
this is an aromatherapeutic crop

1502
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,679
and we're like missing the point if

1503
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:45,440
we're focusing on strain names

1504
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:48,000
thc even dominant terpenes indica sativa

1505
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,599
hybrid and the nose really does know but

1506
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:52,000
the problem is the nose doesn't believe

1507
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,838
in itself so often so back to your sense

1508
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,440
of sense ted

1509
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:56,960
i think that they're terribly before the

1510
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:59,358
amount of people who distrust their

1511
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:00,240
senses yes before we touch on that okay

1512
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:02,960
please

1513
00:55:00,239 --> 00:55:04,798
can you just take me through uh for a

1514
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:07,440
cultivator

1515
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:10,719
your optimal process for sort of drying

1516
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,000
and curing a plant from harvest

1517
00:55:10,719 --> 00:55:13,759
on

1518
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,519
just in a little more concrete terms to

1519
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,559
give people um

1520
00:55:15,519 --> 00:55:18,880
just a better idea with what you're

1521
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,040
comfortable sharing i guess

1522
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:24,160
so you've mentioned absolutely

1523
00:55:21,039 --> 00:55:25,599
colder airtight temperature controlled

1524
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,159
yeah can you just touch on that before

1525
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:30,480
we let's let's even rewind it a bit so

1526
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:33,838
the drying process first you know

1527
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:36,159
identifying peak maturity is a thing

1528
00:55:33,838 --> 00:55:38,719
people who harvest on the calendar eight

1529
00:55:36,159 --> 00:55:40,798
weeks you know or nine weeks routinely

1530
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:43,439
are generally missing the peak

1531
00:55:40,798 --> 00:55:46,079
organoleptic expression one example

1532
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,039
we've been cultivating joker's 31 from

1533
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:51,599
excuse me jokers from uh the

1534
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:54,558
compound genetics team huge style

1535
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:56,960
profile i noticed that there's a 72 hour

1536
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,920
window where that part of the profile

1537
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:00,559
peaks

1538
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,400
it's like eight and a half weeks in

1539
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:06,400
i that is an example of a window of time

1540
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:08,880
where if we want to capture that in its

1541
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,160
most expressive state we need to harvest

1542
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:12,480
at that time

1543
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:14,639
so using sensory in the cultivation

1544
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:16,719
facility to identify that

1545
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:17,838
ideally combined with analytics except

1546
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:19,358
in the case of this one if you're

1547
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:21,119
looking for gas

1548
00:56:19,358 --> 00:56:23,759
there's no limonene near seeing

1549
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:25,599
beta-caro filing correlation to that

1550
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:27,680
that's the compounds we would see in

1551
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:28,480
that sort of a cush profile

1552
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:30,558
but

1553
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:32,400
so what i'm trying to say is first it

1554
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:33,760
starts with when you harvest and then

1555
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,559
it's how you harvest

1556
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,400
are you rapidly getting the

1557
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,960
freshly harvested bucked plants

1558
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,559
carefully into the temperature and

1559
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:45,039
humidity controlled

1560
00:56:42,559 --> 00:56:46,880
drying environment i would say that

1561
00:56:45,039 --> 00:56:49,759
where people have gone awry in drying

1562
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,760
environments is that ideally if you

1563
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,880
could wave the wand you'd have two hvac

1564
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,119
systems

1565
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:57,280
one that's a beast that can take out a

1566
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:58,480
majority of the water content in a short

1567
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:01,200
period of time

1568
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:04,000
say 48 hours or less

1569
00:57:01,199 --> 00:57:06,639
with aggressive dehumidification and

1570
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:08,400
being able to immediately with the water

1571
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:12,078
activity process

1572
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,639
get down to your between 0.65 0.85 uh

1573
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:16,079
sort of water activity so that botrytis

1574
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:18,000
cannot occur

1575
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:19,119
uh that knocks out a huge amount of crop

1576
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:21,358
loss but

1577
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:24,000
then have a second smaller hvac system

1578
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:26,000
that stabilizes and carries those trends

1579
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:28,079
you know for the duration of the

1580
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:30,798
qualitative components in the drying

1581
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:32,798
getting that 90 reduction of moisture

1582
00:57:30,798 --> 00:57:35,759
down to you know 10

1583
00:57:32,798 --> 00:57:38,400
pretty ideally between 8 and 10

1584
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:39,520
and essentially uh the moment that's

1585
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:42,000
achieved

1586
00:57:39,519 --> 00:57:44,000
being here's the big trick facilitating

1587
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:46,400
a large scale crop

1588
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,318
into hand trimming the moment it's a

1589
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,200
perfect moisture content and water

1590
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,639
activity that's not easy to do i i don't

1591
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:55,199
know many people that can pull it off

1592
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:56,159
you do the best you can and you have to

1593
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,318
probably

1594
00:57:56,159 --> 00:58:00,159
cut some corners occasionally but the

1595
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:02,318
best you can mobilize a team to go

1596
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:05,199
through that quickly so maybe you start

1597
00:58:02,318 --> 00:58:06,719
trimming at 12 or 14

1598
00:58:05,199 --> 00:58:08,639
and then you're monitoring it and not

1599
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:10,000
sealing that product and being very very

1600
00:58:08,639 --> 00:58:12,798
careful with your water activity

1601
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,920
monitoring to keep it in the safe zone

1602
00:58:12,798 --> 00:58:16,559
then

1603
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:19,680
keeping that constantly from that moment

1604
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,040
in a either inert gas we've a

1605
00:58:19,679 --> 00:58:24,399
combination of

1606
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:25,358
co2 and nitrogen uh blended so it's like

1607
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:28,798
20

1608
00:58:25,358 --> 00:58:30,480
uh co2 80 nitrogen

1609
00:58:28,798 --> 00:58:32,239
just hand fill that you don't have to do

1610
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:35,280
it with a really accurate precise method

1611
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:36,959
but displace the majority of the oxygen

1612
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,720
that's in the container where those

1613
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:40,400
reactions are occurring and then of

1614
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,879
course even in burping

1615
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:45,440
we talk about burping that dr allison

1616
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:47,039
justice was the first person who takes

1617
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:50,000
my awareness with the huge amount of

1618
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:52,239
ethylene content that's in the finishing

1619
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:55,039
gases they're off-gassing in that flower

1620
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:57,039
product ethylene is a ripening agent now

1621
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:58,480
we can only speculate about what all

1622
00:58:57,039 --> 00:58:59,679
it's doing in cannabis but look to

1623
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,760
everything else

1624
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:04,399
we see that complex carbohydrates are

1625
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,160
rapidly breaking down on the sugars and

1626
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:08,880
you know imagine how fast the banana

1627
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:10,639
ripens in the bag when it's ethylene is

1628
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:12,720
more concentrated than what's out in the

1629
00:59:10,639 --> 00:59:14,639
open and it's less concentrated

1630
00:59:12,719 --> 00:59:16,480
i imagine there's a similar dynamic and

1631
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:18,318
that who knows that maybe it's

1632
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:20,240
advantageous to trap in that ethylene

1633
00:59:18,318 --> 00:59:22,798
but i doubt it so you need to burp the

1634
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:25,598
excess co2 and ethylene the excess

1635
00:59:22,798 --> 00:59:28,239
moisture and before you seal it in that

1636
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:30,880
inert gas environment really correctly

1637
00:59:28,239 --> 00:59:33,759
but then going from there it's this cold

1638
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:35,039
chain keep it in you know temperatures

1639
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,359
that are going to be more like

1640
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,679
refrigerated temperatures never freeze

1641
00:59:37,358 --> 00:59:41,199
product unless you intend to rapidly use

1642
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,318
the product after you remove it from the

1643
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:43,838
freezer

1644
00:59:42,318 --> 00:59:46,079
because there's a process called

1645
00:59:43,838 --> 00:59:48,318
nucleation where essentially ice

1646
00:59:46,079 --> 00:59:50,240
crystals are building up inside of the

1647
00:59:48,318 --> 00:59:52,719
plant cellular tissue

1648
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:54,798
and then as soon as they um

1649
00:59:52,719 --> 00:59:56,000
thaw it's an expansion and contraction

1650
00:59:54,798 --> 00:59:58,159
exercise

1651
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:02,079
it breaks and bursts these you know sort

1652
00:59:58,159 --> 01:00:04,078
of simple uh uh these these stores for

1653
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:06,480
the vocs and so forth

1654
01:00:04,079 --> 01:00:09,359
so refrigerated temps is my

1655
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,599
my target and i would say that um

1656
01:00:09,358 --> 01:00:13,119
you could you know stay at the low side

1657
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:15,519
of refrigeration and that'd be that

1658
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:18,160
would be ideal but most people are going

1659
01:00:15,519 --> 01:00:19,119
to be closer to probably 55 or 65

1660
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:21,358
degrees

1661
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,160
that's okay it's certainly better than

1662
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:24,400
uh

1663
01:00:22,159 --> 01:00:26,960
not having any refrigeration

1664
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:29,119
but really the cooler you can be the

1665
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,119
less brownian motion this is a great

1666
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:33,760
word i learned recently about

1667
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,640
the way molecules move and

1668
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,200
even

1669
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:38,078
various uh liquids and chilled steaks

1670
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:40,159
but

1671
01:00:38,079 --> 01:00:42,798
essentially you want to package that

1672
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:46,159
product and continue to sustain it in

1673
01:00:42,798 --> 01:00:48,960
stasis so the freshness is there

1674
01:00:46,159 --> 01:00:51,118
um i do not use or advise the use of

1675
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,240
boveda packs or other

1676
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:54,880
branded

1677
01:00:52,239 --> 01:00:57,279
desiccants or humidificants

1678
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,720
i think those really uh absolutely

1679
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,240
pillage the aroma it's been my

1680
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:03,679
experience personally

1681
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:05,039
i i see retail nearly universally using

1682
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:06,798
those things which is

1683
01:01:05,039 --> 01:01:09,039
like a fix to a

1684
01:01:06,798 --> 01:01:10,639
to problems that happen downstream it

1685
01:01:09,039 --> 01:01:12,960
doesn't really work

1686
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:16,000
you can never add water back in you know

1687
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:18,480
without compromising aroma or increasing

1688
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,880
the likelihood for new biology

1689
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,920
to to grow there i just i'm not a fan of

1690
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,720
that i think

1691
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,559
getting it correct in drying and

1692
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:28,318
transferring and unpacking is more

1693
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:30,160
important i would like to see a lot more

1694
01:01:28,318 --> 01:01:32,239
emphasis on those things

1695
01:01:30,159 --> 01:01:33,759
but then keep it refrigerated all the

1696
01:01:32,239 --> 01:01:35,838
way to the point where the consumer is

1697
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:38,000
picking up and purchasing the product

1698
01:01:35,838 --> 01:01:39,599
that would be a revolution people would

1699
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:42,079
see and smell

1700
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:44,079
a kind of sort of experience that only

1701
01:01:42,079 --> 01:01:46,559
the producers typically

1702
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:47,760
get access to which you know is where

1703
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,280
the most passionate people in the

1704
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,720
industry sometimes are it's the people

1705
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,720
growing the plants

1706
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:55,439
and you see why when you see this

1707
01:01:52,719 --> 01:01:56,959
massive aroma expression and i'll just

1708
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:59,200
share personally it's a bit

1709
01:01:56,960 --> 01:02:00,798
heartbreaking to me when i know what the

1710
01:01:59,199 --> 01:02:02,318
product looked like before it went

1711
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:03,038
through all these many steps and then i

1712
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:05,838
see

1713
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:07,200
on a random spot by at some retail where

1714
01:02:05,838 --> 01:02:09,519
i have flower at

1715
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:11,679
and this kind of really degraded

1716
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:14,000
expression and it still looks good it

1717
01:02:11,679 --> 01:02:17,118
tests well it sells well it's still got

1718
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,760
some character it is one tenth or maybe

1719
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:21,519
even less of the character it had before

1720
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,480
that whole thing started so

1721
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:27,280
i really do want to see um airtight you

1722
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:29,838
know sort of light proof refrigerated

1723
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:31,359
packaging for elite uh flower products

1724
01:02:29,838 --> 01:02:33,279
but at some point you start to realize

1725
01:02:31,358 --> 01:02:34,880
that's a bit crazy you know it's

1726
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,599
interesting that only in the last 50

1727
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:40,559
years do we have this culture that is so

1728
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:42,400
uh about the flower itself and i really

1729
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:43,599
really love flower and i love fidelity

1730
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,838
to flower

1731
01:02:43,599 --> 01:02:48,559
but i would just suggest that we also

1732
01:02:45,838 --> 01:02:50,798
need to be humble and acknowledging this

1733
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:52,720
ancestral ancient cannabis culture

1734
01:02:50,798 --> 01:02:55,119
around the world that for hundreds of

1735
01:02:52,719 --> 01:02:56,239
generations worked exclusively on hash

1736
01:02:55,119 --> 01:02:57,280
production

1737
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,358
i'm not

1738
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:01,680
i i love traditional hash i think it's

1739
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:03,440
probably my favorite product but i i'm

1740
01:03:01,679 --> 01:03:06,078
not at all against like the high

1741
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:08,000
fidelity exciting massive rotten

1742
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,680
ecosystem that's opening and i would

1743
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,798
suggest for people who don't have enough

1744
01:03:09,679 --> 01:03:12,960
experience

1745
01:03:10,798 --> 01:03:16,400
try not always against a distillate

1746
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:18,720
formulated live regimen i i can

1747
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,920
absolutely discernibly feel a difference

1748
01:03:18,719 --> 01:03:22,798
for myself

1749
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:25,440
it's clear i'm not making it up it it's

1750
01:03:22,798 --> 01:03:26,318
less desirable i get more narrow effects

1751
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:29,119
i get

1752
01:03:26,318 --> 01:03:30,960
less uh sort of nuance and less

1753
01:03:29,119 --> 01:03:32,720
less good feelings there's something

1754
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,318
about keeping everything together and

1755
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:36,078
this whole platform

1756
01:03:34,318 --> 01:03:38,400
uh where you're not combining and

1757
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,798
re-combining things

1758
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,838
you're really just trying to

1759
01:03:40,798 --> 01:03:45,679
capture the peak freshness and maturity

1760
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:47,759
and carry that all the way to the moment

1761
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,159
you ingest that in

1762
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,079
an inhalable or otherwise other form

1763
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:53,920
here's one really quick weird thing we

1764
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:55,839
just did a trial where actually there's

1765
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,680
like six different kinds of inputs in a

1766
01:03:55,838 --> 01:03:59,038
gummy for a long time people were

1767
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,879
wondering well does it make a difference

1768
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,720
to have these big whole plant

1769
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:05,119
phytochemical inventories and gummies

1770
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,480
like isn't the thc and cbd the only

1771
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,920
compounds really getting through the

1772
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:09,679
bile etc

1773
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:11,200
it absolutely makes a difference there's

1774
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:13,519
no question left

1775
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:15,598
dr natasha riz who used to be chief

1776
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:18,559
science at genevis was one of the first

1777
01:04:15,599 --> 01:04:21,359
people to show me data about lavender

1778
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:23,680
and linole getting all the way into the

1779
01:04:21,358 --> 01:04:26,078
gut and being able to be a very

1780
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:27,358
powerful aid to ibs and crohn's

1781
01:04:26,079 --> 01:04:29,760
therapies

1782
01:04:27,358 --> 01:04:32,000
it's very clear that the rosin infused

1783
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:33,280
gummy it's just a better product that's

1784
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,519
a much more

1785
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:37,359
enjoyable edible so

1786
01:04:35,519 --> 01:04:39,440
but i think it's easy to achieve what

1787
01:04:37,358 --> 01:04:40,480
i'm talking about with cold chain post

1788
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:43,039
process

1789
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,280
with hash and rosin products

1790
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:46,319
it's harder to do that with flower

1791
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:48,640
products

1792
01:04:46,318 --> 01:04:50,639
in the current industry i would say that

1793
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:53,838
people who have yet to build out have a

1794
01:04:50,639 --> 01:04:55,598
lot of opportunity to differentiate and

1795
01:04:53,838 --> 01:04:58,239
use what we've learned

1796
01:04:55,599 --> 01:05:00,798
to be able to better facilitate this

1797
01:04:58,239 --> 01:05:02,000
massive variable and consumer enjoyment

1798
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:02,960
and to really

1799
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,639
then

1800
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:06,159
lastly i would say that it's not enough

1801
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:08,400
to do all that

1802
01:05:06,159 --> 01:05:10,639
actually do sensory science and you may

1803
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:12,400
not be able to do it in-house but like

1804
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,400
we're collaborating with true terpenes

1805
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,400
team who will bring their folks

1806
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:18,880
hopefully to the table to

1807
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:21,519
have a third party characterize the

1808
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:24,400
products and you know this fantastic

1809
01:05:21,519 --> 01:05:26,880
process where they've done training

1810
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:29,358
um they they're effective in being able

1811
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,838
to sort of create their own blends and

1812
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:33,838
find the expressiveness and range

1813
01:05:31,838 --> 01:05:35,440
this is back to the riff i was starting

1814
01:05:33,838 --> 01:05:36,639
before you asked the question about

1815
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:39,519
practical

1816
01:05:36,639 --> 01:05:40,719
uh thoughts related to uh the post

1817
01:05:39,519 --> 01:05:43,519
process

1818
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:44,558
it's simply this you can imagine that

1819
01:05:43,519 --> 01:05:48,239
there

1820
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,640
are at least a trillion possible aromas

1821
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:52,719
now how much language do you have

1822
01:05:50,639 --> 01:05:54,960
this is the fundamental challenge with

1823
01:05:52,719 --> 01:05:57,199
everybody who i think looks down the

1824
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,679
barrel of sensory science at first

1825
01:05:57,199 --> 01:06:01,838
you don't trust that you yourself are an

1826
01:05:59,679 --> 01:06:04,879
expert or and most people are not

1827
01:06:01,838 --> 01:06:07,119
certainly or that you can be that i i

1828
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,200
believe that more people than i think

1829
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:11,280
they then identify in that way could

1830
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,759
with the littlest bit of training or as

1831
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:17,039
a part of a larger sensory process

1832
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:19,039
become educated and useful in this

1833
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:21,039
unfolding conversation

1834
01:06:19,039 --> 01:06:23,119
and that's what i want to encourage and

1835
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:25,680
it is a challenging thing i talk to

1836
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:27,920
people who describe sensory like

1837
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:31,199
architecture and it shapes

1838
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,680
or who describe it as sounds and have

1839
01:06:31,199 --> 01:06:35,439
like various synesthetic

1840
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:37,598
modalities or

1841
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,318
it's a really tricky space because it's

1842
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,280
so

1843
01:06:38,318 --> 01:06:43,119
it's so vast you know there isn't a

1844
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:44,880
million or a million adjectives let

1845
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:47,680
alone a trillion that we're going to

1846
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:49,838
deploy but as we get better and you use

1847
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:52,239
groups to round it out

1848
01:06:49,838 --> 01:06:54,000
simply reporting a few adjectives about

1849
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:55,679
what's exciting in that product from a

1850
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,838
sensory perspective

1851
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:59,759
after you've done your excellent cold

1852
01:06:57,838 --> 01:07:02,558
chain post process

1853
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,119
will create a whole new level of

1854
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:08,000
cannabis enjoyment and i would argue

1855
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:11,119
that enjoyment is in some ways tethered

1856
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:12,480
to therapeutic use and to long-term

1857
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:14,480
relationships

1858
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:17,039
and it's really the maturing of what is

1859
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,798
a very early stage kind of new industry

1860
01:07:17,039 --> 01:07:20,400
in this ancient culture

1861
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:22,239
that needs to be addressed and i'm

1862
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,440
trying to do that work with a variety of

1863
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:24,959
teams and

1864
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:25,838
thrilled about the results that i've

1865
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:29,119
seen

1866
01:07:25,838 --> 01:07:30,880
but again i think the nose knows

1867
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:33,680
but the next part of a statement i would

1868
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,280
add on is people don't trust

1869
01:07:33,679 --> 01:07:36,960
themselves yet though

1870
01:07:35,280 --> 01:07:39,440
it's like the nose nose but there's some

1871
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:40,960
disconnecting cognitive dissonance

1872
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:42,720
if you will and

1873
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,798
what i'm excited to do is to help

1874
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:46,000
support people to be more effective in

1875
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:47,519
that regard

1876
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,798
but then also

1877
01:07:47,519 --> 01:07:50,480
not even to

1878
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:52,639
to encourage everybody to do that but at

1879
01:07:50,480 --> 01:07:54,480
least on the producer side if you're

1880
01:07:52,639 --> 01:07:56,639
spending your life cultivating flowers

1881
01:07:54,480 --> 01:07:59,199
and not working on sensory in a way

1882
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:01,358
that's above and beyond you using your

1883
01:07:59,199 --> 01:08:04,159
own anecdotal perspective

1884
01:08:01,358 --> 01:08:07,038
you're missing a giant part of how we

1885
01:08:04,159 --> 01:08:08,960
can make the richest best

1886
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:10,559
most valuable expressions of craft

1887
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:13,039
cannabis on the earth

1888
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:14,880
i really mean that and so really excited

1889
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:17,119
about this conversation

1890
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,400
as it unfolds

1891
01:08:17,119 --> 01:08:19,920
you know i think you've given us a lot

1892
01:08:18,399 --> 01:08:21,759
to think about

1893
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:24,000
i know myself

1894
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:27,039
as a consumer

1895
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:28,000
i want to be more cognizant of

1896
01:08:27,039 --> 01:08:30,798
my

1897
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:34,079
dosage my

1898
01:08:30,798 --> 01:08:36,079
environment my mood

1899
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,679
and how that relates to the cultivar how

1900
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:40,318
the plant was grown and all of these

1901
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:43,119
things to get a more comprehensive

1902
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:45,359
understanding of what that effect is

1903
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,679
uh for me and and how that the plant

1904
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:48,798
interacts with my personal

1905
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,480
endocannabinoid system which i found is

1906
01:08:48,798 --> 01:08:53,119
quite different than

1907
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:54,879
the majority so um

1908
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:56,960
yeah i might i appreciate that my friend

1909
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:59,039
you gave us a lot to think about today

1910
01:08:56,960 --> 01:09:00,480
and i'm so grateful for your time

1911
01:08:59,039 --> 01:09:02,158
um

1912
01:09:00,479 --> 01:09:03,919
i hope you have a wonderful

1913
01:09:02,158 --> 01:09:05,119
rest of your trip oh yeah

1914
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,880
really quick thing

1915
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:08,079
in summary there's one other thought

1916
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:09,838
just to go all the way back to the

1917
01:09:08,079 --> 01:09:11,759
beginning it's simply that

1918
01:09:09,838 --> 01:09:14,318
think again about the person who walks

1919
01:09:11,759 --> 01:09:16,560
into the retail dispensary who may be

1920
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:19,039
from out of town who may be not hooked

1921
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:21,359
up and connected who doesn't have the

1922
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:23,439
elite cultivator uh group of

1923
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:25,359
connoisseurs that you do or you know

1924
01:09:23,439 --> 01:09:27,439
that really are just trying to find

1925
01:09:25,359 --> 01:09:30,079
their favorite experience

1926
01:09:27,439 --> 01:09:32,399
and think about the layers of [ __ ]

1927
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:36,000
they have to wade through yeah indica

1928
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:39,119
sativa hybrid high thc strain name

1929
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:41,439
terpene dominance um and now we'll add

1930
01:09:39,119 --> 01:09:44,640
proprietary marketing effect language

1931
01:09:41,439 --> 01:09:45,759
that's literally five layers of deceit

1932
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,239
and lies

1933
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:49,198
that stand in between the person and the

1934
01:09:48,238 --> 01:09:51,919
planet

1935
01:09:49,198 --> 01:09:54,559
i would say we do so well to

1936
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,840
start to just remove all of that just

1937
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:58,560
take it away

1938
01:09:55,840 --> 01:10:00,480
and educate retail staff

1939
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:03,280
with sensory language

1940
01:10:00,479 --> 01:10:05,359
use language that actually is accessible

1941
01:10:03,279 --> 01:10:07,920
that connects to people that also that's

1942
01:10:05,359 --> 01:10:10,479
accurate and when it's accurate and you

1943
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:11,840
have that product and you finally find

1944
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:13,359
that sort of

1945
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:16,319
uh gosh

1946
01:10:13,359 --> 01:10:19,599
fermented blueberry with a

1947
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:22,079
floral punctuated note with a sort of a

1948
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:23,920
top note a middle and a bottom that's

1949
01:10:22,079 --> 01:10:26,238
still got gas

1950
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:28,239
you're so delighted by that experience

1951
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:29,759
it's like a discovery and then you want

1952
01:10:28,238 --> 01:10:31,919
to reproduce it but you've at least

1953
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:33,360
internally mapped that i think that's

1954
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:35,520
the kind of stuff like i'm in dublin

1955
01:10:33,359 --> 01:10:36,799
there's this giant whiskey museum

1956
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:39,280
you look at all these people i mean

1957
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:41,279
they've been doing this for generations

1958
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:43,198
and that's what they're looking for

1959
01:10:41,279 --> 01:10:45,359
they're looking to reproduce that

1960
01:10:43,198 --> 01:10:47,839
amazing experience they of course have

1961
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:50,639
mouth feel and actual flavor

1962
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,880
but i i anyways more to say but

1963
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:54,320
you sir thank you for this platform

1964
01:10:52,880 --> 01:10:55,359
thank you for the opportunity and

1965
01:10:54,319 --> 01:10:58,079
privilege

1966
01:10:55,359 --> 01:11:00,399
to get to communicate with uh all of the

1967
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:03,279
amazing folks that tune in and

1968
01:11:00,399 --> 01:11:04,799
i'm just so grateful to you for also the

1969
01:11:03,279 --> 01:11:06,800
best version

1970
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:08,880
of an organoleptic

1971
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:10,159
enriching media that has happened

1972
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:12,800
certainly in the last five years of

1973
01:11:10,158 --> 01:11:14,079
proof and the supply chain disruptions

1974
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,719
and chaos

1975
01:11:14,079 --> 01:11:17,600
that led me and sam and todd and the

1976
01:11:16,719 --> 01:11:19,920
team

1977
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:21,760
to make the bold move to with absolutely

1978
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:24,960
no time to trial

1979
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:27,119
jump in headlong and to the necessity of

1980
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:29,760
agronomic balancing and liquid injecting

1981
01:11:27,119 --> 01:11:32,399
in small sized containers with living

1982
01:11:29,760 --> 01:11:35,039
soil i bet really your product is second

1983
01:11:32,399 --> 01:11:36,799
to none it's been fantastic and helpful

1984
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,479
unfortunately due to some technical

1985
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:40,320
difficulties the end of the podcast

1986
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:42,158
recording was cut off but we caught the

1987
01:11:40,319 --> 01:11:43,759
majority of the content so i decided to

1988
01:11:42,158 --> 01:11:45,519
publish it as is

1989
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:47,199
