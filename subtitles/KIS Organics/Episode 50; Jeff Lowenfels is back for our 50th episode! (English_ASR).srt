00:00:17,239 --> 00:00:20,820
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,800
science podcast

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,079
I'm your host Tabb Hussey of kiss

5
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,939
organics this is the podcast where we

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,739
discuss the cutting edge of organic

7
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:30,689
growing from a science-based perspective

8
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:32,219
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:34,500
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:37,260
knowledge our guest today is Jeff Lowen

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,210
fellows in honor of our 50th episode I

12
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:41,878
wanted to get Jeff our very first

13
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:43,620
podcast guest an old friend back on the

14
00:00:41,878 --> 00:00:45,449
show Jeff is the author of the popular

15
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:47,549
teaming series teeming with microbes

16
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:50,760
teeming with nutrients and teaming with

17
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:52,709
fungi Jeff is an extremely respected and

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,329
popular national garden writer he is the

19
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,579
former president of the Garden Writers

20
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:58,378
of America Jeff has been a good friend

21
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:00,808
now for over a decade and is a wonderful

22
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:07,259
advocate for organic gardening compost

23
00:01:00,808 --> 00:01:08,789
teas and the microbes in our soil thanks

24
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,829
Jeff great to have you back on the show

25
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:12,680
you know you're an old friend and it's

26
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:15,329
wonderful to chat with you again

27
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:17,670
it's always fun I never see you enough

28
00:01:15,329 --> 00:01:21,539
so this is this is a poor second

29
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,000
substitute I guess well let's let's just

30
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,900
let's just start right away

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,670
you know we talked about a few different

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,140
topics off air but one of the things you

33
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:30,030
ought to talk about was rise of [ __ ]

34
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,549
which is something pretty interesting

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,040
that I'm not that informed on so why

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,360
don't we just start right there

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:42,150
yeah we should it's a fascinating

38
00:01:36,359 --> 00:01:45,750
subject rise Oh [ __ ] RHIC opha g ey i

39
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:47,850
think it is or maybe just g why it's

40
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,578
something that I stumbled upon oh gosh

41
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:52,769
about probably about ten years ago a

42
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:57,029
friend of mine in New York sent me a

43
00:01:52,769 --> 00:02:00,539
article about tundra plants that are

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:03,359
capable of actually ingesting organic

45
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,939
molecules now just just as by way of

46
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:08,340
background in teeming with nutrients one

47
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:12,750
of the one of the takeaways is that the

48
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:14,849
microbes in the soil put a charge on the

49
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,629
17 nutrients that you need to grow

50
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,539
plants and is that that charge which

51
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,599
enables the nutrients to get into plant

52
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:25,709
cells so it needs that charge and and so

53
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:27,479
I wrote the book teaming with microbes

54
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,610
which is about how much stuff gets

55
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,169
delivered and then and then teeming with

56
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,530
nutrients how it gets into the plant

57
00:02:31,169 --> 00:02:37,079
based upon the soil food web concept

58
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,490
that the that the exudates that the

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:40,560
plant drips out of the root system

60
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:42,870
attracts bacteria and fungi bacteria and

61
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,729
fungi attract the protozoa nematodes who

62
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:46,680
eat the bacteria and fungi and poop out

63
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:48,449
the excess and feed the plant because

64
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,010
it's all happening right there in the

65
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:52,709
root zone so that's sort of the model

66
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:55,679
that I've used and then about seven or

67
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:57,449
eight years ago the this rise of a key

68
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,430
concept came up and it was sort of an

69
00:02:57,449 --> 00:03:02,849
eye-opener because plants aren't

70
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:05,099
supposed to be able to take in organic

71
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:07,500
molecules that don't have a charge on

72
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:09,239
them and so there there were some

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,489
pictures of some tundra plants and they

74
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,930
were actually doing that now you know

75
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,610
you can think okay they're living in the

76
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,050
tundra they've had to adapt for a

77
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:20,519
special way to live they have a very

78
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:23,790
short growing season blahblahblah but

79
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:27,530
what it turns out is that there appear

80
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:29,879
to be a set of bacteria and I don't know

81
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:32,879
what the identification of this

82
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,699
particular set is but these bacteria

83
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,959
operate in a different way than that

84
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:45,060
standard soil food web model these guys

85
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:48,390
go into the meristem of a root so those

86
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,909
brand new cells you know so the stem

87
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:55,738
cell area of the root they go into the

88
00:03:50,909 --> 00:04:00,209
tip and when they go in they drop off or

89
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:05,549
lose their cell wall and they move into

90
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:08,310
the root where they are up against the

91
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:09,750
cell wall on the plasma lemma all of

92
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,659
this stuff if you don't know these words

93
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:15,750
they're in teeming with nutrients and

94
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:18,509
they are oxidized and the nutrients that

95
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,449
they contain that the plant wants are

96
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:24,389
stripped out of these shell-less

97
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:24,909
bacteria who then continue to move

98
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,579
through

99
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:30,220
the route to the edge of the route where

100
00:04:27,579 --> 00:04:33,310
they stimulate the production and growth

101
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:37,090
of a route here now a root hair is just

102
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,430
one cell as a single cell it moves into

103
00:04:37,089 --> 00:04:42,810
that single cell out to the tip of the

104
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,389
root hair and pops out into the soil

105
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,199
putting back on its cell wall or

106
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:53,139
building a new cell wall and then

107
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,229
repeating the process so these guys

108
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:58,329
cycle through the soil losing their cell

109
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:02,069
wall inside the plant giving the plant

110
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:07,329
its nutrients moving back outside whoa

111
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:11,230
that is an unusual new way of plants

112
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:12,639
getting food holy crow it's pretty

113
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,640
interesting and if we can figure out

114
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,620
which bacteria do it when they do it why

115
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:20,409
they do it we're going to have a neat

116
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:22,810
tool it seems to me to be able to grow

117
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:25,689
our favorite plant pretty amazing unit

118
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,129
oh that's fascinating yeah it is and

119
00:05:25,689 --> 00:05:28,689
they've got pictures of it if you go on

120
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:31,209
the web they're pictures of it where

121
00:05:28,689 --> 00:05:33,639
they can actually show the off the

122
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:35,259
oxygen creates a situation where they

123
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:37,300
can mark it and so they can actually

124
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:39,699
show where these guys are in the route

125
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,650
and it's not just one little guy in the

126
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:43,269
root I mean it there there's quite a few

127
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:45,519
of them in there Wow

128
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:46,719
now you know we gotta back up a second

129
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:48,639
because I think a lot of people don't

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,800
understand that there are two ways to

131
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,349
move through a plant's Alyssa you're

132
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,960
going into a route you can go into the

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:59,050
room once you get into the cell you're

134
00:05:55,959 --> 00:06:00,969
inside the cell you can move from that

135
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:04,000
cell to another cell to any other cell

136
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,680
on the plant by going through the cells

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,689
okay so you're it's called the

138
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:14,379
symplastic pathway but you could also go

139
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:17,019
into a plant in the cell walls and move

140
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:19,120
from one cell wall all the way through

141
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:21,609
the plants just by staying in the cell

142
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,959
walls and that's called the apple

143
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,689
plastic pathway and in that situation

144
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:31,449
there are there are things that live in

145
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:33,009
the cell walls that are that you want I

146
00:06:31,449 --> 00:06:35,288
mean there are bacteria and fungi and

147
00:06:33,009 --> 00:06:36,939
these are capable of of Buddhist

148
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:38,949
reservation sure going back out in the

149
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,810
soil and and they do also they drop

150
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,180
they're in antibiotics you know they

151
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,699
take out bad guys so it's kind of

152
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,910
interesting now we've got a situation

153
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:51,089
where not only do we have these guys you

154
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:53,800
know going into the symplastic pathway

155
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:54,909
and moving back out into the soil which

156
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,910
is something that I always thought they

157
00:06:54,910 --> 00:07:00,400
could do by going through the cell wall

158
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:02,290
but uh you know you got a sort of a

159
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,359
second way the plants are feeding

160
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,580
themselves what is there a different

161
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,290
there's not enough information for me to

162
00:07:06,579 --> 00:07:10,539
be able to tell exactly what's going on

163
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:13,120
here and I'm so excited about it as you

164
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:14,860
can tell because this information is

165
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,420
going to be coming available no question

166
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,660
so so everybody needs to keep an eye on

167
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:23,590
that I think that is interesting so we

168
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:27,370
don't quite know what the commercial or

169
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:29,829
human application might be for this this

170
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:31,689
amazing process but it's something new

171
00:07:29,829 --> 00:07:34,389
kind of like what mycorrhizal fungus was

172
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:37,600
oh gosh now probably what 15 20 years

173
00:07:34,389 --> 00:07:40,269
ago well yeah and yeah absolutely and

174
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,920
that's a very good comparison because in

175
00:07:40,269 --> 00:07:44,139
a way these guys are operating like

176
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,610
mycorrhizal fungi they're going into the

177
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:48,419
plant root you know I mean it's kind of

178
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:50,500
an interesting situation and and and

179
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:52,600
it's going to be fascinating to figure

180
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:54,430
out how they and to watch how they study

181
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:56,980
it and figure it all out it's quite

182
00:07:54,430 --> 00:07:58,900
simple so we're going beyond obviously

183
00:07:56,980 --> 00:08:00,939
the tundra plant now we're in depth into

184
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:03,789
regular plants I does cannabis do it I

185
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:04,870
don't know I assume it does you know

186
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:06,850
it's one of these things where an

187
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,780
article sort of plopped out in there you

188
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,629
know and it just doesn't have enough

189
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:12,099
specifics oh so maybe I got a I just

190
00:08:10,629 --> 00:08:13,839
read it about a couple of weeks ago so I

191
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:16,470
got a I got a maybe I need to contact

192
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:19,750
the author and see what's going on so

193
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:21,100
stay tuned on that one oh my gosh and if

194
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,399
it turns out to be you know a

195
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:27,070
significant way plants obtain their

196
00:08:24,399 --> 00:08:31,810
nutrients ah I'm gonna have to revise

197
00:08:27,069 --> 00:08:34,569
the books yeah it's interesting I have

198
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:36,820
seen commercial applications now for our

199
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,060
commercial products around endo FIDIC

200
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:42,070
bacteria where they've yep studied

201
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:44,799
studied this essentially in this case it

202
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:46,500
was from the vents of Yellowstone so a

203
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,990
specific bacteria that they're now

204
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,820
culturing and and using and they found

205
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,519
supposedly great success in

206
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,440
mediating abiotic stress in plants by

207
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:58,710
using this end up fitting bacterium

208
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:01,720
we've set up some trials over at a local

209
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:03,910
cannabis facility that I work with but

210
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,379
we haven't gotten any definitive results

211
00:09:03,909 --> 00:09:08,199
yet but that was something I was

212
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:09,460
interested in - yeah I love that because

213
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,030
when I when I throw teeming with

214
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:16,810
microbes uh you know above ground every

215
00:09:13,029 --> 00:09:20,819
plant has at least one and really really

216
00:09:16,809 --> 00:09:25,119
many more than that up to about 300 350

217
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,760
different in the Indo fatik organisms in

218
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,350
there in the plant above ground you know

219
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:31,330
there's sort of a comparable to the like

220
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:32,529
the horizontal giant below ground but

221
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,960
above ground you got all these and

222
00:09:32,529 --> 00:09:37,539
pathetic fungi and endo FIDIC bacteria

223
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,460
and I predicted back then that gee you

224
00:09:37,539 --> 00:09:41,199
know we're gonna start seeing these

225
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:45,009
things in commercial applications and

226
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,540
wow just terrific I mean so so what's

227
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,730
the name of the product if I may ask you

228
00:09:46,539 --> 00:09:50,620
or does it not have a name yet you know

229
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,180
I don't remember off the top of my head

230
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,919
I'd have to go back into my email and

231
00:09:52,179 --> 00:09:55,870
dig it up cuz it's been a few months

232
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:57,490
since we started but they were there

233
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,669
working in agriculture they're actually

234
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:02,590
a local company to me and yeah we're

235
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:05,110
gonna hopefully get some information off

236
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,320
the trials and see if we can figure that

237
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,050
out

238
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,340
yeah ah just fantastic I mean you know

239
00:10:08,049 --> 00:10:11,529
then that's that's what's so exciting

240
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,690
about this this particular hobby I mean

241
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:15,129
you get to do things that you just

242
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:18,430
normally wouldn't think about doing I I

243
00:10:15,129 --> 00:10:21,519
heard a guy speak in Baltimore a very

244
00:10:18,429 --> 00:10:25,750
interesting talk and it's right up our

245
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:28,809
alley you and me what he was talking

246
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:31,570
about was making specialized teas really

247
00:10:28,809 --> 00:10:33,899
specialized compost teas and and and his

248
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:36,040
theory and I think he's proven it out

249
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,929
you can put a lot of stuff in your

250
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:39,399
compost pile and end up in your compost

251
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,620
teas that you wouldn't normally think

252
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,480
about and he was concentrating on a

253
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:46,419
number of things one of which was chitin

254
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:50,740
which I found very interesting too so he

255
00:10:46,419 --> 00:10:54,699
he he goes to the ocean or the beach and

256
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:57,580
he collects soil that can you know that

257
00:10:54,700 --> 00:11:00,430
was made by kelp and seaweed and all

258
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:02,440
those things decaying etc etc I suppose

259
00:11:00,429 --> 00:11:05,229
you could make your own by going to get

260
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,440
kelp and seaweed and and

261
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:10,899
then I what is discovered is that back

262
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:14,890
the chitin are in the bodies of the

263
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:17,500
organisms that eat that kind of soil or

264
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:21,330
live in that kind of soil that chitin

265
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:25,210
becomes an unbelievable tool in

266
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:28,270
protecting plants as you know a lot of

267
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:30,040
the mycorrhizal fungi chitin prevents

268
00:11:28,269 --> 00:11:32,019
some nematodes from getting into the

269
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:35,409
roots they just don't like chitin and

270
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:38,500
and so so what this guy does is grow it

271
00:11:35,409 --> 00:11:40,480
grows organisms that have Titan in their

272
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,980
bodies fungi but they're also bacteria

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,570
and other things that you know deal with

274
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,460
chitin and break it down and do all

275
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,190
sorts of stuff and and then he and then

276
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:51,670
he uses it in his in specialized teas

277
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:53,860
and he's done the same thing I make by

278
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:56,979
taking some of the beneficial insects

279
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:59,019
that you might use you know I can never

280
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,560
pronounce their names Kim personally on

281
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:05,500
the mite any any grows in in massive

282
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:07,239
quantities in this compost so that

283
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,669
they're meta mites that you know the

284
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:11,950
things that they produce are in that

285
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:14,799
compost and then become useful in

286
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:17,230
growing the plant now which is sort of

287
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:18,609
just a little bit more of an extension

288
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:21,529
of what we do but trying to make a

289
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:23,159
designer fungal or designer bacterial

290
00:12:21,529 --> 00:12:27,189
[Music]

291
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:29,469
compost tea pretty exciting exciting and

292
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:31,930
and since I live near the coast I'll be

293
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,550
trying it that's for sure yeah you know

294
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:37,149
that's an interesting concept I'd love

295
00:12:33,549 --> 00:12:39,159
to see more research on that I know the

296
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:42,429
like for example the insect frass that

297
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:45,279
we source has really high levels of

298
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:48,399
chitin ease producing bacteria which

299
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,500
produce a particular enzyme I believe

300
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,569
it's called chitin ace and that enzyme

301
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,190
rice is what is effective in dealing

302
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:56,350
with these insects in a lot of ways so

303
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:58,840
what you're describing there and then we

304
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,000
are seeing a lot of like these Korean

305
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,129
natural farmers and and natural farming

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,470
where they're taking local their local

307
00:13:03,129 --> 00:13:09,220
soils and using that in teas as a way of

308
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:11,470
increasing indigenous microbes so right

309
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,410
it's it's definitely catching on I'm

310
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:17,110
curious to see how it all plays out

311
00:13:13,409 --> 00:13:19,000
funny enough yeah I'll send you the name

312
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,669
of the he's got a

313
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,720
lab and you know I think I think be

314
00:13:21,669 --> 00:13:24,789
worth you're communicating with

315
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,490
particularly since you know you're

316
00:13:24,789 --> 00:13:30,279
you've got a lot of inputs on your farm

317
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:31,779
and and you live close enough to the to

318
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:33,220
the ocean you can you can really fool

319
00:13:31,779 --> 00:13:34,659
around with a lot of this stuff plus I

320
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:37,889
happen to know that you makes a pretty

321
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:41,079
damn good compost so this would be fun

322
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:42,340
really fun but it makes a lot of sense I

323
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:45,129
mean you know we build this for a

324
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:46,870
forever that if you can if you can give

325
00:13:45,129 --> 00:13:48,820
it to the plant the plan will figure out

326
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:51,279
how to use it and and that's what

327
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,620
happens and that kindness is important

328
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,769
stuff it enables our stuff to break down

329
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:58,450
without it you wouldn't break it down so

330
00:13:55,769 --> 00:14:01,449
very cool stuff very cool stuff lots of

331
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:02,920
new stuff going on but lots of old stuff

332
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:04,930
going on as well and I think people

333
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:06,549
people who listen to your podcast

334
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:08,919
probably get a little bit of a chuckle

335
00:14:06,549 --> 00:14:10,779
or maybe are just a little bit confused

336
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:13,449
by some of the things that they read so

337
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:17,279
for example last week there was an

338
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:21,129
article about a she was in Saskatchewan

339
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,750
and this was a research assistant

340
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:25,480
obviously in the university she

341
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:27,460
obviously had an advisor and the article

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,659
you know was one of these articles that

343
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,629
I just couldn't believe it

344
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:35,409
the article said oh my goodness gracious

345
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:37,960
we've just discovered that plants create

346
00:14:35,409 --> 00:14:41,289
their own microbial communities around

347
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:43,990
their root system and I read and I went

348
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:47,919
wow there's this lady Ben where has this

349
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:49,839
lady been so more important where has

350
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,479
her adviser been all these years

351
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,460
I mean this is not a new discovery but

352
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,639
it's written up like it is you know and

353
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,830
so so people read it ah you know it's

354
00:14:57,639 --> 00:15:03,250
pretty interesting how much how further

355
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:05,850
further along the spectrum we are as

356
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:09,190
growers you know and as hobby' growers

357
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:11,050
compared to so many other people who who

358
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,850
deal with glances it's just simply

359
00:15:11,049 --> 00:15:14,319
amazing and then I think cannabis

360
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:17,259
growers have to give themselves a pat on

361
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:20,260
the back frankly best best gardeners

362
00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:22,120
I've ever met frankly yeah I like the

363
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:25,149
idea that you know you're pushing the

364
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,589
envelope with cannabis growers and giant

365
00:15:25,149 --> 00:15:29,319
pumpkin growers people they're really

366
00:15:26,589 --> 00:15:31,240
trying out new things but I also love

367
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,230
that science does catch up and then tell

368
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,029
us where

369
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:35,980
were way off base you know there's a lot

370
00:15:34,029 --> 00:15:38,110
of stuff right campus industry is tried

371
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,700
and honestly a lot of things that giant

372
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:42,370
bunkers pumpkin growers have done that

373
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,110
it's just not panned out over time that

374
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:47,500
we thought was good science when we

375
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:48,820
first started doing it so yeah it is a

376
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,309
bounce but I totally agree with you

377
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:54,100
cannabis growers are great and I was

378
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:55,869
just talking with someone how a lot of

379
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:57,759
for a lot of cannabis growers it's

380
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:59,110
becoming a new gateway drug to vegetable

381
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,649
gardening and where their food comes

382
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:05,560
from so that's been a right right

383
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:07,179
generating all this sure but lanessa as

384
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:09,039
you know we don't want to ruin it for

385
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:11,859
the next show but we'll do a future show

386
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:14,469
on my upcoming book which is on

387
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,750
autoflowering cannabis and I take the

388
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,759
perspective and this is not a book that

389
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:20,320
I've written for you or for the

390
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:24,069
listeners of this particular podcast

391
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:28,270
this is a book I wrote for you know my

392
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,740
wife a sister you know somebody that's

393
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,069
not a professional grower that's just a

394
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,720
gardener because I believe that

395
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:37,690
autoflowering cannabis have reached the

396
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,870
point now where they are they're going

397
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:43,390
to be the next tomato plant and and just

398
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,129
without getting too far into it just to

399
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:48,220
cap it off you know I think they've

400
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:51,909
reached the point now where they are so

401
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:53,680
easy to grow and so effective in terms

402
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:58,209
of what they're able to deliver in terms

403
00:16:53,679 --> 00:17:00,250
of CBD or THC uh you know that I think

404
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:04,090
they are the next Hobby plant in our

405
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:08,529
lifetime a new plant comes along once or

406
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:10,119
twice in the vegetable world snap peas

407
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,779
is the one that I remember more than

408
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,279
anything else

409
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:13,690
there weren't any and now all of a

410
00:17:12,279 --> 00:17:15,339
sudden is you know seven eight ten

411
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:16,990
fifteen different kinds of snap peas

412
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:19,269
everybody grows them they're terrific

413
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:22,059
you know that's what autoflowering

414
00:17:19,269 --> 00:17:24,779
cannabis I think is going to do to the

415
00:17:22,059 --> 00:17:28,119
gardening world the stigmas dropping

416
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:30,849
once it drops hey this is the next

417
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,699
tomato the Holy Grail so I'll leave it

418
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:35,980
there we'll do another show I hope

419
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:39,490
you're right I think you know we are a

420
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:41,710
gateway into growing food and growing

421
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,420
food organically well I know I said I

422
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:45,509
wanted to wait on that because you have

423
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:48,300
your books coming out when in October

424
00:17:45,509 --> 00:17:49,769
is that right yeah yeah so we can have a

425
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:52,230
whole conversation about that but yeah

426
00:17:49,769 --> 00:17:53,819
we well we will but I do you want to do

427
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,839
you want to talk briefly about it I mean

428
00:17:53,819 --> 00:17:56,639
do you want to talk a little bit about

429
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:58,199
what Auto flowers are I know most of the

430
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,610
people on this podcast are probably

431
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,500
pretty familiar but have you learned

432
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:04,709
anything in it really interesting about

433
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,839
their history or something that you know

434
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:09,539
might surprise listeners that we didn't

435
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:11,220
know about Auto flowers well I think the

436
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:13,980
most surprising there are two surprising

437
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,789
things the most surprising thing is that

438
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:21,630
Auto flowers are now as strong and can

439
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:24,509
produce almost as well as standardized

440
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,700
or the regular kinds of cannabis the

441
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:28,230
second thing is I was dumbfounded that

442
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,750
many people do not know what

443
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:32,789
autoflowering cannabis is they've never

444
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:34,500
heard of it and once they and even

445
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:37,379
professional growers and once they hear

446
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:40,490
about I think a WoW the possible ISM and

447
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,800
so so for those who don't know

448
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:47,160
autoflowering cannabis does not require

449
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:50,009
a photo period like indica and sativa

450
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:52,380
cannabis plants do and that means you

451
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:54,629
can grow at any time of the year and

452
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:56,040
where the temperature is okay and that

453
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,740
means you can grow it indoors or

454
00:18:56,039 --> 00:19:02,210
outdoors any time of the year but better

455
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:10,319
than that they go from seed to harvest

456
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:13,558
in seven to nine weeks Wow because they

457
00:19:10,319 --> 00:19:18,029
don't have the breeding that we have put

458
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:22,230
into our sativas on our indicas we put

459
00:19:18,029 --> 00:19:24,389
ask Afghan hash plants they had a basis

460
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:27,420
of all the plants we grow except with

461
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:30,030
these OTO flowers and they take a long

462
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:33,630
time to mature these OTO flower is seven

463
00:19:30,029 --> 00:19:36,599
to nine weeks harvest seed to harvest

464
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:38,220
and they are spectacular and the

465
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:39,119
breeding that's going on with them is

466
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:41,370
spectacular

467
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:44,789
you can breed them yourself it's quite

468
00:19:41,369 --> 00:19:46,739
easy to breed to existing Auto flower

469
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,990
plants but if you wanted to breed an

470
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,880
auto flower plant with you know a

471
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:52,890
regular cannabis plant you can do that

472
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:55,110
as well it takes a bit longer and

473
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:58,740
obviously takes many more generations

474
00:19:55,109 --> 00:20:01,259
but it's just an exciting new adjunct

475
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:03,289
to our hobby but to the gardening world

476
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:08,129
I think it's going to be a brand new

477
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:10,470
hobby the next tomato so if anybody

478
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:12,809
wants to just quickly hop over to Amazon

479
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:15,299
and pre-order the book you can do that

480
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:17,940
it's called the DIY autoflowering

481
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:21,178
cannabis a new way to grow and I like to

482
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:22,940
say there's a new bud in town and this

483
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:26,250
is it it's going to be spectacular and

484
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:28,830
and if your broiler currently and you're

485
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,509
turning your nose up to you know these

486
00:20:28,829 --> 00:20:32,460
things go on the internet look up some

487
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,470
of these seed companies get some of

488
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:37,620
these new seeds and just try them out I

489
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:40,500
guarantee you'll be flipping out no

490
00:20:37,619 --> 00:20:42,689
question about it now one question I had

491
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,269
I had heard that I don't know if you

492
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:47,929
know research you found the origin story

493
00:20:45,269 --> 00:20:50,339
of what what cannabis ruderalis

494
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,929
essentially is otto flowers as I

495
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:54,329
understand it and that they were

496
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:56,580
discovered in Siberia on the side of a

497
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:57,210
road or something is that true what what

498
00:20:56,579 --> 00:20:59,759
have you found

499
00:20:57,210 --> 00:21:03,420
yeah the story goes that there was a

500
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:06,109
scientist in the Volga River area and he

501
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:11,308
stumbled upon this in his travels and

502
00:21:06,109 --> 00:21:13,319
and it was about 1900 1903 or so and you

503
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:15,960
know it didn't have any THC in it and

504
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:18,240
and you know sort of a scrubby looking

505
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,160
little plant st. really think too much

506
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,609
about it I mean he did he did realize it

507
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:24,870
was a photo a photo period lift plant

508
00:21:22,609 --> 00:21:27,899
but he didn't think too much about it he

509
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:29,699
didn't really do much about it and

510
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:32,550
people fooled around with them a little

511
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,529
bit in the 70s but they just they just

512
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:36,000
weren't kicking around and and then

513
00:21:34,529 --> 00:21:40,349
people begin to discover him in other

514
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,529
places so so in addition to the volga

515
00:21:40,349 --> 00:21:46,139
river area which is not siberia i think

516
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:47,940
they found it in siberia people have

517
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,620
found them in canada i've heard stories

518
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:51,720
that people have found them along the

519
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:56,039
railroad tracks in alaska although i've

520
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:58,019
been unable to track that one down but

521
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,529
there are scrubbing little plan there

522
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:02,429
about a foot foot and a half tall

523
00:22:00,529 --> 00:22:04,980
sometimes a little bigger if you give

524
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:06,840
them a little bit of food but it's just

525
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:11,130
a funny looking little cannabis plant

526
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:12,689
that grows so quickly it doesn't have a

527
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:14,790
photo period and the reason it does

528
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:16,620
a photo period is because it you know

529
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:20,009
it's the evolution it's a great example

530
00:22:16,619 --> 00:22:21,779
of evolution these escaped from

531
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,970
plantations when people were growing

532
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,970
hemp for a probably rope and sailcloth

533
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:29,850
and things like that and they realized

534
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:32,069
oh oh I've been a flower right now or

535
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,939
I'm not going to survive and they did so

536
00:22:32,069 --> 00:22:35,819
there you go

537
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:38,309
autoflowering cannabis the next tomato

538
00:22:35,819 --> 00:22:40,799
and I want to do a quick plug for a

539
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,269
forum called Auto flower net so if you

540
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,440
want to go and read a little bit about

541
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:45,720
it that's a good one

542
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,700
Jeff's posted on there I've posted on

543
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,190
there I don't check it as frequently as

544
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,690
I probably could but there's a lot of

545
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:53,220
great guys on there that are more

546
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:56,039
familiar with Auto flowers than anyone

547
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:58,049
oh my goodness gracious and if and if

548
00:22:56,039 --> 00:22:59,909
you want to you know soup to nuts if you

549
00:22:58,049 --> 00:23:01,409
want to learn about where to buy seeds

550
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:03,840
they cover all the seed companies

551
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:06,660
there's little you know little splays

552
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:09,240
off various different forms I don't like

553
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:10,890
to tell a story you know a tag that you

554
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,069
know when I came up with the idea to

555
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:15,509
write the book and again it's not a book

556
00:23:14,069 --> 00:23:18,000
for growers it's a book for you know

557
00:23:15,509 --> 00:23:19,259
parents who want to be your gardeners

558
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,970
who might want to get into a new kind of

559
00:23:19,259 --> 00:23:25,859
plan boy I really have drunk I I have

560
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,910
consumed the kool-aid that the stigma is

561
00:23:25,859 --> 00:23:31,439
gone haven't I you know oh yeah your

562
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,300
father and mother will be growing plant

563
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:38,100
you know rather yours might be but I

564
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:39,869
don't know you know it's just one of

565
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:41,159
these it's just a phenomenal thing I

566
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:43,019
think people just gonna fall in love

567
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,910
with this it everything you like about

568
00:23:43,019 --> 00:23:49,769
growing a regular plant you can do with

569
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:51,930
this one colors shapes sizes breathing

570
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:54,180
not breathing feminizing you know

571
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:56,009
male-female the whole bit it's just

572
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:58,769
fabulous and all in seven to nine weeks

573
00:23:56,009 --> 00:24:00,299
can you imagine what the difference is

574
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:02,670
in a breeding program if it's seven to

575
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,930
nine weeks versus seven to nine months

576
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:06,120
Wow

577
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:08,130
yeah I haven't had a chance to grow Otto

578
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:09,719
flowers yet but I think this year I

579
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,220
might get the opportunity to get to

580
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,259
experiment with them a little bit so I'm

581
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,420
excited for that and I'm excited to read

582
00:24:13,259 --> 00:24:17,640
your book we'll definitely come back on

583
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:20,150
and have a podcast just on Otto flowers

584
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,720
here you know maybe closer to October

585
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:22,860
that'd be great

586
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,970
yeah it could be it's going to be

587
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:25,559
interesting to see what happens to the

588
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,370
book because again you know so I write

589
00:24:25,559 --> 00:24:29,460
these books for my

590
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:30,899
often a random for anybody else and this

591
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:32,039
one I did write for somebody else I

592
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,350
wrote it you know for people who don't

593
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:36,180
grow but yeah I always amazed on these

594
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,308
books I just learned that the teaming

595
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:41,549
with microbes and teaming with fungi are

596
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:44,460
both being translated into German I

597
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:47,549
talked to a woman the other day about TV

598
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,779
with microbes in Chinese Wow wouldn't

599
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:52,589
that be something

600
00:24:48,779 --> 00:24:54,450
ah it's unbelievable and you know I got

601
00:24:52,589 --> 00:24:57,329
to thank people like you and your

602
00:24:54,450 --> 00:25:00,779
listeners you know who've just adopted

603
00:24:57,329 --> 00:25:03,960
the book is a sort of a good reading and

604
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:05,849
and I thank you guys for that cos again

605
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,110
write these books for myself but only

606
00:25:05,849 --> 00:25:12,509
one person buying a book you know yeah

607
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:14,039
it doesn't go anywhere so so I thank

608
00:25:12,509 --> 00:25:17,429
everybody for this for that there were

609
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,990
even more than kind and buying the book

610
00:25:17,429 --> 00:25:20,610
and telling friends about it or all the

611
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:23,009
Boston daily been together well I didn't

612
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:24,569
tell you I was in the San Juans this

613
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:26,009
past week on weekend for a friend's

614
00:25:24,569 --> 00:25:27,240
birthday and we walked into the

615
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:29,910
bookstore and of course I went straight

616
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:31,410
to the gardening section and teeming

617
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:34,170
with fungi I was right there in the

618
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:36,150
front best location on the bookshelf and

619
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:38,009
there was also Jesse blooms book and

620
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,360
Steve Solomon's book a lot of people

621
00:25:38,009 --> 00:25:40,740
that I've interviewed on this podcast I

622
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:42,509
was like wow I know a lot of the really

623
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,759
cool people in the gardening world I'm

624
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:48,210
very fortunate isn't that fun yeah

625
00:25:44,759 --> 00:25:49,740
isn't that fun yeah it's fun so you did

626
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:51,929
Steve something I you know Steve Steve

627
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:54,480
of course lives in New Zealand yeah and

628
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:55,830
I you know I used to be on this list sir

629
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,380
for a little while I just don't have any

630
00:25:55,829 --> 00:26:01,199
time anymore because because he was you

631
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:03,300
know he initially he thought his system

632
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,730
are growing which is you know for lack

633
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:08,940
of a better word minerals versus

634
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:12,210
microbes he you know he was not a big

635
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:16,529
fan of the microbe system and I think

636
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:18,120
he's come along quite a bit I you know I

637
00:26:16,529 --> 00:26:20,460
think some of them exactly said he

638
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:22,799
didn't agree with and so I think he I

639
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:25,980
think he sort of went the other way and

640
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,119
I think he's back again but you know the

641
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:31,500
two systems work quite well obviously

642
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:33,209
you know it's the microbes that put the

643
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:36,539
charge on the minerals so they can get

644
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:37,829
in there so you gotta happen both yeah I

645
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:40,049
think they're both a little writing a

646
00:26:37,829 --> 00:26:41,399
little wrong to you so we try and call

647
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:43,730
use a combination of both by

648
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:46,470
remineralizing the soil and then having

649
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:47,819
good biological activity and diversity

650
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:49,259
and promoting the sorts of things that

651
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:51,960
you talked about in teaming with

652
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:52,890
microbes yeah oh hey that reminds me of

653
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,450
something I want to I want to go back

654
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,150
into correctors I think I think this was

655
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,090
the show where I created the the

656
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:02,580
controversy I you know we talked about

657
00:27:00,089 --> 00:27:05,009
whether cannabis should be grown in

658
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,619
fungally dominated soil or bacteria

659
00:27:05,009 --> 00:27:10,140
dominating so remember that conversation

660
00:27:06,619 --> 00:27:12,119
and I think I what I said was you know

661
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:14,310
it's an annual plant it's not a

662
00:27:12,119 --> 00:27:18,719
perennial plant and it likes bacteria

663
00:27:14,309 --> 00:27:19,769
dominated soil and III believe again I

664
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:25,350
don't want to put any words in her mouth

665
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:27,150
but I believe dr. Lane said I know her

666
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:32,539
research indicates that really likes a

667
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:34,740
little bit likes fungally dominated or I

668
00:27:32,539 --> 00:27:36,629
know again I don't want to put words in

669
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:38,789
her mouth and I said I said I think the

670
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:40,230
right answer is a and I as I went back

671
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,869
and so I look and looked and thought

672
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:44,579
about it in light of the autoflowering

673
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:47,599
book and I want to I want to sort of

674
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:51,750
change my answer a little bit if I can

675
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:55,679
it is an annual I still believe that it

676
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:57,299
likes bacterial soil but I think you got

677
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,610
to take a look at which variety you're

678
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:01,559
growing first of all so if you're going

679
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:04,019
in Auto flower plant chief these are in

680
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:06,389
the ground for only nine weeks both

681
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:09,240
those love bacteria dominate soil

682
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,520
there's no question they are clearly in

683
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,710
my mind that clearly dominated all the

684
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,569
testing I've done you know they thrive

685
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,700
with the bacterial soil but if you make

686
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:20,970
it if you make if you make the soil too

687
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:22,950
rich they don't do very well so that's

688
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:25,259
that's the first thing the second thing

689
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,660
is when when we talk about bacterial

690
00:28:25,259 --> 00:28:29,759
soil we're not talking about soil that

691
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:33,150
is or I'm not talking about soil that's

692
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:34,859
void of fungi so that clearly dominates

693
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:38,820
simply means that you have more bacteria

694
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:40,259
than Punjab but you have fungi and and

695
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:44,490
obviously you need to have fungi to

696
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:46,259
break down stuff you know you've got to

697
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:48,269
have you got to have the fungi in your

698
00:28:46,259 --> 00:28:49,920
soil even if it's a you know it's

699
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,240
supposed to be heavily bacteria

700
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:52,920
dominated you still have to have some

701
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,400
fungi I believe in the soil in order to

702
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,490
make it soil

703
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:59,650
so if you're growing a let's go back to

704
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:02,049
my original thought I thought if you're

705
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:06,100
growing in Afghani you know that's a

706
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:08,529
nine-month long plant it you know if

707
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:12,689
necessarily in nature is going to have

708
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:15,970
soils that we're fungi have have come in

709
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:18,100
you know and and establish themselves so

710
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:20,230
you're going to want to have more fungi

711
00:29:18,099 --> 00:29:22,809
for the plants to take longer to grow

712
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:24,579
and we know now pretty well how long a

713
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:28,960
seeds going to take you know blue dream

714
00:29:24,579 --> 00:29:32,049
takes X amount and you know whatever you

715
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:34,029
know you know blueberry takes and Y

716
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:35,710
amount and so and so I think we got to

717
00:29:34,029 --> 00:29:37,990
be thinking of in terms that way so so I

718
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:40,569
just wanted to clarify that a little bit

719
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:42,910
I still think they they like specularly

720
00:29:40,569 --> 00:29:45,309
dominated soil but you've got to have

721
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:47,050
fungal in it and if I'm if I'm correct

722
00:29:45,309 --> 00:29:49,299
in putting words in her mouth I believe

723
00:29:47,049 --> 00:29:51,940
that dr. Lane thinks that you need to

724
00:29:49,299 --> 00:29:54,789
have a little bit more fungal than

725
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:55,210
bacteria so I'll sort of leave it at

726
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:57,460
that

727
00:29:55,210 --> 00:30:01,420
I never want to argue with dr. Lane I

728
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:05,049
she is she's been so important to my

729
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:07,300
life and I hate to argue with her until

730
00:30:05,049 --> 00:30:09,609
I have empirical evidence and we sit

731
00:30:07,299 --> 00:30:10,109
down and have a discussion so oh there

732
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,189
we go

733
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:14,049
well I have a few thoughts on the

734
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,580
subject I'd love to get your opinion too

735
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:17,769
so great

736
00:30:15,579 --> 00:30:20,139
yeah in my opinion when we talk about

737
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:21,460
fungally dominated act aerial dominate

738
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:23,770
we're really talking about the plant

739
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,289
succession table which I think our chart

740
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:28,569
which people get I think overly caught

741
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:31,450
up in so yes if we were trying to grow

742
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:34,329
cannabis or lettuce or some you know

743
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:36,610
annual crop at the very edge of an old

744
00:30:34,329 --> 00:30:38,619
oak forest we may have issues with that

745
00:30:36,609 --> 00:30:40,329
because that's soil right established

746
00:30:38,619 --> 00:30:42,009
and that's why when we till the soil

747
00:30:40,329 --> 00:30:44,139
we're getting that reset that you talked

748
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:47,950
about and and getting some more bacteria

749
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:50,980
in there so all right right but then all

750
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:52,720
sales are probably you know like you

751
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:54,759
said all soils need fungal activity

752
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,890
that's the subway system for our

753
00:30:54,759 --> 00:30:58,839
bacteria to move around it creates soil

754
00:30:56,890 --> 00:31:01,360
structure it prevents erosion all of the

755
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:03,039
things that you talk about in in teeming

756
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:05,769
with microbes and and teeming with fungi

757
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:07,349
so right when I make a compost tea

758
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,839
because this is where I

759
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:11,759
I find it people email me or like I'm

760
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:14,099
growing cannabis

761
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:16,919
I need a bacterial tea this is you know

762
00:31:14,099 --> 00:31:19,288
I don't want fungus so I'm doing it this

763
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,020
way or I want a fungally dominant - so I

764
00:31:19,288 --> 00:31:24,808
need to add you know baby oats and then

765
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:26,700
and then get this fungally dominated tea

766
00:31:24,808 --> 00:31:29,099
and I think people get so caught up in

767
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,460
that that they forget that compost tea

768
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:34,048
is really about microbial diversity and

769
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:36,450
nutrient cycling because realistically

770
00:31:34,048 --> 00:31:39,720
that that cannabis plant or that tomato

771
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,058
or lettuce is really controlling the

772
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,710
rhizosphere right what organisms are

773
00:31:42,058 --> 00:31:45,869
going to be successful so we're just

774
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:47,940
trying to put out as many as we can and

775
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,629
really let the plant be in charge of

776
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:50,210
that process

777
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:52,890
would you agree without it right

778
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:54,690
absolutely absolutely and I always you

779
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:57,179
know in my talk I always start out with

780
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:59,788
the concept that yep this is how the

781
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,700
system worked but the plant is in

782
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:04,829
control not you it's the plant that

783
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:07,288
makes the decision and so even if you

784
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:09,629
even if you put down a back securely

785
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:12,929
dominated tea if the plant needs fungal

786
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:14,730
ooh fungal you know materials or needs

787
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:17,009
to attract more but it'll change the F

788
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:20,190
Shadid and do what it needs to do to get

789
00:32:17,009 --> 00:32:22,710
the fungal and it needs is you're right

790
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,330
we tend to get we can to get hung up on

791
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:26,009
the theoretical so to speak I mean in

792
00:32:24,329 --> 00:32:29,129
order to explain the system we talked

793
00:32:26,009 --> 00:32:31,798
about you know fungal bacterial the the

794
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:35,100
succession chart what I do now in my

795
00:32:31,798 --> 00:32:36,690
talks is I as I as I say basically if

796
00:32:35,099 --> 00:32:38,189
it's in the if it's in the ground for

797
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:40,650
more than a year it really needs much

798
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,940
more fungal than than bacteria and if

799
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,100
it's in the ground for less than a year

800
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,759
it doesn't that's not how I leave it but

801
00:32:44,099 --> 00:32:46,769
the plant

802
00:32:44,759 --> 00:32:48,929
you're right is in control and it's

803
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:51,179
going to make the decision if it can

804
00:32:48,929 --> 00:32:53,159
live long enough and generally you can

805
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:54,659
you know if you're in a situation where

806
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,390
you've taken a plant up to space and

807
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,549
you're growing it in a baby diaper you

808
00:32:57,390 --> 00:33:01,049
know and you've given it fungal and it

809
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:03,960
needs bacteria it's not going to live

810
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:05,879
but if it's in regular soil it'll it'll

811
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:07,890
figure out if I can live long enough how

812
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,750
to get the goodies that it needs from

813
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,490
those but those bacteria it's just

814
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:14,369
simple as that the plant is in control

815
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:17,429
we don't give them enough credit and I

816
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:19,048
agree with you 100% I would also say

817
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:20,290
that when we talk about bacteria and

818
00:33:19,048 --> 00:33:22,990
fungi

819
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,819
so many different species you know tens

820
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,880
of thousands of species of bacteria in

821
00:33:24,819 --> 00:33:29,470
the soil we don't know which one is the

822
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,890
mechanism of action in a lot of cases so

823
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:35,890
we can't just say I would argue we can't

824
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:37,840
just say bacteria by adding bacteria is

825
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,270
going to be beneficial without knowing

826
00:33:37,839 --> 00:33:42,789
what species of bacteria strain of

827
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:44,349
bacteria were we're adding so again with

828
00:33:42,789 --> 00:33:47,049
compost tea it's the shotgun approach

829
00:33:44,349 --> 00:33:49,000
but I don't want to get too caught up

830
00:33:47,049 --> 00:33:51,730
because it's very easy to add bacteria

831
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,069
bacterias everywhere it's it's easy to

832
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:55,809
make more bacteria but we want to make

833
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,849
sure they're beneficial bacteria and

834
00:33:55,809 --> 00:34:01,179
that they're working in you know a

835
00:33:57,849 --> 00:34:04,149
functioning nutrient cycling system sure

836
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:06,400
well yeah yeah absolutely and of course

837
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:08,829
then I always I always add but if

838
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,240
nothing else and you put a bacterial

839
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:13,179
down you really wanted a fungal the

840
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:15,428
bacteria might die they become food they

841
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:17,349
become food and so you know something

842
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:19,119
else in the cell food web will use it to

843
00:34:17,349 --> 00:34:20,429
make whatever the plant ultimately is

844
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:24,039
going to say it needs

845
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:27,269
yeah such a beautiful system in it yeah

846
00:34:24,039 --> 00:34:30,759
so that that reminds me of something so

847
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:34,300
it's pretty crazy I I see you being

848
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,879
quoted now as like a authority on the

849
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,200
subject so people will say in forums you

850
00:34:36,878 --> 00:34:40,360
know I read in teeming with microbes

851
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,099
this and then already write someone else

852
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:44,740
will say well in teeming with fungi Jeff

853
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:50,168
says this and and in this particular

854
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:51,939
case the topic was soil pH does it does

855
00:34:50,168 --> 00:34:55,210
pH matter because in this case the

856
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:57,128
gentleman had water that was I think

857
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:58,599
like eight three or eight four and

858
00:34:57,128 --> 00:35:00,250
people were saying you don't need to

859
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,929
worry about that the plants and the

860
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:04,110
microbes in the soil are going to buffer

861
00:35:01,929 --> 00:35:07,569
the pH now I have my own thoughts I

862
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:09,880
personally believe that pH is still a

863
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:13,360
factor I think we've gotten away with a

864
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:16,000
lot because the microbes do offer some

865
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:17,530
buffering capacity so you know 75 80

866
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,300
percent of time and I'm making those

867
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:21,730
numbers up we can we can check our pH

868
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:25,060
pen and not have issues but if I saw

869
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:28,000
water that was you know seven six seven

870
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:30,369
five or higher I would want to be adding

871
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,039
an acid and you know like citric me to

872
00:35:30,369 --> 00:35:34,269
lower the pH so go ahead tell me your

873
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,460
thoughts on

874
00:35:34,269 --> 00:35:38,110
okay yeah I think you know I think what

875
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,949
people are forgetting is what I say is

876
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:46,150
the the only place where pH counts is

877
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:47,799
around the rhizosphere now that's that's

878
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:49,329
really probably too much of the

879
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,820
generalized statement because the pH

880
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:54,250
doesn't just affect the bacteria the

881
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:57,580
fungi now other organisms are impacted

882
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,230
by pH as well but but but we tend to

883
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:02,079
think of it just in terms of how it how

884
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:05,019
it impacts the ability of a plant to be

885
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,299
able to take up certain nutrients which

886
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:12,820
is bacterium punji related I think

887
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:14,650
ultimately but so so the area where pH

888
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:16,900
councils where the plant in it doesn't

889
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,599
count on the surface if there's no roots

890
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,220
on the surface who cares what the pH is

891
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:23,170
and so that I think you know that's so I

892
00:36:21,219 --> 00:36:25,089
get into that but if someone gave me a

893
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,400
glass of acid and said here what are

894
00:36:25,090 --> 00:36:28,750
your plants with it you said the plants

895
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,619
are going to take care of themselves I'd

896
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,440
say whoa whoa whoa you're

897
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:34,150
misunderstanding what I'm sayin yeah of

898
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:37,059
course you got to be cognizant of what's

899
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:39,789
what's going on but in general as you

900
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:41,320
say 7080 percent of the time you don't

901
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:43,719
got to worry about the pH the plants

902
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,920
going to take care of it for itself if

903
00:36:43,719 --> 00:36:46,480
you're if you've got an extreme

904
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,240
situation yeah you've got to pay some

905
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,440
attention why do I test for pH all the

906
00:36:49,239 --> 00:36:55,569
time now I don't but if I see something

907
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,880
going on with my plant that's one of the

908
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:59,800
first things I think about this pH and

909
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:02,349
and it's one of the easiest things to

910
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:04,990
adjust so so that's where sort of where

911
00:37:02,349 --> 00:37:06,519
I come from yeah the plant and the

912
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,339
natural system should take care of your

913
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:11,110
pH for you but but but in your in the

914
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,450
example you gave you know you got

915
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:16,450
somebody adding a you know an outside

916
00:37:13,449 --> 00:37:18,939
substance with a pH of 10 oh my god you

917
00:37:16,449 --> 00:37:21,099
know whatever that's not a natural

918
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,079
system yeah when I when we talk about

919
00:37:21,099 --> 00:37:25,659
commercial cultivation you know where

920
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:29,259
you're doing this for a living I I like

921
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:30,549
to see a good soil test initially in

922
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:32,170
this case we usually use the may like

923
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:33,670
three in the saturated paste just to get

924
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:37,960
the ballpark figure I don't take these

925
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:39,970
numbers is you know is Scripture you got

926
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:41,710
to be able to track trends and so you

927
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:44,289
got to have a number any number is

928
00:37:41,710 --> 00:37:45,519
helpful but if you've got some specific

929
00:37:44,289 --> 00:37:47,650
ones and that's and as long as you use

930
00:37:45,519 --> 00:37:49,449
the same ones each time that's great

931
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:51,190
yeah and I think testing your water - is

932
00:37:49,449 --> 00:37:52,750
really important especially for people

933
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:54,849
on the wells as that water may fluctuate

934
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:56,710
throughout the year it can make a

935
00:37:54,849 --> 00:38:00,069
difference and we've seen it with plans

936
00:37:56,710 --> 00:38:03,550
so yep I don't disagree I don't disagree

937
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:05,530
but but but here again if you were

938
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:07,120
dealing with a normal crop you know

939
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:08,950
you've done it adjust as helpful we're

940
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:10,539
done with a commercial crop and we you

941
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,829
know you're you're you're selling it you

942
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:14,139
got to pay attention to it in all

943
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:15,789
aspects of it you know you want to know

944
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:17,529
everything but you want to know with pH

945
00:38:15,789 --> 00:38:20,289
you want to know NPK you want to know

946
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:21,519
Michael biomass all of these things are

947
00:38:20,289 --> 00:38:24,909
have you been fooling around with the

948
00:38:21,519 --> 00:38:27,130
bio micro bio meter at all I haven't I

949
00:38:24,909 --> 00:38:29,980
haven't quite gotten on board with that

950
00:38:27,130 --> 00:38:31,539
product yet and I loved I think we

951
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,230
already had this discussion but we can

952
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:37,269
have it on air for fertilis nurse - so I

953
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:39,639
approach this the microbe side a little

954
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:42,400
differently than you do for me for

955
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:44,500
example this this microbe bio meter that

956
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,639
would tell me you know microbial biomass

957
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:52,239
in the soil it doesn't identify species

958
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:54,369
no for me it doesn't change my my

959
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:57,219
behaviors in terms of how I garden and

960
00:38:54,369 --> 00:39:00,099
that that's why I haven't quite figured

961
00:38:57,219 --> 00:39:01,899
out a use for it in my head because I'm

962
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:03,819
already going to be you know making

963
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,970
compost teas or using a high quality

964
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:08,830
compost or doing things to increase

965
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:10,329
microbial biomass and diversity you know

966
00:39:08,829 --> 00:39:12,759
getting a test back that says it's lower

967
00:39:10,329 --> 00:39:14,909
high doesn't change my gardening habit

968
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,020
particularly but what are your thoughts

969
00:39:14,909 --> 00:39:19,719
well I use it for a couple of reasons

970
00:39:17,019 --> 00:39:22,000
first first I use it well let me let me

971
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,339
back up a second Michael biomass in

972
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,429
general you can you can use Michael

973
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:29,559
biomass changes in micro biomass to tell

974
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:31,629
you whether inputs are helping or

975
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,099
hurting and so that's the first place

976
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:34,690
where I use it people come to me all the

977
00:39:33,099 --> 00:39:36,670
time and say hey when you endorse this

978
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:39,179
product I suppose of any good you know I

979
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,619
mean I got to grow plants and do it

980
00:39:39,179 --> 00:39:45,519
knowing that is able to increase a

981
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:47,739
biomass in the soil in a positive way is

982
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,739
a good indicator it's a pretty good

983
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:52,149
product and so I use it for that and I

984
00:39:50,739 --> 00:39:53,500
think you could do that as well you know

985
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:54,730
if you make a new kind of tea you want

986
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:57,219
to see whether it's whether it's

987
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:59,380
effective is it adding to the biomass or

988
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,549
not you know you take a test before and

989
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:02,260
then you take one after it's just like

990
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:07,390
you do an NPK

991
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:11,380
you can also use it to determine what

992
00:40:07,389 --> 00:40:14,379
the plant is doing so so plants in the

993
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,420
springtime produce tremendous amounts of

994
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,309
exudate and increase their biomass

995
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:20,619
around their root systems and you can

996
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:22,900
track it which is interesting you can

997
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:25,630
track the cannabis plant biomass changes

998
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:28,750
they change biomass when they start to

999
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:31,960
flower and so so it's just it's another

1000
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:36,369
tool now yes it does not identify

1001
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:38,639
species and right now it doesn't

1002
00:40:36,369 --> 00:40:42,099
distinguish between bacteria and fungi

1003
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:44,259
although there is now a beta test going

1004
00:40:42,099 --> 00:40:46,570
on on the next version which will do

1005
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:49,089
that which what I think will be very

1006
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:51,160
useful and maybe increase your potential

1007
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:55,150
use of it if you can do a little bit of

1008
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:56,858
bacterial fungi identification Oh ratio

1009
00:40:55,150 --> 00:41:00,550
or quantity identification that would be

1010
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:02,858
very very useful it's going to be able

1011
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:04,630
to do pH as well which i think is going

1012
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:06,279
to be useful and so it's just another

1013
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,108
one of these tools I don't think sim

1014
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:10,599
exclusive tool but it's just another one

1015
00:41:08,108 --> 00:41:12,159
of these tools to help you quantify

1016
00:41:10,599 --> 00:41:16,390
whether what you're doing is actually

1017
00:41:12,159 --> 00:41:17,920
helping whether it's hurting and I find

1018
00:41:16,389 --> 00:41:20,618
that to be a fascinating thing to do not

1019
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,019
all gardeners need to do it but but but

1020
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:24,730
if you want to analytics information is

1021
00:41:23,019 --> 00:41:27,280
power this is another little piece of

1022
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:29,829
information so you know micro bio meter

1023
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:31,269
calm it's fascinating and people are

1024
00:41:29,829 --> 00:41:34,359
coming up with new uses for it all the

1025
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:36,009
time which is kind of fun

1026
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:39,848
III don't know if you're aware of it I

1027
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:42,069
did you ever meet James Sotelo anyway

1028
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:44,980
this was the guy in it's either one by

1029
00:41:42,068 --> 00:41:46,509
yeah he was what he was the guy that

1030
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,969
gave the talk that the woman who

1031
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,859
invented the thing heard and decided to

1032
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:53,199
go home and and put the thing together

1033
00:41:50,858 --> 00:41:58,588
and James was a wonderful compost tea

1034
00:41:53,199 --> 00:42:01,269
brewer really avant-garde designer teas

1035
00:41:58,588 --> 00:42:04,509
maintained the High Line in New York the

1036
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:07,809
World Trade Center the battery parks a

1037
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:09,400
lot a lot of the stuff along along the

1038
00:42:07,809 --> 00:42:12,009
harbor in New York and unfortunately he

1039
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:14,460
died last week so we lost a great guy

1040
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:17,339
who's really a lot

1041
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:19,440
a compost tea world I think so so upset

1042
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:21,299
about that but he had some involvement

1043
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,829
with the micro bio meter which is flat I

1044
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:25,019
thought about it but don't want to be a

1045
00:42:22,829 --> 00:42:28,789
downer we're all on the back nine and

1046
00:42:25,019 --> 00:42:32,699
it's how we gotta pray that game well so

1047
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:32,940
the organic folks yeah I'm sorry to hear

1048
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,919
that

1049
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,380
I do recognize his name that you say it

1050
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,088
from compost tea so that yeah yeah I

1051
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:44,220
don't think I ever met him but I'm sure

1052
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:46,469
my father knew back in the day yeah yeah

1053
00:42:44,219 --> 00:42:50,779
so just to talk a little more about this

1054
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:54,088
micro bio meter if I were to apply

1055
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:56,130
mycorrhizal fungi or apply a coli or

1056
00:42:54,088 --> 00:43:00,119
Salmonella it would show an increase in

1057
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:03,329
biomass potentially yes yes it would but

1058
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:05,849
it would smell bad well but my cries she

1059
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:07,739
she's got some stuff very exciting stuff

1060
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:10,740
about mycorrhizal fungi coming in the

1061
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:12,179
test so again it's in beta but but yeah

1062
00:43:10,739 --> 00:43:14,399
I mean and I had this conversation with

1063
00:43:12,179 --> 00:43:16,980
I thought about Blakeley with these Lane

1064
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,690
you know I smile you know yeah if you

1065
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:21,329
put any coli in your soils can I smell

1066
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,710
that I mean in other words you gotta you

1067
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:24,358
gotta you gotta know something about the

1068
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:27,179
soil food web in order to be able to use

1069
00:43:24,358 --> 00:43:28,769
that tool if you pick up sort of smells

1070
00:43:27,179 --> 00:43:31,440
bad I don't care what the microbiome is

1071
00:43:28,769 --> 00:43:33,300
is this bad song you know there's

1072
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,889
something wrong with it but if you pick

1073
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,750
up that soil and it smells sweet and

1074
00:43:34,889 --> 00:43:40,170
measure the microbiome ask that's a

1075
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:42,059
different story so so it's just so so so

1076
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:45,450
it doesn't it doesn't so just so I'm

1077
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:46,980
clear it doesn't replace NPK or soil

1078
00:43:45,449 --> 00:43:48,000
food web tests I think you got to do

1079
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,250
those as well

1080
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,349
or look in the microscope in front of

1081
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:55,190
the cell food web test but but but it is

1082
00:43:52,349 --> 00:43:58,890
a very interesting effective new tool so

1083
00:43:55,190 --> 00:44:01,800
yeah it's right well another question I

1084
00:43:58,889 --> 00:44:05,579
had then was so I went to this soil

1085
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:07,230
scientist conference last January in San

1086
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:09,960
Diego and it's very cool and what some

1087
00:44:07,230 --> 00:44:12,119
of the speakers were talking about you

1088
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:14,070
know they were actually identifying the

1089
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:16,650
specific bacterias and their levels in

1090
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:19,470
soils but they were talking about how

1091
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:22,680
biomass changes throughout the day even

1092
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:25,529
they're like an hourly basis so yep yeah

1093
00:44:22,679 --> 00:44:28,579
we just really range with a product like

1094
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:31,080
that or because will change

1095
00:44:28,579 --> 00:44:33,719
it will change it's not that dramatic to

1096
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:35,039
change frankly but it does change but

1097
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,779
it's not that dramatic interp all we're

1098
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:39,150
talking about is you know if you look at

1099
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,600
a soil on it on the scale of one to two

1100
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:45,059
thousand and it has a reading of 285 on

1101
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:46,980
the micro bio meter test which you take

1102
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,420
out in the field the neat thing about it

1103
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:52,320
it shouldn't do it right there in the

1104
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:53,639
field right away you know and then you

1105
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,350
know you know that you need to add

1106
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:57,839
something that's not high enough biomass

1107
00:44:55,349 --> 00:45:01,440
to be able to feed those plants but if

1108
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:03,120
you have one that's 1700 oh my god you

1109
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,980
know you've got a pretty good situation

1110
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:07,849
you can start concentrating on other

1111
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,349
things then you're in your microbiology

1112
00:45:07,849 --> 00:45:12,860
so that you know it's a useful tool in

1113
00:45:10,349 --> 00:45:15,420
that regard I find it incredibly useful

1114
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:17,250
I'm having I'm having I'm having fun

1115
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:19,050
just sort of wandering around and you

1116
00:45:17,250 --> 00:45:23,039
know I go into the forest and they holy

1117
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:24,420
crawl you know whoa some of that some of

1118
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,980
the things I measure it's just about

1119
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,539
anyway I'm a nut ball you know I mean I

1120
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,240
would walk around with a microscope if I

1121
00:45:27,539 --> 00:45:31,980
could even waste a lot of time

1122
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,599
yeah fooling around testing with these

1123
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,519
things you know the missions in

1124
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:39,329
practical that's that's the bottom line

1125
00:45:35,519 --> 00:45:42,210
right on right I like that so one of the

1126
00:45:39,329 --> 00:45:42,869
other companies that I looked into was

1127
00:45:42,210 --> 00:45:45,300
Sol vida

1128
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:46,829
they do soil respiration tests and

1129
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:49,140
there's actually a lot of really good

1130
00:45:46,829 --> 00:45:52,500
research around measuring soil

1131
00:45:49,139 --> 00:45:55,710
respiration and co2 coming off of soils

1132
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:57,269
to see what sort of aerobic activity you

1133
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:58,769
have in soils but they're just the issue

1134
00:45:57,269 --> 00:46:01,710
I had was they were just really

1135
00:45:58,769 --> 00:46:06,059
expensive still a great company but

1136
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:08,429
expensive expensive and they're there's

1137
00:46:06,059 --> 00:46:11,489
some limitations to the test as well but

1138
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:13,440
yeah you know I again all of these tests

1139
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,879
whether you know whether they're perfect

1140
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,590
they're not they all health they don't

1141
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,970
give you information and information is

1142
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,050
power

1143
00:46:16,969 --> 00:46:21,569
and you want to know that you know i

1144
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:24,030
think i think the standardized test for

1145
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:27,240
michael you know microbiome a cyst is

1146
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:29,820
measure the phospholipids you know they

1147
00:46:27,239 --> 00:46:33,329
come from their cells and just take two

1148
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:35,820
one five hundred dollars you know so I'm

1149
00:46:33,329 --> 00:46:38,190
glad we're seeing these new tests coming

1150
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,930
along and I think ultimately let's go

1151
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:41,670
back to the question of the bacteria

1152
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:43,529
ultimately we're going to happen

1153
00:46:41,670 --> 00:46:47,068
she's in our own homes that are going to

1154
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,750
our fall hit our cell phone you know

1155
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:50,579
that's going to enable us take pictures

1156
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:53,909
and be able to go to able to determine

1157
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:56,670
what we have and boy would that be an

1158
00:46:53,909 --> 00:46:58,500
exciting time so for example I was talk

1159
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:01,068
about this this article I read last year

1160
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,599
in science I think was in science news

1161
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:05,699
where they go around they test soils all

1162
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:07,740
around the world and they're 511

1163
00:47:05,699 --> 00:47:09,808
bacterial taxes you know bacterial

1164
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:12,179
families and pop up everywhere they test

1165
00:47:09,809 --> 00:47:14,280
soils you know what if you go to the

1166
00:47:12,179 --> 00:47:17,399
kiss farm you test the soil and it's

1167
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:19,260
only got you only got 428 it's missing

1168
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,838
those other one you know which one is

1169
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:24,059
missing you can put them in does it make

1170
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:25,349
it does it make a soil better you know

1171
00:47:24,059 --> 00:47:27,750
well you got to be able to identify

1172
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:29,250
these bacteria and so when we get in

1173
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,260
there we're getting closer and closer

1174
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:34,048
and closer all ultimately I believe

1175
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:36,900
going to be growing or flower cannabis

1176
00:47:34,048 --> 00:47:40,318
we're all going to have a you know one

1177
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:41,818
of these 3d printers in our houses you

1178
00:47:40,318 --> 00:47:43,380
know so that when you want a new piece

1179
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:46,289
for the kiss machine you just go to

1180
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:48,599
kisses Webb's website you know and you

1181
00:47:46,289 --> 00:47:51,088
and you download the template to make

1182
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:53,039
the new pipe and poof you make it you

1183
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:54,328
know huh and then I forgot what the

1184
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:56,489
third thing was which was the point it

1185
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:57,780
was trying to make but you know we're

1186
00:47:56,489 --> 00:47:59,548
all going to have bacteria like a

1187
00:47:57,780 --> 00:48:01,619
bacterial and fungal identification

1188
00:47:59,548 --> 00:48:04,559
abilities and we're going to be able to

1189
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:06,030
say oh wow this soils missing 16

1190
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,519
different kinds of bacteria that it

1191
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:09,059
needs or this soils got powdery mildew

1192
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:12,298
in it

1193
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:12,980
Wow can you imagine it's coming it's

1194
00:48:12,298 --> 00:48:15,659
coming

1195
00:48:12,980 --> 00:48:17,548
yes Oh science is so fascinating to me

1196
00:48:15,659 --> 00:48:19,259
but I was you know getting back to what

1197
00:48:17,548 --> 00:48:20,818
you talked about with cannabis growing

1198
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,680
and all of that being sort of on the

1199
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:24,690
cutting edge some of the stuff that they

1200
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:26,460
were sharing at the conference very

1201
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,409
specific but it did seem like things

1202
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:30,329
that was kind of like oh yeah we already

1203
00:48:28,409 --> 00:48:32,608
we were too kind of knew that right but

1204
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:34,619
then they're able to prove it with you

1205
00:48:32,608 --> 00:48:36,088
know trials and these these the

1206
00:48:34,619 --> 00:48:38,250
methodology that they're setting up with

1207
00:48:36,088 --> 00:48:41,460
these studies so it was definitely

1208
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:43,940
interesting oh yeah I mean let's face it

1209
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:46,980
as we get more legalization

1210
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,200
opportunities to study you know who the

1211
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,719
things we're going to be able to pick

1212
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:55,500
out you know when you study a plant in

1213
00:48:51,719 --> 00:48:57,779
the like cannabis where there

1214
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,550
is a demand and they need we know in

1215
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,590
different kinds of uses and all the

1216
00:48:59,550 --> 00:49:04,110
different different chemical ingredients

1217
00:49:01,590 --> 00:49:05,190
that we're all trying to find hollowly

1218
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:07,890
quo we're going to have some

1219
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:10,860
unbelievable research opportunities you

1220
00:49:07,889 --> 00:49:12,359
know again once in the lifetime and this

1221
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:14,940
it's going to happen because sooner or

1222
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:17,180
later our stupid federal government is

1223
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:19,650
gonna back off I mean we just you know

1224
00:49:17,179 --> 00:49:21,779
we're just gonna make it happen and once

1225
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:23,910
it once that happens and you can do

1226
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:24,510
research on this stuff oh my goodness

1227
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:28,019
gracious

1228
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:29,550
unbelievable so changing subjects here

1229
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:31,650
anything you want to share looking back

1230
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:33,150
at your three books that are already on

1231
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,700
them on the market

1232
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,019
you mentioned yeah you know I know

1233
00:49:35,699 --> 00:49:38,899
remember when you first came out with

1234
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:40,920
tea made microbes you had the pH

1235
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:45,599
switched in there and yet it's an

1236
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,800
election sillier but was anything you

1237
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,960
found that you've been like you know

1238
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,030
looking back this was really important

1239
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,079
and I wish I'd talked more about it I

1240
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,060
know you did that with micro eyes'll

1241
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:57,299
fungus or I've changed my mind on this

1242
00:49:54,059 --> 00:50:00,090
maybe something's changed well you know

1243
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:02,930
I didn't include algae I think I should

1244
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:04,950
have I mean Alice he's part of the soil

1245
00:50:02,929 --> 00:50:10,460
and they're part of the soil food web

1246
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:10,460
and I think that was a was a mission um

1247
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:14,849
gosh you know I have here every now and

1248
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:16,649
then jotted down little things and I

1249
00:50:14,849 --> 00:50:21,420
just I'm drawing a blank right now

1250
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:23,970
ah but I guess what I ought to say is if

1251
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:25,909
any listeners come across stuff that

1252
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:28,230
bothers them let me know right away

1253
00:50:25,909 --> 00:50:31,230
and we'll take a look at this stuff boy

1254
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:33,480
that pH problem plagues me because every

1255
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:35,039
time they do a reprint a reprinting they

1256
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:38,219
go back to the first one it has the

1257
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:40,469
mistake in it but and then I always

1258
00:50:38,219 --> 00:50:43,409
worry about if the duck does the Dutch

1259
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:46,230
version have you mistaken pH does the

1260
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:48,299
Korean version oh yeah it's in 11

1261
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:50,519
languages also that's that sort of

1262
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,800
bothers me but ah you know to talk about

1263
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:55,590
the books in general I think what I what

1264
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:57,330
I have found to be the most satisfying

1265
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:59,100
in addition to the fact that people have

1266
00:50:57,329 --> 00:51:00,929
accepted the books and and I've read

1267
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:02,190
them and you know sort of applied and

1268
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:04,379
improved on them and all that kind of

1269
00:51:02,190 --> 00:51:07,860
stuff is the fact that people are now

1270
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:08,610
reading the books as a trilogy and I was

1271
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:10,710
a little

1272
00:51:08,610 --> 00:51:12,630
concerned that people were going to

1273
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:14,760
think these were three very separate

1274
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:17,250
books but they're not they really are

1275
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:19,050
tied together I mean obviously the the

1276
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:21,590
teaming with fungi is an adjunct with

1277
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:24,330
teaming with microbes fungi are microbe

1278
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:27,690
at the time I wrote the team with

1279
00:51:24,329 --> 00:51:32,519
microbes there wasn't really this wealth

1280
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:34,829
of information or or I don't want to say

1281
00:51:32,519 --> 00:51:36,869
craze but I need for the mycorrhizal

1282
00:51:34,829 --> 00:51:39,420
fungi stuff and it just appeared you

1283
00:51:36,869 --> 00:51:42,269
know 2011-12 and so that's why that one

1284
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:44,639
kid but teeming with nutrients appears

1285
00:51:42,269 --> 00:51:46,110
because why right team with microbes

1286
00:51:44,639 --> 00:51:48,839
teaming with microbes is just how the

1287
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:50,430
food gets to the plant and it's so

1288
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,079
important to know how it gets in the

1289
00:51:50,429 --> 00:51:53,489
plant and how it operates in the plant

1290
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,099
and then you could you can think about

1291
00:51:53,489 --> 00:51:58,739
it in terms of where it was in the soil

1292
00:51:56,099 --> 00:52:02,549
miss all packaged and all fits together

1293
00:51:58,739 --> 00:52:04,639
and and and I I really encourage people

1294
00:52:02,550 --> 00:52:07,410
when they pick up a gardening book to

1295
00:52:04,639 --> 00:52:10,349
any kind of gardening book to always try

1296
00:52:07,409 --> 00:52:12,449
to fit it into the to their body of

1297
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:15,869
knowledge you know because these things

1298
00:52:12,449 --> 00:52:17,879
are not written in isolation and a lot

1299
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:19,469
of people do just pick up a gardening

1300
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:20,610
what's wrong with my plant you know and

1301
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:23,369
they meet it and they don't think about

1302
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:25,289
it in terms of the soil they only think

1303
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:27,269
about it in terms of what beliefs are

1304
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:30,179
telling you know that kind of stuff no

1305
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:32,460
you gotta be thinking more holistically

1306
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:38,250
in or in order to be really successful

1307
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:40,289
at what you do so there I go I thought

1308
00:52:38,250 --> 00:52:41,699
about I thought about biodynamic concept

1309
00:52:40,289 --> 00:52:44,190
isn't it you know it's not as a whole

1310
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:45,779
it's the whole hippie just put

1311
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:48,059
everything together you can't look at

1312
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:51,690
just one part yeah I think it's funny

1313
00:52:48,059 --> 00:52:53,940
cuz soil really gets a bad rap or

1314
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:56,300
nutrients in general when we talk about

1315
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:58,170
a plant that's not looking as well

1316
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:00,660
people forget about all the other

1317
00:52:58,170 --> 00:53:03,480
variables like lighting and great

1318
00:53:00,659 --> 00:53:05,609
humidity temperature in my case I find

1319
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:08,219
I'd say and again I'm making up these

1320
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:10,860
numbers 75% of the people that have

1321
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:13,349
issues it's their watering habits even

1322
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,240
because the next the microbial

1323
00:53:13,349 --> 00:53:18,389
communities so dramatically with these

1324
00:53:15,239 --> 00:53:20,699
living soils that they end up what looks

1325
00:53:18,389 --> 00:53:22,009
like a deficiency is actually over or

1326
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:23,750
under watering

1327
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:25,460
yeah absolutely you know it's funny

1328
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:28,250
because you raised these things over

1329
00:53:25,460 --> 00:53:30,740
here it might in my basic talk that I

1330
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:32,389
give you know but the fifth or six lakh

1331
00:53:30,739 --> 00:53:34,399
slide you know when you give it talking

1332
00:53:32,389 --> 00:53:36,469
if you if you put in slides that

1333
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:37,760
generate in theory if people are

1334
00:53:36,469 --> 00:53:39,618
understanding what you're saying a laugh

1335
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,300
you know that they're listening and that

1336
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:43,400
they understand if they don't laugh and

1337
00:53:41,300 --> 00:53:44,780
they get to that slide then you didn't

1338
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,670
explain it properly and so you're going

1339
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:48,829
to go make sure you do so and one of my

1340
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:51,800
laughs slides at the very beginning is a

1341
00:53:48,829 --> 00:53:53,990
picture you know of a guy standing in

1342
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:56,839
water and now I have one of a reader

1343
00:53:53,989 --> 00:53:59,959
board that says spring is here I'm so

1344
00:53:56,838 --> 00:54:02,170
excited i wet my plans No and I always

1345
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:04,099
say to people we water our plants not

1346
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:06,559
necessarily to give the plant water

1347
00:54:04,099 --> 00:54:08,630
although that's obviously important but

1348
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:11,900
to keep the bacteria and the microbes

1349
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:14,240
alive they need water for God's sakes

1350
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:15,950
and you know it's amazing but in the

1351
00:54:14,239 --> 00:54:18,199
gardening world not the cannabis world

1352
00:54:15,949 --> 00:54:20,118
in the gardening world every garden

1353
00:54:18,199 --> 00:54:22,549
writer in America has written it at

1354
00:54:20,119 --> 00:54:25,510
least one column or done one radio or

1355
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:29,119
television show were on the subject of

1356
00:54:25,510 --> 00:54:32,780
the number one mistake people make is

1357
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,579
they over water their plants the number

1358
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:38,960
two mistake they make is they under

1359
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:40,670
water there and that's that's a standard

1360
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,800
and if you don't write that column once

1361
00:54:40,670 --> 00:54:44,510
during the year you know then you

1362
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:47,150
haven't you haven't you know complying

1363
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:49,609
with the rules of garden writing so

1364
00:54:47,150 --> 00:54:54,559
you're actually right watering is some

1365
00:54:49,608 --> 00:54:56,809
tea okey it's just you'd think it's

1366
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:59,088
intuitive but it's not have you played

1367
00:54:56,809 --> 00:55:00,828
around with moisture meters at all we

1368
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:02,449
use one from blue mats it's a digital

1369
00:55:00,829 --> 00:55:04,789
moisture meter but I'm always looking

1370
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:06,049
for other you know other suggestions and

1371
00:55:04,789 --> 00:55:08,389
what other people are doing to measure

1372
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:11,950
you know more quantitatively they're

1373
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:13,879
they're levels in the soil I I used to

1374
00:55:11,949 --> 00:55:15,679
you know and then I found there was

1375
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:17,269
enacting the one I had was an accurate

1376
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:18,019
night I've never I've never gone back

1377
00:55:17,269 --> 00:55:21,349
and done it again

1378
00:55:18,019 --> 00:55:25,750
I suppose I could I like to use my

1379
00:55:21,349 --> 00:55:28,369
finger not very accurate of course but

1380
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:31,699
something I've always done talk about a

1381
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:33,950
myth huh your finger can't tell where

1382
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:35,839
the soil is moist properly or not a lot

1383
00:55:33,949 --> 00:55:37,789
of my thinking ah crazy

1384
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:40,910
you know I've heard that too but then

1385
00:55:37,789 --> 00:55:43,400
one of the best gardeners that my botany

1386
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:45,049
teacher he that's what he does he's his

1387
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,880
finger and I was like well it's not that

1388
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:48,710
scientific but man you know you're the

1389
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,650
best gardener ago or I've ever met so

1390
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:53,840
I'm not gonna argue with you on this one

1391
00:55:50,650 --> 00:55:57,590
yeah yeah I guess yeah my father taught

1392
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,910
me how to do it you know it yeah yeah

1393
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,440
yeah I go wait a minute that's the same

1394
00:55:58,909 --> 00:56:02,179
finger you pick your nose where that's

1395
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:04,610
not an instrument what are you talking

1396
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:07,279
about you know but it is yeah this is

1397
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:08,990
but meters are fun again because the

1398
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:11,210
quantum of information once you start

1399
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:13,279
collecting this information you know if

1400
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:15,320
you do it properly oh my gosh you get a

1401
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:17,570
whole different picture whole different

1402
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:19,370
picture you know what is with holding

1403
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:21,110
water to this flowering the you know

1404
00:56:19,369 --> 00:56:23,630
what is you know what is withholding

1405
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:25,809
water due to the to the production of

1406
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:28,670
trichomes all that kind of stuff is

1407
00:56:25,809 --> 00:56:30,500
fascinating stuff unfortunately in the

1408
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:32,360
cannabis world we tend to share that

1409
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,349
information we were talking a little

1410
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,970
earlier I don't think we want to

1411
00:56:33,349 --> 00:56:37,670
necessarily get into it but about this

1412
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:39,199
Philo's situation you know because

1413
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:40,789
people people in the cannabis world were

1414
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,719
sharing information you know now we got

1415
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:43,250
a problem

1416
00:56:41,719 --> 00:56:45,559
but we do we tend to share information

1417
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:47,559
and I hope we continue to do so it's

1418
00:56:45,559 --> 00:56:49,759
very important very important

1419
00:56:47,559 --> 00:56:51,739
particularly with the big guys trying to

1420
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:54,680
get into the business you know we gotta

1421
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:56,539
we gotta support ourselves not it's not

1422
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:59,480
competition that way it's you know

1423
00:56:56,539 --> 00:57:02,719
that's healthy competition it's the big

1424
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:04,219
guys we gotta worry about yeah I do have

1425
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:05,839
actually one other question I wanted to

1426
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:09,980
I wanted to bring up and see if you had

1427
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:12,710
any information on so I got a call a few

1428
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:14,150
weeks ago about a woman who was

1429
00:57:12,710 --> 00:57:17,570
vegetable gardening and she'd done a

1430
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:19,940
test on her native soil and then also

1431
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:23,120
her raised bed garden and it came back

1432
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,619
with 40 ppm of lead in her raised bed

1433
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,569
garden you know where she bought potting

1434
00:57:24,619 --> 00:57:30,309
soil versus the one where her native

1435
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:32,510
soil was 0 ppm so she was you know

1436
00:57:30,309 --> 00:57:35,509
obviously upset about that and I had no

1437
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:37,910
idea what 40 ppm of lead meant on this

1438
00:57:35,510 --> 00:57:41,120
particular test to know if that was an

1439
00:57:37,909 --> 00:57:43,489
issue or not so I called the double USDA

1440
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,079
and the Washington State Department of

1441
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:46,219
Agriculture and I said hey what kind of

1442
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:49,190
regulations do you have around heavy

1443
00:57:46,219 --> 00:57:53,029
metal testing because for me

1444
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:55,429
as a soil company who because of the

1445
00:57:53,030 --> 00:57:57,410
level of fertilizer or nutrients we're

1446
00:57:55,429 --> 00:58:00,469
putting into our soils I had to register

1447
00:57:57,409 --> 00:58:02,750
our soil as a fertilizer which requires

1448
00:58:00,469 --> 00:58:05,209
heavy metal testing to make sure it's

1449
00:58:02,750 --> 00:58:08,059
safe now if I had registered as a

1450
00:58:05,210 --> 00:58:10,099
potting soil or a soil amendment what I

1451
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:11,779
learned from the double USDA is there

1452
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:13,700
really isn't any requirement there so I

1453
00:58:11,780 --> 00:58:17,990
could have high levels of cadmium or

1454
00:58:13,699 --> 00:58:19,399
lead or arsenic and they wouldn't they

1455
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:20,588
wouldn't know or really no I won't say

1456
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,869
they won't care but there's no

1457
00:58:20,588 --> 00:58:25,670
legislative policy around this so oh

1458
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:27,880
it's even more it's worse it's worse

1459
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:31,880
than that it if you wanted to have

1460
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:34,910
radioactivity in your material it's not

1461
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:37,068
tested for that either and so so you you

1462
00:58:34,909 --> 00:58:41,179
know it's unbelievable that you can get

1463
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:42,679
away with putting in potting soil yeah

1464
00:58:41,179 --> 00:58:44,328
so I called the Oregon Department of

1465
00:58:42,679 --> 00:58:45,379
Agriculture because they've always been

1466
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:47,240
really great

1467
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:50,568
whenever I've talked to them and

1468
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:52,189
basically what they said is they I think

1469
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:54,199
I did pass me through to a few people

1470
00:58:52,190 --> 00:58:55,880
and came back with well we don't if

1471
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:57,529
you're buying it for off you know by the

1472
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:59,210
truckload or you're just getting loaded

1473
00:58:57,530 --> 00:59:00,950
in the back of a pickup we don't we

1474
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:03,050
don't test it but if you're putting it

1475
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:04,460
into a bag then we do require heavy

1476
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:07,369
metal testing because all these states

1477
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:10,039
have different regulations and in this

1478
00:59:07,369 --> 00:59:11,480
case what they said was and it was I

1479
00:59:10,039 --> 00:59:15,289
don't want to say it was a very specific

1480
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:16,880
number it was like 238 ppm or 243 and I

1481
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:18,170
was like how is this how did you come up

1482
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:19,760
with this number I know it was somewhere

1483
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:23,210
right around that range and they're like

1484
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:25,280
well the FDA hired this consulting

1485
00:59:23,210 --> 00:59:27,679
company way back you know 20 30 years

1486
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,599
ago to set these levels and we've used

1487
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:31,279
them ever since and so I asked for him

1488
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:34,760
to send me research I haven't seen that

1489
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:37,490
research yet but you know that made 40

1490
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:38,480
ppm not look so bad but whiff but then I

1491
00:59:37,489 --> 00:59:39,949
got thinking about it you know if we're

1492
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,630
growing root crops if we're growing

1493
00:59:39,949 --> 00:59:43,489
cannabis you know things that are

1494
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:46,250
there's a lot of research to show that

1495
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:48,919
they're dynamic accumulators they uptake

1496
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:51,349
heavy metals really really well

1497
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,240
how do we know that what we're getting

1498
00:59:51,349 --> 00:59:55,010
is safe and that's something I just

1499
00:59:53,239 --> 00:59:56,719
wanted to bring up for listeners because

1500
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:58,400
the people are sourcing things from so

1501
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,679
many different places or using really

1502
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,119
really high levels of rock dust and we

1503
01:00:00,679 --> 01:00:02,779
could be getting these heavy metals in

1504
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:05,870
their final

1505
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:07,490
and it could be an issue I just wanted

1506
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,659
to hear your opinion and what what you

1507
01:00:07,489 --> 01:00:11,659
found on the subject

1508
01:00:08,659 --> 01:00:13,009
well I'm very concerned about it first

1509
01:00:11,659 --> 01:00:16,339
of all let's talk about the forty number

1510
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:19,190
I mean this stuff is cumulative and so

1511
01:00:16,340 --> 01:00:22,750
so yeah it may only be 40 you know but

1512
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:25,849
but you know then you go then you go and

1513
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:27,559
rub up against your wall or you know who

1514
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:29,690
knows what I mean so it adds up it's

1515
01:00:27,559 --> 01:00:30,920
like having a backpack you know forty

1516
01:00:29,690 --> 01:00:31,940
but then you run into something else

1517
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:33,829
that's forty and all of a sudden you

1518
01:00:31,940 --> 01:00:36,619
have a me in your backpack not just 40

1519
01:00:33,829 --> 01:00:38,929
so so that I'm concerned about any

1520
01:00:36,619 --> 01:00:40,670
number I don't think it had anything to

1521
01:00:38,929 --> 01:00:42,529
do with the fact that one was raised bed

1522
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:45,619
one was in ground I mean it was the soil

1523
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:48,380
that they brought in it had the lead in

1524
01:00:45,619 --> 01:00:51,289
it I am very concerned about the fact

1525
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,840
that that we do not test for lots of

1526
01:00:51,289 --> 01:00:55,070
stuff in the cannabis industry in Alaska

1527
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,400
where I live they don't test for

1528
01:00:55,070 --> 01:01:01,309
pesticides on the plant wait a minute

1529
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,900
that ticks me off you know I mean

1530
01:01:01,309 --> 01:01:05,690
where's our where's our clean green

1531
01:01:02,900 --> 01:01:06,710
certified organic yellow standard this

1532
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:10,490
is something we're putting into our

1533
01:01:06,710 --> 01:01:13,159
bodies so so you know it's not just lead

1534
01:01:10,489 --> 01:01:16,639
it's radioactivity it's all it's arsenic

1535
01:01:13,159 --> 01:01:18,259
it's all sorts of stuff and and yeah I

1536
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,750
mean we should be testing this nothing

1537
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:21,470
and if you're growing a plant like a

1538
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,869
fern or

1539
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:25,639
cannabis that can create this stuff you

1540
01:01:23,869 --> 01:01:27,559
know one of them is fine because you're

1541
01:01:25,639 --> 01:01:31,129
not eating or smoking it the other one

1542
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:34,460
it's not so so it's upsetting I'm upset

1543
01:01:31,130 --> 01:01:36,410
I need to go back and look at the

1544
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:38,210
research but I'm not sure if it

1545
01:01:36,409 --> 01:01:40,369
accumulates it into its trichomes or if

1546
01:01:38,210 --> 01:01:42,230
it just goes into its leaf biomass in

1547
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:44,420
which case it's a little less concerning

1548
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:45,860
for cannabis but there are always some

1549
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:47,570
leaf material you know when you're

1550
01:01:45,860 --> 01:01:48,860
consuming well wait a minute wait wait

1551
01:01:47,570 --> 01:01:51,860
wait wait a minute we're putting you

1552
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:54,289
know in the new modern world they're

1553
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:56,090
putting those leaves into a machine is

1554
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:59,570
turning them into oil and so on the lead

1555
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:01,280
still there in theory so so so whether

1556
01:01:59,570 --> 01:02:03,039
it's trichome or leaf if it's in the

1557
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:05,120
plant you're turning it into oil and oil

1558
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:06,710
you know that's a potential problem

1559
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:09,949
let's talk about the research a little

1560
01:02:06,710 --> 01:02:13,179
bit there's a terrific podcast that ran

1561
01:02:09,949 --> 01:02:16,009
recently uh and I'm trying to remember

1562
01:02:13,179 --> 01:02:16,819
whether it was radio lab or something of

1563
01:02:16,010 --> 01:02:21,350
that sort per team

1564
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:24,650
google it involving lead standards and

1565
01:02:21,349 --> 01:02:28,099
lead keep the little Dutch boy that's on

1566
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:30,260
the lead paint and basically also it's a

1567
01:02:28,099 --> 01:02:31,819
brand new podcast I remembered it's a

1568
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:34,190
brand new podcast where they're trying

1569
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:36,019
to say to people why don't we pass these

1570
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:38,119
we got to do something about this with

1571
01:02:36,019 --> 01:02:40,610
various subjects and one of them is led

1572
01:02:38,119 --> 01:02:43,460
they have a whole podcast about the lead

1573
01:02:40,610 --> 01:02:45,980
paint industry the little Dutch boy and

1574
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:49,039
how there's so much lead and lead paint

1575
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:50,840
and why it was there and and and and why

1576
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,190
it's still around thirty years later we

1577
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,250
haven't done a damn thing about it and

1578
01:02:52,190 --> 01:02:57,409
we're not holding national lead company

1579
01:02:55,250 --> 01:03:01,639
that made the paint and other companies

1580
01:02:57,409 --> 01:03:04,869
accountable good god you know it's crazy

1581
01:03:01,639 --> 01:03:06,920
anyways fascinating google it and

1582
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:09,400
listeners will be fascinated by it no

1583
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:11,059
question I'll have to check that out

1584
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,500
that's that's really interesting

1585
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:15,590
especially since I'm getting ready to

1586
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:18,340
pay my house so but yeah yeah yeah but

1587
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:20,450
again not just not just the lead

1588
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:24,050
radioactivity is something that that

1589
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:26,659
always gives me in you have to in order

1590
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:29,510
to put you know your radioactivity into

1591
01:03:26,659 --> 01:03:31,339
a landfill your nuclear waste you've got

1592
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:34,220
to fill out form after form after form

1593
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:40,940
in order to put it into your potting

1594
01:03:34,219 --> 01:03:46,099
soil nothing bad bad what have we done

1595
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:49,970
to ourselves so the moral is you know

1596
01:03:46,099 --> 01:03:52,699
definitely test and you know you get

1597
01:03:49,969 --> 01:03:54,769
information you get smart yeah kind of a

1598
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:56,509
downer to end the podcast on but nowhere

1599
01:03:54,769 --> 01:03:58,090
you source your ingredients I would

1600
01:03:56,510 --> 01:04:01,550
agree with you that is very important

1601
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:03,380
right and all if all regards and just so

1602
01:04:01,550 --> 01:04:05,510
that we can you know keep it into the

1603
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:07,820
organic it's not just these chemicals

1604
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:10,940
that you gotta worry about so if you're

1605
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:13,610
using manure for example and it's got

1606
01:04:10,940 --> 01:04:16,250
tremendous amounts of phosphorous in it

1607
01:04:13,610 --> 01:04:19,190
you know it could be that you're using

1608
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:20,659
so much manure that your phosphorus

1609
01:04:19,190 --> 01:04:22,760
levels in your soil even though the

1610
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:24,889
stuff gets locked up are so high that

1611
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:27,630
mycorrhizal fungi will never work in

1612
01:04:24,889 --> 01:04:29,579
your soil for a hundred years

1613
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:32,309
you gotta test folks to know what your

1614
01:04:29,579 --> 01:04:33,960
numbers are so you can figure that idea

1615
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:36,360
you end up with a with the soil that has

1616
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:39,389
a you know phosphorous number that you

1617
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:41,970
know 250 parts per million you got a

1618
01:04:39,389 --> 01:04:45,119
problem you know it should be 50 parts

1619
01:04:41,969 --> 01:04:47,309
per million or lower I think and so so

1620
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:49,589
yeah testing is so important it's not

1621
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:53,190
just for the chemicals that we know are

1622
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:54,809
bad it's for the good stuff as well yeah

1623
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:56,970
I've seen some recent testing around

1624
01:04:54,809 --> 01:04:58,710
nitrogen where you know it's being over

1625
01:04:56,969 --> 01:05:01,230
applied and we're seeing you know some

1626
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:03,960
nitrogen toxicities actually from-from

1627
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:05,789
too high of levels so that's where a

1628
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:07,320
test came in really handy to sort of

1629
01:05:05,789 --> 01:05:10,920
confirm what we thought we were seeing

1630
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:13,289
visually with right exactly exactly well

1631
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:14,940
exactly so and again the place like like

1632
01:05:13,289 --> 01:05:17,610
Alaska for years and years we had a

1633
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:21,539
garden columnist not me who was telling

1634
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:24,450
people to put down 8 32 16 8 32 16 three

1635
01:05:21,539 --> 01:05:26,699
times a year on your lawn with a holding

1636
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:29,399
call that's a lot of fun

1637
01:05:26,699 --> 01:05:31,769
that's a lot of phosphorous those lawns

1638
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:36,300
they've got phosphorous afford the rest

1639
01:05:31,769 --> 01:05:37,889
of time so yeah they've even allowed to

1640
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,690
apply phosphorus on logs here in

1641
01:05:37,889 --> 01:05:42,000
Washington they passed laws around that

1642
01:05:39,690 --> 01:05:44,909
because of issues with it leaching it

1643
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:48,050
well I think I think nationally if

1644
01:05:44,909 --> 01:05:51,449
people take a look at the lawn lawn

1645
01:05:48,050 --> 01:05:54,360
non-organic lawn foods you'll see there

1646
01:05:51,449 --> 01:05:55,710
is a no-no number zero from the middle

1647
01:05:54,360 --> 01:05:57,990
number you're not allowed to put

1648
01:05:55,710 --> 01:06:02,789
phosphorus were 3040 years away from

1649
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:04,319
peak phosphorus and and and that's gonna

1650
01:06:02,789 --> 01:06:06,869
be a bad problem we thought climate

1651
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:09,539
changes a bit if we run out of

1652
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:10,889
phosphorus we're dead well you know Jeff

1653
01:06:09,539 --> 01:06:13,019
I really appreciate you taking the time

1654
01:06:10,889 --> 01:06:15,119
