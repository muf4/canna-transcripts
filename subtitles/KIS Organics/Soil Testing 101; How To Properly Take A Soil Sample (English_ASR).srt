1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,798
so today I'd like to talk about soil

2
00:00:02,279 --> 00:00:06,240
testing now soil testing is very

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,920
important so we know what sort of

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,759
fertility exists in our bed sure we

5
00:00:08,919 --> 00:00:13,679
could go with a generalized fertilizer

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,320
recommendation or guess based on uh what

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,679
our plants look like and what sort of

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,679
symptoms or deficiencies they're

9
00:00:16,679 --> 00:00:20,879
displaying but if we really want to dial

10
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:24,320
in our fertility and know exactly what

11
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:26,439
levels of nitrates phosphorus potassium

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,278
calcium magnesium all of these things

13
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:31,879
are in our soil then we have to do a

14
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:33,840
soil test it will also tell us pH uh our

15
00:00:31,879 --> 00:00:36,039
the EC of our soil and a bunch of really

16
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,640
useful metrics for dialing in our soil

17
00:00:36,039 --> 00:00:41,200
for our next cycle of

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,200
plants okay so the very first step would

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,320
be to go onto the website at kis

20
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,239
organics.com you're going to click on

21
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,439
the amend Tab and then go down there

22
00:00:48,238 --> 00:00:53,439
until you see the soil testing and

23
00:00:50,439 --> 00:00:55,519
consultations so on that page we have a

24
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,558
list of options of various types of

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,399
tests that we offer all of these tests

26
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:02,039
are through Logan labs and the price on

27
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,359
our website is going to be exact same

28
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,040
price as through Logan directly so if

29
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:08,879
you can order through us it does help

30
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,240
support us now we offer everything from

31
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:12,519
the complete soil test with an analysis

32
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:15,000
all the way through to checking your

33
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:17,599
irrigation water for suitability uh

34
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,200
tissue testing and then final finally a

35
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:22,239
standalone analysis if you have a soil

36
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:24,118
test from another lab or if you have a

37
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:25,280
Logan test that you got independently we

38
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,959
do charge a little bit more for the

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,599
analysis if you don't order the soil

40
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,399
testing through us so if you plan on

41
00:01:28,599 --> 00:01:32,879
doing both then the best op option is

42
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,719
this very first complete soil test so

43
00:01:32,879 --> 00:01:36,959
you just add it to your cart go ahead

44
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:40,200
and check out as you would normally and

45
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:42,399
then what will happen next is you'll

46
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,600
receive an email from us typically the

47
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,759
same day or the next business day at the

48
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,718
latest and it'll come from orders at

49
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,799
kiss organics.com so be sure to check

50
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:54,078
your spam folder and on that you'll see

51
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:55,759
you'll get an attachment that will

52
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:58,000
already be filled out you'll just put in

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,920
the sample ID in this case we use Garden

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,438
one and then we also have the

55
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,000
instructions as well as how to fill out

56
00:02:01,438 --> 00:02:05,038
the submission worksheet and how to take

57
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,560
the sample that you'll receive digitally

58
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,360
as well so let's talk about what tools

59
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,878
you need for a soil test now you will

60
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,519
need a plastic Ziploc bag that you can

61
00:02:12,878 --> 00:02:17,799
ride on and tape you'll need gloves

62
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:19,840
because the moisture from your fingers

63
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,599
can impart sodium and other minerals

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,519
that can affect the results of your soil

65
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:27,399
test and you'll want either a stainless

66
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:29,280
steel Trel or your hand just you can use

67
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,640
your hand if it's potting soil like this

68
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,800
which is my reference or a soil probe if

69
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:36,279
you want to get one of those they're

70
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:38,599
like $20 or you can make one out of

71
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,919
PVC okay so I just switched to an empty

72
00:02:38,598 --> 00:02:41,679
bed because I thought it would be easier

73
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:43,958
for this demonstration I've got my

74
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:46,120
gloves on and I grabbed a clean bowl

75
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:47,840
that I can mix the samples in so I'm

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,800
just reaching down with my hand I'm

77
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,640
pulling out a handful about a 6inch

78
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,280
depth I'm going to do that from multiple

79
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:56,238
places in the bed so I get a more

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,878
homogeneous sample now you can sample

81
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,400
multiple garden beds at the same time

82
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:01,759
that's definitely an option

83
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,480
you can just mix all the samples

84
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:06,280
together and get a rough idea of where

85
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:07,919
your soil is in your garden overall now

86
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,479
if you want to send in multiple samples

87
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,839
you absolutely can too that's definitely

88
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:13,000
an option but if you're trying to save

89
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,640
money in a lot of cases you can just mix

90
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,519
them together and the samples will be

91
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:20,318
close enough or give you a pretty good

92
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,319
idea of where your fertility is in your

93
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:24,840
garden so the next step is to mix the

94
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,878
soil even more thoroughly together just

95
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,120
to make sure that's it's fully

96
00:03:25,878 --> 00:03:29,840
homogenized you can do this regardless

97
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,158
of the size of your sample or how many

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,158
samples you take you just want to make

99
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:35,280
sure to mix it thoroughly prior to

100
00:03:33,158 --> 00:03:38,120
putting it into the Ziploc

101
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,318
bag I'm going to put a generous amount

102
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,640
into the Ziploc bag the lab says they

103
00:03:40,318 --> 00:03:44,318
want at least two cups I always put in

104
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:45,919
extra it doesn't hurt anything to

105
00:03:44,318 --> 00:03:47,719
include a little extra in your sample

106
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:51,199
and that will guarantee they have enough

107
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:51,199
especially if they have to rerun a

108
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,199
test next you want to label the soil

109
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,120
sample to make sure it matches exactly

110
00:03:56,199 --> 00:04:00,078
what's on the submission sheet this is

111
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,000
especially important if you have

112
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,239
multiple samples so that there's no

113
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,759
issues of things getting mixed

114
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:10,360
up and then the final step is just to

115
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:12,719
tape up the soil sample uh making sure

116
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,360
to add extra tape right along the Ziploc

117
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,839
seal as well as taping the bag to itself

118
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,040
just to make sure that nothing spills

119
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:22,879
out during the shipping process I found

120
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,759
the best way to ship these soil samples

121
00:04:22,879 --> 00:04:28,319
if you're just shipping one sample is to

122
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,160
use a USPS Priority Flat Rate envelope

123
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:32,279
or padded envelope and and then if you

124
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,759
have multiple samples then you could

125
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:36,519
move up to like a medium flat rate box

126
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:38,680
unless you're really close to their

127
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:41,038
location this tends to be the most

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,319
affordable way to ship these products

129
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:44,918
and don't forget to include your

130
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:47,478
submission sheet along with the soil

131
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:50,439
sample in the in the envelope or in the

132
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:53,680
box and you should be good to

133
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:56,038
go so after the lab receives your test

134
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,959
they will reach out to us with the test

135
00:04:56,038 --> 00:05:00,159
results and the same day that we get the

136
00:04:57,959 --> 00:05:03,239
results we will send them on to you if

137
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,600
you have an analysis as part of your

138
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,759
package that you ordered through kiss

139
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,360
Organics we will also send you that

140
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:10,919
comprehensive analysis as well uh here's

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,000
a sample of an email that you would get

142
00:05:10,918 --> 00:05:15,038
from us they typically come from Brandon

143
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,120
and they include some resources on our

144
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:19,079
website that you can check out as well

145
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,759
as some additional notes just the high

146
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:23,719
Lev stuff of what we saw on the test the

147
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,080
test themselves this is the standard

148
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,520
test this would be the mik 3 extraction

149
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:29,318
this is going to tell us everything

150
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:31,799
that's in the soil from an acid

151
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,759
extraction action perspective and then

152
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,918
in conjunction for the complete test we

153
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,560
also have this saturated paste report

154
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,318
the saturated paste report tells us

155
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,038
exactly what's available to the plant

156
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,080
right now and so between these two

157
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:45,439
metrics we're able to make really good

158
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:47,680
actionable decisions about how to remend

159
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:49,439
our garden

160
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,478
properly and then once you have your

161
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:54,560
analysis you can go back to the soul

162
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:56,079
report analysis page on our website

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,478
where we list a bunch of helpful

164
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,839
information like cups to pounds uh

165
00:05:58,478 --> 00:06:03,199
here's an example of what a analysis

166
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,159
