00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:55,769
farming and specifically more these

46
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:59,728
these fish products yeah sure kind of a

47
00:01:55,769 --> 00:02:03,030
funny story taking me from my home and

48
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:05,899
leading me back to my home so I grew up

49
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:10,080
in Wisconsin and went to college there

50
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:14,219
and while I was in college I came out

51
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,650
here to where I'm currently living in

52
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:19,979
Seattle area and I came out to study

53
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:24,289
killer whales and out in the San Juan

54
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:29,339
Islands just off of north of Seattle and

55
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:31,289
loved it out here and ended up sticking

56
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:35,420
around in the area in getting into

57
00:02:31,289 --> 00:02:38,879
teaching environmental education and got

58
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:42,809
really into that really enjoyed that and

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,539
kind of found a calling I guess and that

60
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:47,569
led me into really looking at the

61
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:51,659
environmental side of our food systems

62
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:53,129
diving in deep on that trying to figure

63
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:56,340
out how we're gonna grow food in the

64
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,490
future so that we're not harming future

65
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,590
generations that led me to spending a

66
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:03,900
year on a permaculture farm out there

67
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,490
called Bullock's permaculture farm where

68
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,909
I learned a lot of sustainable living

69
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:10,740
skills a lot about growing food and just

70
00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:12,689
honestly really nerded out with the

71
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,189
stack of books from the library next to

72
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:17,159
my bed every night and learning

73
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:20,400
everything I could about growing fruits

74
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,539
vegetables nuts let's see and then left

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,159
there my wife and I moved back to her

76
00:03:24,539 --> 00:03:28,739
family's farm where she grew up

77
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,810
and we ended up buying a 20 acre chunk

78
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:36,209
from her parents and started doing a

79
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:39,810
community supported agriculture farm and

80
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:42,269
immediately planted everything we could

81
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:44,430
so every fruit nut and vegetable that

82
00:03:42,269 --> 00:03:47,450
you can grow in the climate which is

83
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:49,650
know for your listener is a great way to

84
00:03:47,449 --> 00:03:51,629
make sure that there's always something

85
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,849
to do outside and also a really good way

86
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:57,509
to make sure that you never turn a

87
00:03:53,849 --> 00:03:59,310
profit trying to be so diversified but

88
00:03:57,509 --> 00:04:02,189
it's you know our pantry always looks

89
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:04,530
amazing and it's really fun and

90
00:04:02,189 --> 00:04:07,560
educational just probably not the

91
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,150
greatest business plan in the world so

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,099
we continue to do something like that in

93
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,560
some form every year we do a lot of work

94
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:19,168
trade because we both work off the farm

95
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:21,540
and so that led me I went back and

96
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:24,000
visited my family in Wisconsin and ended

97
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,010
up bringing my wife and kids to take a

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,560
tour of this fertilizer plant this

99
00:04:26,009 --> 00:04:29,149
organic fertilizer plant I had her

100
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,560
about that's just five minutes from my

101
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:32,359
parents house though this is kind of

102
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,689
near Green Bay Wisconsin right on Lake

103
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,400
Michigan and I took the two are not

104
00:04:35,689 --> 00:04:41,750
really knowing what I was getting into

105
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:43,759
and watch the process of this recycling

106
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,279
of fish scraps that we'll get into more

107
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,870
here on this call and got to the end of

108
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:50,929
it and just said wow this is amazing you

109
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,759
guys are taking a waste waste stream

110
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,939
source and making this incredible

111
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:57,139
fertilizer out of it and this is five

112
00:04:55,939 --> 00:04:57,589
minutes from where I grew up this is

113
00:04:57,139 --> 00:04:59,660
crazy

114
00:04:57,589 --> 00:05:01,250
and we got to the end and they actually

115
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,229
mentioned that they're looking to hire

116
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,168
somebody out in the Seattle area to work

117
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:09,949
with the Alaskan fisheries on obtaining

118
00:05:06,168 --> 00:05:12,168
scrap and I said give me a call and one

119
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,810
thing led to another and Here I am eight

120
00:05:12,168 --> 00:05:17,180
years later of working for DRAM so now

121
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:19,939
I'm currently the director of sales of

122
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:22,370
our fertilizer division now I grew up

123
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:24,439
knowing about DRAM because my parents

124
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:27,199
owned a nursery but when I think of DRAM

125
00:05:24,439 --> 00:05:30,439
I think of sprayers and I think of hoses

126
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,089
and and things like that so what can you

127
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:34,160
talk a little bit on what DRAM overall

128
00:05:32,089 --> 00:05:35,779
as a corporation does I know they have

129
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,810
hands in a lot of different aspects of

130
00:05:35,779 --> 00:05:40,579
agriculture sure and that's yeah I'm

131
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:42,740
right with you we're where I had worked

132
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:45,949
at a nursery as the you know the edible

133
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:47,840
food the edible plant specialist and and

134
00:05:45,949 --> 00:05:49,129
that's what I knew drama is is anything

135
00:05:47,839 --> 00:05:51,649
that you screw onto the end of a hose

136
00:05:49,129 --> 00:05:54,259
has drams name on it so the water wands

137
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:57,168
so the company actually started like 80

138
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:59,689
years ago now we celebrated our 75th

139
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:01,699
anniversary just recently really cool

140
00:05:59,689 --> 00:06:04,579
company created and and are started in

141
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:06,949
Wisconsin and the the flagship invention

142
00:06:04,579 --> 00:06:08,779
was the water breaker so you're familiar

143
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,279
with that that the screen that softens

144
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:12,649
the water spray so that you don't

145
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:15,109
trample your flowers when you're when

146
00:06:12,649 --> 00:06:16,609
you're watering them and so that's still

147
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,889
what a lot of people know DRAM for is

148
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:20,569
you know go into any flora culture

149
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:22,910
greenhouse or anything and what you

150
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:26,089
screw onto the end of a hose DRAM also

151
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:29,630
has a you know developed a line of home

152
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:31,219
gardener tools and so you go into an

153
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:33,769
independent garden center and you'll see

154
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:36,860
a big colorful racks of sprinklers and

155
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:38,478
hoses and and don't you screw on to the

156
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:40,680
hoses and then our commercial division

157
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:43,199
that I was just describing does

158
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,788
you know if you build a greenhouse we do

159
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,919
pretty much we can do pretty much

160
00:06:44,788 --> 00:06:50,250
everything after that so the fan layout

161
00:06:46,918 --> 00:06:52,288
the irrigation systems known a lot for

162
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:56,100
really high quality sprayers chemical

163
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:58,769
applicators we do the hoses and so on we

164
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,660
have another division that deals with

165
00:06:58,769 --> 00:07:02,849
it's our newest division dealing with

166
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,370
water purification systems using ozone

167
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:07,620
the more high capital projects and just

168
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:07,889
the coolest company I work for with you

169
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,680
know

170
00:07:07,889 --> 00:07:13,199
family-owned and and nobody ever leaves

171
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,930
the joke is you know nobody ever leaves

172
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,150
the company so a lot of people have been

173
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:21,629
there for 20 30 years and so on

174
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:23,909
so that was a long way of saying about

175
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:26,399
20 years ago the the owner of the

176
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:29,430
company Kurt Graham started using a fish

177
00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:32,069
fertilizer in Wisconsin and was amazed

178
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:33,750
at his little you know his small hobby

179
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,490
greenhouse at the results he was seeing

180
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:37,589
you know just on plants like cyclamen

181
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:39,478
and so on and he went to the to the

182
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:41,369
plant and took a look at it and at that

183
00:07:39,478 --> 00:07:42,569
time it was pretty rundown and open

184
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:44,129
tanks and it was near the high school

185
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:48,478
near the high school that I actually

186
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:53,098
went to and ended up buying the plant

187
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:54,810
and buying a building and really making

188
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:57,269
everything you know state-of-the-art as

189
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,649
far as fish fertilizer goes and so we're

190
00:07:57,269 --> 00:08:01,889
really proud of our plant it's very

191
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:05,310
clean and we've just recently invested

192
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:07,050
in a lot more storage so that we can age

193
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,399
the product of product longer you know I

194
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,530
can get into that a little bit more

195
00:08:08,399 --> 00:08:12,149
later but yeah we've been doing the fish

196
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:14,279
fertilizer thing for about 20 years

197
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:16,168
reason a lot of existing Graham

198
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:17,758
customers don't know about it is we you

199
00:08:16,168 --> 00:08:20,879
know we do a lot of the other dram

200
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,169
business for indoor growing the flora

201
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:27,300
culture industry and the fish fertilizer

202
00:08:25,168 --> 00:08:29,129
just naturally fits a lot more in the

203
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,470
outdoor agriculture so we sell a lot of

204
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:33,899
it in 5,000 gallon tanker loads to

205
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:36,538
outdoor growers yeah and I want to get

206
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:38,129
into that on scale affordability and

207
00:08:36,538 --> 00:08:40,979
some of the issues issues around

208
00:08:38,129 --> 00:08:43,139
application methods and rates but can we

209
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:46,528
just talk a little bit more about the

210
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:49,799
process itself so most people have heard

211
00:08:46,528 --> 00:08:51,809
of fish fertilizer but that carries a

212
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:53,490
lot of that falls into a lot of

213
00:08:51,809 --> 00:08:54,469
different categories and many people

214
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:56,450
aren't aware of the different

215
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:58,639
and I would say the two big ones in

216
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:01,120
terms of liquids when we talk about

217
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,500
liquid applications would be emulsion or

218
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,970
hydrolysate or hydro lysate we were

219
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,799
talking before the podcast and you said

220
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,340
it could be pronounced either way I've

221
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:13,099
always said hydrolysate so can you

222
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:14,870
describe sort of that process in terms

223
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,670
of how emulsion is made and how

224
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:18,049
hydrolysate is made and then we can look

225
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:21,409
into some of the ways that they're

226
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:23,240
different sure yeah I mean it's a common

227
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,219
question like you said and and you know

228
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,980
especially when I when I started

229
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,050
emulsions were around more I I don't see

230
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:32,420
it as much especially on the on the

231
00:09:30,049 --> 00:09:34,339
commercial scale I think you you know

232
00:09:32,419 --> 00:09:37,159
still go into a box store there's gonna

233
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,100
be a fish emulsion on the shelf the fish

234
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:42,559
emulsions are a thicker material they're

235
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:45,139
usually lower there I mean they're

236
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:47,089
always lower price tag and so that's

237
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:50,960
always attractive usually less than half

238
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:53,690
the price of a hydrolysis the emulsions

239
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,990
as far as I know are usually made from

240
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:58,250
menhaden from the Gulf of Mexico and so

241
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:00,009
there's some concerns there with

242
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:02,529
sustainability and now I say that

243
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:05,629
knowing there's probably some other

244
00:10:02,529 --> 00:10:09,319
emulsions on the market that aren't made

245
00:10:05,629 --> 00:10:11,120
from that that source a lot of times as

246
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,290
far as I know the emulsions they'll

247
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,210
remove proteins and some of the oils

248
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:19,610
that's a big one for us is the

249
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:21,830
hydrolysis will usually have a good fish

250
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:24,110
oil content in them and we think that

251
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:25,940
that's very beneficial so what you get

252
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,340
at the end with the emulsions is a

253
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:30,740
thicker material that's going to be

254
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:32,030
higher in nitrogen so that's obviously

255
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,519
something that growers like so you have

256
00:10:32,029 --> 00:10:36,079
a cheaper cheaper fertilizer that's

257
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,149
usually an analysis that's something

258
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:41,240
like five one one so five percent

259
00:10:38,149 --> 00:10:43,730
nitrogen one percent phosphorous and one

260
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,919
percent potassium it where is like the

261
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,860
hydrolyse that are hydrolysate our base

262
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:51,049
is a two five zero point two so two

263
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:53,120
percent nitrogen five percent Foss

264
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:54,679
zero point two percent potassium and

265
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,720
that's we're a little bit higher in

266
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:58,399
fosston some other ones but that's those

267
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,620
are those are in general are pretty

268
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,389
close to the numbers so then you might

269
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:05,299
ask why would you buy the hydrolysis why

270
00:11:02,389 --> 00:11:06,799
is it more popular than the emulsion the

271
00:11:05,299 --> 00:11:08,659
big difference is we're not heating it

272
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:10,609
up and removing all that stuff

273
00:11:08,659 --> 00:11:14,029
so what you have is this this low heat

274
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:16,899
process where the vitamins the proteins

275
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:20,839
the amino acids are not broken down and

276
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:23,689
so the the the general thought is that

277
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:26,269
the hydrolysis speed beneficial fungus

278
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:28,700
and bacteria like nothing else so I

279
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:32,439
would say that more than 50% of our

280
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,240
business is customers not buying on NPK

281
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,520
they're definitely not buying on

282
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,710
nitrogen per dollar that's just never

283
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,629
the case with hydrolysis with what

284
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:44,030
they're usually buying is this

285
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:45,919
incredible food stores and so you know

286
00:11:44,029 --> 00:11:49,299
we can get into this later but a lot of

287
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:52,339
times our fish will be sold right with

288
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:54,139
some sort of biological product you know

289
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:56,899
that I'm sure you're familiar with the

290
00:11:54,139 --> 00:12:00,049
bugs in a bottle idea big industry of

291
00:11:56,899 --> 00:12:01,789
folks trying to isolate the good guys

292
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:05,149
you know compost tea would be a way of

293
00:12:01,789 --> 00:12:06,139
of doing that by yourself and then you

294
00:12:05,149 --> 00:12:08,629
know there's plenty of companies that

295
00:12:06,139 --> 00:12:12,080
are really trying to isolate a handful a

296
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:13,909
really good bacteria and so they would

297
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:15,680
sell that along with our fish to help

298
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:18,289
multiply it once it goes on your on your

299
00:12:15,679 --> 00:12:19,909
plant or on your yeah I definitely want

300
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:22,399
to talk about that aspect of it that

301
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:24,100
microbial side of things but can you

302
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,539
just explain a little bit about how

303
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:29,120
emulsion is just how it's made you

304
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:32,299
mentioned high heat in that process and

305
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,340
then typically this menhaden this yeah

306
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:36,199
and I guess you know I I've never been

307
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:38,090
in an emulsion Factory and so I'm a

308
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,860
little bit hesitant to you know go on

309
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:43,399
record telling you how it's made

310
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:46,399
okay but but yeah what what I've been

311
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:48,889
told is that you're using ocean fish

312
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,169
your your your heating to extract the

313
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:54,220
oils and the proteins sometimes that oil

314
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:57,079
will be sold off separately as a

315
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,000
cosmetic industry and so on and in some

316
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,970
cases protein is removed for livestock

317
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,700
feed and then you have this thicker

318
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,200
liquid left at the end and so it's you

319
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:09,740
know a waste product of a waste product

320
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:10,879
that said I'll I tell people you know if

321
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,799
you're looking for a cheap source of

322
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:15,019
organic nitrogen you know try to make

323
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:15,829
sure it's an actual organic emulsion you

324
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,389
know that they're using an organic

325
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:19,580
process and not throwing something else

326
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:21,620
in there and usually if it's a 5-1 one

327
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,310
or four one one definitely not a bad

328
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,600
source of nitric

329
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:25,638
it's just not gonna be as good of a

330
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,879
microbial food source as a hydrolic that

331
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:31,100
will be yeah in my experience and also

332
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:34,370
this is a lot of the work from Tim

333
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:37,339
Wilson of microbe organics was that when

334
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:39,499
you start using these fish products

335
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:43,040
emulsion or hydrolysate in compost teas

336
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:44,769
the emulsion would actually inhibit

337
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:47,120
microbial growth in a lot of cases

338
00:13:44,769 --> 00:13:49,039
whereas the hydrolysate is one of the

339
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,688
best fungal foods out there I mean it

340
00:13:49,039 --> 00:13:53,469
feeds the bacteria as well so you get a

341
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:55,669
good good growth with the bacteria but

342
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:57,319
specifically it's an excellent fungal

343
00:13:55,669 --> 00:14:01,248
food which there's not a lot of great

344
00:13:57,318 --> 00:14:02,328
ones out there for that so yeah that's

345
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,550
what I've heard and I've done that here

346
00:14:02,328 --> 00:14:07,039
I have a decent-sized compost tea brewer

347
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:08,838
and so that idea of if you're gonna use

348
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,669
your compost tea on your orchard where

349
00:14:08,839 --> 00:14:13,279
you're going for a higher fungal

350
00:14:10,669 --> 00:14:14,509
population and I've definitely heard it

351
00:14:13,278 --> 00:14:16,159
both ways of whether to add the

352
00:14:14,509 --> 00:14:19,459
hydrolysis at the beginning or wait

353
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:20,838
until the end but that's interesting

354
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,188
about the inhibition on the on the

355
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,699
emulsion you know it kind of surprises

356
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:27,708
me a little bit right yeah and it was it

357
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,958
was this was over a decade ago so I

358
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:31,250
don't want to totally go on record there

359
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:32,899
either but I will say that there is

360
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,028
quite a dramatic difference I can

361
00:14:32,899 --> 00:14:36,889
confidently say that between hydrolysis

362
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:39,528
and emulsion from microbial perspective

363
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,990
with hydrolysate being far superior now

364
00:14:39,528 --> 00:14:44,568
you did mention adding it at the end of

365
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:46,490
a brew I will say Tim Wilson did a lot

366
00:14:44,568 --> 00:14:48,558
of research on this and found that if

367
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,870
you add fish hydrolysate at the end of a

368
00:14:48,558 --> 00:14:52,458
high quality compost tea brew you can

369
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:55,009
drop your dissolved oxygen levels within

370
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,688
minutes so it's much much better to add

371
00:14:55,009 --> 00:14:58,100
at the beginning or use it as a separate

372
00:14:56,688 --> 00:15:00,169
application from a compost tea

373
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,939
perspective at least what we're seeing

374
00:15:00,169 --> 00:15:04,370
when we use a dissolved oxygen meter and

375
00:15:01,938 --> 00:15:06,828
a microscope to evaluate the quality of

376
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:10,879
compost tea brew wow that's that's

377
00:15:06,828 --> 00:15:12,528
fascinating yeah and I I mentioned the

378
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:16,159
DRAM water division that's what we're

379
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:17,480
seeing a lot is you know we the main

380
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:19,818
idea at the beginning was a good

381
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:22,730
effective way to clean clean water using

382
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:24,349
the ozone the what's come out of it

383
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:27,199
you know and we of course knew dissolved

384
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:29,480
oxygen is good we had no idea how good

385
00:15:27,198 --> 00:15:31,278
and so studies and a lot of the

386
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:33,170
anecdotal evidence coming out of these

387
00:15:31,278 --> 00:15:35,328
greenhouses putting on extremely high

388
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:36,289
levels of dissolved oxygen in their

389
00:15:35,328 --> 00:15:39,588
water

390
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:42,049
as far as edelen's doing way better but

391
00:15:39,589 --> 00:15:44,209
of course the inhibition of pathogens

392
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:46,159
you know we know that pathogens love

393
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,888
anaerobic environments and they don't

394
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:51,439
like high levels of dissolved oxygen but

395
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:53,448
that that benefit of of high levels of

396
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,480
dissolved oxygen has become incredibly

397
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:58,399
apparent so one other key difference I

398
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,230
believe is that the emulsion tends to

399
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,028
have a much stronger odor I just opened

400
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,490
your bottle of hydrolysate the same way

401
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:06,500
I mean it definitely smells like fish

402
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,659
there's no denying that but it's not

403
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:12,799
overwhelming though I don't have the

404
00:16:08,659 --> 00:16:14,838
best sense of smell either I have heard

405
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,969
that emotion is a much stronger odor

406
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:18,170
I've heard that too I've used emulsion

407
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:19,940
it's been a while since I used in

408
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:22,179
emulsion obviously you know the guy I'm

409
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:25,699
not going out and buying fish emulsion

410
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:26,419
but I literally have our product on my

411
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:30,528
face right now

412
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:32,929
oh it's just outside excited giving

413
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:34,818
giving a dose on our vegetables and I'm

414
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:37,789
I can be a little bit clumsy when I'm in

415
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:39,289
a hurry and add some splash up on me and

416
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:41,689
yeah what we like to say is it smells

417
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:44,389
like fish you know it doesn't smell like

418
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:45,800
rotten fish you know Kirk Graham cold me

419
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:47,690
you know right off the bat it smells

420
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:50,448
like the ocean breeze I like that I like

421
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,470
that description but yeah it shouldn't

422
00:16:50,448 --> 00:16:53,149
smell like rotten fish and I've heard

423
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,278
people say that emulsions are a little

424
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:57,409
bit more of an offensive odor the good

425
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:59,689
part about it especially outdoor using

426
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:01,850
it outdoors is it literally goes away by

427
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:04,279
the next day you know so your neighbors

428
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,199
you know people in suburban areas using

429
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:09,068
it on lawns you can definitely smell it

430
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:11,360
for a couple hours but it it goes away

431
00:17:09,068 --> 00:17:13,279
I've also heard you know you had some

432
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,769
people will add if the smell is really a

433
00:17:13,279 --> 00:17:18,408
concern molasses can actually act as a

434
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:19,789
masking agent for it

435
00:17:18,409 --> 00:17:20,959
we've experimented a little bit with

436
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,699
like peppermint oil and that kind of

437
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,230
stuff but I I just you know it smells

438
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:26,000
like fishy peppermint which I don't know

439
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,620
that that's a whole lot better I've

440
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,259
smelled that it gets a little weird I

441
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:31,399
agree yeah right so we've talked a

442
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,400
little bit about emulsion but let's

443
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,070
let's talk a focus really quick on how

444
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:40,340
hydrolysate is made right so how do you

445
00:17:37,069 --> 00:17:43,069
have this product what's that how do you

446
00:17:40,339 --> 00:17:45,259
make this product yeah it's funny

447
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:46,700
because it's pretty simple yeah and I'll

448
00:17:45,259 --> 00:17:47,990
get into what the complicated part is

449
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,819
it's simple but I wouldn't recommend

450
00:17:47,990 --> 00:17:54,440
starting your own plant because

451
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:56,750
of the complications so so we take scrap

452
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:59,120
from from the fishing industry so we're

453
00:17:56,750 --> 00:18:00,710
taking all wild fish scrap after they

454
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,589
take the fillet off we'll take

455
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:05,569
everything else it's really important to

456
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:07,220
us for Graham it's really important to

457
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:10,099
us that we get some of the duck material

458
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:12,470
that has the natural enzymes in it kind

459
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:14,509
of a just a cool synergistic thing with

460
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:16,670
natures that those those enzymes and the

461
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:19,700
fish guts help break break down the fish

462
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:21,890
for it so what we're doing is obtaining

463
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:24,410
scrap in our case it's almost all

464
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,050
completely from the five Great Lakes the

465
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:29,120
fishing industry on the five Great Lakes

466
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:32,869
will bring them into our plant in in

467
00:18:29,119 --> 00:18:34,639
totes grind them up and then will digest

468
00:18:32,869 --> 00:18:37,729
them and at that point we're adding an

469
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,250
acid so all the hydrolysis use an acid

470
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:42,799
at that stage we prefer to use

471
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:45,440
phosphoric acid it's a little bit more

472
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,680
expensive than the alternative which

473
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,630
would be sulfuric acid at this point a

474
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:53,210
lot of people ask how how we can use

475
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:54,230
phosphoric or sulfuric acid seeing as

476
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:56,660
though on their own they're not

477
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:59,240
considered organic and that's the

478
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,519
National Organic Standards Board made a

479
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:03,140
ruling that it won't be possible to make

480
00:19:01,519 --> 00:19:04,789
fish burger like that fish fertilizer is

481
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:07,100
a necessary ingredient for organic

482
00:19:04,789 --> 00:19:09,440
agriculture and we need to have a

483
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:12,799
stabilizing aid so we're allowed to use

484
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,289
enough of it to get it pH stabilized and

485
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:18,169
so that's the key here tad is that what

486
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:23,779
what we're really doing is pickling fish

487
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:26,240
got it's not unlike you know your

488
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:28,099
grandma making vinegar pickles and

489
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,500
putting them in the pantry so we're

490
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:32,449
grinding digesting so we're letting it

491
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,759
sit in the tank with the acid and digest

492
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:38,720
then we run it through an emulsifier and

493
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:40,609
then a key for DRAM is that we have an

494
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:43,400
incredible amount of storage tanks where

495
00:19:40,609 --> 00:19:45,949
we can eat the product longer and really

496
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:48,890
let those fine bits of bone break down

497
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:50,840
and get into the liquid and so that's

498
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:53,360
that's a big one for us as we end up

499
00:19:50,839 --> 00:19:56,029
with almost always 1% of calcium in it

500
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:57,829
and that is a little bit rare some of

501
00:19:56,029 --> 00:20:00,109
the other companies will filter those

502
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,579
filter that bone out and sell that as a

503
00:20:00,109 --> 00:20:03,469
separate product I'm sure you've seen

504
00:20:01,579 --> 00:20:06,379
fishbone meal

505
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,579
floating around and that's that's that

506
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:09,710
would be that product we're trying to

507
00:20:07,579 --> 00:20:11,509
get back into the liquid does that give

508
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,058
you phosphorus as well because I know

509
00:20:11,509 --> 00:20:19,069
fish bone meal tends to be high in pee

510
00:20:14,058 --> 00:20:19,788
yeah okay yeah this boat it would be

511
00:20:19,069 --> 00:20:21,788
high yep

512
00:20:19,788 --> 00:20:24,079
so then that helps us get to that 5%

513
00:20:21,788 --> 00:20:25,759
phosphorus number you know some some

514
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:28,428
hydrolysis that are made from like a

515
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:32,119
product fish that are more a cartilage

516
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:33,679
based they that would I've seen numbers

517
00:20:32,119 --> 00:20:36,469
that's three so you'd see like a two

518
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,150
three one again two percent nitrogen

519
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:40,759
three percent one percent

520
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,679
faciem so then it's at the very end

521
00:20:40,759 --> 00:20:45,440
we're screening it and blending it and

522
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:47,390
so what's pretty cool about our places

523
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:51,740
you you you go and what's left at the

524
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:53,419
end you know the the the solids that

525
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,640
come out at the end because we're aging

526
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:57,288
it so long is not much at all

527
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,240
you know like for how much fertilizer

528
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:01,940
comes out of our factory you know you'll

529
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:04,730
see a couple 55-gallon drums of solid at

530
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,200
the very end and that's a combination of

531
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,240
the enzymes and the fish guts and then

532
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,190
the acid breaking down those solids and

533
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,380
getting them down to where they can make

534
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:15,019
it through a 200 mesh screen twice

535
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:17,330
before we ship it out but that's it in

536
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:20,359
so and so I got at the point that is a

537
00:21:17,329 --> 00:21:22,730
fairly simple process the hard part tad

538
00:21:20,359 --> 00:21:25,699
is we're taking something that I just

539
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,950
said earlier feeds beneficial biology

540
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,080
like nothing else and then we're trying

541
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,029
to stabilize it so we can put it in the

542
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:34,099
little bottles and ship it all over the

543
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,750
world literally we sell it all over the

544
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:37,908
world and sometimes it doesn't get used

545
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:40,269
for six months and so that's the tricky

546
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,909
part is we're trying to take this this

547
00:21:40,269 --> 00:21:45,710
extremely bioactive product and

548
00:21:42,909 --> 00:21:48,110
stabilize it for this moment in time and

549
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:52,009
so that's all about hitting this correct

550
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:55,519
pH there's other factors besides pH you

551
00:21:52,009 --> 00:21:56,929
know as far as getting it able so just

552
00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:59,629
so I understand that you get in all of

553
00:21:56,929 --> 00:22:02,509
these this these fish guts and fish

554
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:04,610
carcasses essentially this by-product it

555
00:22:02,509 --> 00:22:07,099
goes into a giant tank or multiple tanks

556
00:22:04,609 --> 00:22:11,509
and then the phosphoric acid is added

557
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:12,918
first as a way of establishing a pH a

558
00:22:11,509 --> 00:22:15,589
target pH so you're aiming for is that

559
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:16,880
right right otherwise we would end up

560
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:17,389
smelling like the emulsion you're

561
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,330
talking about

562
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:22,309
right so if we're not ph stabilizing

563
00:22:20,329 --> 00:22:24,139
that early in the process you're going

564
00:22:22,308 --> 00:22:26,359
to start to have a beautification okay

565
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,130
so then you hit this pH and then and

566
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:29,719
then sort of stabilizes everything and

567
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:31,400
then at that point your you say you

568
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,140
emulsified so you're just mixing it

569
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:37,570
really well and then the natural enzymes

570
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:39,799
and the fish are breaking down all the

571
00:22:37,569 --> 00:22:42,619
organic matter I guess you would say

572
00:22:39,798 --> 00:22:44,150
that the carcasses themselves over time

573
00:22:42,619 --> 00:22:46,099
and then when you're done are you

574
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,920
restabilizing it or is that really the

575
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:50,689
whole step so now we do need to check so

576
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:52,519
we have we do check before it goes out

577
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:54,200
the door to make sure it's within the pH

578
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:56,298
parameters the quality control pH

579
00:22:54,200 --> 00:23:01,130
parameters right so somewhere in between

580
00:22:56,298 --> 00:23:03,440
3.5 and 4 pH okay but that if we do need

581
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,090
to we in rather than adjusting will do

582
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,860
like blending if we do ever do have a

583
00:23:05,089 --> 00:23:10,548
problem there you know where we're we're

584
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:13,759
up above where we want to be or in that

585
00:23:10,548 --> 00:23:15,529
situation you know and a lot of times

586
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:17,839
there's wiggle room there as far as

587
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:19,250
being above four we'd probably still be

588
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:22,849
alright since we really prefer to have

589
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,009
it in that range so there shouldn't be

590
00:23:22,849 --> 00:23:27,829
any real microbes coming in on it at

591
00:23:25,009 --> 00:23:29,419
that point because of the high acidity

592
00:23:27,829 --> 00:23:31,750
is that is that right and that's what

593
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:35,750
allows it to stay stable in the bottle

594
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:38,539
right except there is some life so we're

595
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:42,019
good on the good news is that pH range

596
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:45,470
kills a really bad guys so Salmonella

597
00:23:42,019 --> 00:23:47,629
e.coli and so on there will be some life

598
00:23:45,470 --> 00:23:51,200
if we stick it under a microscope but

599
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:54,110
not enough life to make a a 275 gallon

600
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:56,210
tote below up which which if you talk to

601
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:58,308
people veterans of the fish fertilizer

602
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,470
industry everybody's got a story right

603
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:02,269
of something getting away from them and

604
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:05,029
a lot of times that happens that more

605
00:24:02,269 --> 00:24:06,440
often with sulfuric acid products that's

606
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:10,099
part of the reason we don't like to use

607
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,509
the cheaper sulfuric acid is there's a

608
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:14,808
reaction going on between the the

609
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:18,919
fishbone or any of the solid and the

610
00:24:14,808 --> 00:24:21,889
acid where as that bone gets broken down

611
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:24,820
the pH will rise and when we use

612
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:28,370
sulfuric acid that tends to happen

613
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:30,200
faster or less predictably I guess would

614
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:31,279
be the best way to say it and so you'd

615
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,039
be more likely to have

616
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:35,869
a pH shoot up when you don't want it to

617
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:37,039
be but to answer your question there you

618
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:41,119
know some of this is a little bit

619
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,799
unknown to us of you know that what

620
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:46,489
exact parameters and so we're constantly

621
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,619
logging and trying to learn more about

622
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:51,380
that so people really aren't making

623
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:52,819
their own fish hydrolysate at home they

624
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,210
might be making it more of a fish

625
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:59,559
emulsion it sounds like if you were to

626
00:24:56,210 --> 00:25:01,819
take fish and grind it up and then let

627
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:04,669
apply it to your plants that's

628
00:25:01,819 --> 00:25:06,649
essentially an emulsion more or less

629
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:09,140
yeah yeah except I don't know that this

630
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:11,720
I mean I your emulsifying fishing so I

631
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:14,450
guess you know I can pick a trout in my

632
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,029
Vitamix here that would technically be

633
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:19,160
an emulsified kraut you know whether

634
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:20,990
that would actually be what what on the

635
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,570
market has sold as fish emulsion you

636
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,609
know because the in that case there is a

637
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:27,349
heating process and stuff removed but

638
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,059
yeah I have seen some some YouTube

639
00:25:27,349 --> 00:25:30,619
videos of some guys make it homemade

640
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,329
what I've recommended to people is

641
00:25:30,619 --> 00:25:34,399
because it does happen where somebody

642
00:25:32,329 --> 00:25:36,589
gets a line on say University doing

643
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,500
Studies on fish and having these fish

644
00:25:36,589 --> 00:25:42,289
carcasses that they need to dispose of

645
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:44,150
and actually yeah bollocks permaculture

646
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:45,619
farm where I live they had a great story

647
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:48,019
about that where they had a line on

648
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:50,179
Aldous dish and so big and this is what

649
00:25:48,019 --> 00:25:52,190
I do recommend is composted hot compost

650
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:55,340
it you know if you have the means to do

651
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,410
it get a lot of good carbon source but

652
00:25:55,339 --> 00:25:59,619
if I remember that story you know from

653
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:02,570
20 years ago there was that was that

654
00:25:59,619 --> 00:26:04,129
they buried it all you know in the

655
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:06,319
compost pile and then maybe forgot about

656
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:07,400
somebody forgot about it and went and

657
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,799
tried to move it with the traffic

658
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,019
tractor loader and there's you know not

659
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:15,980
much worse smells than that of you know

660
00:26:12,019 --> 00:26:17,660
rotten anaerobic rotten fish so you just

661
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,960
want to keep it aerated obviously yeah

662
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:24,080
and wild animals are gonna go crazy yeah

663
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,120
that so that's yeah right but as someone

664
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:29,059
who's hoping to get into fishing here as

665
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:30,799
a personal hobby as I get older I have

666
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:32,990
heard of people taking those fish guts

667
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,000
and burying them right into their

668
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,920
gardens Native Americans used to put

669
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,289
them under there

670
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,110
I believe under there corridor tomato

671
00:26:38,289 --> 00:26:42,940
plants and things like that so people

672
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,439
can definitely use fish in those ways

673
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,080
and there's so much information online

674
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:48,730
people can go read about about that but

675
00:26:47,079 --> 00:26:50,439
it is important I think differentiate

676
00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:52,990
that hydrolysate is a totally different

677
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:55,090
product that you're not you're not

678
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:56,529
making it at home I guess is what out

679
00:26:55,089 --> 00:26:58,720
the point I wanted to get across to

680
00:26:56,529 --> 00:27:01,000
people right

681
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,309
one thing you touched on was shelf-life

682
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,950
you said six months like that was a long

683
00:27:03,309 --> 00:27:07,359
time what isn't what is a good

684
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:08,559
shelf-life for these products do we need

685
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:11,589
to worry about that when we're buying

686
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,659
them from say a garden center or you

687
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:16,449
don't you know we need to put a shelf

688
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:17,759
life on it you know just because that's

689
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:19,660
what you do

690
00:27:17,759 --> 00:27:21,910
there's some people who think that

691
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:24,100
there's actually a continual breakdown

692
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:26,050
going on in the bottle I'm not sure that

693
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:31,029
that's true as far as the microscopic

694
00:27:26,049 --> 00:27:35,559
you know solids that make it through the

695
00:27:31,029 --> 00:27:37,420
200 mesh screen but I would be I would

696
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:39,639
feel perfectly comfortable if I found

697
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,529
you know out of my barn an old bottle

698
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:45,070
from eight years ago when I started

699
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:47,079
working for DRAM using it all right

700
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:49,299
the way that I say I'd like I've said it

701
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:51,220
a couple times already is treat it like

702
00:27:49,299 --> 00:27:53,609
you would a jar of pickles that you made

703
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:56,170
a jar of vinegar pickles that you made

704
00:27:53,609 --> 00:28:00,879
that you found in your pantry and I just

705
00:27:56,170 --> 00:28:03,400
just ate some spicy pickled asparagus

706
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,060
from 2015 yesterday and it tasted just

707
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,769
fine

708
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:08,349
you know what I'm saying so so if it's

709
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:10,539
pH stabilized nothing should be

710
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:12,009
happening in there and so that is an

711
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:13,740
advantage of the hydrolysis versus some

712
00:28:12,009 --> 00:28:15,879
of the other you know like biological

713
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:18,670
amendments you'd be buying in the

714
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,220
organic world yeah I've got I got a 50

715
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:23,620
grand 50 gallon drum right now at my

716
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:26,730
farm that we found who knows how old it

717
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:28,599
is it could be two to five years now I

718
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:29,920
don't know quite what I'm gonna do with

719
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:31,599
yet but they didn't have a really bad

720
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:33,840
odor so I was just gonna use my nose

721
00:28:31,599 --> 00:28:37,480
sort of as a guide there and hopefully

722
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:38,889
still use it on my on my plants so the

723
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:41,890
one thing that wouldn't be uncommon

724
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:43,840
there that is is for you to look down

725
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,210
into that drum and see some white mold

726
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:48,759
on the top and when that's been tested

727
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,220
it's a simple bread mold I mean you know

728
00:28:48,759 --> 00:28:50,839
if you

729
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,009
want to be really careful you would

730
00:28:50,839 --> 00:28:53,599
actually get it tested but a lot of

731
00:28:52,009 --> 00:28:56,480
times what that would be is a very

732
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:59,209
simple safe bread mold and so you just

733
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,079
need to filter that out but I would feel

734
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:04,909
I would feel okay using that personally

735
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:07,009
yeah and I don't worry too much about

736
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:09,320
these sorts of things when I'm applying

737
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:11,089
them to ornamentals or to soil directly

738
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,529
because I think the nature kind of

739
00:29:11,089 --> 00:29:14,569
handles a lot of that now spraying it

740
00:29:12,529 --> 00:29:16,279
directly onto my finished vegetables or

741
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:19,399
my crops is probably something I

742
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:20,869
wouldn't recommend but exactly yep yeah

743
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,980
I think you just have to look at

744
00:29:20,869 --> 00:29:24,709
different materials and treat them

745
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:27,860
differently depending on all these

746
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:31,279
circumstances so we talked a little bit

747
00:29:27,859 --> 00:29:33,168
about how fish hydrolysate is made

748
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,298
versed in the difference between that

749
00:29:33,169 --> 00:29:38,659
and emulsion can you talk a little bit

750
00:29:35,298 --> 00:29:40,339
about the quality and the differences

751
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:42,799
now I'm not trying to throw you under

752
00:29:40,339 --> 00:29:45,558
the bus regarding other companies but

753
00:29:42,798 --> 00:29:47,210
I've heard you know there's a bunch of

754
00:29:45,558 --> 00:29:48,168
companies out there making this you know

755
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:52,370
just to throw some names out there

756
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:54,980
Organic gem Neptune's harvest what's the

757
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:57,079
one close to me Pacific that's gonna

758
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,819
grow is if I grow so there's other

759
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:01,490
companies making fish hydrolysate and

760
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:03,788
some are putting in you know biochar

761
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:06,288
you're putting in kelp

762
00:30:03,788 --> 00:30:08,599
I've heard of some putting in crustacean

763
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:10,730
meal can you just talk a little bit

764
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:13,009
about the are there differences I guess

765
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:15,019
across these different companies besides

766
00:30:13,009 --> 00:30:17,808
like maybe the species of the fish is

767
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:19,519
that all the exact same process yeah

768
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:22,279
you're I mean obviously that's a tough

769
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,658
spot for me because up because what I

770
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,819
can really speak about is our process

771
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:31,039
you know and what we're doing that I've

772
00:30:25,819 --> 00:30:32,899
kind of went in-depth on so yes there's

773
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:36,429
a difference between ocean oceans are

774
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:39,830
there a difference is ocean fish versus

775
00:30:36,429 --> 00:30:40,788
our fish from the Great Lakes but just

776
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:42,349
because the place is on the coast

777
00:30:40,788 --> 00:30:45,679
doesn't necessarily mean that it's all

778
00:30:42,349 --> 00:30:47,058
ocean ocean fish I don't know that

779
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,429
that's a conclusion you want to draw in

780
00:30:47,058 --> 00:30:51,918
this case I think that pretty much is

781
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:53,240
the case that the the the ones that the

782
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,890
the companies you mentioned on the coast

783
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,829
are using ocean fish are you going to

784
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:59,929
see higher sodium levels in fish drawn

785
00:30:57,829 --> 00:31:02,480
from saltwater versus freshwater or do

786
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:05,630
they wash them so family is that not

787
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:07,009
and in the flesh I believe though I

788
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:09,200
don't know that it's going to be harmed

789
00:31:07,009 --> 00:31:11,419
you know the levels that you're using

790
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,390
fish unless you're you know we do have

791
00:31:11,419 --> 00:31:16,370
some growers who really dive in and use

792
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:18,559
you know over a hundred gallons per acre

793
00:31:16,369 --> 00:31:20,239
you know hop growers really like our

794
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:23,509
fertilizer a lot and some of them will

795
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:25,009
used extremely high volumes of it to the

796
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:26,569
point where if we add higher sodium

797
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:29,269
levels and ours that would be

798
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:30,889
detrimental or if you're in the you know

799
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:33,589
in eastern Washington you know near

800
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:34,790
where we live on the other side of the

801
00:31:33,589 --> 00:31:37,730
mountains where there's just not enough

802
00:31:34,789 --> 00:31:40,129
rainfall to wash out that sodium and you

803
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,410
were using extremely high levels but I I

804
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:45,049
don't have a recent comparison of our

805
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:47,058
lake fish versus ocean fish of whether

806
00:31:45,048 --> 00:31:49,789
it's really a big difference in sodium

807
00:31:47,058 --> 00:31:51,410
levels as far as process I can't speak

808
00:31:49,789 --> 00:31:53,269
to that as much I mean you can always

809
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:59,290
look at the NPK and get an idea from

810
00:31:53,269 --> 00:32:01,819
that so when I said the the lower

811
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:03,109
phosphorous levels the it's possible

812
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:05,269
that the bone is being pulled out

813
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:08,599
earlier and this in sold as a separate

814
00:32:05,269 --> 00:32:10,970
product I would ask if you think calcium

815
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:12,619
is important like I do in you know most

816
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:14,900
crops or all crops

817
00:32:12,619 --> 00:32:16,759
she's like apple growers and Eastern

818
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,169
Washington trying to prevent bitter pit

819
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:20,089
I say hey if you're buying somebody

820
00:32:18,169 --> 00:32:22,040
else's fish just ask them you know for a

821
00:32:20,089 --> 00:32:24,470
lab analysis showing what their calcium

822
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:27,289
is that's something we're proud of in

823
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:29,419
ours see I'm trying to think of Bo and

824
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:32,480
then yeah you hit on it a little bit we

825
00:32:29,419 --> 00:32:36,679
do several different blends with ours

826
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,690
and so we have a fish a fishing kelp we

827
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:42,048
have a fish helped fall Vick and humic

828
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:44,298
acid product and then we also will

829
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:48,079
dissolve sodium nitrate or Chilean

830
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:49,129
nitrate into some of our blends to get

831
00:32:48,079 --> 00:32:52,819
out four percent or five percent

832
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:56,059
nitrogen product that has a quick

833
00:32:52,819 --> 00:33:01,189
release organic nitrogen source along

834
00:32:56,058 --> 00:33:03,168
with that slow release sorry we have the

835
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,660
the quick release nitrate nitrogen

836
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:08,540
source in the Chilean nitrate that's

837
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:10,909
still certified organic and then that

838
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:13,460
slower release nitrogen from the the

839
00:33:10,909 --> 00:33:15,620
other 2% of the nitrogen and so I really

840
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,400
like that combination especially you

841
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,319
know like a

842
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,660
said I was just out fertilizing

843
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:23,149
vegetables here in the Skagit Valley

844
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:24,560
where the soil takes forever to warm up

845
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,390
you know I'm three feet above sea level

846
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,220
and so getting that little bit of

847
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,960
nitrate into those plants as they're

848
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:33,110
they're popping up here and in the

849
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:34,880
spring is really important but those are

850
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:38,449
things you know as far as different

851
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:41,390
blends that the companies make would be

852
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:43,730
a difference you know at the beginning

853
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:45,980
is if you're asking making sure you're

854
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:48,559
getting any hydrolysis if if one of your

855
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:51,259
goals is to really amp up your your

856
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:53,000
biology in your organic system you're

857
00:33:51,259 --> 00:33:54,559
you're already you know starting out

858
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,569
really well you know they're they're

859
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,549
just a you really should be thinking of

860
00:33:56,569 --> 00:34:00,649
emulsions and hydrolysis is two very

861
00:33:58,549 --> 00:34:03,740
different things not as all being fish

862
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:07,640
fertilizer okay so start with the idea

863
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:11,179
that hydrolysates are gonna be superior

864
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:12,740
in a lot of ways to emulsions but one of

865
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:13,940
the things I like you said is there's

866
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:15,619
different ones that are put people are

867
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,389
putting in different different

868
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,039
ingredients and I think it's important

869
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:21,408
that people look further into that so

870
00:34:19,039 --> 00:34:23,599
like and again this is not a comment on

871
00:34:21,409 --> 00:34:25,398
any particular product in general or

872
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:27,440
company but I've seen some they're

873
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:30,049
adding biochar which on the surface

874
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,700
sounds great now we don't know the

875
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:33,380
quality of the biochar and we don't know

876
00:34:31,699 --> 00:34:35,029
the concentration of biochar so that's

877
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:37,369
the sort of stuff that as a grower I

878
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,019
would want to look further into and I

879
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,789
don't actually know the answer to these

880
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:42,380
questions in those particular products

881
00:34:40,789 --> 00:34:45,168
but that's what I would want to know

882
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:47,000
before I started really getting heavy

883
00:34:45,168 --> 00:34:48,648
into applying them and same with you

884
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,148
know even the kelp or the crustacean to

885
00:34:48,648 --> 00:34:51,289
find out sort of what levels are going

886
00:34:50,148 --> 00:34:53,210
to be in there because I know getting

887
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:54,860
something on a label versus putting

888
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,389
enough in to actually make a noticeable

889
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,700
change in your crop it can be very

890
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:04,369
different based on the bureaucracy

891
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:05,659
around the fertilizer industry so and

892
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:07,369
the other thing I want to touch on too

893
00:35:05,659 --> 00:35:10,460
is you mentioned that your products it's

894
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:12,380
a lot longer than maybe traditionally

895
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,720
done by some of these other hydrolysate

896
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:16,280
companies that's another thing I would

897
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:20,359
look into when I'm trying to determine

898
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:22,280
quality of a product so just just some

899
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:25,070
things some pointers for listeners to

900
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,950
maybe think about as they consider using

901
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:30,440
fish products in their garden and

902
00:35:27,949 --> 00:35:32,509
one of the things I wanted to touch on

903
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,760
that I know is a little tricky for you

904
00:35:32,510 --> 00:35:37,880
too is just the idea that when you look

905
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:39,980
at a bottled nutrient an organic bottled

906
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,660
nutrient product whether it's a bottle

907
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,280
of nutrient line from pretty much any

908
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:47,599
company out there in the cannabis

909
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:50,180
industry if they list fish on the on the

910
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,690
label as I understand it's most likely

911
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:55,909
fish hydrolysate is that correct yeah

912
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:58,970
really tough for me to answer you know I

913
00:35:55,909 --> 00:36:00,980
mean I know that we do work with some of

914
00:35:58,969 --> 00:36:05,359
those companies sending ingredients over

915
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:06,679
right but very difficult for me to

916
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,750
answer whether some of them are using

917
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:10,730
emulsion and what you know the labeling

918
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,630
laws are so tricky and as I'm sure you

919
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:15,920
know is like each state has different

920
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:18,170
regulations to the point where it's not

921
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:20,750
even legally possible to have the same

922
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,300
fertilizer label you have an Oregon of

923
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:25,519
the label you have in California where

924
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:29,000
the requirements are are at odds with

925
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:31,550
each other and so as far as what you're

926
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:34,489
required to list on there and I think

927
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:37,730
some of those cases so I'm very lucky in

928
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:40,849
that I am not the person I drafted has

929
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:43,880
to deal with all that we thank our

930
00:36:40,849 --> 00:36:46,639
friend Tim Daly for being the one who

931
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,140
has to jump through those hoops but if

932
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:50,750
you're using you know as you're alluding

933
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:52,250
to if they're adding a such a small

934
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:54,219
amount of some of this stuff where

935
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:56,989
they're just trying to put it on you can

936
00:36:54,219 --> 00:36:59,539
actually omit some of that from the

937
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:01,969
label is my understanding in some state

938
00:36:59,539 --> 00:37:03,619
so I you know the best thing to do is to

939
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,909
ask and in that case it's a little bit

940
00:37:03,619 --> 00:37:07,039
harder to ask and that's what I was

941
00:37:04,909 --> 00:37:10,639
gonna you know say about comparing the

942
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:12,469
fish fertilizers a lot of times or

943
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,150
usually in our case it's sold through

944
00:37:12,469 --> 00:37:16,069
distribution so that's a little bit

945
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:17,660
trickier but a lot of times our

946
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:19,910
distributors will send customers

947
00:37:17,659 --> 00:37:21,379
straight to us and I'm totally fine I'm

948
00:37:19,909 --> 00:37:23,980
happy with that you know I mean I'm

949
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:26,510
proud of the way we make our fertilizer

950
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:30,289
but that would be my advice for your

951
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:35,690
listeners is ask you know if you're

952
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:36,980
buying from a certain label and they're

953
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:40,829
obviously not a fish fertilizer

954
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:42,840
producers end of an email and say hey

955
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:44,069
whose fish fertilizer are you using you

956
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,809
know they might got they probably won't

957
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:48,330
give you the answer to that but is it

958
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:49,590
hydrolysis it or isn't an emulsion yeah

959
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:52,860
at the very least they can tell you that

960
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:54,000
and the labeling laws are a mess I gotta

961
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,849
tell you I've been working on our

962
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,130
California label now for a year and a

963
00:37:56,849 --> 00:38:01,230
half it sucks it's just it's been

964
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:03,630
terrible like you're in Washington I can

965
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,820
call us kiss organics but in California

966
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:07,800
I can't unless all of our products are

967
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:11,010
certified to produce an organic or an

968
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,970
agriculture by them which I totally get

969
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:14,070
because it can be misleading to

970
00:38:11,969 --> 00:38:16,199
consumers but they're just very they're

971
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:17,910
very strict in terms of what they allow

972
00:38:16,199 --> 00:38:20,719
and don't allow and they don't accept

973
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:23,029
Omri they don't accept double USDA and

974
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,649
it's it's been really eye-opening like

975
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:29,910
for example with your product being a

976
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:33,599
two 50.2 in Washington Oregon you could

977
00:38:29,909 --> 00:38:35,670
actually have five percent nitrogen or

978
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,929
ten percent phosphorus in theory on the

979
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:41,280
label on your on your tests but you

980
00:38:39,929 --> 00:38:44,699
don't have to declare that on your

981
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,530
actual label so if you were great you

982
00:38:44,699 --> 00:38:48,210
know and that gets in you and I could go

983
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:50,220
on for a while and I don't know yeah I

984
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,840
don't want to hear it but it's crazy

985
00:38:50,219 --> 00:38:54,029
that you know because there's laws in

986
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:56,250
some places about phosphorus fertilizers

987
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:58,440
because of runoff and that it's my

988
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,829
understanding that you can put down a

989
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,170
zero for phosphorous even though you

990
00:39:01,829 --> 00:39:05,489
have five percent phosphorous in it to

991
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,690
get around those to get around the

992
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,909
labeling laws that are supposed to

993
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:10,289
supposed to prevent people from dumping

994
00:39:08,909 --> 00:39:13,649
too much on their lawns and having it go

995
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:17,610
into their the the lake next door so

996
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:17,960
yeah some of it's crazy we fight through

997
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,519
it

998
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:23,130
yeah yeah that's it probably is a whole

999
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:25,289
nother podcast so I just I just want to

1000
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:28,079
encourage people to really look into the

1001
00:39:25,289 --> 00:39:29,519
sourcing and and use that as a guide for

1002
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,440
determining quality when they're

1003
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:33,389
evaluating different products in general

1004
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,889
not just not just fish products but

1005
00:39:33,389 --> 00:39:40,679
let's get back into some of the aspects

1006
00:39:37,889 --> 00:39:43,049
of applying these products so this is a

1007
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:44,730
liquid it's a concentrate you're gonna

1008
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,440
be mixing it with water can you talk a

1009
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:48,710
little bit about application rates and

1010
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:53,250
methods for applying fish hydrolysate

1011
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:54,778
yes and so one of the big advantages for

1012
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:58,818
me is that fish fertilizer

1013
00:39:54,778 --> 00:40:02,668
in so many different ways and so it

1014
00:39:58,818 --> 00:40:04,259
there is no one-size-fits-all or this is

1015
00:40:02,668 --> 00:40:07,498
how much to use and this is the way to

1016
00:40:04,259 --> 00:40:10,708
put it on so that's the strength of our

1017
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:12,958
fertilizer and most liquid organic

1018
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:14,848
fertilizers is there's a lot of ways to

1019
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:19,288
put them on that said I will get into

1020
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:20,579
some of the obstacles so you can apply

1021
00:40:19,289 --> 00:40:23,400
it straight on the plant you can apply

1022
00:40:20,579 --> 00:40:25,019
it on the soil one way I really like for

1023
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:28,668
especially for larger growers is

1024
00:40:25,018 --> 00:40:30,568
dripping it on on the seed at planting

1025
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:32,608
getting back to what we talked about

1026
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:35,159
about its ability to grow beneficial

1027
00:40:32,608 --> 00:40:37,528
fungus you know if you can put your your

1028
00:40:35,159 --> 00:40:40,380
mind there on that seed popping up and

1029
00:40:37,528 --> 00:40:42,179
having that what I call the fungal force

1030
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:45,179
field you know that does beautiful

1031
00:40:42,179 --> 00:40:49,259
bright white mycelium helping protect

1032
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:52,289
that plant from some pathogens I love

1033
00:40:49,259 --> 00:40:54,168
that idea so we but we do have a lot of

1034
00:40:52,289 --> 00:40:57,409
growers who use it as a foliar

1035
00:40:54,168 --> 00:40:59,908
application we get anecdotal reports of

1036
00:40:57,409 --> 00:41:03,269
fungicidal effects and there are some

1037
00:40:59,909 --> 00:41:05,519
studies of fish products going back on

1038
00:41:03,268 --> 00:41:08,968
like blueberries showing some you know

1039
00:41:05,518 --> 00:41:11,818
fungicidal properties and I don't know

1040
00:41:08,969 --> 00:41:14,309
whether it's oils preventing those kind

1041
00:41:11,818 --> 00:41:16,708
of things or whether it's more just

1042
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:18,719
promoting biodiversity and creating an

1043
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:22,438
environment in which pathogen aren't

1044
00:41:18,719 --> 00:41:27,479
interested in in thriving sorry getting

1045
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:29,308
off topic as far as application rates in

1046
00:41:27,478 --> 00:41:32,489
general a lot of folks will use it not

1047
00:41:29,309 --> 00:41:34,229
as their primary source of nutrients and

1048
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:38,309
so they'll be using some sort of dry

1049
00:41:34,228 --> 00:41:41,548
fertilizer or cover crop in that

1050
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:43,769
situation 2 to 5 gallons per acre per

1051
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:45,778
application is common so the five

1052
00:41:43,768 --> 00:41:48,718
gallons more for for like orchards and

1053
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:51,838
so on I'd say the most common rates

1054
00:41:48,719 --> 00:41:53,849
would be a two gallons per acre per

1055
00:41:51,838 --> 00:41:55,650
application three times during the

1056
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:58,349
growing season that's a really common

1057
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,548
one and so when you get into cost on

1058
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,769
that say say you're buying the

1059
00:41:59,548 --> 00:42:04,048
fertilizer for four five or six bucks a

1060
00:42:01,768 --> 00:42:04,909
gallon you're not talking about a big

1061
00:42:04,048 --> 00:42:07,849
investment

1062
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:10,369
to add into your program so when you're

1063
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:12,199
talking about acreage right now a lot of

1064
00:42:10,369 --> 00:42:14,719
our guys maybe let's say they had a

1065
00:42:12,199 --> 00:42:18,679
small small garden so there may be

1066
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:20,059
applying it by the gallon of water are

1067
00:42:18,679 --> 00:42:23,359
you're adding like what like maybe an

1068
00:42:20,059 --> 00:42:26,000
ounce or so per gallon right yeah so

1069
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,490
we've ended dilution rates the two most

1070
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:31,369
common dilution rates would be 20 parts

1071
00:42:28,489 --> 00:42:33,079
water to one part fertilizer okay that

1072
00:42:31,369 --> 00:42:35,900
probably that's the most common some

1073
00:42:33,079 --> 00:42:38,329
folks prefer a 50 to one in a lot of

1074
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,740
cases though it comes down to you know

1075
00:42:38,329 --> 00:42:42,710
I've had it here where I'm traveling a

1076
00:42:39,739 --> 00:42:45,019
lot for work and I miss I'm only able to

1077
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:47,119
get my one application in so I'll go for

1078
00:42:45,019 --> 00:42:49,280
a stronger fertilizer so I'll be using a

1079
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:51,769
stronger amount and a stronger dilution

1080
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,340
ratio and I'm not at all scared to get

1081
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:57,320
down to ten to one with our fertilizer

1082
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:59,420
and I would even go stronger dilution

1083
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:00,769
rate than that I did some experiments

1084
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:03,409
here trying to you know just using a

1085
00:43:00,769 --> 00:43:05,210
backpack sprayer going with some because

1086
00:43:03,409 --> 00:43:07,339
the concern the next question would

1087
00:43:05,210 --> 00:43:11,000
usually be how low can I go or how

1088
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:13,100
strong of a of a dilution ratio can I go

1089
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,469
before I start burning stuff and I went

1090
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:17,719
to like 3 to 1 on our product that has

1091
00:43:15,469 --> 00:43:19,250
the sodium nitrate in it and I saw a

1092
00:43:17,719 --> 00:43:21,409
little bit of brown spots on some

1093
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:22,670
broccoli you know but that was where it

1094
00:43:21,409 --> 00:43:25,639
looked like straight fish fertilizer

1095
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:30,110
coming out of the end of the end of the

1096
00:43:25,639 --> 00:43:33,799
sprayer so the versatility so it so in

1097
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:34,940
but in some cases folks will do 5 7

1098
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,710
applications you know if you're already

1099
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:39,380
going out with your tractor the fish is

1100
00:43:36,710 --> 00:43:42,260
really compatible and in fact can work

1101
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,880
as a spreader sticker for other products

1102
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,650
and so some people just like to mix a

1103
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:48,680
little bit of fish in their tank with

1104
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:50,780
just about everything now because of the

1105
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:53,899
phosphoric acid you want to avoid using

1106
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:55,280
it with calcium products I'm sure you

1107
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,380
sure you've heard that you know those

1108
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,560
two two guys don't get along you'll have

1109
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:04,280
a precipitate all out now are you pa

1110
00:44:00,559 --> 00:44:07,909
Qing the solution at all prior to

1111
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:10,010
application I'm not I I don't know so so

1112
00:44:07,909 --> 00:44:13,489
we're it's gonna come out of our bottle

1113
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:15,490
at a 3.5 before and then by the time you

1114
00:44:13,489 --> 00:44:18,219
dilute that it pops up quite a bit

1115
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:20,679
that's not an area I mean

1116
00:44:18,219 --> 00:44:22,569
time's a lot of your listeners have have

1117
00:44:20,679 --> 00:44:24,489
programs and ways to test that stuff and

1118
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:28,059
I just don't even get into it and again

1119
00:44:24,489 --> 00:44:30,729
I sell you know I sell a lot through

1120
00:44:28,059 --> 00:44:32,949
distribution and so I don't end up

1121
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,139
working directly with with those growers

1122
00:44:32,949 --> 00:44:36,639
and what about growers in eastern

1123
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:39,400
Washington hacked a lot of calcium in

1124
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:40,989
their water already do they need to

1125
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,289
treat that prior to using that water

1126
00:44:40,989 --> 00:44:46,449
with application you know that's a good

1127
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:47,800
question I don't know that okay well

1128
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:49,239
hopefully the people that have high

1129
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,440
calcium waters already know how to deal

1130
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:54,489
with that kiss we're really fortunate

1131
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:56,590
here in the in the Western Washington to

1132
00:44:54,489 --> 00:44:57,909
not have we have wonderful water that's

1133
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:00,760
that's one of the best things about

1134
00:44:57,909 --> 00:45:02,199
living here yeah so you mentioned a

1135
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,880
little bit about affordability

1136
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,799
you know you threw out some numbers like

1137
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:08,858
I think you said seven to eight dollars

1138
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:10,180
a gallon that sounds low to me but so

1139
00:45:08,858 --> 00:45:12,969
you must be talking about buying on

1140
00:45:10,179 --> 00:45:14,500
scale is that correct yeah that's where

1141
00:45:12,969 --> 00:45:16,659
you get into the single digits when

1142
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:19,570
you're when you go in 55-gallon drums

1143
00:45:16,659 --> 00:45:21,489
are larger and so that's a big quite you

1144
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:23,019
know a lot of the listeners for your

1145
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:27,009
podcast are going to be that's a

1146
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:29,440
decision that they would make of the two

1147
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:32,410
points so our next size lower than a

1148
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,329
55-gallon drum is a five gallon size and

1149
00:45:32,409 --> 00:45:36,159
so that's two two and a half gallon jugs

1150
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:38,130
and that's what we decided to go with

1151
00:45:36,159 --> 00:45:40,358
rather than the five gallon bucket

1152
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,530
people really like the convenience of

1153
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:44,170
those the fact that you can just pick up

1154
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:49,000
a 2.5 gallon jug and shake it you know

1155
00:45:44,170 --> 00:45:50,680
and get it nice and agitated so I think

1156
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:54,219
where you're going with the question and

1157
00:45:50,679 --> 00:45:56,019
we're where the big question is is it

1158
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:57,789
worth it to scale up to a 55-gallon drum

1159
00:45:56,019 --> 00:46:00,070
that you have to get shipped on a on a

1160
00:45:57,789 --> 00:46:02,949
on a semi that's going to weigh 600

1161
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:04,240
pounds so you have to deal with it but

1162
00:46:02,949 --> 00:46:08,019
you're gonna pay about a third of the

1163
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:09,219
price per gallon and so if you're going

1164
00:46:08,019 --> 00:46:11,170
to go through that much and then another

1165
00:46:09,219 --> 00:46:13,118
big advantage of fish hydrolysis is that

1166
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:15,130
you could use half that drum in one

1167
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:18,039
season and then use the rest the next

1168
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:20,200
season and again you know watch for you

1169
00:46:18,039 --> 00:46:21,759
know whether bread mold will grow on it

1170
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:24,219
in between you know if you're not using

1171
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,740
it for four seven months you just check

1172
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:28,750
on those things but that's what you'd be

1173
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:31,929
looking at is saving that kind of thing

1174
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,409
so say five dollars five to six dollars

1175
00:46:31,929 --> 00:46:34,239
per

1176
00:46:32,409 --> 00:46:36,730
gallon in the 55-gallon drum and I'm

1177
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,279
using bag numbers for a couple reasons

1178
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:40,329
as it depends you know how close it is

1179
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,060
to you with the shipping and everything

1180
00:46:40,329 --> 00:46:44,139
then also we sell several different

1181
00:46:43,059 --> 00:46:45,969
blends that are all different price

1182
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:47,289
points you know the more more extra

1183
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,269
amendments we put in the higher the

1184
00:46:47,289 --> 00:46:50,980
price gets but then you'd be getting up

1185
00:46:49,269 --> 00:46:54,250
to say fifteen sixteen seventeen dollars

1186
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:55,420
a gallon in in the 2.5 gallon jugs if

1187
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:57,489
that gives you a good idea the

1188
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:59,559
difference yeah a range and then of

1189
00:46:57,489 --> 00:47:01,959
course we saw we sell gallons and quarts

1190
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:03,670
and in all of that - for even smaller

1191
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,400
amounts but a lot of times that's the

1192
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:07,389
big decision to grow our estimators

1193
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:09,340
should I save the extra money on the

1194
00:47:07,389 --> 00:47:11,109
55-gallon drum but then I got a you know

1195
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,820
use a paint mixer on the end of a power

1196
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:15,190
drill it's really not that bad and you

1197
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:18,030
have to have a 65 gallon drum pump but

1198
00:47:15,190 --> 00:47:21,070
those are all the considerations to make

1199
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,390
you know and the more frugal growers you

1200
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:24,220
know we'll we'll go ahead and do the

1201
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:25,839
55-gallon drum and sometimes growers

1202
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:26,759
will just say I I don't want to deal

1203
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:29,829
with that

1204
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:32,920
yeah I'm looking forward to talking to

1205
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:35,079
Kurt Becker about applications and

1206
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,750
spraying and he's a genius and that I

1207
00:47:35,079 --> 00:47:39,610
know he works for DRAM as well I get the

1208
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:41,949
opportunity to meet him last year but

1209
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:45,340
he's the man yeah he's out he really a

1210
00:47:41,949 --> 00:47:47,199
note that stuff inside and out of of

1211
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,019
what you what the best solution is for

1212
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,659
your problem in your greenhouse so we'll

1213
00:47:50,019 --> 00:47:54,849
dive into spraying and and all of that a

1214
00:47:52,659 --> 00:47:56,829
little more with him you did mention

1215
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:58,690
drip systems as being a little bit

1216
00:47:56,829 --> 00:48:02,639
problematic I can't remember if you had

1217
00:47:58,690 --> 00:48:04,869
talked about them yet on this podcast

1218
00:48:02,639 --> 00:48:05,980
say it again you'd mentioned drip

1219
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:07,839
systems as being a little bit

1220
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:09,070
problematic for yeah that's where I was

1221
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:10,539
gonna go with that thing thank you for

1222
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:12,039
reminding me is that that's the big

1223
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:13,480
question we get is can I put your stuff

1224
00:48:12,039 --> 00:48:15,849
through our drip system you know and

1225
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:17,679
it's gonna the answer to that is gonna

1226
00:48:15,849 --> 00:48:19,509
depend a little bit on what type of drip

1227
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:20,949
system you have how long you want it you

1228
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:23,820
know some people will bury their lines

1229
00:48:20,949 --> 00:48:27,009
and want to keep them for several years

1230
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:29,080
my answer my first answer is I don't put

1231
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:31,600
it through drip at my place and I

1232
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:33,699
recommend if you can put it on any other

1233
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,750
way then putting it through a drip

1234
00:48:33,699 --> 00:48:39,909
system do that now you still get people

1235
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:41,380
growers where their system is just not

1236
00:48:39,909 --> 00:48:44,289
going to have another way to get it on

1237
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,880
and so if you're going to use it to drip

1238
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:47,230
and lots of people do

1239
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,360
and this would be for our fish

1240
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:52,030
hydrolysis or for any liquid organic

1241
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:53,980
fertilizer is you just have to be

1242
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,860
vigilant about flushing with water and

1243
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:59,199
then I recommend you occasionally using

1244
00:48:56,860 --> 00:49:01,960
some sort of organic you know bio side

1245
00:48:59,199 --> 00:49:05,469
so you got to make sure you're sticking

1246
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:07,900
on label you know with things like wood

1247
00:49:05,469 --> 00:49:09,189
oxidate or sand a date or the I'm

1248
00:49:07,900 --> 00:49:11,170
hesitant to even say it on a podcast

1249
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,880
because I don't know what you know

1250
00:49:11,170 --> 00:49:16,780
things would be allowed for it there's

1251
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,769
also some enzyme products and I don't

1252
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,870
know how are you familiar with there's

1253
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:21,610
something EF 300 a guy in California

1254
00:49:19,869 --> 00:49:23,139
makes that I've heard great things about

1255
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:25,120
I might have the name of that product

1256
00:49:23,139 --> 00:49:27,639
wrong I know you had Chris Jagger on the

1257
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:29,920
podcast and I think Chris would be to go

1258
00:49:27,639 --> 00:49:33,129
to for that he's got an enzyme product

1259
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:35,769
and he really likes for eating up living

1260
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,320
stuff in the lines so that's your

1261
00:49:35,769 --> 00:49:40,690
concern is I'll say it again nothing see

1262
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:43,150
it's beneficial fungus and bacteria like

1263
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:45,190
fish hydrolysis but sometimes it feeds

1264
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:46,360
those in places you don't want it and

1265
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,030
that would be the inside of your drip

1266
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:51,280
line right so algae growth and so on

1267
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:53,890
yeah we're trying to avoid that biofilm

1268
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,210
so if you actually let's say you're

1269
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:57,190
putting it through piping that you can

1270
00:49:55,210 --> 00:49:58,210
reach your finger into if you'll slimy

1271
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:01,990
or anything like that that's that

1272
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:04,840
biofilm created by the biology that's

1273
00:50:01,989 --> 00:50:06,849
eating as a food source and that's what

1274
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,079
that one dad is a really good place to

1275
00:50:06,849 --> 00:50:09,400
go with script Becker's he knows a lot

1276
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,150
you know that's that's where our ozone

1277
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,470
systems are big on um you know it's a

1278
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:17,440
common problem how do we get rid of that

1279
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:20,079
biofilm in our irrigation system and

1280
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,880
that's something he's really dove into

1281
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:24,279
coming up with solutions for growers on

1282
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,750
yeah I'm looking forward to talking to

1283
00:50:24,280 --> 00:50:28,260
him there's so much I didn't even think

1284
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:30,340
about when they came to spraying that

1285
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:32,650
yeah I'm excited for that you know

1286
00:50:30,340 --> 00:50:36,250
Suzanne's always saying stop using paint

1287
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:37,960
sprayers and he really explains what the

1288
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:40,179
difference is in terms of the actual

1289
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:42,309
size of the molecule or drip that you're

1290
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:44,169
applying and it it was fascinating I

1291
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:47,369
really enjoyed his presentation so I'm

1292
00:50:44,170 --> 00:50:49,599
looking forward to that for sure now

1293
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:53,230
let's see for you the other the other

1294
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:55,539
question I had then was can you use like

1295
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:58,500
a so for example at my house here I just

1296
00:50:55,539 --> 00:51:00,449
put in a new lawn of sod and I was going

1297
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:02,489
take the sample you gave me and put it

1298
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:05,879
through a hose end sprayer as a way to

1299
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:07,669
get it out onto the pond of the lawn

1300
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,470
what do you think of something like that

1301
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,690
that works great so we even sell you

1302
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:13,949
know like the small retail bottles with

1303
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:17,820
that hose end sprayer it's being

1304
00:51:13,949 --> 00:51:20,460
attached to them um you know that works

1305
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:22,740
great another one that I've done here is

1306
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:23,490
our you familiar DRAM actually sells the

1307
00:51:22,739 --> 00:51:26,399
siphon jekt

1308
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:27,809
be familiar with that product no no so

1309
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:31,079
it's it's kind of the next step down

1310
00:51:27,809 --> 00:51:33,599
from like the smallest dosatron and it's

1311
00:51:31,079 --> 00:51:36,989
just this incredibly simple technology a

1312
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:38,730
little venturi injector and you take

1313
00:51:36,989 --> 00:51:41,639
that little you can look on the internet

1314
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:44,550
for a dram size inject I think they're

1315
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:46,799
less than $20 and it's got a little hose

1316
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:48,660
line so you can do it a couple different

1317
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:51,480
ways the one thing you need to make sure

1318
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:53,609
is that you're following all the rules

1319
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,210
on how to use it if you want to make

1320
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:58,860
absolute certain that you're pulling the

1321
00:51:57,210 --> 00:52:01,199
product the fertilizer out of the bottle

1322
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,849
at the right dilution rate and now for

1323
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:04,439
our product it doesn't really matter

1324
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:05,489
that much if you're doing you know

1325
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:07,380
you're not gonna specially for how

1326
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:10,289
you're talking about using it if you're

1327
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:11,640
pulling it out at twice the dilution

1328
00:52:10,289 --> 00:52:13,980
ratio it doesn't really matter that much

1329
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:16,829
so what I'm getting at is you you would

1330
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:18,240
um you could either put it on the front

1331
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:20,400
of the hose or the back of the hose so

1332
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:23,159
back up the spigot and then you put the

1333
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,099
little hose thing down into your

1334
00:52:23,159 --> 00:52:27,359
fertilizer bottle you screw that onto

1335
00:52:26,099 --> 00:52:28,949
the spigot and then you screw the hose

1336
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,390
on to that part and so it's a little bit

1337
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:33,750
difficult to describe over the phone

1338
00:52:30,389 --> 00:52:35,789
near but um then if you start spraying

1339
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:39,960
with your with your hose and go through

1340
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:42,329
a normal water wand and you are pulling

1341
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,929
an exact dilution ratio pretty sure it's

1342
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:47,549
fifty to one I should know that you get

1343
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:50,519
what I'm saying so totally simple

1344
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:51,780
technology of a injector that you know

1345
00:52:50,519 --> 00:52:53,099
you're not plugging it into an outlet

1346
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:55,320
you're not doing anything like that it's

1347
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:57,869
just really simple yeah so in my house

1348
00:52:55,320 --> 00:53:00,059
we have I'm on city water so there's

1349
00:52:57,869 --> 00:53:02,460
chlorine in the water so I'm going to

1350
00:53:00,059 --> 00:53:04,230
apply things like this fish hydrolysate

1351
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:05,970
the dramatic kay here that you gave me

1352
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:08,760
and things like seaweed extract powder

1353
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:10,469
through my hose end sprayer because I'm

1354
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,620
not applying anything that really has a

1355
00:53:10,469 --> 00:53:14,199
lot of

1356
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:15,549
official microorganisms in it or that's

1357
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:17,799
not the point of the application it's a

1358
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:20,260
food source whereas when I go to apply

1359
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:22,150
my compost tea to my garden I'm not

1360
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:24,700
going to use that same sprayer because I

1361
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:26,079
haven't filtered out the chlorine and I

1362
00:53:24,699 --> 00:53:29,230
would want to also determine that that

1363
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:31,119
sprayer doesn't damage the bacteria or

1364
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:33,159
break up the fungal hyphae during the

1365
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:36,069
application but for things that are just

1366
00:53:33,159 --> 00:53:39,609
food sources or nutrients I think it'll

1367
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:41,710
work great yeah I would I would love to

1368
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:43,840
talk to you more often offline about

1369
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:46,059
that because that's I have chlorinated

1370
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,890
water here our farm also which surprises

1371
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:49,509
people but you know like I said birds

1372
00:53:47,889 --> 00:53:51,579
I'm three feet above sea level here and

1373
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:54,490
we just don't have well water where I'm

1374
00:53:51,579 --> 00:53:55,509
at in the Skagit Valley and I always

1375
00:53:54,489 --> 00:53:58,509
wonder about that when I was making

1376
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:00,700
compost teas and so on I'm obviously not

1377
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,050
gonna run when I brew beer here at the

1378
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:03,460
farm I run everything through a Brita

1379
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,960
you know or run everything through a

1380
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:08,519
water filter but I'm obviously not going

1381
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,809
to do that for irrigating crops so I

1382
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:16,059
often wonder about how to handle that

1383
00:54:10,809 --> 00:54:18,460
situation I just put up a photo on our

1384
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:22,269
Instagram also on our Facebook page for

1385
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:26,380
kiss organics of compost tea that had

1386
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:29,320
been made or added to chlorinated water

1387
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:31,450
versus D chlorinated water and you can

1388
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:32,769
see they're in petri dishes and it's a

1389
00:54:31,449 --> 00:54:34,989
dramatic difference I'm gonna be

1390
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:37,329
interviewing a golf course

1391
00:54:34,989 --> 00:54:42,129
superintendent that I met oh boy almost

1392
00:54:37,329 --> 00:54:43,960
a decade ago that has gotten into using

1393
00:54:42,130 --> 00:54:45,789
organics and beneficial biology and he's

1394
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,820
reduced his fertilizer applications on

1395
00:54:45,789 --> 00:54:50,949
his golf course is something like 70%

1396
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:54,690
because golf courses are terrible when

1397
00:54:50,949 --> 00:54:56,710
it comes to the amount of pesticides and

1398
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:58,329
inorganic fertilizers that they have to

1399
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:01,240
use to keep the grass looking the way

1400
00:54:58,329 --> 00:55:02,380
you know golfers want it to look so go

1401
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:04,029
check that out you might find it

1402
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:06,960
interesting and even I can definitely

1403
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:10,600
talk offline about about that for sure

1404
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:12,940
in terms of compost tea but ya know I'll

1405
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:14,529
definitely check that out thanks well I

1406
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:16,990
think we covered all the questions I had

1407
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:20,560
on on fish for the day and hopefully

1408
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:22,629
this will help listeners know a little

1409
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,549
bit more about the differences primarily

1410
00:55:22,630 --> 00:55:25,000
between emulsion and hydrolysate and how

1411
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:29,950
to use

1412
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:31,329
product and all of its benefits and yeah

1413
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:31,989
I think I think we covered a lot here so

1414
00:55:31,329 --> 00:55:35,409
thanks for that

1415
00:55:31,989 --> 00:55:37,000
