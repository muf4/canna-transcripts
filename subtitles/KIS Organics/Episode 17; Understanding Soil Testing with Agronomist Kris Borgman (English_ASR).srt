industry for the show this week's

18
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:48,988
podcast is all about soil testing in

19
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:50,878
this episode we dive into the importance

20
00:00:48,988 --> 00:00:52,500
of soil testing some of the different

21
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:55,439
types of soil tests and how to

22
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:57,808
understand and interpret the results our

23
00:00:55,439 --> 00:00:59,549
guest this week is Chris Boardman Chris

international who were the makers of the

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:18,390
soil savvy test kits the ion exchange

34
00:01:16,519 --> 00:01:20,250
technology in these kits has been

35
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,368
utilized by large agribusiness companies

36
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:25,530
like Wilbur Alice McGregor crop

37
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:28,379

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:30,269
more chris also manages a large family

operation in eastern Washington

41
00:01:32,069 --> 00:01:37,889
welcome to the show Chris yeah thanks

42
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:39,868
Todd I appreciate the opportunity yeah

43
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,509
so today we're talking all about soil

44
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:44,219
testing and I want to start off with a

45
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:46,618
little bit of your background not going

46
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:49,828
too deeply but just a really brief idea

47
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:51,569
of where how you got into this realm and

48
00:01:49,828 --> 00:01:54,599
what your background is was so testing

49
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:58,438
yeah yeah really my background started

50
00:01:54,599 --> 00:02:01,109
out I acquired or earned my Bachelors of

51
00:01:58,438 --> 00:02:04,048
Science degree in crop and soil science

52
00:02:01,109 --> 00:02:07,228
from Washington State University that

53
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:09,750
degree had a turf grass emphasis and so

54
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:14,030
I really focused on turf grass systems

55
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:16,310
from there I graduated and

56
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:19,370
I'm a golf course superintendent and

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,759
worked at a couple golf courses built

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:25,819
two golf courses and grew them in the

59
00:02:22,759 --> 00:02:27,829
last golf course I was at we built and

60
00:02:25,818 --> 00:02:32,958
grew it in and I was there for about

61
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:36,620
three years and in that time I met the

62
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,509
owner of Univest international who has

63
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,980
the soil savvy product that we'll be

64
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:46,159
talking about today he was curious if I

65
00:02:42,979 --> 00:02:48,199
was interested in the technology that he

66
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,900
had and if it was applicable to turf

67
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,789
grass and I was really blown away by

68
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:55,670
this technology that he had and the

69
00:02:52,789 --> 00:02:58,429
accuracy of this technology and soil

70
00:02:55,669 --> 00:03:02,149
sampling he mentioned that he was

71
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:05,349
looking for an agronomist and I actually

72
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:07,819
made a career change to come work for

73
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:10,969
Univest who developed the soil savvy

74
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:13,458
product and I've been here for seven

75
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:14,659
years almost eight years now okay so

76
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,000
let's talk a little bit about why

77
00:03:14,659 --> 00:03:19,459
someone would want to soil test what's

78
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,829
what sort of actionable information does

79
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:24,489
it give you with soil testing yeah so

80
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:28,010
soil testing is really going to give you

81
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:32,150
you know the best opportunity or ability

82
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:35,449
to manage the system that that you're

83
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:38,810
looking to manage this can be you know

84
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:42,679
large-scale agricultural systems or you

85
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,109
know small scale plots size gardens at

86
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,060
home potting plants I mean you name it

87
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:49,850
but really we want a soil test to give

88
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,390
ourselves the the highest probability of

89
00:03:49,849 --> 00:03:55,039
achieving high-quality or yield and so

90
00:03:53,389 --> 00:04:00,199
soil testing is a very critical

91
00:03:55,039 --> 00:04:02,780
component of achieving both quality and

92
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:05,209
yield and these systems that that were

93
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,640
managing you know I like to look at as a

94
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:10,209
way of helping avoid making mistakes so

95
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:12,469
the soil testing will tell us

96
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:14,090
essentially what sort of excesses and

97
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:15,620
deficiencies we have or things that

98
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,699
might be building up over time if we're

99
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,030
reusing the soil

100
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:22,819
I think it's personally I think soil

101
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:24,079
testing is really important so if we

102
00:04:22,819 --> 00:04:26,779
could talk a little bit more about the

103
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:27,889
different types of soil tests can you

104
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:29,448
talk a little bit about you know

105
00:04:27,889 --> 00:04:31,939
I know there's a bunch out there can you

106
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,860
just touch briefly on the major ones

107
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:36,919
that people may be familiar with yeah

108
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:39,680
sure so the major soil tests that are

109
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:42,498
that are currently offered to to most of

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,288
us are often through extension agencies

111
00:04:42,499 --> 00:04:48,169
but you might have direct access to soil

112
00:04:45,288 --> 00:04:50,959
testing labs these labs are going to

113
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:54,948
offer chemical extraction type soil

114
00:04:50,959 --> 00:04:58,310
tests and maybe paste extractions our

115
00:04:54,949 --> 00:05:00,319
chemical extraction soil tests are most

116
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:02,810
common especially in commercial

117
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:06,528
agriculture this is where they use

118
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:10,278
different types of weak or strong acids

119
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:13,699
to essentially they apply these acids to

120
00:05:10,278 --> 00:05:15,439
your soil and extract off the nutrients

121
00:05:13,699 --> 00:05:18,218
that are in your soil that may be

122
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:23,000
available to a crop that is growing

123
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:26,120
there's also paste extractions these and

124
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:28,098
simple would take your soil make it into

125
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:30,499
a slurry and the paste extractions

126
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:33,800
really look at the the solution or

127
00:05:30,499 --> 00:05:36,800
soluble forms of nutrients within within

128
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:39,560
your soil type those are really the two

129
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,838
main the chemical extraction and the

130
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,050
paste extraction of the two main soil

131
00:05:41,838 --> 00:05:47,870
tests that are most familiar to to most

132
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,399
growers or agronomist so I'm most

133
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:51,379
familiar with the Mallik three test

134
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:54,259
that's the one that we typically use and

135
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:56,210
as I understand it and correct me if I'm

136
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:58,580
wrong what we're getting when we use

137
00:05:56,209 --> 00:06:00,829
that Mallik test is we're getting an

138
00:05:58,579 --> 00:06:02,778
idea of everything that's in that soil

139
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:04,128
but not necessarily what's currently

140
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:07,278
available to the plant

141
00:06:04,129 --> 00:06:08,419
whereas with that saturated paste test

142
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:10,759
that's telling us a little bit more

143
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:13,490
about what is currently soluble and

144
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:14,658
plant you know more plants available is

145
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:17,949
that is that an accurate way of

146
00:06:14,658 --> 00:06:20,718
describing the - yes so the the Mallik

147
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,908
extraction is going to be you know an

148
00:06:20,718 --> 00:06:25,968
acid type extraction and it's really

149
00:06:22,908 --> 00:06:28,129
dependent on the soil type that you have

150
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:31,009
and what extraction is going to give you

151
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:33,229
the the best idea of nutrient

152
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:35,419
availability in your soil so there's a

153
00:06:33,228 --> 00:06:37,338
lot of different types that may lick the

154
00:06:35,418 --> 00:06:39,889
Bray the Olson there's a lot of

155
00:06:37,338 --> 00:06:42,199
different types of extractions

156
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:45,288
accuracy of those extraction really

157
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:48,919
depend on the soil type that you have

158
00:06:45,288 --> 00:06:51,079
and often labs use certain extractions

159
00:06:48,918 --> 00:06:53,778
for areas where most of their soil

160
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,359
samples come from and then the paste

161
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:59,478
extraction obviously is going to give

162
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,669
you a better look at the soluble forms

163
00:06:59,478 --> 00:07:04,158
of that total amount of nutrient what's

164
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:06,468
actually soluble and in the solution

165
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:08,718
phase that would be available to your

166
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:12,110
plants and I think it's important for

167
00:07:08,718 --> 00:07:14,839
growers to know what type of test that

168
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,360
lab is using that they go with so that

169
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:18,888
they know if they're getting a braid

170
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,400
rubbery extraction or a male ik3

171
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,778
extraction so that they can base have

172
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:26,149
some sort of basis for those results

173
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:29,050
would you agree with that yeah yeah and

174
00:07:26,149 --> 00:07:31,848
I think it's important to know that and

175
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:34,728
you know once you've once you've gotten

176
00:07:31,848 --> 00:07:36,620
results from a lab it's best to really

177
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:39,079
stick to that lab and look at those

178
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:41,718
results compared to the responses in

179
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:44,329
your crops and start to really you know

180
00:07:41,718 --> 00:07:47,028
mesh those those tests with your crop

181
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:50,598
responses and kind of stick with that

182
00:07:47,028 --> 00:07:53,389
lab that that you're using it's not good

183
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:54,949
to change labs or send soils to

184
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:59,509
different labs because it really gets

185
00:07:54,949 --> 00:08:02,149
confusing to us as growers or agronomist

186
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:05,270
and trying to interpret these tests

187
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:09,019
across labs we should be able to do that

188
00:08:05,269 --> 00:08:10,968
but currently in industry they recommend

189
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:12,978
that you stick with one lab versus

190
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:14,870
trying to send your soils you know to

191
00:08:12,978 --> 00:08:17,658
all different labs and see what

192
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:20,959
responses or what readings you get from

193
00:08:17,658 --> 00:08:22,879
multiple labs yeah we've actually done

194
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:24,829
that where we've sent same samples to

195
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,838
two different labs and gotten you know

196
00:08:24,829 --> 00:08:29,658
fairly similar but different results you

197
00:08:26,838 --> 00:08:32,240
know the pH can vary by as much as 0.4

198
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:34,309
between these two we've seen different

199
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,918
calcium and magnesium levels

200
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:38,629
I totally agree with you that it is

201
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:40,879
important to stay with a lab once you

202
00:08:38,629 --> 00:08:43,399
like a lab now personally we've been

203
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:45,980
using the standard soil test at Logan

204
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,778
labs because we work with we've worked

205
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,039
with Steve Solomon and Erica Ryan himer

206
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,889
and it makes it really easy if

207
00:08:49,039 --> 00:08:52,569
everyone's using the same

208
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:54,100
lab results so that's the one that I'm

209
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,870
most comfortable with but I've seen

210
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,990
tests from all these other labs too and

211
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:01,480
they make these recommendations but I

212
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,039
think for listeners it's important to

213
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,810
realize that these recommendations are

214
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:07,539
sometimes based on certain crops or

215
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:09,369
crops that are different than cannabis

216
00:09:07,539 --> 00:09:11,649
so it's good to know are they making a

217
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:14,950
recommendation for turf grass or for

218
00:09:11,649 --> 00:09:17,379
potatoes or for tomatoes that can factor

219
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:20,680
into how you interpret these results as

220
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:23,980
well yeah correct so you typically when

221
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:25,929
you submit a soil sample to a lab if you

222
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:28,990
want recommendations they're usually

223
00:09:25,929 --> 00:09:30,849
gonna ask you what the crop is that

224
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,940
you're growing maybe what the previous

225
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:35,470
crops were and then usually you know

226
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,120
they want they're going to ask for a

227
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,759
yield goal that you're trying to achieve

228
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,299
and that really drives recommendations

229
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:45,789
in commercial agriculture now obviously

230
00:09:43,299 --> 00:09:47,769
if we're not dealing with commercial

231
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:51,189
agricultural applications you could

232
00:09:47,769 --> 00:09:53,679
probably still provide the crops a

233
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:56,170
tomatoes for example the it's a

234
00:09:53,679 --> 00:09:58,479
commercial crop as well you could

235
00:09:56,169 --> 00:10:01,059
provide that but the recommendations may

236
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,730
not be specific to the systems that

237
00:10:01,059 --> 00:10:05,649
you're trying to manage and I think that

238
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:09,039
will lead into a little bit about the

239
00:10:05,649 --> 00:10:11,409
soil savvy technology that we're

240
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:13,360
offering and how we can help growers

241
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:15,250
with the specific systems and

242
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,320
recommendations that they're that

243
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:18,610
they're managing so just to highlight a

244
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,829
couple of things you've already covered

245
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,810
so it's important to stay with a lab

246
00:10:20,828 --> 00:10:24,759
once you go with a lab know the type of

247
00:10:22,809 --> 00:10:26,679
test that they're doing and realize that

248
00:10:24,759 --> 00:10:28,958
these test results are guidelines

249
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:31,059
they're not written in stone here so

250
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:35,109
your actual soil may be you know within

251
00:10:31,059 --> 00:10:36,189
a certain percentage or close to the

252
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:39,039
results that you're getting but not

253
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,199
necessarily exactly those numbers would

254
00:10:39,039 --> 00:10:43,448
you agree with that yeah yeah and like I

255
00:10:41,198 --> 00:10:45,370
mentioned previously you really want to

256
00:10:43,448 --> 00:10:46,689
you know look at your you know look at

257
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:49,149
your plants you know if you're doing

258
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,269
tissue testing stay on top of that if

259
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:54,070
you're seeing consistent you know

260
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:56,169
deficiencies and certain nutrients and

261
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:58,629
you know maybe you're picking those up

262
00:10:56,169 --> 00:11:00,769
on the standard soil analysis and maybe

263
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:03,708
or not but you want to keep comparing

264
00:11:00,769 --> 00:11:06,649
those tests to one another and you know

265
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:09,349
just your visual observations of of your

266
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:11,389
plants and your tissue samples in

267
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:13,430
conjunction with that soil test is going

268
00:11:11,389 --> 00:11:15,980
to start to kind of lead you in the

269
00:11:13,429 --> 00:11:18,139
proper direction and nutrient management

270
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,149
if you're seeing the same deficiencies

271
00:11:18,139 --> 00:11:23,028
over and over again obviously we need to

272
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:26,240
you know maybe amend these soils with

273
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:28,009
these specific nutrients and that way

274
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,379
you know we're not trying to make up

275
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:33,139
with foliar applications during the

276
00:11:30,379 --> 00:11:35,149
growing time we want to make sure that

277
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:37,009
those nutrients are in the soil they're

278
00:11:35,149 --> 00:11:39,708
available to the plant once that plant

279
00:11:37,009 --> 00:11:42,769
starts to grow a lot of times plants

280
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:46,278
will begin to adjust in quality and

281
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:48,379
yield in deficient systems and may not

282
00:11:46,278 --> 00:11:50,330
display all the deficiencies but they're

283
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:52,250
going to start adjusting to it based on

284
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:53,870
the deficiencies in the soil so we

285
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,750
always want to start with building a

286
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,580
good soil so as an agronomist you're not

287
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,620
just looking at this soil test but

288
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:02,899
you're also looking at where your last

289
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:04,789
crop finished in terms of yield you're

290
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,610
looking at what you're visually seeing

291
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:09,379
so for example if the if the soil test

292
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:11,899
showed sufficient magnesium but you're

293
00:12:09,379 --> 00:12:13,250
seeing magnesium deficiencies that may

294
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,589
lead you to believe that that magnesium

295
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:17,990
may not be plant available or that you

296
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:19,970
may still need to do applications to get

297
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:22,459
those levels up or adjust the pH so

298
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:24,528
you're not just looking at the soil test

299
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:26,179
but there another tool and your sort of

300
00:12:24,528 --> 00:12:28,759
your agronomist toolbox would you say

301
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,588
yeah exactly you want to use all the

302
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:32,870
tools you know and we've talked about

303
00:12:30,589 --> 00:12:34,790
you know chemical extractions paste

304
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:36,769
extractions we talked about tissue

305
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:39,500
sampling so far and then we're going to

306
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:41,659
get into resin testing and what that's

307
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,789
going to offer we have all of these

308
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:45,649
tools and it's not saying though you

309
00:12:43,789 --> 00:12:47,870
know ones may be better than the other

310
00:12:45,649 --> 00:12:49,370
they all have their place and fit and

311
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:51,470
what we're trying to do is just bridge

312
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:54,200
the gap between all of these different

313
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:57,379
tools to help us manage these these

314
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,600
systems great and I think another

315
00:12:57,379 --> 00:13:01,850
important factor is the biological

316
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,040
aspect of all of this so in organic

317
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,500
soils we're counting on the micro

318
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:09,319
organisms releasing these nutrients so

319
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:11,690
the the soil tests that we talked about

320
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,850
so far all of these tests sort of give

321
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:14,460
us an idea of all of what's in the soil

322
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:17,340
not

323
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:19,800
Sara Lee what's available and that's

324
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:21,360
where the having good biological

325
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,889
activity and the soil helps release

326
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:26,490
these nutrients to the plant

327
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:29,309
now the biological is even in commercial

328
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:32,970
agriculture logical agriculture becoming

329
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:35,879
one of the biggest sectors or increasing

330
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,250
sales or in biologicals and we're really

331
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:41,220
starting to realize even in commercial

332
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:44,490
agricultural systems that biologics play

333
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,550
a huge role in soils and keeping those

334
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,799
soils essentially alive and you know the

335
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:52,500
more micro new molecular organisms the

336
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:54,479
more activity we have going on in those

337
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:56,820
soils are continually breaking down

338
00:13:54,480 --> 00:14:00,060
nutrients holding nutrients and it's

339
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:03,150
just a much better system than having

340
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:05,819
you know more of a chemical fallow type

341
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:08,720
system where you essentially are not

342
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:12,780
promoting that biological aspect of

343
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,450
those systems great so let's dive in a

344
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:17,759
little bit more about the soil savvy

345
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:19,590
test now I grilled you guys when I first

346
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:22,110
found out about your product I was

347
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:24,600
really excited for the potential of it

348
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,430
and I want to just kind of go through

349
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,070
some of that conversation that we had

350
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:30,899
you know months ago in terms of some of

351
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:32,910
the questions I had about the soil savvy

352
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:35,009
test so can you talk give a little

353
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,850
background into what what the test is

354
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:39,120
and how it works

355
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:42,389
sure yeah so the soil savvy test really

356
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:45,060
started with and with the foundation of

357
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,970
what we call our ion exchange resin

358
00:14:45,059 --> 00:14:50,969
technology this technology was acquired

359
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,300
by our company out of Montana State

360
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:57,230
University and really we've spent most

361
00:14:54,299 --> 00:15:00,059
of our time in commercial agriculture

362
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:03,450
building the foundation the baselines

363
00:15:00,059 --> 00:15:06,299
for for resin soil testing and

364
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:09,210
agriculture but what we've done is asked

365
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:12,000
after we've built that foundation and

366
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:14,790
got traction and agriculture we really

367
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,309
moved into more specialty type systems

368
00:15:14,789 --> 00:15:19,620
all the way to where we're offering what

369
00:15:17,309 --> 00:15:22,099
we're calling soil savvy which is more

370
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:25,409
for our independent gardeners our

371
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:27,159
homeowners that that need access to a

372
00:15:25,409 --> 00:15:29,289
soil test

373
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:31,838
they can read they can understand they

374
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:33,939
can interpret and then it also provides

375
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,360
them with an actionable item a

376
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,360
recommendation for both an organic or

377
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,159
synthetic fertilizer to help them you

378
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,310
know with their with their cropping

379
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:47,318
system so the base of soil savvy the

380
00:15:45,309 --> 00:15:51,219
soil savvy test kit really came out of

381
00:15:47,318 --> 00:15:53,919
commercial agriculture and even when we

382
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:57,278
look at the turfgrass applications that

383
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:58,088
are available with soil savvy those came

384
00:15:57,278 --> 00:16:01,568
from

385
00:15:58,089 --> 00:16:04,329
you know golf courses sports turf fields

386
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:06,338
all that data that backs that up came

387
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:08,559
from these applications and we've just

388
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:12,819
moved that to make it available to the

389
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:15,758
homeowner or the home or the local

390
00:16:12,818 --> 00:16:18,878
landscaper there's a lot of applications

391
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,829
for this soil savvy product so

392
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:23,528
essentially the way it works is like a

393
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:27,128
an artificial or synthetic route in

394
00:16:23,528 --> 00:16:30,549
terms of you're putting the soil into a

395
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:34,688
tiny container with a little gel like

396
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:37,389
resin yeah so the resins themselves are

397
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:39,809
in what we call a resin capsule and as

398
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:42,610
tad mentioned this is essentially

399
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:45,879
mimicking a plant root and the way that

400
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:48,009
that our system works is that these ion

401
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,740
exchange resins can only absorb

402
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:53,680
nutrients from the soil if it's in a

403
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:55,629
form available for plant uptake so if

404
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:57,338
you have nutrients in your soil and

405
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:59,500
they're not actually in a form available

406
00:16:57,339 --> 00:17:01,899
for plant uptake say they're tied up

407
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:05,318
your phosphorus is tied up with your

408
00:17:01,899 --> 00:17:08,078
calcium or your pH is reducing the

409
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:09,970
availability of your phosphorus the

410
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:12,698
resins are really going to account for

411
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:15,429
that so we talked about our standard

412
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,890
soil analysis or chemical extractions

413
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:20,199
they're really telling us okay this is

414
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:22,270
what's in our soil but it doesn't

415
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:24,610
necessarily mean that those nutrients

416
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:27,279
are in a form available for plant uptake

417
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:29,439
so now we have the resin test that's

418
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:32,529
going to tell us the actual available

419
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:35,019
portion of our nutrients in our soil

420
00:17:32,529 --> 00:17:37,250
that are going to be available to the

421
00:17:35,019 --> 00:17:40,670
plant it's almost like taking

422
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:43,130
a tissue test in the soil we have a lot

423
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:45,890
of data that correlates what we see in

424
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:48,620
the soil with the resin test back to

425
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:50,930
tissue concentrations in the plant so

426
00:17:48,619 --> 00:17:52,849
it's almost like taking a tissue test

427
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:55,640
but in the soil and we're also on the

428
00:17:52,849 --> 00:17:58,279
predictive side we're predicting an

429
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,020
excess of a nutrient or deficiency of

430
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,230
the nutrient in the soil

431
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:05,569
prior to even planting a plant or

432
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:08,509
starting a cropping system so we have

433
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:10,669
the ability to go in and amend that soil

434
00:18:08,509 --> 00:18:13,789
or build it to what we need based on

435
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:15,890
nutrient availability of that particular

436
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:17,480
soil I'm glad you mentioned tissue

437
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,900
testing because that's something that

438
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:24,559
with cannabis is not available - I'd say

439
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:27,590
you know 95% of the growers out there

440
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,169
because of the fact it is it is cannabis

441
00:18:27,589 --> 00:18:33,319
so having the ability to get something

442
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,430
that will offer you know similar results

443
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:40,039
as tissue testing in a form that is

444
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:42,230
affordable but also easy to access I

445
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:45,440
think is really a handy tool for growers

446
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,700
so like you mentioned the Mallik test or

447
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,890
the Logan labs test that we've been

448
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,110
using is the standard soil test will

449
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,850
tell us everything in the soil more or

450
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:55,939
less in an idea of what it is and then

451
00:18:52,849 --> 00:18:57,709
the soil savvy test will tell us what's

452
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,180
currently available out of all those

453
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,860
nutrients into the soil because it

454
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:03,200
really doesn't matter how much total

455
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:04,429
calcium I have if not enough of it's in

456
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,960
the form that the plant can actually

457
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:09,320
uptake it I think that's really

458
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:11,029
important so on that note let's talk

459
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:13,429
about ways you could utilize this test

460
00:19:11,029 --> 00:19:16,759
to actually make some good changes in

461
00:19:13,430 --> 00:19:19,640
your garden so for example for me I love

462
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:22,400
the idea that knowing if I get a bumper

463
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:24,860
crop with a particular cultivar that I'm

464
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,990
growing I could test that soil and set

465
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:29,719
that as my benchmark standard for future

466
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,180
crops so if my next crop isn't quite as

467
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,450
good I could do another test and know

468
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:36,920
relatively quickly oh my my manganese

469
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,870
levels are dropped off and maybe that's

470
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,640
the difference or my calcium levels are

471
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:42,829
lower whatever a particular micro macro

472
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,870
nutrient has changed I can make

473
00:19:42,829 --> 00:19:47,599
relatively quick adjustments to that

474
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:49,839
soil would you agree with that yeah yeah

475
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:52,569
I think that's a great way to position

476
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:54,908
and the test within within those systems

477
00:19:52,569 --> 00:19:56,769
you're always comparing back and forth

478
00:19:54,909 --> 00:20:00,039
we mentioned this you know many times

479
00:19:56,769 --> 00:20:02,379
just in this podcast you know that we're

480
00:20:00,038 --> 00:20:04,210
always we're always watching the plants

481
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:07,299
and we're always comparing that back to

482
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:09,940
our analysis of our soil that we that we

483
00:20:07,298 --> 00:20:11,440
currently have available in making you

484
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,750
know those changes even though the

485
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,788
analysis might not come back and tell

486
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,308
you the exact thing you need to be doing

487
00:20:15,788 --> 00:20:21,038
you know as managers we're continuing to

488
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:22,928
compare you know what we're seen and

489
00:20:21,038 --> 00:20:24,940
make adjustments as we go

490
00:20:22,929 --> 00:20:26,380
speaking of adjustments the other way I

491
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:30,159
thought this tests would be really handy

492
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:33,220
would be I could take a test a slow Savi

493
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:36,789
test apply a particular fertilizer or

494
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:38,980
nutrient and then do another test say a

495
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:41,619
few days later a week later two weeks

496
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,880
later at whatever point in time frame I

497
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:48,398
want to know how available that actual

498
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,590
application had been to the plant would

499
00:20:48,398 --> 00:20:52,808
you hear that yeah that that's a great

500
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:56,259
way we're doing that in agriculture as

501
00:20:52,808 --> 00:20:59,109
well and really you know when we have a

502
00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,970
limited amount an unlimited amount of

503
00:20:59,109 --> 00:21:02,648
fertility products out there on the

504
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,200
market biologicals

505
00:21:02,648 --> 00:21:07,178
they all claim have claims you know that

506
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,970
they do certain things or provide the

507
00:21:07,179 --> 00:21:12,250
best nutrient availability but we really

508
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:15,490
don't know once we apply those nutrients

509
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:17,109
to the soil or those biologicals you

510
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:19,538
know the effects we haven't been able to

511
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:22,269
really quantify those those effects of

512
00:21:19,538 --> 00:21:25,119
these applications but with the with the

513
00:21:22,269 --> 00:21:27,369
resin technology we can we can we can

514
00:21:25,119 --> 00:21:30,548
take a test we can look at our baseline

515
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:33,129
soil before an application then we can

516
00:21:30,548 --> 00:21:35,619
apply either a biological or certain

517
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:37,360
nutrient package that is available to

518
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:40,209
you guys that you're using we can apply

519
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:43,990
it to the soil wait a little bit of time

520
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,090
maybe a week or so come back soil test

521
00:21:43,990 --> 00:21:48,548
again send that in and look at the you

522
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:51,308
know the efficacy or the value of the

523
00:21:48,548 --> 00:21:53,619
nutrient that we applied maybe that that

524
00:21:51,308 --> 00:21:56,109
nutrient in your specific soil type

525
00:21:53,619 --> 00:21:58,750
isn't the right one and you can make

526
00:21:56,109 --> 00:22:00,639
adjustments to determine you know which

527
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,269
products are really the best for the

528
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,070
soil types that you're growing

529
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:07,259
more plants in and one other thing I

530
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:08,879
want to touch on for me was what was the

531
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:11,759
big difference between saturated pace

532
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,230
tests and this soil savvy test then

533
00:22:11,759 --> 00:22:15,690
because they're both essentially telling

534
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:18,870
you what's soluble or more available to

535
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:20,670
the plant and one of the features of the

536
00:22:18,869 --> 00:22:23,849
soil savvy test I liked was that this

537
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:25,920
artificial resin or root sits in the

538
00:22:23,849 --> 00:22:27,599
solution for five days so it's giving us

539
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,130
a little more accuracy of what's

540
00:22:27,599 --> 00:22:31,649
breaking down and available over that

541
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:34,740
time period rather than just a snapshot

542
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:36,090
of what's available right when the right

543
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,769
when the lab technician is doing that

544
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:39,808
saturated pace test is there any other

545
00:22:37,769 --> 00:22:42,929
differences there that you'd like to

546
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:45,119
highlight yeah no I you know just a high

547
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:47,519
level of thinking of the two different

548
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:49,019
testing methods you know our saturated

549
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:51,869
paste essentially is going to tell us

550
00:22:49,019 --> 00:22:53,579
you know what's in the solution phase so

551
00:22:51,869 --> 00:22:55,139
they're adding water they're spending

552
00:22:53,579 --> 00:22:57,119
that sample and they're taking the

553
00:22:55,140 --> 00:23:00,150
solution and looking at what's in that

554
00:22:57,119 --> 00:23:02,039
solution phase the resin technology of

555
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:05,040
the soil savvy is going to look at what

556
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,019
nutrients are in that in the solution

557
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:09,480
phase but it goes beyond that because

558
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:13,289
once the nutrients are adsorbed out of

559
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:16,410
the solution phase by the by the resin

560
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:19,079
it then starts to exchange for available

561
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:21,870
nutrients on exchange sites so it goes

562
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:23,730
beyond just that snapshot of what's in

563
00:23:21,869 --> 00:23:26,308
the solution phase it's going to tell us

564
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:28,679
okay once we've absorbed nutrients from

565
00:23:26,308 --> 00:23:31,440
the solution phase what's that soils

566
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,390
ability to continue to provide available

567
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,340
nutrients once we have beds orbed it

568
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:37,530
from the solution phase and that's where

569
00:23:35,339 --> 00:23:39,928
the resins are very dynamic and seeing

570
00:23:37,529 --> 00:23:42,000
what the plants actually going to see in

571
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:44,280
that soil type because we absorb from

572
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,099
the solution phase and then we go and

573
00:23:44,279 --> 00:23:49,349
adsorb from the cation exchange sites on

574
00:23:47,099 --> 00:23:51,808
on the soils and we know what those that

575
00:23:49,349 --> 00:23:54,779
soils ability is to continue to provide

576
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:56,250
available nutrient that's great one

577
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,649
other thing that I forgot to mention

578
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,750
earlier that I get asked a lot are about

579
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:02,820
these home soil test kits that you see

580
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:05,039
it like you know home depot your local

581
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:06,359
garden center do you have any comments

582
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,589
on those I know I have some thoughts but

583
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:09,479
I'd let you go first

584
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:12,058
ah you know I haven't spent I know

585
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:13,269
Brandon our VP of Martin new market

586
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:15,250
development

587
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:17,109
here at Univest has spent a little more

588
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,140
time looking into those systems but

589
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:24,639
they're so general in what they provide

590
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:26,530
even pH testing you know at laboratories

591
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,840
still today as a as Todd mentioned

592
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:31,569
earlier it can vary you know almost a

593
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:34,089
half a pH unit depending on the lab and

594
00:24:31,569 --> 00:24:36,490
how they do pH is and I can only think

595
00:24:34,089 --> 00:24:41,139
that the variability in a home test kit

596
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:43,420
for pH and other you know even NPK can

597
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:46,480
be highly variable and I think the level

598
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:48,910
of you know soil testing and management

599
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,059
of where where we're at today I just

600
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:54,820
don't think you know that's that's gonna

601
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:57,309
be enough to provide us with actionable

602
00:24:54,819 --> 00:24:59,950
recommendations yeah you know I found

603
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,950
these home kits to be very inaccurate

604
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:04,840
personally and I we won't tell them an

605
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:07,240
hour that our feet farm and feed store

606
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:09,699
or garden center because I just don't

607
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:13,450
think they give us good information as

608
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:15,130
you mentioned these these tests you know

609
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:16,330
they're they're doing alright there

610
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,710
you're going to see a color change

611
00:25:16,329 --> 00:25:20,319
sometimes so you're being asked to

612
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,240
interpret a color and that's really

613
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:23,769
challenging a lot of ways and you guys

614
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:26,500
have a lot of expensive you know

615
00:25:23,769 --> 00:25:27,849
equipment that you're using and so for

616
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:30,400
me to spend twenty five to thirty

617
00:25:27,849 --> 00:25:32,169
dollars on a soil test and send it into

618
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,460
a laboratory that's going to have a

619
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:35,769
technician that's trained on

620
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:38,170
interpreting the results and also using

621
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:40,720
much more expensive lab equipment than I

622
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:43,000
can afford at my you know in my garden

623
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:46,870
to interpret those results I think is

624
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,549
really important so moving on here now

625
00:25:46,869 --> 00:25:51,489
that we've kind of covered your tests

626
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:52,960
and also these other types of soil tests

627
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,549
and the way they can be used can we talk

628
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,430
a little bit more about what someone

629
00:25:54,549 --> 00:25:59,139
might see on a soil test in terms of

630
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:01,120
what these you know what these different

631
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:03,820
categories or numbers are and what what

632
00:26:01,119 --> 00:26:06,729
they really mean can we talk a little

633
00:26:03,819 --> 00:26:09,429
bit more about what what pH is yeah so

634
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:11,890
on the soil test I guess we'll kind of

635
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:14,769
transition more to speaking about the

636
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:16,870
soil savvy test but any test when we

637
00:26:14,769 --> 00:26:19,720
talk about nutrients a lot of times

638
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:22,509
you're going to see the pH or the

639
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:26,269
percent hydrogen and you're also going

640
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:28,669
to see parts per million values apart

641
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:30,679
per million of nutrient you may see

642
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:32,538
percentages so there's a lot of

643
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,320
different things you're going to see on

644
00:26:32,538 --> 00:26:39,769
on a soil test I guess first to talk

645
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:42,739
specifically to pH what we're looking at

646
00:26:39,769 --> 00:26:46,038
is the percent hydrogen in that in that

647
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:48,319
soil and so it's a reverse logarithm of

648
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:50,209
the amount of hydrogen in the soil so if

649
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:52,819
you think about it the more hydrogen

650
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:55,909
that you have free hydrogen in the soil

651
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:59,718
or on exchange sites that's going to

652
00:26:55,909 --> 00:27:01,459
decrease your pH and the less hydrogen

653
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:05,719
you have you you're going to have a

654
00:27:01,459 --> 00:27:07,548
higher pH and pH is really you know the

655
00:27:05,719 --> 00:27:10,489
first thing that we want to tackle when

656
00:27:07,548 --> 00:27:12,618
we look at a soil test if your pH is you

657
00:27:10,489 --> 00:27:14,028
know either high or low that's one of

658
00:27:12,618 --> 00:27:16,848
the first things that we want to adjust

659
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:19,608
before we start to tackle you know some

660
00:27:16,848 --> 00:27:22,398
of the other nutrients so if we have a

661
00:27:19,608 --> 00:27:25,668
low pH for example you know maybe we're

662
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:27,678
down at five or five point five pH you

663
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,749
know that's pretty low for for most of

664
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,538
our plants with the exception of you

665
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:34,219
know blueberries as a elyes

666
00:27:31,538 --> 00:27:36,319
rhododendrons you know you can be at

667
00:27:34,219 --> 00:27:38,899
those lower PHS they thrive at those

668
00:27:36,319 --> 00:27:41,569
lower PHS but most of our most of our

669
00:27:38,898 --> 00:27:45,798
crops do the best you know between a six

670
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:46,908
and a seven pH so if our pH is low you

671
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:49,519
know we're really going to want to look

672
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:52,159
at you know some liming applications and

673
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:54,288
limes essentially calcium carbonate that

674
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:56,570
we're adding to the soil and that's

675
00:27:54,288 --> 00:27:59,479
going to help you know kick off some of

676
00:27:56,569 --> 00:28:02,208
these free hydrogens get rid of those

677
00:27:59,479 --> 00:28:06,109
hydrogen's and increase our our pH in

678
00:28:02,209 --> 00:28:09,078
the soil if we have soil test that comes

679
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:10,958
back with low magnesium you know and our

680
00:28:09,078 --> 00:28:13,459
pH as low we might want to use a

681
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:16,219
dolomitic lime and this is going to have

682
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:19,308
your magnesium component in there so if

683
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:22,009
you have low low pH and low magnesium

684
00:28:19,308 --> 00:28:23,979
you'll want to use a dolomitic line

685
00:28:22,009 --> 00:28:27,769
because that will help you increase your

686
00:28:23,979 --> 00:28:30,139
magnesium as well as increase your pH so

687
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,759
when you look at a soil test that's one

688
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:35,558
of the first things I look at is what is

689
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:39,349
the pH of my soil and justed by just

690
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:41,569
adjusting pH alone you can also make

691
00:28:39,349 --> 00:28:43,849
more nutrient available that wasn't

692
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:46,339
available at that lower pH so as we

693
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:48,889
increase that pH we can increase

694
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:51,709
nutrient availability and that might

695
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:55,190
solve a lot of our deficiency problems

696
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:57,110
alone just by adjusting pH we've talked

697
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:59,720
about against low pH now what do we do

698
00:28:57,109 --> 00:29:02,479
for high pH you know we're going to want

699
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:04,850
to use more ammonium type products

700
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,349
ammonium sulfate or similar products

701
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:08,418
because now we want to add these

702
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:11,298
hydrogen's and these acidifying

703
00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:15,110
components back into the soil to

704
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:17,720
decrease the pH and in the same way as

705
00:29:15,109 --> 00:29:19,490
we did with the low pH we might increase

706
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,798
nutrient availability of certain

707
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:26,450
nutrients that weren't available under

708
00:29:21,798 --> 00:29:29,418
the original pH regime so pH is a very

709
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:31,580
good place to start with your soil test

710
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,419
and really get that balance before you

711
00:29:31,579 --> 00:29:35,658
start to tackle your macro and

712
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:38,509
micronutrients

713
00:29:35,659 --> 00:29:40,159
yeah I'll post the pH availability chart

714
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:42,169
which is sort of what you were kind of

715
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,659
discussing there as you were talking

716
00:29:42,169 --> 00:29:47,090
about pH so people can see at what

717
00:29:44,659 --> 00:29:49,610
levels things are available and one

718
00:29:47,089 --> 00:29:50,779
thing that's interesting too is as you

719
00:29:49,609 --> 00:29:53,569
mentioned certain things are available

720
00:29:50,779 --> 00:29:56,359
more available at certain PHS and some

721
00:29:53,569 --> 00:29:57,529
things are at lower pH are more

722
00:29:56,359 --> 00:30:00,469
available that you don't actually want

723
00:29:57,529 --> 00:30:03,859
like aluminum for example or some of the

724
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:05,808
heavy metals so keeping the pH above you

725
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:08,240
know certain levels is really important

726
00:30:05,808 --> 00:30:09,109
as well and this is a really complicated

727
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,450
topic

728
00:30:09,109 --> 00:30:12,979
you know people obviously go to school

729
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:15,558
for a long time for this and there's lot

730
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,360
of stuff we're still learning so we're

731
00:30:15,558 --> 00:30:19,190
just going really basic into it but

732
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:21,558
there's a lot of put up other resources

733
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:24,169
for people who want to read more the

734
00:30:21,558 --> 00:30:25,940
other aspect of pH and I just wanted to

735
00:30:24,169 --> 00:30:29,240
mention is I've seen some good research

736
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:31,548
showing that the plant can actually

737
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:34,519
buffer the pH in the rhizosphere based

738
00:30:31,548 --> 00:30:36,408
on the exudates it puts out to select

739
00:30:34,519 --> 00:30:39,048
for certain microorganisms so I've heard

740
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:40,370
that the pH can vary a fair bit so

741
00:30:39,048 --> 00:30:44,569
that's how you can get plants that can

742
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:46,788
survive in you know less than optimal pH

743
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:49,369
ranges in terms of the soil test but

744
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:52,069
they can still thrive have you seen any

745
00:30:49,369 --> 00:30:52,849
research on this yourself yeah yeah yeah

746
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:55,308
plants

747
00:30:52,849 --> 00:30:57,408
definitely do that they can adjust for

748
00:30:55,308 --> 00:31:00,558
certain environmental conditions I guess

749
00:30:57,409 --> 00:31:02,720
one caveat to that mean saying they

750
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,329
might not be thriving they might they

751
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,970
may just be managing you know to get by

752
00:31:05,329 --> 00:31:09,918
so I wouldn't you know just think that

753
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:12,739
the plants can adjust to these things

754
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,570
because everything that plants having to

755
00:31:12,739 --> 00:31:16,369
you know give out or those plant

756
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:19,038
exudates you know those are all being

757
00:31:16,368 --> 00:31:21,769
created you know through through light

758
00:31:19,038 --> 00:31:23,298
through sunlight you know that's all

759
00:31:21,769 --> 00:31:26,538
have to be transferred those are all

760
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:28,970
processes that take energy to do that to

761
00:31:26,538 --> 00:31:31,278
buffer out you know the offset these

762
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:33,528
soil factors so we really want to still

763
00:31:31,278 --> 00:31:36,589
focus on the soil but tadd is correct

764
00:31:33,528 --> 00:31:39,319
that plants can adjust for some of these

765
00:31:36,589 --> 00:31:42,168
things but you know obviously in the

766
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:45,019
cannabis industry we have a very great

767
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:47,480
opportunity to really get these soils

768
00:31:45,019 --> 00:31:51,499
exactly where we want them you know

769
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:54,378
especially with the resin technology and

770
00:31:51,499 --> 00:31:56,419
I really wanted to also talk about you

771
00:31:54,378 --> 00:31:58,189
know the value of the resin technology

772
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:00,679
we've talked about all these chemical

773
00:31:58,190 --> 00:32:03,169
extractions we talked about pH and how

774
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,600
complicated all of these components are

775
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:07,850
which extraction is the best one you

776
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:10,248
know what do I do the great thing about

777
00:32:07,849 --> 00:32:12,259
the resin technology that we've

778
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:14,538
developed is its accounting for all

779
00:32:12,259 --> 00:32:16,639
those things for you it's kind of doing

780
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:20,148
that work for you in a sense you know

781
00:32:16,638 --> 00:32:22,488
the pH of your soil is going to tell you

782
00:32:20,148 --> 00:32:24,558
what nutrients are available the resins

783
00:32:22,489 --> 00:32:26,690
are going to adsorb those so it takes

784
00:32:24,558 --> 00:32:28,249
some of that that work or that thought

785
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:30,528
out of thinking you know which

786
00:32:28,249 --> 00:32:33,379
extraction is the best or what nutrients

787
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:35,239
are actually available and so I like to

788
00:32:33,378 --> 00:32:37,278
think of the resin as doing a lot of

789
00:32:35,239 --> 00:32:40,460
that work for us that we've tried to

790
00:32:37,278 --> 00:32:42,710
figure out in the past ya know that's a

791
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,419
good point as we as we move on to some

792
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:46,220
of these other topics some of these

793
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:48,799
things that I'd like to cover not

794
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:51,319
necessarily on the soil savvy test most

795
00:32:48,798 --> 00:32:53,028
of them are but I'm actually looking at

796
00:32:51,319 --> 00:32:54,288
a may like three tests right now in my

797
00:32:53,028 --> 00:32:57,769
screen to so I just kind of want to

798
00:32:54,288 --> 00:32:59,269
cover both one of the the ones that they

799
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,950
offer you too is your organic matter

800
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:03,230
percentage can we talk a little about

801
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:04,429
what that number tells us yeah so our

802
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:08,450
organic mint

803
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:12,169
matter percentages is a important factor

804
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:15,649
in in our soils and you know really it's

805
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:18,129
tied to ability of soils to hold water

806
00:33:15,648 --> 00:33:21,798
or certain percent moisture is really

807
00:33:18,128 --> 00:33:23,628
tied to the amount of organic matter it

808
00:33:21,798 --> 00:33:26,118
really controls say the amount of

809
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:28,730
irrigation that we can apply at one time

810
00:33:26,118 --> 00:33:31,730
the holding capacity of that soil but

811
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:36,019
it's also tied to nutrient holding

812
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:38,599
capacity and more cation exchange sites

813
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:40,249
the amount of organic matter as you

814
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:43,038
increase it's going to have the ability

815
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:45,618
to to hold on to more nutrient the

816
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:47,690
ability to release more nutrient if our

817
00:33:45,618 --> 00:33:49,999
microbial populations are good it's

818
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:53,509
going to continually break down this

819
00:33:49,999 --> 00:33:57,110
organic matter and release more nutrient

820
00:33:53,509 --> 00:34:00,470
into our soil so having organic matter

821
00:33:57,109 --> 00:34:03,229
in the soil is very important obviously

822
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:05,538
when we get into our sandy or soil

823
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:07,190
systems typically they have less organic

824
00:34:05,538 --> 00:34:10,128
matter they have less ability to hold

825
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,798
water nutrient and those systems are a

826
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:15,529
little bit tougher to manage but the

827
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:18,108
downside of too much organic matter also

828
00:34:15,530 --> 00:34:20,899
is that organic matter can tie up

829
00:34:18,108 --> 00:34:22,789
nutrient very readily and make it not

830
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:24,588
available so as you apply these

831
00:34:22,789 --> 00:34:27,230
nutrients that we talked about these

832
00:34:24,588 --> 00:34:29,148
products there's a chance that in some

833
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:31,730
soils that organic matter could tie that

834
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:33,798
up immediately and it may become

835
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:37,519
available over time as it gets broken

836
00:34:33,798 --> 00:34:39,949
down by these microbial population these

837
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:42,048
organisms that may be become available

838
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:44,088
over time but if you're managing the

839
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:46,219
lifecycle of a plant in a very short

840
00:34:44,088 --> 00:34:48,619
period of time we need to be working

841
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:51,168
with nutrient you know that's more

842
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:53,568
available more readily available into

843
00:34:51,168 --> 00:34:55,128
that solution phase in that short amount

844
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,710
of time that we're managing that we

845
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:59,659
don't want to try and manage nutrient

846
00:34:57,710 --> 00:35:02,059
that's going to be available in a year

847
00:34:59,659 --> 00:35:05,298
or two we want a mad managed nutrient

848
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:06,740
that's out of mediate availability yeah

849
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:09,079
and the other thing about organic matter

850
00:35:06,739 --> 00:35:10,548
percentage to that I've found is because

851
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:12,920
we're dealing with a lot of people using

852
00:35:10,548 --> 00:35:16,780
potting soils is that high level can

853
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,420
break down over the time so you may have

854
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:21,370
you know 20% less soil at the end of

855
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:23,860
your crop cycle then when you started

856
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:25,539
because the microorganisms are breaking

857
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:28,870
that material down toward you know the

858
00:35:25,539 --> 00:35:30,099
cue makasian of that soil and so it's

859
00:35:28,869 --> 00:35:31,960
important to account for that if you

860
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:33,190
plan on reusing your soil to realize

861
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,030
that you're going to have a lot less

862
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:39,250
soil come recycling time if your organic

863
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:40,360
matter percentage is higher and any of

864
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:42,639
these potting soils are going to be a

865
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,010
lot higher than say a field or

866
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:46,900
agricultural soil we're typically trying

867
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,000
to get organic matter percentage above 5

868
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:50,710
percent and if you get up into 10

869
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,869
percent you know you're you're rocking

870
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,220
from an agricultural perspective but

871
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:56,889
from a potting soil perspective that's

872
00:35:54,219 --> 00:35:58,329
very low one so you kind of already

873
00:35:56,889 --> 00:35:59,980
jumped into the next one that I want to

874
00:35:58,329 --> 00:36:02,250
talk about which is a cation exchange

875
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:07,150
capacity or total exchange capacity

876
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:08,800
you'll see it as CEC or tea CEC on soil

877
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:10,660
tests can you talk a little bit about

878
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,210
that you kind of already touched on it I

879
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:14,829
know ya know this is a very important

880
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:17,079
component and one of those components

881
00:36:14,829 --> 00:36:19,449
that we talked about what the resins are

882
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:22,989
kind of telling us as far as nutrient

883
00:36:19,449 --> 00:36:26,829
availability so our CEC or our cation

884
00:36:22,989 --> 00:36:29,939
exchange capacity is a measurement of

885
00:36:26,829 --> 00:36:33,309
the amount of nutrient or exchange

886
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:36,519
exchangeable sites on a particular soil

887
00:36:33,309 --> 00:36:40,449
so these are negatively charged sites on

888
00:36:36,519 --> 00:36:44,019
a soil particle and this is kind of a

889
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:47,859
scale or an idea of like high CEC soils

890
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:51,369
versus low CEC soils they a clay type

891
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:53,620
soil because of the the type of soil the

892
00:36:51,369 --> 00:36:57,159
amount of surface area on a clay is

893
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:59,469
going to have the most negative exchange

894
00:36:57,159 --> 00:37:02,429
sites and so it's going to have ability

895
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:04,839
to hold on to a lot more of our

896
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:08,139
positively charged nutrients or calcium

897
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,420
or potassium or magnesium it's got the

898
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:13,029
ability to hold on to a lot more of that

899
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:15,460
at one time essentially versus our

900
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:18,850
sandier soils are going to have a low

901
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:21,849
cation exchange capacity or a low amount

902
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:24,849
of negative exchange sites to hold

903
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:27,279
nutrients so it's very important and how

904
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:29,589
we load soils with nutrient and their

905
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,619
ability is to actually hold that that

906
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:33,890
nutrient

907
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:35,509
so as we mentioned in a sandier soil you

908
00:37:33,889 --> 00:37:38,058
know I might not be able to put as much

909
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:40,219
nutrient down at one time because I

910
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:42,349
don't have the exchange capacity to tie

911
00:37:40,219 --> 00:37:45,048
up or hold those nutrients on those

912
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:48,440
exchange sites versus a high organic

913
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:50,449
matter or CC soil like with clay you're

914
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:52,630
going to have a lot more exchange sites

915
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:55,068
to hold on to a larger amount of

916
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:57,680
nutrient at one time so it's a very

917
00:37:55,068 --> 00:38:00,949
important measure you know of your soil

918
00:37:57,679 --> 00:38:03,768
and its nutrient holding capacity so as

919
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:05,538
Todd mentioned you know in in commercial

920
00:38:03,768 --> 00:38:07,998
agriculture we're trying to shoot for

921
00:38:05,539 --> 00:38:11,569
you know four or five percent organic

922
00:38:07,998 --> 00:38:13,159
matter you know on those soil types but

923
00:38:11,568 --> 00:38:14,838
in the systems that you guys are

924
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:16,548
managing with potting soil those

925
00:38:14,838 --> 00:38:20,058
percentages are going to be much higher

926
00:38:16,548 --> 00:38:23,748
so that and CC is going to allow you to

927
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:25,789
load those soils much more upfront and

928
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:28,459
have the ability to carry it out through

929
00:38:25,789 --> 00:38:33,079
the lifecycle of the of the plant versus

930
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:37,460
lower CEC soils and lower organic matter

931
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:40,910
soil so always look at your CEC levels

932
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:44,269
of your soil one thing that is really

933
00:38:40,909 --> 00:38:47,498
tied to CEC - and I think everybody

934
00:38:44,268 --> 00:38:51,018
should ask for this test as a base

935
00:38:47,498 --> 00:38:53,598
saturation test and this is a very

936
00:38:51,018 --> 00:38:56,659
critical test because this is going to

937
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,660
essentially tell us the the balance of

938
00:38:56,659 --> 00:39:02,538
bases in our soil so this is the balance

939
00:38:59,659 --> 00:39:05,509
of our calcium to our magnesium and to

940
00:39:02,539 --> 00:39:07,609
our potassium and the availability of

941
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:10,219
those nutrients is very much tied to

942
00:39:07,608 --> 00:39:12,949
that that base saturation you know

943
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:15,439
typically on a good soil when we look at

944
00:39:12,949 --> 00:39:19,068
a base saturation measurement about

945
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,759
seventy five percent you know of our our

946
00:39:19,068 --> 00:39:24,650
base saturation should be calcium so 75%

947
00:39:22,759 --> 00:39:28,998
of those exchange sites roughly should

948
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:31,700
be taken up or occupied by calcium about

949
00:39:28,998 --> 00:39:33,949
four to seven percent of those exchange

950
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:36,828
sites should be occupied by potassium

951
00:39:33,949 --> 00:39:39,858
and then the remaining exchange sites

952
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:41,509
should be applied by our magnesium which

953
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:43,929
i think is usually around you know

954
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:46,869
twelve to fifteen

955
00:39:43,929 --> 00:39:49,119
or so of those exchange sites so when

956
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:51,940
you guys get a test the base saturation

957
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:53,980
is very critical because depending on

958
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:56,500
the balance of those nutrients on that

959
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,809
exchange site it's really going to turn

960
00:39:56,500 --> 00:40:01,719
determine the availability of those

961
00:39:58,809 --> 00:40:04,239
nutrients if if we have a too much

962
00:40:01,719 --> 00:40:06,730
calcium and magnesium on those exchange

963
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:09,250
sites we're going to have very low base

964
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:12,670
saturation number four potassium which

965
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:15,159
is a very key nutrient and most of our

966
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,409
plants and so look at that base

967
00:40:15,159 --> 00:40:19,389
saturation number to get familiar with

968
00:40:17,409 --> 00:40:22,690
those numbers if they're offered to you

969
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:24,940
we don't do that on the soil savvy test

970
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:27,490
but this is one reason why we want to

971
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:29,950
use all the tools that are available you

972
00:40:27,489 --> 00:40:32,500
know at Universal Savi we're not saying

973
00:40:29,949 --> 00:40:34,539
to not do a standard soil analysis

974
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:37,059
because we've talked about the the

975
00:40:34,539 --> 00:40:40,900
critical components of these tests the

976
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:42,549
base saturation the CEC these components

977
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,280
that we don't offer with just the

978
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:47,410
availability test at soil savvy so use

979
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,890
these tools in conjunction with one

980
00:40:47,409 --> 00:40:53,619
another as we mentioned to give yourself

981
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:56,699
the best opportunity to to manage these

982
00:40:53,619 --> 00:41:00,429
soils yeah you know I like to think of

983
00:40:56,699 --> 00:41:02,079
CC sort of as a giant sponge and it's a

984
00:41:00,429 --> 00:41:04,539
little bit of a double-edged sword in

985
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,639
the sense that with a soil with a low

986
00:41:04,539 --> 00:41:09,670
CEC it's not going to take very much

987
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:11,230
nutrients to fill that sponge but then

988
00:41:09,670 --> 00:41:12,789
it's not going to hold as much nutrients

989
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:15,550
either so we're going to apply nutrients

990
00:41:12,789 --> 00:41:17,590
more frequently whereas something with a

991
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:19,120
high CEC it's going to hold a lot more

992
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:22,390
nutrients but it's going to take a lot

993
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,339
more to fill that sponge as well so you

994
00:41:22,389 --> 00:41:26,170
have to keep that in mind too when

995
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:28,570
you're looking at your your cation

996
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:31,030
exchange capacity so really really high

997
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:32,620
it's not necessarily a lot better it

998
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:35,410
just means you have to manage that soil

999
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:38,349
differently now in terms of baits bass

1000
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,879
saturation percentage you know I've read

1001
00:41:38,349 --> 00:41:41,259
a few different books on the subject and

1002
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:43,690
everyone sort of has a slightly

1003
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:46,290
different idea of what they call an

1004
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:48,730
optimal level or optimal range I know

1005
00:41:46,289 --> 00:41:50,679
currently I'm I'm reading a book by Neil

1006
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:53,849
Kinsey and he likes to have calcium

1007
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:55,809
around 68% and magnesium at 12%

1008
00:41:53,849 --> 00:41:57,818
depending on your crop your potassium

1009
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:59,650
labels levels may vary

1010
00:41:57,818 --> 00:42:02,228
I like to run potassium a little bit

1011
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:04,509
higher with cannabis but that person

1012
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:06,189
based saturation is essentially what

1013
00:42:04,509 --> 00:42:09,219
percentage of that sponge is what

1014
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:11,679
nutrient and like you mentioned you know

1015
00:42:09,219 --> 00:42:13,838
high calcium can cause less magnesium or

1016
00:42:11,679 --> 00:42:15,368
potassium availability these things all

1017
00:42:13,838 --> 00:42:17,048
interact together and there's

1018
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:18,608
relationships between these different

1019
00:42:17,048 --> 00:42:22,208
nutrients and it gets really really

1020
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:23,380
complicated and I still is a lot of it's

1021
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:25,598
still over my head and I'm still

1022
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:28,568
learning a lot myself because they'll be

1023
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:30,910
relationships between you know zinc and

1024
00:42:28,568 --> 00:42:32,949
another another nutrient or iron or

1025
00:42:30,909 --> 00:42:35,978
phosphorus and and there's all these

1026
00:42:32,949 --> 00:42:37,930
levels and in relationships that get

1027
00:42:35,978 --> 00:42:40,268
very complicated I guess is there

1028
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:42,578
anything uh do you want to talk about in

1029
00:42:40,268 --> 00:42:45,159
that regard or don't move on to the next

1030
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:48,160
the next thing on the soil report yeah

1031
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:50,199
sure I mean like like you said everybody

1032
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:52,929
there's kind of different ranges for

1033
00:42:50,199 --> 00:42:54,999
these nutrients and you know one of the

1034
00:42:52,929 --> 00:42:57,759
things that had just mentioned is you

1035
00:42:54,998 --> 00:43:01,389
know potassium in the cannabis system

1036
00:42:57,759 --> 00:43:04,769
just like in you know Tomatoes is huge

1037
00:43:01,389 --> 00:43:10,239
and a lot of ranges for potassium are

1038
00:43:04,768 --> 00:43:12,728
often too low for these crops and so

1039
00:43:10,239 --> 00:43:14,920
when we look at nutrient levels for

1040
00:43:12,728 --> 00:43:18,098
potassium it might say that you're in

1041
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,349
the range for potassium in the range for

1042
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:22,539
that specific lab or even our soil savvy

1043
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:25,539
test it might say that you're in the

1044
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:27,039
range but I would say that you know for

1045
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:29,259
a cannabis you're going to want to be at

1046
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:31,390
the high end or even above that range

1047
00:43:29,259 --> 00:43:35,469
because we know that cannabis is a hot

1048
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:37,179
as a high demand for potassium and so we

1049
00:43:35,469 --> 00:43:39,509
want to actually be at the higher end of

1050
00:43:37,179 --> 00:43:42,788
that range so don't let the range is

1051
00:43:39,509 --> 00:43:43,989
totally dictate you know where you're at

1052
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:45,729
it might come back that you're

1053
00:43:43,989 --> 00:43:48,429
sufficient but you could still see

1054
00:43:45,728 --> 00:43:51,129
deficiencies in your tissue samples that

1055
00:43:48,429 --> 00:43:53,048
you take or just visual deficiency

1056
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:55,719
symptoms and that's because it's but

1057
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:58,179
saying that you're in range but maybe a

1058
00:43:55,719 --> 00:44:00,039
lot of that potassium is not available

1059
00:43:58,179 --> 00:44:02,919
or you just need to continue to increase

1060
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:05,019
the amount of potassium to displace some

1061
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:07,599
of that calcium magnesium because you

1062
00:44:05,018 --> 00:44:10,088
need more potassium for that specific

1063
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:11,190
crop that you're managing where those

1064
00:44:10,088 --> 00:44:14,460
levels might be

1065
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:17,159
for another crop we needed to manage the

1066
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:19,380
high demand nutrient now it's kind of my

1067
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:22,139
second thing after pH we want to look at

1068
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:24,900
our macronutrients and see you know what

1069
00:44:22,139 --> 00:44:27,690
our macro nutrient levels are you know

1070
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:29,760
and that really leads into you know

1071
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:32,579
potassium looking at our n P and K

1072
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:34,650
levels and you know where those levels

1073
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:36,480
are at and if I have a plant that

1074
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,389
requires a high amount of a certain

1075
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,730
nutrient we want to address that

1076
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:43,529
nutrient yeah that's a really good point

1077
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,409
that you bring up there that these

1078
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:48,300
recommendations are like you said just

1079
00:44:46,409 --> 00:44:51,118
their guidelines and we need to adjust

1080
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,220
them for our specific crops and in

1081
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,940
addition traditionally these

1082
00:44:53,219 --> 00:44:58,889
recommendations to by you know by

1083
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:02,338
naghralla just by a lab to a farmer

1084
00:44:58,889 --> 00:45:04,559
would be just enough to get that crop to

1085
00:45:02,338 --> 00:45:06,960
grow for an optimal yield they're not

1086
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,719
trying to necessarily build the soil so

1087
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,639
as an organic farmer as we're trying to

1088
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,939
reuse the soil and have this high-value

1089
00:45:11,639 --> 00:45:16,618
cash crop our recommendations may we may

1090
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:18,389
want to vary our guidelines based on

1091
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:20,099
that and actually put a little bit more

1092
00:45:18,389 --> 00:45:22,019
into the soil or try and do a little bit

1093
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:24,300
more to build the quality of the soil

1094
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:25,440
for successive you know successive

1095
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:27,390
generations of crops

1096
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,880
all right so Chris one of the other

1097
00:45:27,389 --> 00:45:32,400
questions I had was that you don't see

1098
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,960
nitrogen on like for example the Logan

1099
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,608
lab standard soil test the may like

1100
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:38,579
three tests can you talk a little about

1101
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:40,170
why that might be yeah I think a lot of

1102
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:42,900
times we don't get a nitrogen

1103
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:46,318
measurement maybe unless it's specially

1104
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:48,900
requested um on a test because a lot of

1105
00:45:46,318 --> 00:45:52,710
times if they're doing a grower is doing

1106
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:55,079
like a pre plant soil sample usually

1107
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:57,150
they're looking at nitrates only and

1108
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:00,599
most of these tests and they typically

1109
00:45:57,150 --> 00:46:02,639
may assume that those nitrates are going

1110
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,680
to be readily lost or leached out of the

1111
00:46:02,639 --> 00:46:06,960
system by the time you get to growing

1112
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:09,118
the crops so they might soil test you

1113
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,949
know two or three months before the

1114
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:13,829
actual crop goes in the ground so they

1115
00:46:10,949 --> 00:46:16,559
would assume that most any nitrates and

1116
00:46:13,829 --> 00:46:19,260
most systems may be lost prior to the

1117
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:22,559
crop going in and so a lot of times they

1118
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:25,019
may not offer the the nitrate test

1119
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:27,418
unless it's maybe specific

1120
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:29,698
we requested one good thing about the

1121
00:46:27,418 --> 00:46:31,528
soil savvy test is we're going to give

1122
00:46:29,699 --> 00:46:33,599
you a measurement of nitrate in your

1123
00:46:31,528 --> 00:46:35,998
soil but we're also going to give you a

1124
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:37,469
measurement of the amount of ammonium in

1125
00:46:35,998 --> 00:46:40,618
your soil that's going to be available

1126
00:46:37,469 --> 00:46:43,318
to the plant typically ammonium has been

1127
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:46,019
a lot tougher nutrient to analyze for

1128
00:46:43,318 --> 00:46:49,469
with the standard analysis methods but

1129
00:46:46,018 --> 00:46:50,879
it's very easily absorbed by our resins

1130
00:46:49,469 --> 00:46:52,769
and our resin blends so we're going to

1131
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:56,548
give you the nitrate and ammonium

1132
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:57,988
portions of nutrient in the soil and

1133
00:46:56,548 --> 00:47:00,659
that's really important to kind of

1134
00:46:57,989 --> 00:47:03,358
managing the ratios of those nutrients

1135
00:47:00,659 --> 00:47:06,269
to one another you know we don't want to

1136
00:47:03,358 --> 00:47:08,458
be leaching or pushing a lot of nitrates

1137
00:47:06,268 --> 00:47:10,498
through our system so we can also build

1138
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:12,658
up nitrogen levels with ammonium which

1139
00:47:10,498 --> 00:47:15,118
can be held on exchange sites are not

1140
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:17,759
near as leachable as our as our nitrates

1141
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,809
so we want to balance out the amount of

1142
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:24,208
nitrate to ammonium in these systems a

1143
00:47:21,809 --> 00:47:26,819
lot more a lot of the organic soils tend

1144
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:29,938
to have more ammonium higher ammonium

1145
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:31,798
levels than nitrate so just look for

1146
00:47:29,938 --> 00:47:34,638
that on the soil savage test and see

1147
00:47:31,798 --> 00:47:37,498
what your balance is of these nitrogen

1148
00:47:34,639 --> 00:47:38,880
components and try and balance those out

1149
00:47:37,498 --> 00:47:41,818
because we don't really want to even

1150
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,259
though we're a lot of times indoor and

1151
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:45,088
potting systems we're not pushing

1152
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:47,188
nitrates through and into the

1153
00:47:45,088 --> 00:47:49,259
environment we could be recycling them

1154
00:47:47,188 --> 00:47:50,759
even we just don't want to waste them

1155
00:47:49,259 --> 00:47:52,259
and push them through if we don't need

1156
00:47:50,759 --> 00:47:56,159
them so look at the balance of your

1157
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:59,099
nitrate to your ammonium in your soil

1158
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,838
savvy results as well yeah excess

1159
00:47:59,099 --> 00:48:02,909
nitrates is a big problem with the

1160
00:48:00,838 --> 00:48:06,389
cannabis industry in terms of

1161
00:48:02,909 --> 00:48:08,969
contributing to algal blooms and other

1162
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:12,719
problems with our with our groundwater

1163
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:14,880
so if we can optimize or even limit the

1164
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,918
amount of nitrogen that we're using not

1165
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:19,139
only does it save us money but it's a

1166
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:20,818
lot better for the environment that kind

1167
00:48:19,139 --> 00:48:23,459
of leads me to my next question so if

1168
00:48:20,818 --> 00:48:26,338
you were a cannabis grower and you were

1169
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:29,398
looking to utilize soil testing and

1170
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:31,858
we're reusing your soil say in in the

1171
00:48:29,398 --> 00:48:34,078
ground or in raised beds how would you

1172
00:48:31,858 --> 00:48:36,688
go about what would your protocol be for

1173
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:38,860
that sort of a thing yeah you know what

1174
00:48:36,688 --> 00:48:41,679
I would do is you know at the

1175
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:44,380
at the end of the growing time I would

1176
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:46,779
obviously put all these soils in one

1177
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:50,050
place composite these soils all together

1178
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:52,960
really well and I would pull a soil

1179
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:56,080
sample or two and look at you know where

1180
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,179
our nutrient levels are at you know even

1181
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:01,559
run a standard soil analysis and see

1182
00:48:58,179 --> 00:49:04,599
where our organics at now where our base

1183
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:06,820
saturations are where our available

1184
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:09,069
nutrient levels are run the run these

1185
00:49:06,820 --> 00:49:11,950
tests get an idea where they're at and

1186
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:15,640
then now we're going to have a baseline

1187
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:17,469
of that soil after it's after it's been

1188
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:20,529
used and now that we could actually

1189
00:49:17,469 --> 00:49:23,289
rebuild that soil by knowing what our

1190
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:26,010
target nutrient levels are and soil

1191
00:49:23,289 --> 00:49:28,809
savvy is going to give you a general

1192
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:31,390
recommendation or guideline of how we

1193
00:49:28,809 --> 00:49:34,119
could do this we could come back and

1194
00:49:31,389 --> 00:49:37,389
once again introduce our biologicals and

1195
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:40,480
kind of rebuild this soil after we've

1196
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:43,000
already grown a crop in the soil so

1197
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:46,329
don't think about it just pre you know

1198
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:50,199
pre plant and in season but also after

1199
00:49:46,329 --> 00:49:51,670
season and recycling these soils so you

1200
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:54,879
can give me your comments on this but

1201
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:57,099
for me I like to know everything that's

1202
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:59,470
in the soil so I use that that may like

1203
00:49:57,099 --> 00:50:01,269
three tests at the end of the cycle to

1204
00:49:59,469 --> 00:50:03,369
find out all of what's still left in

1205
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:04,960
that soil and then that soil savvy test

1206
00:50:03,369 --> 00:50:06,670
can be taken at the same time as a way

1207
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,260
to see what's currently available for

1208
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:11,050
that plant if I were to plant right back

1209
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:13,900
into it and then I could amend that soil

1210
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:15,310
and retest prior to planting and I think

1211
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:18,309
what people need to keep in mind is they

1212
00:50:15,309 --> 00:50:19,960
think of soil testing as an expense but

1213
00:50:18,309 --> 00:50:23,139
we're talking about a really valuable

1214
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:25,840
crop here where it's all it could save

1215
00:50:23,139 --> 00:50:27,279
you tons of money down the road with

1216
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:31,030
such a high value crop you can't afford

1217
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:32,680
to have crop loss in in most cases with

1218
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:35,260
cannabis it's just it's too much money

1219
00:50:32,679 --> 00:50:37,059
throwing down the drain so spending you

1220
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:38,590
know 50 bucks a hundred dollars couple

1221
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:41,380
hundred dollars depending on your scale

1222
00:50:38,590 --> 00:50:42,960
on on the soil test to get you that

1223
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:45,970
information I think is really really

1224
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:47,650
important and one thing that you touched

1225
00:50:45,969 --> 00:50:49,839
on was you know mixing all that so all

1226
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,099
together in one place well a lot of our

1227
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:52,130
growers may be growing different

1228
00:50:51,099 --> 00:50:54,589
cultivars in

1229
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,480
in raised beds for example where you're

1230
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:58,010
not necessarily you're not necessarily

1231
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,920
going to be able to move that soil or

1232
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:03,230
Rehim ionize it what do you think about

1233
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:04,940
taking you know samples from different

1234
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:06,769
beds and then just using that as a

1235
00:51:04,940 --> 00:51:08,539
general guideline for where your soils

1236
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:10,429
at or do you think people should be

1237
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,440
sampling every bed if they're going to

1238
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:13,339
be slightly different where do you land

1239
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:15,320
on that topic

1240
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:17,390
I mean if you're managing each bed

1241
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:21,559
differently I think you'd want to sample

1242
00:51:17,389 --> 00:51:24,559
each bed alone if you're doing the same

1243
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:26,659
thing across multiple beds you can go

1244
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:29,000
ahead and just take soil cores or

1245
00:51:26,659 --> 00:51:31,039
portions of soil from each of those beds

1246
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:33,349
and then composite them together in a

1247
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:35,150
bucket with your hand get a good

1248
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:37,759
composite of that soil and that's going

1249
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,260
to give you a good representation of all

1250
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:41,330
of those beds but yeah if you're

1251
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:43,520
managing the beds differently for

1252
00:51:41,329 --> 00:51:46,639
different characteristics you're going

1253
00:51:43,519 --> 00:51:47,840
to want to test them individually and

1254
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:50,089
there's some good examples on how to

1255
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:52,190
take a soil sample online but a couple

1256
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:53,690
points I want to hint at is that you

1257
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:56,210
want to go down on at least six inches

1258
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:58,190
and it's important to use either you

1259
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,360
know I guess you could use your hand I

1260
00:51:58,190 --> 00:52:03,380
always used to you'd like to use a

1261
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:05,329
plastic shovel or a core sampler because

1262
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:08,119
if you use say for example a really a

1263
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:10,639
rusty old hand trowel you're potentially

1264
00:52:08,119 --> 00:52:11,929
adding a lot of iron to that soil sample

1265
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:13,400
so there's little things you want to

1266
00:52:11,929 --> 00:52:15,409
think about too when you're sampling and

1267
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:18,559
making sure that you're getting an

1268
00:52:15,409 --> 00:52:20,869
accurate mix or sample of your your

1269
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,480
given soil so that you can get a more

1270
00:52:20,869 --> 00:52:24,920
accurate result yeah that's a that's a

1271
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:27,019
great point you know you don't want to

1272
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,940
introduce other factors into your soil

1273
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:32,360
test that might throw it off such as a

1274
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:33,829
rusty you know soil probe or shovel you

1275
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:36,110
want to make sure that's clean because I

1276
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:41,029
could definitely throw off throw off

1277
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:43,519
your your analysis I think it's critical

1278
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:46,550
you know for for professionals that are

1279
00:52:43,519 --> 00:52:48,800
doing this all the time to invest in a

1280
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:52,010
soil probe they're not that expensive

1281
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:54,170
you can find them online very easily you

1282
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:56,900
know invest in a soil probe it's it's

1283
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:58,849
it's a critical tool I think to have in

1284
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:01,610
any curve anybody who's managing a

1285
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:03,349
cropping system and then you know as we

1286
00:53:01,610 --> 00:53:05,539
get into potted plants say we're in

1287
00:53:03,349 --> 00:53:08,179
season during the growing time

1288
00:53:05,539 --> 00:53:09,980
and we want to you know test like Midway

1289
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:11,929
you know through the season see where

1290
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,119
levels are you know you might want a

1291
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:16,399
smaller diameter probe that's not going

1292
00:53:14,119 --> 00:53:19,699
to pull as big of a core you know out of

1293
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:22,070
the pots but maybe take multiple take a

1294
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:24,649
core from multiple pots but we want a

1295
00:53:22,070 --> 00:53:26,450
smaller diameter core when we do that so

1296
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:30,650
we're not you know disrupting a ton of

1297
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:33,500
routing mass as we pull that soil sample

1298
00:53:30,650 --> 00:53:35,180
out of each of the pots yeah that's a

1299
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,769
really good point you know we have a at

1300
00:53:35,179 --> 00:53:39,409
work I have a course sampler and then I

1301
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:41,989
also have a compaction tool it's like it

1302
00:53:39,409 --> 00:53:43,549
looks like kind of like a super

1303
00:53:41,989 --> 00:53:45,799
scaled-down like I don't know maybe a

1304
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:48,140
jackhammer shape that you push down into

1305
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:50,060
soil and it tells you how much you know

1306
00:53:48,139 --> 00:53:51,710
psi are pressure you have as you go down

1307
00:53:50,059 --> 00:53:54,529
so you can see how much slow compaction

1308
00:53:51,710 --> 00:53:56,510
there's a lot of really fun you know

1309
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:58,340
little tools and gadgets out there that

1310
00:53:56,510 --> 00:54:00,830
can help you in analyzing your soil

1311
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:03,559
better and making you know actionable

1312
00:54:00,829 --> 00:54:05,900
decisions about how to manage your cell

1313
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:08,809
fertility and manager so better I might

1314
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,450
throw one other kind of idea or concept

1315
00:54:08,809 --> 00:54:14,989
in there to think about when your soil

1316
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:17,319
sampling we I mean in with the cannabis

1317
00:54:14,989 --> 00:54:20,779
stuff we really like to build that soil

1318
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:22,760
you know prior to the plant going in and

1319
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:25,340
get our guitar levels for most of our

1320
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:28,910
nutrients where they are and then as we

1321
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:32,120
go into planting and afterwards in

1322
00:54:28,909 --> 00:54:35,119
season we want to understand say maybe

1323
00:54:32,119 --> 00:54:37,130
we put some slow-release or some coded

1324
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,980
fertilizers or prills or some type of

1325
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:42,619
prills and in that pot we need to

1326
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:45,199
understand you know one if we have those

1327
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:47,389
prills in there when we're taking the

1328
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,819
soil sample because one of those prills

1329
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:52,579
can really throw off a soil sample so it

1330
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:54,800
could come back very skewed so the more

1331
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:57,170
we can build our soil up front and then

1332
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,300
if we need to test in season we don't

1333
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:02,510
have those big pearls and stuff in that

1334
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:03,800
in that pot we just want to avoid any of

1335
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:06,440
those type of things that are going to

1336
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:08,210
skew your data and it's usually pretty

1337
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:09,320
obvious when you hit those type of

1338
00:55:08,210 --> 00:55:11,389
things

1339
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:13,400
you're gonna get you know just huge

1340
00:55:11,389 --> 00:55:15,980
numbers that are you know off the chart

1341
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,500
or any any scale because one pril of

1342
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:20,780
anything can really throw off

1343
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,409
test so you know be aware of your

1344
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:26,690
management system where you've placed

1345
00:55:23,409 --> 00:55:29,480
nutrient and try to avoid you know those

1346
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:31,909
large those prills if you can but I

1347
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:34,010
think building the soil out front is

1348
00:55:31,909 --> 00:55:36,769
really going to give you know the best

1349
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:40,340
results for most of our macronutrients

1350
00:55:36,769 --> 00:55:42,259
you might manage nitrogen in season a

1351
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,240
little bit a little bit differently but

1352
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,880
I think building that soil upfront is

1353
00:55:44,239 --> 00:55:48,709
really key when you say prills I see we

1354
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,990
talk about something like Osmocote yeah

1355
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:52,880
that's sort of its product yeah then you

1356
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:54,799
know we're big proponents on this

1357
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:57,858
podcast of getting people to go organic

1358
00:55:54,800 --> 00:56:00,769
to really build their soil and consider

1359
00:55:57,858 --> 00:56:02,509
their biggest resource on their farm so

1360
00:56:00,769 --> 00:56:05,139
a lot of what you're saying just really

1361
00:56:02,510 --> 00:56:07,580
speaks to sort of our philosophy around

1362
00:56:05,139 --> 00:56:10,460
farming and gardening and cannabis

1363
00:56:07,579 --> 00:56:12,049
cultivation in general again I just want

1364
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:14,539
to say thank you for taking the time

1365
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:16,039
today to chat about soil testing and

1366
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:18,259
I'll be sure to put up some more

1367
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:20,570
information including that pH

1368
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:24,550
availability chart some sample test

1369
00:56:20,570 --> 00:56:28,309
results and links to the soil savvy test

1370
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:29,930
and website information as well as some

1371
00:56:28,309 --> 00:56:33,108
good resources that people want to dive

1372
00:56:29,929 --> 00:56:34,759
further down into all of this soil

1373
00:56:33,108 --> 00:56:37,819
testing and in books they can check out

1374
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:39,500
so yeah thanks for your time Chris I

1375
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:43,150
really appreciate it and look forward to

1376
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:43,150
talking again soon thank you ted

1377
00:56:46,489 --> 00:56:50,999
that was chris boardman with yuna best

1378
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:52,438
international makers of the soil savvy

1379
00:56:50,998 --> 00:56:54,718
test kit which we currently have

1380
00:56:52,438 --> 00:56:56,639
available on our website for only $30

1381
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:58,380
with free shipping the kits come with a

1382
00:56:56,639 --> 00:57:00,179
self-addressed envelope with prepaid

1383
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,798
postage so it's super easy to take a

1384
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:03,838
sample and send it into the lab for

1385
00:57:01,798 --> 00:57:05,639
results I encourage everyone to look

1386
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,619
into soil testing as a way of improving

1387
00:57:05,639 --> 00:57:09,239
both the fertility of your soil but also

1388
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:11,699
as a way of increasing yield and

1389
00:57:09,239 --> 00:57:13,228
reducing plant stress some places like

1390
00:57:11,699 --> 00:57:15,449
King County here in Washington State

1391
00:57:13,228 --> 00:57:17,068
offer three free soil tests to every

1392
00:57:15,449 --> 00:57:18,838
homeowner and while these tests are

1393
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:20,548
basic and information they give you it

1394
00:57:18,838 --> 00:57:22,048
is a good starting point and your local

1395
00:57:20,548 --> 00:57:24,449
