pests we see in cannabis and what some

46
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:50,000
good management options are for

47
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,960

biobee now and i asked suzanne who to

56
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:08,878
talk to over at biobee and uh

57
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,719
she mentioned your name so uh can you

58
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:14,079
tell me a little bit about yourself um

59
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:16,800
and then we'll dive into the podcast

60
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
all right be happy to so yeah my name's

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,160
steven arthurs

62
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,319
and i'm with a company called biobee

63
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:26,400
originally based out of israel

64
00:02:24,318 --> 00:02:28,399
and

65
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,640
we now have a subsidiary in the us by

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,360
the usa and

67
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:35,518
yeah i've been with them for

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,720
about three years now

69
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,719
and prior to biobee i was

70
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,719
actually working in research for for a

71
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,878
number of years most of my career

72
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,560
so it's been a bit of a career change

73
00:02:44,878 --> 00:02:48,399
and

74
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,519
you know i was able to work with a lot

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,400
of

76
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,400
these beneficial organisms um

77
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,840
you know in the lab and in the field and

78
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:57,519
now i'm sort of

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,319
in the um

80
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,759
very much in the uh the operational side

81
00:03:00,318 --> 00:03:03,759
of things seeing them actually used in

82
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:07,039
practice so it's been it's been an

83
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:08,959
interesting uh full circle

84
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:11,679
well i'm so excited to be able to start

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,759
offering uh biobee insects to our

86
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,519
customer base one of the things that

87
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,719
suzanne has drilled into my head is that

88
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:18,959
you know

89
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:21,680
insects can't develop resistance to

90
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,598
being eaten to other insects moving away

91
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,760
from pesticides or reducing the amount

92
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:28,158
of pesticides we have offers a lot of

93
00:03:25,759 --> 00:03:30,079
benefits um

94
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,239
i i'm really excited to be able to you

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,040
know dive into this a little further

96
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,680
today i really wanted to get into uh

97
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:40,239
some of the main pests that we're seeing

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,400
in cannabis and what some of those uh

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,560
bio control options are

100
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
and uh you know kind of talk about how

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,000
they work and what they do and give

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
people a little more information there

103
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,360
so

104
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:56,158
uh you know why don't we start with um

105
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,080
you know just a a classic issue that i'm

106
00:03:56,158 --> 00:04:00,479
sure everyone's had over the years which

107
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
is spider mites you know two spotted

108
00:04:00,479 --> 00:04:03,919
spider mite how do we

109
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
how do we uh offer you know begin to

110
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:08,958
treat that from a um

111
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,878
bio control perspective

112
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,080
right right well

113
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:17,439
yeah spider mites are probably the most

114
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,959
common pests that you see we've seen in

115
00:04:17,439 --> 00:04:20,719
indoor grows

116
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,399
and uh

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,360
they can become really bad i've seen

118
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,239
them

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,800
really um devastate the crop and once

120
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,560
they get bad they can be quite hard to

121
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,240
to get rid of and i've seen people

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,040
struggling with them

123
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
so

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,040
luckily um if you do things the right

125
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,800
way the spider mites are not actually

126
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,360
that hard to control

127
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,918
the the the key really is is to be

128
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,680
preventive and to

129
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:48,319
once your crop is clean it's relatively

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,400
easy to keep it clean um it's when you

131
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:51,759
have a large problem that needs clearing

132
00:04:50,399 --> 00:04:53,120
up where things get a little bit more

133
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,560
difficult

134
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:58,639
but but in general the the

135
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,399
several species of beneficials

136
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,639
uh seem to be

137
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:04,319
relatively effective and reliable for

138
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,000
for spider mite control

139
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:08,959
and they're primarily the predatory

140
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,759
mites and so i've seen

141
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:13,599
a lot of uses of predatory mites

142
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,080
probably the most commonly used one

143
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
would be phytophys per similar

144
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:19,359
seems to do quite well on on cannabis

145
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:21,038
and hemp

146
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,600
but there's a few others as well that

147
00:05:21,038 --> 00:05:27,279
also will feed on spider mites and

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
can be effective in their own rights

149
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:31,918
so you mentioned preventative and also

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,160
uh a challenge around if it gets really

151
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:35,279
bad so one of the things

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,880
you know a lot of this is me just

153
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:39,038
regurgitating things i've learned from

154
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,800
suzanne over the years is that if it

155
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:41,839
gets really bad and i'm picturing like

156
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,038
webbing

157
00:05:41,839 --> 00:05:44,879
in the case of

158
00:05:43,038 --> 00:05:46,560
spider mites um

159
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:49,038
we may want to consider a knock back

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,038
spray some sort of oil like you know

161
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:55,279
suffolk x or something and then follow

162
00:05:51,038 --> 00:05:57,918
that up um after the the appropriate

163
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,198
interval with a bio control does that

164
00:05:57,918 --> 00:06:01,038
sound like a good approach or like you

165
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,840
know persimilis in this case does that

166
00:06:01,038 --> 00:06:05,599
sound like a good approach

167
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,758
yeah yeah typically once you start

168
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,919
getting webbing then

169
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,240
for now first of all can work on webbing

170
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:13,519
it can navigate the the spider mite webs

171
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,079
whereas other

172
00:06:13,519 --> 00:06:16,879
most other beneficial uh insects and

173
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:18,000
mice

174
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:20,879
can't

175
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,720
so but but but because you need a large

176
00:06:20,879 --> 00:06:24,800
number and because once you start

177
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,880
getting webbing the risk of damage

178
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,478
immediate damage is very high

179
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:30,879
um

180
00:06:28,478 --> 00:06:32,639
most most people at that point would try

181
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:35,120
to bring the numbers down

182
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,439
through through the use of sprays

183
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,519
um so whether they be soaps or oils

184
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:41,439
would be the most common

185
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:42,959
common type and there's various types

186
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:45,038
that you can use

187
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,478
um so yeah that that would be most

188
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,839
common um

189
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:50,000
that can be can be a little bit

190
00:06:47,839 --> 00:06:51,598
challenging because the the website can

191
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,918
actually protect the spider mites to a

192
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:55,598
certain extent from sprays as well

193
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:57,839
and so you really need to come in with a

194
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:59,439
pretty high volume and you need to come

195
00:06:57,839 --> 00:07:01,119
in with um

196
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:03,519
a good coverage

197
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,000
and i have actually seen um some

198
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:06,799
operations uh coming vacuums and try to

199
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,959
suck

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,439
suck them up off the plants and it's

201
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:13,839
quite time consuming but they try to do

202
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,959
that as a way to get rid of those webs

203
00:07:13,839 --> 00:07:17,119
and some of those

204
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:18,000
very high populations

205
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,918
um

206
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,160
and in some cases you know people will

207
00:07:19,918 --> 00:07:24,560
rogue plants if they don't

208
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,479
necessarily need them and and they want

209
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,399
to just kind of

210
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,680
be very proactive they will get rid of

211
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:31,439
some plants but because of the value of

212
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,800
cannabis plants often that's not always

213
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:34,319
an option

214
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,520
but yes once you brought the numbers

215
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,120
down

216
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,879
um that would be the time to come in

217
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,759
with a buyer program

218
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:42,399
um

219
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:45,120
you releasing your predatory mics and

220
00:07:42,399 --> 00:07:46,399
some of your predatory insects as well

221
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,840
sometimes those are used for spider

222
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:49,598
mites and then you really probably want

223
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:52,399
to come in with a high rate

224
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:53,519
um higher rate higher frequency at least

225
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:56,079
initially

226
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:58,159
uh and so your problems uh and under

227
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:00,478
control and then pay attention to your

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,720
new crop coming on because one of the

229
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:05,360
spider mites do get around through being

230
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,080
moved from workers and being moved from

231
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,759
pruning equipment and and um

232
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:11,839
you know so they can get around so you

233
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,280
really want to be extra vigilant once

234
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:15,519
you have a source

235
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:17,119
extra vigilant on your

236
00:08:15,519 --> 00:08:19,598
surrounding

237
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,598
tables or even in your surrounding rooms

238
00:08:19,598 --> 00:08:24,319
that your spider mites are

239
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:26,399
are not transferring and you really want

240
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,479
to get that population down to the point

241
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:30,638
where things are clean and then you can

242
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,918
go back to a more um

243
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,959
economical

244
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:36,799
rate of application

245
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,879
yeah and in an ideal world we're

246
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:41,918
scouting and catching these things early

247
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:43,599
so they don't get to that stage and

248
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:45,360
realistically when it comes to

249
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,278
application rates

250
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,200
a maintenance application or preventive

251
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,039
application rate would be significantly

252
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,000
lower than

253
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:53,360
um

254
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,799
i guess a treatment

255
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:57,120
application

256
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:59,039
would that be correct

257
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,759
yeah yeah i mean

258
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:04,159
there's a wide range of different

259
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:05,278
ranges of rates that are used

260
00:09:04,159 --> 00:09:07,360
and

261
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:08,639
but the most economical rate would be a

262
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,879
preventative rate so when you're

263
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:12,639
basically coming in you're treating your

264
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:15,039
crop that's pretty clean and your goal

265
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:17,039
is just to keep it clean to take out

266
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,919
those initial populations that are left

267
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:19,120
over

268
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:20,719
or those

269
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,639
or those um

270
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,160
isolated populations that either coming

271
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:25,838
in from outside

272
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:27,199
coming from another room and you're

273
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,399
basically preventing them from

274
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,399
developing

275
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,159
so that way you could definitely reduce

276
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,919
your your rate down

277
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:37,199
um and uh and obviously be more economic

278
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:38,879
at that stage

279
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,560
but yeah if you're controlling an

280
00:09:38,879 --> 00:09:42,799
existing population

281
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:44,799
then yes you need to you need to use the

282
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:46,399
rates and most of the companies that

283
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:48,159
provide information

284
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:51,200
will give different ranges whether it's

285
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:52,639
a curative rate or preventative rate and

286
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,560
you can just you can talk to your

287
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:56,639
suppliers or your distributors and they

288
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,399
should be able to advise you

289
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,600
um you know given the stage of your

290
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,839
plants

291
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,278
and given your planting density and how

292
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,839
severe your problem is you know what

293
00:10:03,278 --> 00:10:06,799
might be a reasonable rate to work with

294
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,360
um

295
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:10,879
depending on your situation

296
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,720
great now

297
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,000
is there anything else that persimilis

298
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,839
is also

299
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,759
effective against in terms of cannabis

300
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
pests and can you talk a little bit

301
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,039
about

302
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:24,240
you know how we would apply it like the

303
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:24,240
actual application itself

304
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,320
right so persimmons is a bit of a

305
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,078
one-trick pony it really only feeds on

306
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,000
spider mites and a few

307
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,120
closely related spider mites in the

308
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,399
family

309
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,519
uh it does not control russet mic

310
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,440
it does not control um

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,759
any other any other pests that you might

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,519
have won't control broad mice

313
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:48,078
so most most

314
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:50,480
most ipm programs will have a range of

315
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:51,519
different beneficials to control

316
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,519
um

317
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,639
the range of issues that they're dealing

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,560
with

319
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,039
so yeah so persimilis really is just for

320
00:10:56,559 --> 00:11:01,759
spider mites

321
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:04,078
and so if you're dealing with uh for

322
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,039
example if you're dealing with um

323
00:11:04,078 --> 00:11:09,359
aphids or thrips or white flies or

324
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:11,679
other pests it's important to have a

325
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,200
combination program that tackles all of

326
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:14,879
the issues that you're seeing we can

327
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
talk a little bit more about

328
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:19,360
about that

329
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:21,199
absolutely so how would i how how would

330
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
i go about applying for simulus in terms

331
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,278
of best practice

332
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:27,359
right right okay

333
00:11:25,278 --> 00:11:28,799
so so for someone else

334
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959
basically comes in several different

335
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:32,559
formats that it comes as a loose format

336
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:35,518
in in a bottle

337
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:38,000
typically in a in a vermiculite carrier

338
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,519
um it also comes in a sachet a slow

339
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,200
release factory now which is something

340
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,200
that buyer b carries

341
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,560
and this is often preferred for moms and

342
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,160
flowers and

343
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,000
plants in the later stage of grow where

344
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,240
you really want to try to avoid

345
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,839
contaminating your your plant with

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:56,480
anything that could

347
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,399
that could cause a contamination um in

348
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,680
those cases the sachets are just hung on

349
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,879
the plants

350
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:04,319
and it also comes in a a nipple form

351
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:06,320
which you can just touch to the plant

352
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,360
and release the prostimulus directly

353
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,360
there and actually unlike that

354
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,919
that is quite time consuming though so

355
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:17,039
you have to factor the time involved in

356
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:18,159
going around to every single plant

357
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:20,078
um

358
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:23,679
but yeah those are those are the the

359
00:12:20,078 --> 00:12:25,759
basic formats uh for persimilis and in

360
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:28,879
terms of how they're applied

361
00:12:25,759 --> 00:12:31,039
uh for most smaller grow operations

362
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:32,639
um whether you're using the bottles

363
00:12:31,039 --> 00:12:35,838
you're basically just

364
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,519
inoculating the plant with a with a

365
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:40,639
with one or two small doses of the

366
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,799
persimilis directly onto the leaves

367
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,959
um often that will be done every week or

368
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,559
sometimes every other week depending on

369
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:48,239
on your pressure

370
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:49,359
the sachets

371
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,919
they

372
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,079
they come in two forms one is a quick

373
00:12:51,919 --> 00:12:56,639
release form which you're putting on

374
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:59,759
plants that already have spider mites

375
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:01,120
and and then a slower release form

376
00:12:59,759 --> 00:13:03,439
which which you can use more

377
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,959
preventively because they'll release for

378
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,000
about two weeks

379
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:07,838
um

380
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,639
and then um

381
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
the

382
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,200
um

383
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:13,279
the the

384
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,200
the other uh types of protein might have

385
00:13:13,278 --> 00:13:17,679
used for spider mites there's one called

386
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,560
uh neocytose californicus that's

387
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,638
probably the second most commonly used

388
00:13:20,559 --> 00:13:25,599
uh predatory mite for spider mite

389
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:28,079
control it comes in the same formats

390
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,040
basically we directly release from from

391
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:31,439
a bottle

392
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:33,519
or from a slow release sachet

393
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,680
and

394
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,320
and again you know that that choice

395
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:40,239
typically embeds in veg it's cheaper

396
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,839
it's it's often quicker

397
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
to release them directly from bottles

398
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,760
and veg and then

399
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:48,240
um people will often move to the sachets

400
00:13:45,759 --> 00:13:49,439
once the the plant goes into flower

401
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,959
because then

402
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,560
you know the plants bigger there's more

403
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:56,078
area to cover and there's more concern

404
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:58,559
about contamination so so often times on

405
00:13:56,078 --> 00:14:00,958
mums and on flour the sachets are

406
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:04,319
probably the most common form i see

407
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:06,638
being used and then in veg

408
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:09,519
loose material from a bottle

409
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,440
and one thing i do also do see

410
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,078
with some of the larger operations is

411
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,720
that because of the amount of time taken

412
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:18,719
to do a treatment so some growers will

413
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
actually mix their persimulus often

414
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,320
they'll combine it with other bios and

415
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,240
they'll mix it together

416
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,399
and then they'll put it out with a

417
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,519
blower and that allows you to basically

418
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
treat

419
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:31,120
a much larger area

420
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
quickly you're not treating individual

421
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,159
plants you're treating

422
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:37,759
um several rows at the same time

423
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:39,120
and because these predatory mice are

424
00:14:37,759 --> 00:14:41,360
relatively mobile for similarities

425
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,440
probably the most mobile of them all

426
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,120
i really can

427
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,279
it really can crawl along the bench and

428
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,879
it can climb up plants and it can even

429
00:14:47,278 --> 00:14:51,360
move between plants

430
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:53,120
so it's uh often times in the larger

431
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,039
operations

432
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,560
putting them out with a blower would be

433
00:14:55,039 --> 00:15:00,879
a technique i see a lot

434
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:03,119
are there any situations where we may

435
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:05,198
make a preference for california kiss

436
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,679
over persimilis with

437
00:15:05,198 --> 00:15:08,879
spider mites

438
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,399
you know there's a lot of talks about

439
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:12,480
this and and everyone has their own

440
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,720
opinion

441
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,120
there are some biological differences

442
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,440
for sure between them and there may be

443
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,000
some cost differences as well depending

444
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,399
on your supplier the reality is i think

445
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,519
you can use either

446
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,759
and

447
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
you can you can use them individually or

448
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:31,679
in combination

449
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,039
i tend to find that pristimonious is

450
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,359
just probably a little bit more

451
00:15:33,039 --> 00:15:37,759
aggressive it does feed on a higher

452
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,399
number of spider mites it's going to be

453
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,919
in most cases more effective

454
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,839
when you have an existing population

455
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,039
you're trying to bring down

456
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,120
um

457
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:48,799
the only issue with presumably it's a

458
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,600
little bit less tolerant of lower

459
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:53,278
humidities so if you do grow dry if

460
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,278
you're

461
00:15:53,278 --> 00:15:57,039
have a have a humid you know an average

462
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,958
humidity let's say

463
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:00,480
60 or less

464
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:02,399
uh persimmons may not be able to

465
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,560
establish very well in that situation

466
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,039
and you may find if you're growing dry

467
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:08,958
and you can be preventative californicus

468
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,078
may be a better bet for you

469
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:12,399
um

470
00:16:10,078 --> 00:16:15,120
but for the most part really you can

471
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,879
potentially use use either or or both of

472
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,240
them together like i say just for

473
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:20,320
simulus is just a little bit more

474
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,159
aggressive has a slightly higher spider

475
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,000
mic consumption rate and it's a little

476
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:25,838
bit more mobile it's a little bit better

477
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,720
able to move around

478
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:30,959
than california

479
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,120
okay and you could always i assume do a

480
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,119
combination to really just cover your

481
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,519
bases

482
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,799
i i guess as well

483
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
you can i mean some people mentioned

484
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:42,958
that california because freedom for

485
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
similar flags uh which is true

486
00:16:42,958 --> 00:16:48,638
but for the most part you're you know

487
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:50,639
your mass inoculating these bugs and

488
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:52,320
um these sort of interactions that you

489
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:55,120
do see with one maybe feeding a little

490
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,800
bit on the other they don't tend to be

491
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,959
i don't see them generally jeopardizing

492
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:00,958
your bio control program for the most

493
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:05,038
part they they can still they can still

494
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:07,359
be used together i see that a lot so um

495
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:09,679
that that's an option but

496
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:11,599
um and the other advantage i suppose in

497
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,919
california because the sachets do last a

498
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,558
little bit longer so some people will

499
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,799
just use a like a swarovski and the

500
00:17:16,558 --> 00:17:22,000
californica sachet mix that seems to be

501
00:17:18,798 --> 00:17:23,759
very common and that covers um

502
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,759
that will cover spider mites and it will

503
00:17:23,759 --> 00:17:26,959
also cover thrips control of course

504
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,640
because

505
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,080
and and white flight control as well

506
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,759
because that's

507
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:34,079
those are two pests first they seem to

508
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:35,919
do it to do a good job on so again that

509
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:37,359
would be a combination of

510
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,160
californicus

511
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:41,759
and uh and swirsky put together on the

512
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,519
same plan

513
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:45,759
yeah now if we were outdoors would we

514
00:17:43,519 --> 00:17:48,480
want to lean more towards californicus

515
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:50,079
due to its ability to survive in greater

516
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,000
environmental ranges

517
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,480
or do you still are you still using

518
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,480
persimilis outdoors with certain crops

519
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,600
um so in florida there's not too much

520
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:03,199
outdoor production of cannabis so it

521
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,159
seems to be a bit more

522
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,960
of of hemp but um

523
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:12,000
but yes you can like the the most

524
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,600
important thing is is to look at the

525
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,079
the environmental conditions if it's

526
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,119
particularly dry where you are

527
00:18:16,079 --> 00:18:19,519
um

528
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:21,038
then if you want to take some advice

529
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:24,160
about whether it's going to be too dry

530
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,679
for proper similar and if it is then

531
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,679
yes you probably want to use the

532
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,679
californicus or

533
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:31,600
some growers also like to use ander sony

534
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,000
i forgot to mention that one that's

535
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:35,199
another one which is uh commonly used on

536
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
cannabis for

537
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,919
spider mite control

538
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,440
it has similar characteristics to

539
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,559
californicus

540
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,840
um

541
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,160
now both

542
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,279
andersoni swersky

543
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:51,759
and californicus can also feed on pollen

544
00:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,918
and so in some situations if outdoors

545
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:56,400
you know pollen occurs naturally

546
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:59,360
they may do you know it blows in and

547
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
they may do a better job on establishing

548
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:02,479
on plants that are pretty clean because

549
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,400
they're able to survive longer without

550
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,759
food and they're also able to feed on

551
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,160
things like pollen which which

552
00:19:05,759 --> 00:19:09,119
presumably is not able to do

553
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,919
so

554
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:13,199
having a longer uh duration of survival

555
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,600
on the plants

556
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,960
um can be an advantage in certain

557
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:19,359
situations

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,279
um it just depends you know i personally

559
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:23,359
i find that for stimulus

560
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:25,279
it doesn't live very long if it doesn't

561
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:27,678
have food but it does a pretty good job

562
00:19:25,279 --> 00:19:29,759
at knocking your spider mite populations

563
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,840
down to a very low level even

564
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:33,759
eradicating them locally so

565
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:36,079
you really have a bit sometimes have a

566
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,679
little bit of a breather time before the

567
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:39,439
calf before the spider mites will

568
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,759
reestablish and so

569
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
you don't necessarily need to have life

570
00:19:41,759 --> 00:19:45,599
proof similars on the plants at all

571
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:47,119
times as long as you're inoculating your

572
00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,199
plants frequently enough that the spider

573
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:50,719
mites can't get a foothold

574
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,240
so

575
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
yeah i don't really think there's one

576
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,240
size fits all here i think different

577
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,599
people have different preferences but i

578
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,200
think i mentioned some of the things you

579
00:19:57,599 --> 00:20:02,399
need to look out for when you're

580
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,400
deciding which predatory mice to use

581
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
no that's great information i mean

582
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,360
that's one of the things about

583
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:09,439
biocontrols that i think people struggle

584
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:11,519
with and why we need

585
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,519
experts is because it is a little more

586
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:15,279
subtle there's a lot of variables to

587
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:16,960
consider when making decisions so this

588
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:18,798
is

589
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:20,880
this is great so you know you kind of

590
00:20:18,798 --> 00:20:21,918
covered persimilis in pretty good detail

591
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,720
um

592
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,440
and also talked about californicus now

593
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,640
you mentioned californicus also has some

594
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,600
suppression of uh broad mites maybe we

595
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,600
could talk a little bit about broad

596
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:36,079
mites as a transition into another

597
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:38,639
target past

598
00:20:36,079 --> 00:20:40,720
yeah yeah so broad mics are not as

599
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:43,120
common as the problems of spider mites

600
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,519
but they certainly um

601
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:47,199
they certainly do get on on cannabis and

602
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:48,400
they're they can be a little bit more

603
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:50,319
insidious because they're kind of a

604
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,159
little bit smaller they're a little bit

605
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:53,439
more cryptic you know often they'll sort

606
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,600
of hide

607
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,360
um in the growing

608
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,119
portions of the plant or they run along

609
00:20:57,359 --> 00:21:00,639
the mid vein

610
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:01,599
and when they first get in they're not

611
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,280
so

612
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:05,678
easy to see you do want to look out for

613
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:07,599
the symptoms on the plant they can cause

614
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,120
crinkling and deformation on the on the

615
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,399
young parts of the plant so you're

616
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:12,959
probably going to see the symptoms of

617
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,400
bromides before you actually see them

618
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,440
um

619
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,000
but yes luckily broad mites are not too

620
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,320
hard to control um

621
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,480
a lot of growers i think with cannabis

622
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:25,839
they find it useful to in their program

623
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,679
to include something that's going to

624
00:21:25,839 --> 00:21:30,158
feed on broadband even if they don't

625
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:32,159
necessarily have broad mites um you

626
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,960
don't want them and

627
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,520
some of the predatory mites um swarovski

628
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,798
is pretty effective at broad mice

629
00:21:37,519 --> 00:21:40,798
um

630
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,679
uh californicus also can feed on broad

631
00:21:40,798 --> 00:21:43,918
mites

632
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:45,038
so having something in there in your

633
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,038
program

634
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,640
that will um be able to take control of

635
00:21:47,038 --> 00:21:51,279
world mice before they become a problem

636
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:52,799
is a good idea

637
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:54,879
great and is the application for

638
00:21:52,798 --> 00:21:57,759
californicus similar to persimilis are

639
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:00,880
there any differences there

640
00:21:57,759 --> 00:22:02,000
for you know these nights in general

641
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:05,120
um

642
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,798
no not not not really um they

643
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:09,199
the the formats

644
00:22:06,798 --> 00:22:10,879
uh different suppliers will will have

645
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,440
different formats but

646
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
but most of them come in uh a range of

647
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,279
different bottle sizes sometimes there's

648
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,360
differences in concentration so

649
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:21,519
you may have um

650
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:22,879
you you want to look at the the

651
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:24,000
when you're when you're planning your

652
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
program you want to look at the

653
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,240
different

654
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,720
bottle sizes and the different

655
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,319
concentrations and

656
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,919
if you if you want to put on a

657
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:33,519
relatively high rate you want to get a

658
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,559
fairly concentrated bottle so that

659
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:36,639
you're not

660
00:22:34,558 --> 00:22:39,678
having to put a lot of extra carrier on

661
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,679
the plants which is not necessary

662
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:43,280
on the flip side if you're if you're

663
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:45,440
trying to

664
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,879
apply to plants that are spaced and

665
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,400
you've got a large area to cover and

666
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,840
you're going to use a blower

667
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,080
then you want to make sure you've got

668
00:22:49,839 --> 00:22:54,558
enough um volume

669
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:56,079
to distribute the the mites you want

670
00:22:54,558 --> 00:22:57,359
sufficiently so you may need to use a

671
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:59,038
larger bottle or a slightly less

672
00:22:57,359 --> 00:23:00,959
concentrated form

673
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:03,119
um so yeah there's a range of different

674
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,600
sizes um

675
00:23:03,119 --> 00:23:09,279
i like i say i do find that that a lot

676
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:10,798
of cannabis growers like the sachets

677
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,639
for various reasons they're a little bit

678
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:14,240
more expensive so i work a lot with

679
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,360
ornamental growers and they're always

680
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,038
you know very very price conscious

681
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:22,240
and the sachets is the more expensive

682
00:23:19,038 --> 00:23:24,000
way to apply the same number of mites

683
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,000
but in cannabis because of the value of

684
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,759
the crop

685
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,200
that's not necessarily so much of an

686
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,960
issue and so

687
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,880
in situations where

688
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:36,720
having essentially is advantageous and

689
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:39,520
so certainly in moms and in flower then

690
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,679
you know a few extra cents per for

691
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,558
per plant for applying essentially is

692
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:47,679
not not really a big deal

693
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:51,759
yeah so the sachets make the application

694
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,120
simpler they um may give longer levels

695
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:54,240
you correct me if i say anything wrong

696
00:23:53,119 --> 00:23:57,038
here

697
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:00,000
longer time intervals of prevention

698
00:23:57,038 --> 00:24:02,480
depending on the type of sachet and they

699
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,880
also keep any sort of carrier like

700
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,360
vermiculite off of our

701
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,200
trichomes in this case is there any

702
00:24:07,359 --> 00:24:12,000
other advantages to sachets that i'm

703
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,640
missing here or something that i

704
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,798
may have misspoke on

705
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,038
no so the yeah the main advantages would

706
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:20,240
be um the the

707
00:24:19,038 --> 00:24:22,480
the

708
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,880
extra time of release so

709
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,038
in the case of things like californicus

710
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,559
and conhumerus and swarsky most

711
00:24:27,038 --> 00:24:30,879
saturdays typically will give you a

712
00:24:28,558 --> 00:24:32,879
month of release

713
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,880
if if they're in a humid situation you

714
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
can get up to six weeks

715
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,520
um

716
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,400
and um so yeah a lot longer duration

717
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:43,440
um lack of lack of the carrier on the

718
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,600
crop

719
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:47,278
um and also of course once the fat is on

720
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:49,199
the plant most sachets have a date on

721
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:50,319
them so you can see which plants have

722
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,240
been treated

723
00:24:50,319 --> 00:24:54,798
um when you're applying a small amount

724
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
of carrier on a leaf that that may blow

725
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,720
off or drop off

726
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,798
you know the next within a few days

727
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,200
unless you happen to keep records or no

728
00:25:00,798 --> 00:25:04,720
uh it's if you don't have that immediate

729
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,720
um

730
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
ability to go to a plan and determine

731
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:10,720
when exactly when everything was applied

732
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,278
so that would be um

733
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,798
that would be another uh advantage of

734
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:17,278
the other one of course is if you are

735
00:25:14,798 --> 00:25:19,119
spraying and i know a lot of growers do

736
00:25:17,278 --> 00:25:21,839
still when they're using buyers they

737
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:24,479
still like to come in and spray

738
00:25:21,839 --> 00:25:26,079
sometimes perhaps more than they need to

739
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,759
but what keep in mind when you're

740
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,839
spraying

741
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:32,640
even if you're spraying soft materials

742
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:34,480
like like uh soaps and oils these are

743
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,880
still i'm gonna be killing your your

744
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:38,159
predatory mics you know they they

745
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,159
they're killing your soft body

746
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,600
beneficials as well as your pests in

747
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,880
these situations where you're spraying

748
00:25:41,599 --> 00:25:45,599
them directly

749
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,440
and of course the sachet is generally a

750
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:49,119
waterproof and so

751
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,880
anything that's still inside the sachet

752
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:53,278
when you're sprayed and comes out

753
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,480
subsequently once your spray is dried

754
00:25:53,278 --> 00:25:56,558
um

755
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:59,440
that can be a better way to combine

756
00:25:56,558 --> 00:26:01,359
sprays and buyers is the food you use

757
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,880
disgusting

758
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:04,719
yeah that's a great point and also a

759
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,880
reminder to folks to make sure that what

760
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,839
they're spraying um

761
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,720
works well with bio with

762
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:12,240
beneficials

763
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,240
you know i know suzanne's a big fan of

764
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,599
stuff oil x

765
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,440
because it doesn't have a lot of

766
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:19,959
residual effect on the plant and you can

767
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,320
your beneficials can

768
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,360
re-re-inoculate pretty quickly into a

769
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:27,759
space um so

770
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:31,119
yeah she she also mentions on the on the

771
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:33,359
flip side that neem oil for example may

772
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:35,199
deter beneficials from re-inoculating

773
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:36,158
right away so

774
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,679
just something to think about when

775
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,679
you're thinking about what to spray

776
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:43,120
getting back to though

777
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:45,519
the

778
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:48,079
you know you mentioned californicus

779
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:49,440
will work with two spotted also with

780
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,278
broad mites

781
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,759
are there any other

782
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:55,440
target species for for californicus

783
00:26:53,759 --> 00:26:56,798
before or anything else for treating

784
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,080
broad mites that we want to talk about

785
00:26:56,798 --> 00:27:02,480
before we move on to another pest

786
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,319
uh yeah so so one thing we should

787
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,079
probably talk about oh by the way before

788
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:08,158
i forget you may you made a great point

789
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:10,879
with the sprays and suzanne's point

790
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,159
about neem oil which can be repellent is

791
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,278
well taken

792
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,520
um

793
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:16,880
if you are going to be spraying and

794
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:18,398
using buyers

795
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,799
it's very important that you do it in

796
00:27:18,398 --> 00:27:23,119
the right order you want to spray first

797
00:27:20,798 --> 00:27:25,038
release buyers subsequently not the

798
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:27,678
other way around um

799
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:29,119
just keep that in mind but um yeah broad

800
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,840
might um

801
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:34,239
two of the common uh solutions for

802
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:35,759
broadband would probably be uh two

803
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,240
species of fertility might that would be

804
00:27:35,759 --> 00:27:40,720
your swarovski and your humerus

805
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:42,640
um these are both they look very similar

806
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,000
you know you can't tell them apart by

807
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,278
looking at them but

808
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,640
they they both broadly do the same thing

809
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:49,839
um

810
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,200
i swear it needs a little bit more

811
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:53,519
flexible but

812
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,080
they both will work for broad mics

813
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,398
and just keep in mind um if you're using

814
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:00,398
your your your bios

815
00:27:58,398 --> 00:28:02,319
um and you're using either swarovski

816
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,599
humerus it's really important to keep in

817
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:06,000
mind that they have different

818
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:08,879
temperature

819
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:12,960
activity profiles so swarsky is a more

820
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,159
uh sort of tropically adapted species

821
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,880
it

822
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,799
can handle higher temperatures cucumbers

823
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,760
is one that's used a lot more further

824
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,158
north

825
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:24,079
um and and used in the winter and the

826
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:26,159
south perhaps it's

827
00:28:24,079 --> 00:28:27,519
it does a good job if your temperatures

828
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,278
are going to be in the range of sort of

829
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:31,519
50 degrees to

830
00:28:29,278 --> 00:28:33,359
upper seventies uh if you humorous

831
00:28:31,519 --> 00:28:35,200
that's a sweet spot it will be active it

832
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:36,959
will control your world mites

833
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,440
if your average daytime temperature is

834
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:41,679
going to be in your 80s and your 90s

835
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,640
um then yes you definitely want to be

836
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,640
using

837
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,320
sweersky because that one is going to be

838
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:48,320
better adapted to the warmer conditions

839
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:50,879
so you definitely want to keep that in

840
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,599
mind um

841
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:54,880
for

842
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:54,879
for for my control

843
00:28:55,038 --> 00:29:00,319
great and since you mentioned swarski um

844
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,759
you know i'm i'm cheating i'm looking at

845
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:05,678
one of your sheets here uh it's also a

846
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:08,640
swirsky also works quite well against

847
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,960
thrips it sounds like

848
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:12,799
uh immature throughout reading um

849
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,558
maybe we maybe we move on to thrips next

850
00:29:12,798 --> 00:29:16,960
since that's another common

851
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:20,240
problem here in cannabis

852
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,399
oh yeah yeah strips can definitely um be

853
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:24,480
problematic uh

854
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:26,639
and you know that again they can be hard

855
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,759
to spot early on they can be a little

856
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,038
bit cryptic

857
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,798
um

858
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:32,398
so yes there's a few things about trips

859
00:29:30,798 --> 00:29:33,759
one is um there's a number of different

860
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:35,839
trips we'll get on cannabis and they're

861
00:29:33,759 --> 00:29:37,599
not all the same some of them are easier

862
00:29:35,839 --> 00:29:40,398
to control than others

863
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:41,918
um and so definitely if you got thrips

864
00:29:40,398 --> 00:29:43,839
you know figure out which ones you have

865
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,720
and if you're not sure um

866
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:49,199
you know you know work with your uh

867
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,440
your consultant or your you know your

868
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,720
supplier or whoever your local extension

869
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:55,679
office make sure you know which strip

870
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:58,240
you're dealing with

871
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,080
the thrips are best controlled again

872
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,000
sort of preventatively

873
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:03,599
um you made a good point a lot of these

874
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,880
predatory might feed on thrips of

875
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:06,639
swarovski

876
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:09,200
uh ancient humerus would probably be the

877
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:10,159
two main ones that are used for trips

878
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
um

879
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,679
they they only eat the smaller stages um

880
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:19,519
cucumbers really only is the first

881
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:21,679
larval stay swarovski can feed on

882
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,839
most they can also feed on the second

883
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,440
larval stage but they're not going to be

884
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:26,240
for the most part feeding on the adults

885
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
so

886
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,359
your adults are still going to be out

887
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
there potentially laying eggs

888
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:32,879
so that's why it's important if you have

889
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:33,918
thrips that you're maintaining a

890
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,880
coverage

891
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:38,880
of your predatory mites um

892
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,440
continuously because you what you want

893
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,278
to do is is is you want to prevent all

894
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,038
of that all of that reproduction of the

895
00:30:43,278 --> 00:30:46,880
thrips that's going to go on in your

896
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:49,440
crop you want to prevent those larvae

897
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,278
from ever really developing

898
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,120
and so you need to maintain a fairly

899
00:30:51,278 --> 00:30:55,038
constant source whether that you know

900
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:58,398
typically that would be weekly either

901
00:30:55,038 --> 00:31:00,158
sachets that will continuously release

902
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:02,000
uh your predatory mice for a while or if

903
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,760
you're not using flash age you probably

904
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,159
you have a threats issue you probably

905
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,480
want to come on every single week um and

906
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,679
and be releasing your predatory life

907
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,519
um

908
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,000
and if you have

909
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,440
the other thing about thrips is that

910
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,440
especially when you have a fairly

911
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,200
established infestation you probably

912
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:21,038
want to add something for the soil stage

913
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,200
as well because your thrips want to get

914
00:31:21,038 --> 00:31:24,240
into the soil your predatory mics are

915
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,759
not going to be feeding on those so

916
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,720
you've got trips coming out from the

917
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,839
soil

918
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,120
um

919
00:31:27,839 --> 00:31:31,038
you know these they they have a

920
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:32,879
quiescent stage in the soil and then

921
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,879
they develop into adults and they come

922
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,240
up and then they start laying eggs again

923
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,360
and it's not until those eggs are

924
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,278
hatching then that you're going to be

925
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,959
able to start controlling them so you've

926
00:31:39,278 --> 00:31:43,759
a better way to break the life cycle is

927
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,960
to add something for the soil stage

928
00:31:43,759 --> 00:31:47,599
and we can talk about that there's

929
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:49,278
several soil predatory mites and insects

930
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:51,439
which will feed on trips and in that

931
00:31:49,278 --> 00:31:53,038
situation if you have an established

932
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,200
infestation you probably want to be

933
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:57,119
using something both for the soil stage

934
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,000
as well as the stage on the leaves as

935
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,199
well

936
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,480
yeah let's talk about that what would

937
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,919
you recommend then for a soil

938
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,000
application

939
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:05,919
if dealing with rips

940
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,759
right well there's three main things

941
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:09,679
that people use um

942
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,798
one of them is another predatory mic

943
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,960
which is

944
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:15,679
uh it's got their rather long name

945
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,079
stratego lelaps cemetus it was actually

946
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:20,399
formerly known as um hypoaspis so a lot

947
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:21,678
of people still call it hypoaspis it's

948
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:23,839
uh

949
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,759
it's a bit of a larger mic it's it's in

950
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,798
a different family it's in the leylapid

951
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:29,278
family

952
00:32:26,798 --> 00:32:31,440
um and it lives on the on the soil it

953
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:33,119
doesn't really get up onto the leaves

954
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,840
and it's a generalist it will feed on

955
00:32:33,119 --> 00:32:38,319
things like springtails and um

956
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:39,599
trips larvae and and fungus gnats it's

957
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:42,000
probably used many for fungus net

958
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,839
control but it will feed on those stages

959
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
of thrips in the soil so

960
00:32:43,839 --> 00:32:46,720
adding something like that would be a

961
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,720
good idea there's another one the rose

962
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,600
beetle which is very popular

963
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,000
um it's called delosha or a theta

964
00:32:51,599 --> 00:32:57,439
and that's another good one it's very

965
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,960
mobile it can actually fly um

966
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,480
in situations where you have maybe

967
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,679
you're not growing as clean as you want

968
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,440
and you have

969
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,360
things like thrips and fungus gnats

970
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,640
perhaps that are roots that are

971
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:08,319
populations that are coming from the

972
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,200
ground maybe you've got weeds or you've

973
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,200
got

974
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,798
some dampness where you've got algae and

975
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,278
things growing maybe that's a source of

976
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:16,720
pests it'd be good to clean it up but

977
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:18,079
using some of the rose beetles can be

978
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,360
good in that situation because they'll

979
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,398
get around they'll get into those

980
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:22,879
corners

981
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,959
and they can even establish and they'll

982
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,960
they'll they'll be a good thing to use

983
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,880
on in that situation

984
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,880
um and then the third option is would be

985
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
the beneficial episodes which we didn't

986
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,399
talk about yet

987
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:37,678
um but again they can be used in

988
00:33:34,398 --> 00:33:39,119
propagation uh you can drench the plant

989
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,278
at any stage

990
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:42,798
potentially if you have thrips but

991
00:33:41,278 --> 00:33:45,519
typically that would be something that

992
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,278
you would use in younger plants

993
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,159
if you have issues with crypts and

994
00:33:47,278 --> 00:33:52,880
fungus maps and you would come in

995
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,840
and you could definitely uh incorporate

996
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,120
nematodes in that situation as well

997
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,798
yeah and which nematode would you

998
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:01,678
recommend for dealing with throats

999
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:03,359
so

1000
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:06,080
there's several species in limited the

1001
00:34:03,359 --> 00:34:08,239
the one that works best for thrips is

1002
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:10,960
stunning mfl ti

1003
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,078
um we just we just

1004
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,599
because people have such a problem

1005
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:16,720
pronouncing some of these names we just

1006
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,919
call them by their letters so sf

1007
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,678
um

1008
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:21,918
and that one that's probably the one

1009
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,639
that's primarily used for trips

1010
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,799
it it works relatively well it doesn't

1011
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,800
like it hot um

1012
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,720
once you get temperatures in the sort of

1013
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,720
upper 80s it

1014
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,838
doesn't really work too well so it's

1015
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:37,358
something that you want to try to use uh

1016
00:34:35,838 --> 00:34:39,119
in the cooler part of the day or the

1017
00:34:37,358 --> 00:34:41,918
cooler part of the season

1018
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:44,159
um or or have some kind of cooling in

1019
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,199
your grow your operation

1020
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,358
um

1021
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,759
but yeah that that's the one keep in

1022
00:34:47,358 --> 00:34:51,598
mind that they that they these things

1023
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,679
need to be kept uh

1024
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,760
they don't they don't like it too dry

1025
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,160
so you need to be put on a high volume

1026
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,160
you need to keep the the media wet

1027
00:34:58,159 --> 00:35:01,519
uh for several hours

1028
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:03,759
they don't do great in things like

1029
00:35:01,519 --> 00:35:05,599
rockwool anything where you have a very

1030
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,800
fast draining system

1031
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,280
um

1032
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,400
soilless media they don't work quite as

1033
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,280
well but

1034
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,960
so take some advice from your supplier

1035
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,119
about your situation

1036
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,639
and and make sure if you're using your

1037
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,680
nematodes you're using them in the right

1038
00:35:18,639 --> 00:35:21,440
way

1039
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:23,279
um there's a few little things to watch

1040
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,440
out for with nematodes like they can

1041
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,680
clog in filters and they

1042
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,880
um they can drown if you mix them up and

1043
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:32,799
leave them sitting around for a while

1044
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,800
before using them and that kind of thing

1045
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,838
yeah now when you mention temperatures

1046
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,039
you're talking about soil temperatures

1047
00:35:35,838 --> 00:35:38,320
in this case since we're talking about

1048
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:40,400
nematodes

1049
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,960
is that right right

1050
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,639
yes yes that's that's right i mean

1051
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,679
ideally we don't have

1052
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:47,358
you know

1053
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:49,039
we're not in the 80s anyway with our

1054
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:51,440
crop

1055
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:53,599
at least indoors in terms of soil temps

1056
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,639
just to keep cannabis happy but

1057
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,800
um

1058
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:58,480
yeah that's a great that's a great point

1059
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,400
so um

1060
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:02,240
we're kind of jumping around i guess a

1061
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,280
little bit here uh was there anything

1062
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:07,358
else regarding thrips

1063
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,400
that you want to talk about

1064
00:36:07,358 --> 00:36:11,358
um

1065
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,358
well i should mention um

1066
00:36:11,358 --> 00:36:14,880
one of the species of thrips it's often

1067
00:36:13,358 --> 00:36:17,119
it's called poinsettia thrips or

1068
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,240
echinocrypts it's a dark

1069
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:22,480
fairly dark slim looking thrips um

1070
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:25,199
that it doesn't really get controlled

1071
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,358
very well by any of the buyers and in

1072
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:29,199
that situation you really need to have a

1073
00:36:27,358 --> 00:36:30,159
have a spray program or an alternative

1074
00:36:29,199 --> 00:36:32,639
program

1075
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:34,639
to target those um

1076
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:36,480
so again you know make sure you know

1077
00:36:34,639 --> 00:36:38,559
which stretch you're dealing with

1078
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,039
uh i do have uh

1079
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:44,320
some growers that i that i know

1080
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:46,480
they they do like using aureus aureus is

1081
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,838
a it's the pirate bug

1082
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,838
um

1083
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,920
and you know you may be probably

1084
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,239
familiar with it it's uh

1085
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,079
it's a generalist but it's it does like

1086
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,959
to feed on thrips

1087
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,680
um now there is a question about how

1088
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:04,159
persistent it is in cannabis because

1089
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:06,319
if aureus doesn't find anything to eat

1090
00:37:04,159 --> 00:37:08,319
it kind of doesn't really hang around

1091
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,599
and because it can't fly so it can

1092
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,519
disperse

1093
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,280
um having said that some growers they

1094
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:15,119
use a lot of it it's it's a generalist

1095
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,839
they like to have it around

1096
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:20,880
even if it's not very persistent um for

1097
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:22,480
them it's it's a good insurance policy

1098
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:25,280
for adult trips because of course it

1099
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,960
will feed on the adult thrips as well

1100
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,119
and um

1101
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,480
there are also other ways we can maybe

1102
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,400
talk about a little bit but there are

1103
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:34,159
other ways to

1104
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,200
encourage and keep some of your buyers

1105
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,759
around

1106
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:40,000
in the crop longer by feeding them

1107
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,359
um and so that aureus would be an

1108
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,920
example of something that you can

1109
00:37:41,358 --> 00:37:47,119
actually potentially feed using pollen

1110
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,559
or festia eggs or a product that biobee

1111
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,440
has is

1112
00:37:48,559 --> 00:37:53,920
based on a type of decapsulated brine

1113
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,519
shrimp egg which aureus just love i mean

1114
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:58,320
i've got videos of them going to town on

1115
00:37:55,519 --> 00:38:00,800
this stuff they can reproduce on it and

1116
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,680
it's a lot less expensive than

1117
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,519
than

1118
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:06,078
a festive eggs and so

1119
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:08,400
there are potentially ways to

1120
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,079
you can buy for example you can buy

1121
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:12,400
swarski that contains the food in the

1122
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,760
bottle so when you're putting it out if

1123
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,599
they don't necessarily have much to eat

1124
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,760
in the crop then you are giving them a

1125
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:21,359
food source um

1126
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,560
application and that helps to keep them

1127
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,239
happy and

1128
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:26,719
will reduce their their ability to

1129
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:28,559
spread and fly away so

1130
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,519
yeah so i should have mentioned oreos

1131
00:38:28,559 --> 00:38:30,719
there

1132
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:33,440
um

1133
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:36,000
but yeah i think that's that's the main

1134
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,920
thing that's the main aspects of fripps

1135
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,760
i think we covered yeah i want to

1136
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,320
highlight one thing you said just as a

1137
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:44,880
gentle reminder to folks too is that um

1138
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,160
it always starts with identification

1139
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,680
like you mentioned that there's various

1140
00:38:46,159 --> 00:38:48,799
types of thrips some are controlled

1141
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:50,799
certain ways

1142
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,000
or maybe slightly differently or less

1143
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,160
controlled

1144
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:56,639
than other species so

1145
00:38:54,159 --> 00:38:58,799
take the time to scout to get

1146
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,719
proper identification which is not

1147
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,800
necessarily posting it in a facebook

1148
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:04,480
group asking what is this blurry photo

1149
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,839
but you know make sure it gets in front

1150
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,159
of an entomologist someone that can

1151
00:39:05,838 --> 00:39:09,199
actually give you a positive id

1152
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,799
and then

1153
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:12,960
come up with a treatment plan based on

1154
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,640
that information so

1155
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,240
again this is stuff that just suzanne

1156
00:39:14,639 --> 00:39:19,118
just drills into my head

1157
00:39:16,239 --> 00:39:21,199
so it's been yeah yeah well susan's been

1158
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,280
doing this a long time and you know i

1159
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,199
suzanne's probably probably the best out

1160
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:27,280
there at

1161
00:39:25,199 --> 00:39:28,719
what she does and um

1162
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,320
i know one of her

1163
00:39:28,719 --> 00:39:34,000
one of her pet feeds is some of the

1164
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,720
misinformation that can go around on um

1165
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,079
some some forums and chat boards and and

1166
00:39:36,719 --> 00:39:40,000
and that kind of thing in the cannabis

1167
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,200
industry you know there there is some

1168
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:44,639
bad information out there and

1169
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,039
there's also lots of good information

1170
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:49,279
but of course knowing which is which and

1171
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:50,719
getting getting a good idea is really

1172
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,160
important because

1173
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:54,159
um

1174
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,639
you know that's like the first thing you

1175
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:59,440
really need to do because i do see

1176
00:39:56,639 --> 00:40:00,799
people you know maybe applying um

1177
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:02,480
for some of us

1178
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,400
when when the problem they have is not

1179
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:05,838
spider mites or something like that

1180
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,960
you're potentially just wasting your

1181
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:11,119
money so yeah that's a great point pad

1182
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,519
yeah you know i hear these stories about

1183
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:15,838
facilities either you know doing uh

1184
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:18,239
massive over applying of beneficials

1185
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:21,599
because they have the wrong rates

1186
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:24,559
or you know and sometimes that's from uh

1187
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,760
you know a potential consultant or the

1188
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:27,599
issue is they're just not applying the

1189
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:29,040
right insect for the right problem and

1190
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:32,640
then that's where people get into this

1191
00:40:29,039 --> 00:40:35,039
idea that bio controls don't work so

1192
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:37,279
you know i'm grateful because i'm not

1193
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:39,199
an entomologist or anywhere near an

1194
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,400
expert on this i'm grateful for some of

1195
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,838
the people on my team that are more

1196
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,920
knowledgeable than me but then also

1197
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:46,159
having resources like yourself and

1198
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:47,280
suzanne and and other people at biobee

1199
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:49,279
that i can

1200
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:51,200
you know get a positive identification

1201
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,079
just to back up

1202
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:55,598
uh you know my own knowledge as a way of

1203
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,960
making sure that my recommendation is

1204
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,800
going to be

1205
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,800
on target for what what's actually going

1206
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,720
on in a room so

1207
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,160
yeah thank you i just

1208
00:41:02,719 --> 00:41:05,598
i just want to go back and touch on that

1209
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:07,920
because too many times i think people

1210
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:09,680
get ahead of themselves or they you know

1211
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,880
they see a problem on a leaf they post a

1212
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:12,719
photo

1213
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,119
you know of a blurry insect they think

1214
00:41:12,719 --> 00:41:16,639
it's one thing and then it turns out you

1215
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:17,680
know maybe it's

1216
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,598
you know

1217
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:21,679
maybe it's innocuous it's just a soil

1218
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,880
dwelling mite or maybe it's uh not what

1219
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:25,039
they thought it was or a different

1220
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,559
species so

1221
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:27,519
yeah just wanted to go back and touch on

1222
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,639
that so

1223
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,559
okay

1224
00:41:28,639 --> 00:41:32,078
uh moving on unless there's anything you

1225
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:33,920
want to add to that

1226
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,000
yeah and i just one real quick thing

1227
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:38,559
that related to what you just said that

1228
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,318
that is good to keep in mind um

1229
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:41,679
you know i get a lot of people sending

1230
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:43,279
pictures all the time of different

1231
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,078
things and

1232
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,040
um

1233
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,119
you know

1234
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:49,759
so many times the picture quality is

1235
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,318
just low it's very hard to identify

1236
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,000
things without a good photo um

1237
00:41:52,318 --> 00:41:57,199
especially mics you know mice can be

1238
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,318
hard to control uh hard to identify

1239
00:41:57,199 --> 00:42:01,118
um

1240
00:41:58,318 --> 00:42:03,679
without even from good good pictures um

1241
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:05,599
so you know sometimes you need samples

1242
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,919
so yeah so idea is important getting

1243
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,440
good quality photos is important

1244
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,440
um and then another thing you said which

1245
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,880
which i see a lot is

1246
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:14,720
especially you know

1247
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,079
especially once you're growing and if

1248
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:17,519
you're growing in hoop houses or you're

1249
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:19,119
growing outdoors

1250
00:42:17,519 --> 00:42:21,119
you get a lot of different incidental

1251
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,720
things that can come around and then a

1252
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,160
lot of them are not problematic you know

1253
00:42:22,719 --> 00:42:26,000
i i see

1254
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,679
various um

1255
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,358
various bugs that will just come in from

1256
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:31,039
outside and

1257
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,480
you know maybe they'll even feed on a

1258
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,159
leaf for a little bit but they don't

1259
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:36,000
have the capacity to reproduce so

1260
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:37,838
they're not going to be a problem so

1261
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:40,159
by all means get everything identified

1262
00:42:37,838 --> 00:42:42,960
but don't feel like just because you

1263
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:44,480
have a particular bug in the facility

1264
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,639
that that's necessarily something that

1265
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,920
you need to spray for or control it may

1266
00:42:46,639 --> 00:42:49,759
be something that's just innocuous and

1267
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,800
just need to keep an eye out for it

1268
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,440
um

1269
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:54,880
because the more you spray um the more

1270
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,599
you're going to be impacting your

1271
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,240
beneficial insects so making unnecessary

1272
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:02,400
sprays is probably just as bad if not

1273
00:43:00,239 --> 00:43:04,318
worse than not making it thin

1274
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,720
in some ways then making missing sprays

1275
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:07,599
that you need to make so

1276
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:10,318
you

1277
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:12,720
use what you use what you have as a

1278
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:15,440
guide to what you need to do in terms of

1279
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:17,919
your own particular facility

1280
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,800
that's a great point um especially about

1281
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,720
having a high quality camera because

1282
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,240
it's it's it's hard enough to identify

1283
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,919
these mites much less with a blurry

1284
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,799
photo so it's definitely worth the

1285
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,318
investment getting a decent camera to

1286
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,039
take a good photo and a lot of times

1287
00:43:30,318 --> 00:43:32,800
your

1288
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:34,639
phone camera just isn't gonna isn't

1289
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,000
gonna cut it

1290
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:37,759
um

1291
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,679
one other thing that you you mentioned

1292
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,280
was you know people

1293
00:43:39,679 --> 00:43:42,159
treating for things that aren't problems

1294
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,240
well

1295
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:45,838
you know we work with a lot of growers

1296
00:43:44,239 --> 00:43:47,199
doing um

1297
00:43:45,838 --> 00:43:48,159
what people are calling living so i

1298
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,239
don't know if you're familiar with it

1299
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:53,440
stephen it's this idea of

1300
00:43:50,239 --> 00:43:55,118
reusing soil typically beds

1301
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:57,920
and managing the fertility in it over

1302
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:59,599
time and so we do see a lot more insect

1303
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,680
life

1304
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,119
in these you know you'll see a lot of uh

1305
00:44:01,679 --> 00:44:05,039
orbited mites

1306
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:06,480
or you'll see people

1307
00:44:05,039 --> 00:44:09,039
that'll spot you know mold mites that

1308
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,960
may come in with a you know beneficial

1309
00:44:09,039 --> 00:44:12,880
insect application and

1310
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:16,240
it's just important that we we get the

1311
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,240
right id there that's

1312
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,440
i think that's where we always have to

1313
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:20,240
start so

1314
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,400
yeah

1315
00:44:20,239 --> 00:44:24,078
yeah yeah yeah no i do see or about it

1316
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,440
might um

1317
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,280
these are from people what the heck are

1318
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,200
these and they're they don't you know

1319
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,640
they they're again they're often just a

1320
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,919
secondary issue

1321
00:44:30,639 --> 00:44:35,358
um

1322
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:37,599
i also see uh typho typhofagus mites

1323
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:38,400
coming in um various different things

1324
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:41,280
that

1325
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:43,760
are really just pretty innocuous um

1326
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,960
so so yeah yeah

1327
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,280
and i think one thing you mentioned

1328
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,199
earlier which were the isopods again

1329
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:51,760
that's a that's an issue which i haven't

1330
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:52,879
personally seen but i know that can be i

1331
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,400
know whether you want to mention those

1332
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,599
or not but that can be

1333
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,440
um

1334
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:59,280
sometimes some of these soil

1335
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:01,119
soil issues you have are very much

1336
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:03,599
reflect you know how you grow whether

1337
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,519
you recycle soil how much organic matter

1338
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,800
you have

1339
00:45:05,519 --> 00:45:08,000
and um

1340
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,000
and i think you said that you've seen

1341
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:12,400
sometimes those can actually be

1342
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:13,838
causing damage as well so that was

1343
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,639
interesting

1344
00:45:13,838 --> 00:45:19,039
yeah when we see really high levels of

1345
00:45:16,639 --> 00:45:20,960
organic matter in a soil

1346
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:24,318
sometimes those populations i found can

1347
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:28,079
get out of control and actually start

1348
00:45:24,318 --> 00:45:30,480
chewing at the at the stock itself

1349
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:31,920
you know one or two probably not a

1350
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:33,119
problem but you know i've seen it where

1351
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,960
there's like

1352
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,119
hundreds or probably thousands in a

1353
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,400
given room they just get out of control

1354
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:42,559
so that's where i typically recommend

1355
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:44,400
um mass trapping

1356
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:46,480
um and you can even put like a sticky

1357
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,318
sticky tape or traps around

1358
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,800
the stem of your plant to help kind of

1359
00:45:48,318 --> 00:45:52,000
just stave off that damage

1360
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,680
while you're trying to get it back under

1361
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,199
control but there aren't as far as i

1362
00:45:53,679 --> 00:45:56,719
know a lot of good options other than

1363
00:45:55,199 --> 00:45:58,559
maybe reducing their food source by

1364
00:45:56,719 --> 00:46:00,318
removing some of that organic matter or

1365
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:02,318
that cover crop or something else that

1366
00:46:00,318 --> 00:46:04,239
they may be

1367
00:46:02,318 --> 00:46:05,279
surviving off of i don't did you want to

1368
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:07,519
add

1369
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:11,280
add to that

1370
00:46:07,519 --> 00:46:14,960
no i mean i i like the idea about um

1371
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,240
mass trapping and possibly changing your

1372
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,440
um

1373
00:46:16,239 --> 00:46:21,679
your how how you grow what soil you use

1374
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,280
um more than coming in and trying to

1375
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:26,960
spray them away

1376
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,800
um i like that idea more but

1377
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:30,480
um but no that was i don't really have

1378
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,160
anything any direct experience with

1379
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:33,039
using those so

1380
00:46:32,159 --> 00:46:34,000
um

1381
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:35,759
yeah

1382
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:38,000
yeah we'll also see super high levels of

1383
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,599
springtails sometimes which again are

1384
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,318
not

1385
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:44,240
really problematic

1386
00:46:42,318 --> 00:46:45,838
but but i do see a lot of photos of

1387
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:48,479
those showing up online and i have seen

1388
00:46:45,838 --> 00:46:50,000
them in a couple grows i've walked into

1389
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:51,358
i don't know if you want to touch on

1390
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:53,519
that some of the things that you list

1391
00:46:51,358 --> 00:46:54,719
actually feed on springtails some of the

1392
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:58,318
things that we talked about it sounds

1393
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,159
like so i thought that was interesting

1394
00:46:58,318 --> 00:47:01,679
yeah springtails are not normally an

1395
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:03,279
issue but if they get into behind

1396
00:47:01,679 --> 00:47:05,279
numbers um

1397
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,760
you know there is some some evidence

1398
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:10,800
suggestion that they can vector some

1399
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,319
some fungal diseases um if they get to

1400
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:14,240
be high numbers there are certainly some

1401
00:47:12,318 --> 00:47:16,480
species of springtails which will feed

1402
00:47:14,239 --> 00:47:18,559
on young roots potentially can cause

1403
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,480
damage again you know there's lots of

1404
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:22,838
different springtails if you have a lot

1405
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,119
of springtails um i would

1406
00:47:22,838 --> 00:47:27,838
probably caution about doing something

1407
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,000
about them um and again some of the the

1408
00:47:27,838 --> 00:47:31,920
the predatory insects we mentioned

1409
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,400
earlier that the rope beetles as well as

1410
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,079
some of the the australian laylaps mites

1411
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,280
they will feed on them and again that's

1412
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:39,200
something that you might want to

1413
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:40,880
consider putting in if you've got a lot

1414
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:42,879
of springtails just to

1415
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:45,119
just to reduce the risk of some of those

1416
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:46,400
problems happening

1417
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,720
and that's a good point that some of

1418
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:50,240
these insects can be vectors

1419
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:52,558
so that's something to factor in as well

1420
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,838
thank you for mentioning that um

1421
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,119
let's

1422
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,558
you know we haven't even talked about

1423
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:57,599
some of the major

1424
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:59,519
tests that i think people are going to

1425
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,559
tune into this podcast to want to hear

1426
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:04,800
about so let's just knock out um

1427
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,720
probably one of the most common ones um

1428
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,400
and and definitely not one of the more

1429
00:48:06,719 --> 00:48:12,239
damaging or worse ones you have to deal

1430
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,240
with which is just fungus gnats

1431
00:48:13,358 --> 00:48:16,159
give me your thoughts around around

1432
00:48:14,639 --> 00:48:17,920
fungus gnats in terms of how you like to

1433
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,078
treat it

1434
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:22,800
the fungus and that shouldn't should not

1435
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:25,039
be difficult to control and

1436
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,240
you shouldn't really be in a situation

1437
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:28,800
where you're having a lot of fungus and

1438
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:30,558
that's flying around um

1439
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,760
um

1440
00:48:30,559 --> 00:48:35,280
most most fungus maps you know there's

1441
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:36,640
just a few ways to approach fungus

1442
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:38,559
that's at the

1443
00:48:36,639 --> 00:48:40,558
first is um

1444
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,519
are you you know are you growing too wet

1445
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:43,119
um

1446
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:44,880
fungus gnats of course they they're

1447
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:49,838
feeding primarily on

1448
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:52,800
on algae and uh and and and fungi that

1449
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:54,400
grow on the soil or

1450
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:56,318
they can also grow of course on the

1451
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,480
non-crop area on the ground if you if

1452
00:48:56,318 --> 00:49:00,880
your facility is not too clean

1453
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,719
um i've i've also seen them coming out

1454
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,318
of some water walls feeding on water

1455
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,000
walls and things so

1456
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:07,920
um

1457
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,280
so having having a clean grow not

1458
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,760
growing you know

1459
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,559
not growing too wet is is the primary

1460
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,160
thing

1461
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:16,640
fungus naps are really pretty easily

1462
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:18,960
controlled again by by the the

1463
00:49:16,639 --> 00:49:21,440
australian elapsed mites we talked about

1464
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,079
the rope beetles and again the the

1465
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,440
stunning method nematodes all of those

1466
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,880
things um

1467
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,240
will control fungus gnats pretty

1468
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,039
effectively

1469
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:30,558
so

1470
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:31,838
the only thing i would perhaps add is

1471
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,359
that if you have an established

1472
00:49:31,838 --> 00:49:35,519
infestation function that's quite a long

1473
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:37,119
life cycle it can be a month or more

1474
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:39,440
and most of the bio controls you're

1475
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,119
really only targeting the larvae so

1476
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:43,519
you've got potentially a fairly

1477
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:45,680
long-lived adult stage people stage and

1478
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,358
egg stage that are not being targeted so

1479
00:49:45,679 --> 00:49:48,399
it can take a while for those to cycle

1480
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:50,558
through

1481
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,559
so if you have a lot of fungus gnats and

1482
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:55,119
i've certainly seen this in greenhouses

1483
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:57,760
it can take a couple of months or more

1484
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:58,720
before those numbers drop down

1485
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,319
so

1486
00:49:58,719 --> 00:50:02,159
you know some people might want to come

1487
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:04,639
in with a with a

1488
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:06,239
with a a pyrethrin spray and try to

1489
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:09,039
knock down the adults

1490
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:10,879
um definitely putting up sticky traps

1491
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:12,880
will help

1492
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,720
monitor and to a certain extent if you

1493
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,079
if you you know sticky rolls all the way

1494
00:50:14,719 --> 00:50:17,358
around you can you can help bring the

1495
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,720
numbers down

1496
00:50:17,358 --> 00:50:20,639
more quickly but

1497
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:22,239
in general um

1498
00:50:20,639 --> 00:50:25,199
fungus now should not be too too

1499
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,199
difficult to control

1500
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:30,079
yeah i i like the idea of sf nematodes

1501
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,039
um

1502
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
as my

1503
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,400
primary way of dealing with them but i'm

1504
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:36,078
glad you mentioned a couple other ways

1505
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,720
of treating

1506
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:41,280
for them we see them quite a bit in

1507
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,679
because we use compost as a fraction of

1508
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:46,000
our soil mix and it's really inevitable

1509
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:48,879
when we have organic matter that's been

1510
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:50,480
outdoors at some point in time

1511
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,880
you can't have all the biology in the

1512
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:56,800
compost and then not have the potential

1513
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:59,119
for fungus gnats and vice versa so

1514
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:01,280
um it's it you know seasonally will

1515
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:03,680
become an issue sometimes

1516
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:05,599
which is why you know pre-treating with

1517
00:51:03,679 --> 00:51:06,480
sf nematodes or being on a maintenance

1518
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,559
schedule

1519
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:10,559
as a preventative just makes it really

1520
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:13,040
easy because you don't get to that

1521
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:15,440
hopefully that mass trapping infestation

1522
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:16,880
stage where you're having to

1523
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,639
having to think about spraying and

1524
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,240
things like that

1525
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:22,639
yeah yeah that's a good point funder's

1526
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:24,078
max can come in on eggs on on media

1527
00:51:22,639 --> 00:51:25,118
after buying in media unless it's

1528
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:27,680
sterile

1529
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:30,160
um it's not uncommon for fungus net eggs

1530
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:32,318
to be in the media and sometimes they'll

1531
00:51:30,159 --> 00:51:34,558
they'll they they they'll hatch once the

1532
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:36,880
media gets wet and so you're you that's

1533
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:38,559
where your your source can can come from

1534
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,318
like you say or if you

1535
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:42,240
have your media outside it can get

1536
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:44,400
contaminated that way so in that

1537
00:51:42,239 --> 00:51:45,439
situation you'd probably want to treat

1538
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,119
um

1539
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:48,800
you'd probably want to treat your young

1540
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,519
plants for sure with a drench for

1541
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:53,440
nematodes um one of the new products

1542
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:56,800
actually that we have is a nematode in a

1543
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,200
in a capsule which

1544
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,800
is a slow release capsule and

1545
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:03,598
that can actually be incorporated into

1546
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,839
your your your plugs or your media your

1547
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:08,079
young plants

1548
00:52:05,838 --> 00:52:09,519
and the advantage on that is it allows

1549
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:11,920
you to have a

1550
00:52:09,519 --> 00:52:13,199
long application of nematodes during

1551
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,200
that critical

1552
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:17,919
period when the plants are putting at

1553
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,159
their first roots where trenches can be

1554
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:22,159
a little disruptive you don't want to

1555
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:23,440
disrupt your plants when they first

1556
00:52:22,159 --> 00:52:24,399
start rooting

1557
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,679
um

1558
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,280
and so

1559
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:29,358
uh in that situation you can actually

1560
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:32,480
incorporate these nematode capsules into

1561
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:33,759
your into your media uh um and then you

1562
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,960
don't have to drench but then you've

1563
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,559
still got the

1564
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,159
extended release of the nematode so

1565
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:40,079
that's that's something new we're kind

1566
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:42,719
of excited about so

1567
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:46,559
um so yeah that's another that's another

1568
00:52:42,719 --> 00:52:48,078
option as well you don't want to drench

1569
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:49,680
yeah it's called the

1570
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:51,760
nema plus

1571
00:52:49,679 --> 00:52:55,039
depot 200 is the product you're you're

1572
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:56,720
talking about it's 200 capsules 320 000

1573
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:57,920
nematodes per

1574
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:59,358
unit

1575
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,079
uh yeah

1576
00:52:59,358 --> 00:53:03,279
yeah yeah it's just come out in a

1577
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,800
the

1578
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:07,440
until now it's coming these tiny little

1579
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,960
packets with about 200 capsules in

1580
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:11,200
which is fine if you've only got a small

1581
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:14,159
number of plants but i think now it's

1582
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:16,960
now becoming available in a bag of 32

1583
00:53:14,159 --> 00:53:17,759
000 capsules wow so that's a lit that's

1584
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,559
uh

1585
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,800
i believe that should be available

1586
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,839
sometime in the next month or so

1587
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,160
um so

1588
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:27,679
that's something that um you could maybe

1589
00:53:26,159 --> 00:53:29,519
put on a on the potting line or

1590
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:30,879
something and

1591
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:32,239
and

1592
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,960
treat every plant

1593
00:53:32,239 --> 00:53:37,358
as it's being stuck or

1594
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,880
depending on how you how you grow

1595
00:53:37,358 --> 00:53:40,558
so that's so that's exciting and again

1596
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:41,599
that can be potentially automated as

1597
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:44,079
well

1598
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,160
i've seen them put on or automate

1599
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:47,599
automation lines where

1600
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:49,519
every part gets treated with a few

1601
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,599
capsules

1602
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,880
as part of the production line so that

1603
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,480
that's uh

1604
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,760
that's kind of a i think where the

1605
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,519
future would be

1606
00:53:55,760 --> 00:53:59,599
for fungus back control

1607
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:01,199
so i haven't i haven't seen this product

1608
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,440
um

1609
00:54:01,199 --> 00:54:05,358
can you describe what it actually looks

1610
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:07,200
like and then also how you

1611
00:54:05,358 --> 00:54:09,519
how you apply it like are you burying it

1612
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:11,118
in the soil is it just going you know

1613
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:13,440
relatively close to the surface are you

1614
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:15,519
watering it in what

1615
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:17,519
what can you tell me about it yeah

1616
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,358
yeah yeah it was developed for the it's

1617
00:54:17,519 --> 00:54:20,480
actually developed for the for the home

1618
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:22,318
uh

1619
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:23,358
for the um houseplant market where

1620
00:54:22,318 --> 00:54:24,558
people would

1621
00:54:23,358 --> 00:54:27,279
would you know maybe they'd be going

1622
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:28,559
away for a few weeks on vacation or they

1623
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,760
they'd want to treat their house plants

1624
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:31,359
or fungus mass but they didn't really

1625
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,400
want to be spraying and

1626
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:33,440
you could just get a few of these

1627
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,440
capsules

1628
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,079
make a little few holes in the soil put

1629
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:39,358
them in cover them up and then you

1630
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,680
you're good to go

1631
00:54:39,358 --> 00:54:43,838
um in the ag market which is kind of the

1632
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:45,039
new market for for these things

1633
00:54:43,838 --> 00:54:47,759
um

1634
00:54:45,039 --> 00:54:49,920
it's not 100 clear what the best how to

1635
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,119
use them but i but what seems to be the

1636
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,519
best way

1637
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,920
is just to put them on a potting line

1638
00:54:53,519 --> 00:54:58,480
and or put them in your plants when

1639
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:58,480
they're first

1640
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,480
when they're first

1641
00:55:00,639 --> 00:55:03,440
planted

1642
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:04,880
and

1643
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,519
they the capsules have to be in the

1644
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:09,358
media that you can't top dress so

1645
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,358
you know either you put them in the

1646
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:12,159
planting hole when when the plant goes

1647
00:55:11,358 --> 00:55:14,078
in

1648
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:15,358
or you incorporate them into your

1649
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,960
potting mix

1650
00:55:15,358 --> 00:55:19,759
you mix them into your potting mix and

1651
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,440
then that body mix is pre-treated

1652
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,839
or you find some other such way to

1653
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:26,159
incorporate them uh into the

1654
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:27,838
into the top

1655
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:29,759
into the parts where they have to you

1656
00:55:27,838 --> 00:55:30,798
know some device to make holes and then

1657
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,559
put them in

1658
00:55:30,798 --> 00:55:35,119
so it's not it's not clear to me it

1659
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:36,559
would depend on on everyone's situation

1660
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:38,318
but um

1661
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:39,119
like i say this is kind of something new

1662
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:42,000
but

1663
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,920
uh i really see uh this being a very

1664
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,159
useful tool where people can just kind

1665
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,200
of get to get their fungus map treatment

1666
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:49,679
done

1667
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:51,519
straight away when the plants are first

1668
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:52,879
stuck and they don't have to worry about

1669
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:55,119
it for

1670
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,480
maybe at all um if those plants are big

1671
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,160
enough and

1672
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:59,679
got enough root system

1673
00:55:58,159 --> 00:56:01,679
by the time the capsules are done maybe

1674
00:55:59,679 --> 00:56:03,279
fungus fats are no longer a problem but

1675
00:56:01,679 --> 00:56:05,919
if you do have to come in and drench

1676
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:07,920
with nematodes later on um the roots are

1677
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,039
fairly well developed and and the

1678
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,519
direction is not going to be so

1679
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:11,519
disruptive

1680
00:56:11,679 --> 00:56:15,199
yeah

1681
00:56:12,798 --> 00:56:16,480
we should talk about that more

1682
00:56:15,199 --> 00:56:19,519
yeah the other thing that you made me

1683
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,920
think of too is in a facility it reduces

1684
00:56:19,519 --> 00:56:24,079
i would think employee error

1685
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,079
in application um

1686
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:27,920
you know potentially not getting an even

1687
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:31,200
application of nematodes across all your

1688
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:32,960
plants or you know mixing and not

1689
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:36,318
not properly applying to where you may

1690
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,318
be damaging your nematodes

1691
00:56:36,639 --> 00:56:41,279
i i think that's really interesting

1692
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,838
as a reason to potentially use them i'm

1693
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,160
picturing like

1694
00:56:43,838 --> 00:56:49,358
like a fish oil capsule is that anywhere

1695
00:56:46,159 --> 00:56:51,759
close to what they actually look like

1696
00:56:49,358 --> 00:56:53,199
yeah they look a little bit like caviar

1697
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,119
um

1698
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:56,239
the capsules are made from food grade

1699
00:56:55,119 --> 00:56:59,838
material

1700
00:56:56,239 --> 00:57:01,519
it's like a calcium alginate sunflower

1701
00:56:59,838 --> 00:57:03,920
um

1702
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,759
uh oil emulsion in the middle so you can

1703
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:08,559
eat these things if you want i they

1704
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,640
don't taste good i tried it but um

1705
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,960
they're uh they're it's all food grade

1706
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,920
materials um and they're pretty

1707
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:17,280
persistent and you know they they store

1708
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:19,280
well in the fridge

1709
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:21,920
um they just look like little kind of

1710
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:23,440
little um

1711
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,760
little soft

1712
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,960
capsules of like caviar or something

1713
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:30,559
like that

1714
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:32,000
um and they come in these bags and

1715
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:33,440
and uh

1716
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,880
yeah we're excited to see where this

1717
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,280
goes

1718
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:38,880
very cool very cool um well i want to

1719
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,880
save time for what's

1720
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:43,200
what's sort of new

1721
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,599
from biobee and what you're seeing in

1722
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:48,480
the industry but i also realize we at

1723
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:50,318
the very least need to at least touch on

1724
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:53,039
um or maybe i need to do another podcast

1725
00:57:50,318 --> 00:57:56,400
with you on we haven't even talked about

1726
00:57:53,039 --> 00:57:58,318
hemp russet canvas aphid or root aphids

1727
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,240
as the main three and then caterpillar

1728
00:57:58,318 --> 00:58:01,599
leaf miners and white flies is sort of

1729
00:58:00,239 --> 00:58:03,679
more minor

1730
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,440
pests um

1731
00:58:03,679 --> 00:58:08,879
what would you like to what would you

1732
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:11,599
like to tackle next

1733
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,358
um well we can mention hemp russet mike

1734
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:16,160
briefly um

1735
00:58:13,358 --> 00:58:18,558
that that one can be a problem uh if it

1736
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:20,960
gets well established it could be a

1737
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:23,440
can be a problem and that's one that

1738
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:25,440
really um

1739
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:28,159
you know that there's some

1740
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,358
debate about what role bios play but for

1741
00:58:28,159 --> 00:58:30,639
sure i would

1742
00:58:29,358 --> 00:58:32,880
i would think that if you have an

1743
00:58:30,639 --> 00:58:34,400
existing information pentrust it might

1744
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:37,280
you've got to have a

1745
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:39,280
spray program to deal with it um

1746
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,440
soft oil x

1747
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,240
sulfur sprays

1748
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:44,400
some other

1749
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,039
[Music]

1750
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:49,358
paraffin oil type sprays

1751
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:51,358
need to be done

1752
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:53,759
you know you could potentially uh dip

1753
00:58:51,358 --> 00:58:55,358
your dip your clones you need to you

1754
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:57,119
need to deal with that problem it's not

1755
00:58:55,358 --> 00:58:58,318
going to get any better you have to be

1756
00:58:57,119 --> 00:58:59,440
aggressive

1757
00:58:58,318 --> 00:59:01,358
and

1758
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:02,798
once your hemorrhagic might populations

1759
00:59:01,358 --> 00:59:05,279
are under control

1760
00:59:02,798 --> 00:59:07,519
then there there there is some uh

1761
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:10,079
evidence that having something like

1762
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:12,960
swarovski or bicumerous in the mix can

1763
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:15,280
potentially help prevent your plants

1764
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:17,199
becoming reinfected with new sources of

1765
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,880
hemp russet might coming in but i know

1766
00:59:17,199 --> 00:59:21,039
this is something suzanne's got quite

1767
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:22,640
strong opinions on um that the

1768
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:24,000
beneficials themselves are not going to

1769
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:26,318
be an effective way to get rid of an

1770
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:27,679
existing infestation but don't don't

1771
00:59:26,318 --> 00:59:29,679
don't wait around if you've got hemp

1772
00:59:27,679 --> 00:59:30,719
wrap it might i can say it tends to get

1773
00:59:29,679 --> 00:59:33,039
worse

1774
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:35,039
um and you need to have a strategy for

1775
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:36,000
for dealing with it so

1776
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,519
um

1777
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,119
if you apply it in the right way it's

1778
00:59:37,519 --> 00:59:42,639
not that difficult

1779
00:59:39,119 --> 00:59:44,400
but um but uh yeah suffer x i think is

1780
00:59:42,639 --> 00:59:47,279
probably one of the best

1781
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:50,639
uh treatments um out there

1782
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:52,160
for to to deal with an existing problem

1783
00:59:50,639 --> 00:59:53,440
and also example of where you need a

1784
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:57,039
really good

1785
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:58,480
camera or scope just to to spot them i

1786
00:59:57,039 --> 00:59:59,920
mean they're very easy to identify once

1787
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:01,679
you have the right tools but without the

1788
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:03,440
right tools

1789
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:05,199
you'd be struggling i think to make a

1790
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,280
positive identification

1791
01:00:05,199 --> 01:00:08,879
yeah they're probably the smallest pest

1792
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,400
that you're going to be dealing with in

1793
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,640
cannabis

1794
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,639
they really are

1795
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,879
even with the 10x hand lens that then

1796
01:00:14,639 --> 01:00:20,078
they're they're they can be hard to see

1797
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,760
so uh yeah you you that's a situation

1798
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:23,760
where you might want to get get your

1799
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,920
little dissecting scope out or something

1800
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:28,799
and get your samples under there and dig

1801
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:30,960
around and find them because um the same

1802
01:00:28,798 --> 01:00:33,679
with broad mics you know the hair russet

1803
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:35,440
mites and broad mic uh are often to die

1804
01:00:33,679 --> 01:00:37,199
misdiagnosed problems people will see an

1805
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,519
issue on a plan and they'll just say

1806
01:00:37,199 --> 01:00:41,279
well that must be broadband or that must

1807
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:43,358
be right it might the truth is you

1808
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:45,200
actually have to find these critters and

1809
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:47,199
confirm that they're on the plant before

1810
01:00:45,199 --> 01:00:50,639
you can be 100 sure

1811
01:00:47,199 --> 01:00:53,039
um they're not easy to get a positive

1812
01:00:50,639 --> 01:00:56,000
diagnosis without actually finding them

1813
01:00:53,039 --> 01:00:58,719
because you can't get other symptoms

1814
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,318
that can cause potentially similar

1815
01:00:58,719 --> 01:01:01,358
other things that cause similar symptoms

1816
01:01:00,318 --> 01:01:03,039
so

1817
01:01:01,358 --> 01:01:06,000
yeah that's a great great point make

1818
01:01:03,039 --> 01:01:07,599
sure you identify them

1819
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:09,440
okay well

1820
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:13,440
moving on then

1821
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:17,440
cannabis aphid and root aphids

1822
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:20,400
okay well these are other these are um

1823
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,000
two more difficult pests um

1824
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:23,838
if you're gonna get aphids my advice

1825
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:27,199
would be to get cotton aphids and green

1826
01:01:23,838 --> 01:01:29,279
peas aphids um very easy to control

1827
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:30,639
if you're going to get aphids

1828
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,720
not that they can't be a problem if you

1829
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:34,960
don't treat for them but they they

1830
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:36,639
buyers work very well for those some of

1831
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:38,480
the parasitic wasps

1832
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:40,960
they're pretty inexpensive

1833
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:43,039
if you have them as part of your program

1834
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:45,119
um then you shouldn't have too many

1835
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:46,480
issues with those cannabis aphids are a

1836
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:48,960
little bit tougher

1837
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,199
um to control the buyers don't work

1838
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:54,159
quite as effectively for those

1839
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:55,919
um now if you do use parasitic walls for

1840
01:01:54,159 --> 01:01:58,719
aphids um

1841
01:01:55,920 --> 01:02:00,798
they do the common types of parasitic

1842
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:03,598
wasps which you're using for your common

1843
01:02:00,798 --> 01:02:06,798
aphids they will parasitize cannabis

1844
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:09,519
aphids just not as effectively

1845
01:02:06,798 --> 01:02:11,358
but having having them in the mix will

1846
01:02:09,519 --> 01:02:12,880
definitely help slow

1847
01:02:11,358 --> 01:02:14,400
slow down the risk of cannabis so if

1848
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,760
you're going crazy and when it goes

1849
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,119
crazy and it starts spreading it can be

1850
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:20,720
a real problem

1851
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:22,160
um so cannabis aphid yes you know you

1852
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:24,239
want to have

1853
01:02:22,159 --> 01:02:25,598
there's there's several approaches a lot

1854
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:27,199
of people at this point will bust out

1855
01:02:25,599 --> 01:02:28,000
the sprays and they'll try to spray it

1856
01:02:27,199 --> 01:02:30,318
back

1857
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:32,159
um and again you know you that can work

1858
01:02:30,318 --> 01:02:33,759
you need to get the good coverage and

1859
01:02:32,159 --> 01:02:35,759
you also need to be aware of what impact

1860
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,440
you're having on your other bio program

1861
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:40,079
when you're doing that

1862
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,720
um what i see also now is that some

1863
01:02:40,079 --> 01:02:44,798
growers will use predatory insects for

1864
01:02:42,719 --> 01:02:47,358
cannabis aphid and i've seen a lot of

1865
01:02:44,798 --> 01:02:49,280
interest in using lacewings

1866
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,358
lacewings now are more readily available

1867
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:52,400
they're relatively inexpensive

1868
01:02:51,358 --> 01:02:54,159
and

1869
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,240
you they can be put out in large

1870
01:02:54,159 --> 01:02:58,000
quantities as eggs

1871
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,838
in mixed in with things like predatory

1872
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:01,440
mics so people will just say hey we're

1873
01:02:59,838 --> 01:03:02,798
just going to add some lacewings into

1874
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,079
this mix

1875
01:03:02,798 --> 01:03:05,759
and

1876
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:07,519
lacewings are fairly mobile they can get

1877
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,480
around and

1878
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,159
they're

1879
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,199
they will definitely feed on cannabis

1880
01:03:10,159 --> 01:03:12,399
aphids

1881
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:14,078
um

1882
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:16,480
so again you have a you have some

1883
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:18,640
different options there

1884
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:20,639
i've also seen lady beetles released in

1885
01:03:18,639 --> 01:03:22,639
cannabis for for cannabis aphid i would

1886
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:24,400
not generally recommend those they only

1887
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:26,400
ever really work if you have very very

1888
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:28,079
high populations you don't want to have

1889
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,599
your your cannabis avid population

1890
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,400
getting that high

1891
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:32,720
so

1892
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,519
well um and let's also touch on the fact

1893
01:03:32,719 --> 01:03:38,159
that most commercially available

1894
01:03:35,519 --> 01:03:40,239
lady beetles are wild harvested which is

1895
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:41,038
not a great practice and

1896
01:03:40,239 --> 01:03:42,639
not

1897
01:03:41,039 --> 01:03:44,240
necessarily something that

1898
01:03:42,639 --> 01:03:45,519
as a consumer we would want to support

1899
01:03:44,239 --> 01:03:47,358
for its you know

1900
01:03:45,519 --> 01:03:49,280
vector of disease and environmental

1901
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:50,798
damage

1902
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:53,839
though i hear there are some

1903
01:03:50,798 --> 01:03:57,679
commercially available lady beetle

1904
01:03:53,838 --> 01:03:58,558
available they're just really expensive

1905
01:03:57,679 --> 01:04:00,558
yeah

1906
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:05,039
yeah there

1907
01:04:00,559 --> 01:04:06,559
there is one company that does um rear

1908
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:08,240
the convergent lady beetle which is the

1909
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,400
one you're referring to it's normally

1910
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:12,798
wild collected um

1911
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:14,639
artists it they they they do wear it in

1912
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,400
culture but it's very limited supply

1913
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:17,440
it's very expensive

1914
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,680
um

1915
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:22,720
and um

1916
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:24,960
uh yeah yeah so i honestly like lace

1917
01:04:22,719 --> 01:04:29,358
wings are probably gonna be a more

1918
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:32,079
reliable more cost effective way of um

1919
01:04:29,358 --> 01:04:34,960
for as a generalist predator for aphids

1920
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,640
then than ladybugs um

1921
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:39,039
definitely i i would

1922
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:40,639
go more down the the lacewing route than

1923
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:42,000
the ladybug group

1924
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:45,038
um

1925
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:46,400
you know but yes yes go ahead oh i just

1926
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:48,240
wanted to mention i've had some friends

1927
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,960
have success with heat treatment with

1928
01:04:48,239 --> 01:04:52,639
cannabis aphid um by just you know

1929
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,639
massively overheating their rooms

1930
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:56,639
they've been able to knock back

1931
01:04:54,639 --> 01:05:00,318
populations that way because

1932
01:04:56,639 --> 01:05:02,798
it is a really really tough pest

1933
01:05:00,318 --> 01:05:05,038
to deal with it just just keeps coming

1934
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:07,759
back it seems like

1935
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:08,720
so uh that's just one other suggestion i

1936
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:10,640
want to throw out there i know if you

1937
01:05:08,719 --> 01:05:12,879
had any thoughts on that

1938
01:05:10,639 --> 01:05:14,879
yeah yeah no that's interesting i don't

1939
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:16,480
know what the exact temperature you'd

1940
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:18,480
have to get to

1941
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,960
i'd imagine you'd probably want to get

1942
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,199
it up into the mid 40 degree

1943
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:24,559
celsius range or something

1944
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,399
before you

1945
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,720
for a few hours probably because i think

1946
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:30,480
that's a great idea if you can do that

1947
01:05:28,719 --> 01:05:32,239
um one really important thing about

1948
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:33,599
cannabis aphid which you need to keep in

1949
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:36,479
mind is that

1950
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,599
it's it's uh it's monacious on cannabis

1951
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:39,280
right so

1952
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:40,480
whereas other aphids are going to maybe

1953
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,798
fly in

1954
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,358
come through a window come in on

1955
01:05:42,798 --> 01:05:46,559
come in on a weed come in on someone's

1956
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,558
clothes

1957
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:53,519
cannabis aphids they can only really

1958
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:55,519
come from um from from cannabis um

1959
01:05:53,519 --> 01:05:56,960
or you know cannabis plants in the

1960
01:05:55,519 --> 01:05:59,038
cannabis family

1961
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:01,280
and so

1962
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,559
um if you have it you gotta figure out

1963
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,480
well where did it come from because it

1964
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:06,960
didn't just fly into a window

1965
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:09,039
and the other thing to keep in mind is

1966
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:11,039
if it means if you can get rid of it

1967
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,880
from your from your facility

1968
01:06:11,039 --> 01:06:13,839
then as long as you don't bring it in

1969
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,760
again

1970
01:06:13,838 --> 01:06:18,558
you don't have it anymore so there's

1971
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:19,839
more um there's more motivation to make

1972
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:21,760
an effort to

1973
01:06:19,838 --> 01:06:23,440
to try to get rid of it because

1974
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:26,799
if you can get rid of it and not bring

1975
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:29,358
it in you're done your problem's over so

1976
01:06:26,798 --> 01:06:30,559
that's another thing to keep in mind

1977
01:06:29,358 --> 01:06:32,719
um

1978
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:35,039
well the other thing too i think you

1979
01:06:32,719 --> 01:06:37,838
that you brought up a little bit ago was

1980
01:06:35,039 --> 01:06:40,480
this idea of identification again uh

1981
01:06:37,838 --> 01:06:42,078
just to harp on that i know

1982
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:43,760
you know aphids can be color morphs so

1983
01:06:42,079 --> 01:06:45,680
you can't necessarily get a positive id

1984
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,640
just based off the color suzanne's been

1985
01:06:45,679 --> 01:06:48,318
like

1986
01:06:46,639 --> 01:06:50,239
tad you have to send me a close-up of

1987
01:06:48,318 --> 01:06:52,639
their genitals you know when i wanted an

1988
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,558
id once of an aphid so i know that it's

1989
01:06:52,639 --> 01:06:56,078
a little more complex and i so i just

1990
01:06:54,559 --> 01:06:57,599
want to again suggest that people get a

1991
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,760
positive id before jumping to the

1992
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,480
conclusion about what the aphid species

1993
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,200
is

1994
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:05,679
uh that they're necessarily seeing

1995
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:07,919
um on their plants

1996
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,919
yeah yeah great point so both rips and

1997
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,358
aphids uh you need an ip

1998
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:14,079
um

1999
01:07:11,358 --> 01:07:16,400
at the species level you're saying

2000
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:18,079
yeah cannabis labels aren't that hard

2001
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:20,000
what you want to do is you want to look

2002
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:21,760
at their head they have these little

2003
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:23,039
horns

2004
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:24,799
they're actually tubercles kind of

2005
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,559
between their eyes and they look like

2006
01:07:24,798 --> 01:07:29,838
little devil horns

2007
01:07:26,559 --> 01:07:32,960
um and uh there's not really any other

2008
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:35,599
um aphids on cannabis that have these so

2009
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:36,880
um once you see these um that's a pretty

2010
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,480
short bed that you've got cannabis

2011
01:07:36,880 --> 01:07:40,960
aphids

2012
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:43,119
that's a good corner thank you

2013
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:46,480
yeah

2014
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:48,559
all right the dreaded root aphids uh

2015
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:50,159
these might be the most frustrating

2016
01:07:48,559 --> 01:07:52,400
um i don't can't see if it's pretty

2017
01:07:50,159 --> 01:07:55,199
frustrating says hemp russet but this is

2018
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:57,599
definitely in the mix i feel like

2019
01:07:55,199 --> 01:08:00,000
uh what what are your thoughts on rude

2020
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:00,000
aphids

2021
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:04,078
rude aphids are

2022
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:05,519
i always used to think you know if

2023
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:07,680
you've got rude assets you need to

2024
01:08:05,519 --> 01:08:09,358
eradicate them and just get rid of them

2025
01:08:07,679 --> 01:08:11,440
um because

2026
01:08:09,358 --> 01:08:13,358
but the more i think about it and the

2027
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,559
more i see how difficult they are to get

2028
01:08:13,358 --> 01:08:17,920
rid of in

2029
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:19,440
in established um grows

2030
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,440
i think a lot of people are just kind of

2031
01:08:19,439 --> 01:08:23,678
living with them now and then you know

2032
01:08:21,439 --> 01:08:27,119
and and they can be managed to to

2033
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,119
acceptable levels um

2034
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:30,400
um

2035
01:08:28,479 --> 01:08:31,678
if they're not managed then yes they

2036
01:08:30,399 --> 01:08:33,358
they

2037
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,359
the issue with rude aphids is they tend

2038
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:37,039
to get they tend to get in on your stock

2039
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:39,199
on stock plants you know when you've got

2040
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:41,439
plants around for a long time the risk

2041
01:08:39,198 --> 01:08:43,599
of them getting established root aphids

2042
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:44,879
seems to increase and then what happens

2043
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,400
is then they

2044
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,319
they start bubbling out of the stock

2045
01:08:46,399 --> 01:08:50,559
plants and then they fly around and then

2046
01:08:48,319 --> 01:08:51,520
they'll make their way

2047
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:54,080
um

2048
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,679
to to around the facility and then they

2049
01:08:54,079 --> 01:08:57,359
keep kind of spreading

2050
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:59,199
um and so you're always kind of like

2051
01:08:57,359 --> 01:09:00,560
putting out little fires

2052
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:01,439
so

2053
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:04,239
um

2054
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:05,278
rude aphids you have to have um

2055
01:09:04,238 --> 01:09:07,039
you have to figure out where they're

2056
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,159
coming from and you have to use root

2057
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:10,000
trenches

2058
01:09:08,158 --> 01:09:12,158
to try to maintain even if you can't

2059
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:14,000
eradicate them um you should be able to

2060
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,879
maintain a pretty low levels with with

2061
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:19,520
root trenches and so most cannabis guys

2062
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:22,239
they use some combination of botany

2063
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:24,480
guard and pfr

2064
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,639
um and

2065
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:28,479
sometimes as a directon

2066
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:29,920
some of them will mix in nematodes and

2067
01:09:28,479 --> 01:09:32,399
there's there's some evidence that

2068
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,679
nematodes can affect root aphids

2069
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,879
in the lab it's not clear to me there is

2070
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,560
there actually is a little bit of

2071
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,000
research suggesting that they're helpful

2072
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:42,480
but it's not

2073
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,359
it's it's pretty limited but regardless

2074
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,959
um

2075
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,759
some combination of root trenches are

2076
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:49,759
definitely needed um typically you know

2077
01:09:47,759 --> 01:09:51,039
at least weekly well you have decent

2078
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,198
populations

2079
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:55,279
of rude aphids and and even after that

2080
01:09:53,198 --> 01:09:56,879
at least every other week to

2081
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:59,759
keep them suppressed

2082
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,440
um in combination with that you need to

2083
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:03,119
be scouting for rude aphids on the on

2084
01:10:01,439 --> 01:10:05,519
the flowers

2085
01:10:03,119 --> 01:10:06,719
on the on the plants and you need to try

2086
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,080
to stop them

2087
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:09,600
because what will happen is then they'll

2088
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:11,359
move down to the roots and then they'll

2089
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,039
start another source on your roots on

2090
01:10:11,359 --> 01:10:14,559
your other plants so

2091
01:10:13,039 --> 01:10:16,158
you want to be maintaining your root if

2092
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:18,239
it's on your source so that they're not

2093
01:10:16,158 --> 01:10:20,000
bubbling out and expanding if the

2094
01:10:18,238 --> 01:10:21,839
populations stay relatively low they'll

2095
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,359
stay in those roots they won't spread

2096
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,800
it's when you get large numbers that

2097
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:27,439
they'll start crawling out producing

2098
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:29,360
that your wing forms and then spreading

2099
01:10:27,439 --> 01:10:32,719
that's what you want to stop

2100
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:36,559
um in terms of the bios

2101
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:38,480
um we know that that um the the soil

2102
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:40,719
dwelling predatory beetle the rose

2103
01:10:38,479 --> 01:10:42,959
beetles and and the products we might

2104
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:44,800
can and and do feed on roulette because

2105
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:46,158
i've seen them

2106
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:47,760
but they're not going to be an effective

2107
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:49,920
control by themselves they simply don't

2108
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,520
get deep enough into the soil they're

2109
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:53,679
just going to help stop your relatives

2110
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:55,360
from spreading on the soil surface line

2111
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:56,319
and maybe in the top layer they're not

2112
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:58,719
going to be

2113
01:10:56,319 --> 01:11:02,799
eliminating them but i would say

2114
01:10:58,719 --> 01:11:04,319
combining your some some predatory soil

2115
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,560
insects and mites along with your root

2116
01:11:04,319 --> 01:11:09,039
drenches is like a first step for for

2117
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:10,840
rooday food control

2118
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:13,920
yeah i think they're one of the most

2119
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:15,039
persistent insects pests have to deal

2120
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,640
with um

2121
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:18,640
just based on my experience working with

2122
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:20,960
various facilities that are battling it

2123
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:22,640
and really like you mentioned in a lot

2124
01:11:20,960 --> 01:11:23,439
of cases it just comes to maintaining

2125
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:26,800
them

2126
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:29,119
at a threshold that's below

2127
01:11:26,800 --> 01:11:30,880
you know an economic an economic

2128
01:11:29,119 --> 01:11:32,559
threshold where it's it's low enough

2129
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:34,159
that we're still getting a good harvest

2130
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:36,800
we're getting the yields we want and and

2131
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,920
the plant stress isn't necessarily

2132
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,600
too high

2133
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:40,880
but it is really hard to get rid of

2134
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:44,239
especially in facilities where we're

2135
01:11:40,880 --> 01:11:46,079
reusing media and things like that um

2136
01:11:44,238 --> 01:11:47,119
it's a tough one so

2137
01:11:46,079 --> 01:11:48,640
it's good to know that there's some

2138
01:11:47,119 --> 01:11:51,599
options there

2139
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:52,320
yeah yeah and actually i mean

2140
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:55,039
the

2141
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:56,079
root aphids um can be controlled with

2142
01:11:55,039 --> 01:11:58,800
some

2143
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:00,479
pesticide trenches as well it's just

2144
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,840
and um

2145
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:04,319
they can actually be relatively

2146
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:05,679
effective it's just not clear to me that

2147
01:12:04,319 --> 01:12:07,679
how many of these products are going to

2148
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,760
be registered by your state

2149
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,119
so some people will make off-label

2150
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:12,640
applications obviously we don't

2151
01:12:11,119 --> 01:12:14,079
recommend that but

2152
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:16,480
um

2153
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:18,079
but there are and so bovaria is

2154
01:12:16,479 --> 01:12:20,158
definitely one that most cannabis

2155
01:12:18,079 --> 01:12:21,198
growers can't use i mentioned that one

2156
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:24,399
too

2157
01:12:21,198 --> 01:12:25,678
um but things like mainspring and

2158
01:12:24,399 --> 01:12:28,000
endeavor

2159
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:29,440
can also be somewhat effective it's just

2160
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,039
not always clear to me if that they're

2161
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,319
going to be registered for you by your

2162
01:12:31,039 --> 01:12:34,719
state so

2163
01:12:32,319 --> 01:12:36,158
um you have to look at that but uh i've

2164
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:38,800
certainly seen those things being being

2165
01:12:36,158 --> 01:12:40,479
used as well as trenches but yeah your

2166
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:42,320
point is once once they're established

2167
01:12:40,479 --> 01:12:44,079
they're they're hard

2168
01:12:42,319 --> 01:12:45,119
to get rid of if you can get in there

2169
01:12:44,079 --> 01:12:46,238
early

2170
01:12:45,119 --> 01:12:47,840
um

2171
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:50,399
you may be able to eradicate them from

2172
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,079
your facility but uh

2173
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:54,319
once they're fairly as well established

2174
01:12:52,079 --> 01:12:56,000
that community that becomes quite hard

2175
01:12:54,319 --> 01:12:58,719
one other thing you touched on was with

2176
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,719
bavaria and i've been having longer

2177
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:03,039
conversations with suzanne

2178
01:13:00,719 --> 01:13:03,039
and

2179
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:08,559
she's been sharing information with me

2180
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:09,679
from some you know larger companies

2181
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:11,600
that do

2182
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:12,880
pathology and things like that and they

2183
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,039
found with

2184
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,600
that there's various

2185
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:20,960
commercially available bavaria and and

2186
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,960
some of the products on the market um

2187
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,119
may not contain

2188
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:27,359
a spore level that's that's high enough

2189
01:13:25,119 --> 01:13:29,439
to actually get suppression

2190
01:13:27,359 --> 01:13:32,479
um so you want to buy a reputable source

2191
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:33,759
botanica is a great product for example

2192
01:13:32,479 --> 01:13:36,238
but there's other ones on there that may

2193
01:13:33,760 --> 01:13:37,360
not be as as effective or she mentioned

2194
01:13:36,238 --> 01:13:38,879
there may be a product on the market

2195
01:13:37,359 --> 01:13:39,599
where the spore count

2196
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:41,679
is

2197
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:44,000
is higher than could physically fit by

2198
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:45,199
volume in the container so

2199
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:46,960
um

2200
01:13:45,198 --> 01:13:49,439
it's a little you know the world of

2201
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:51,520
microbials uh and biostimulants is a

2202
01:13:49,439 --> 01:13:54,158
little bit unregulated still at the

2203
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:55,679
moment um so you you want to make sure

2204
01:13:54,158 --> 01:13:57,439
you go on the reputable source there on

2205
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:59,279
the bavaria but it is something that

2206
01:13:57,439 --> 01:14:02,319
works really well for

2207
01:13:59,279 --> 01:14:04,399
dealing with root aphids too so

2208
01:14:02,319 --> 01:14:07,359
just just a little tidbit i've been

2209
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:09,359
learning about lately um

2210
01:14:07,359 --> 01:14:11,759
let's let's talk about uh what you're

2211
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:14,880
most excited about in biocontrols and

2212
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,119
some of the new stuff that you're seeing

2213
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,719
all right well um

2214
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:20,479
you know it's it's a fascinating

2215
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:21,439
industry there's a lot of changes going

2216
01:14:20,479 --> 01:14:23,759
on

2217
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:26,238
um

2218
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:27,679
you know where i see that where i see

2219
01:14:26,238 --> 01:14:29,119
the biggest

2220
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,520
adoption

2221
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:33,920
um and growth in the bike control market

2222
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,760
is is definitely outdoors

2223
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:38,000
typically it was very much a high value

2224
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,239
kind of greenhouse commodity

2225
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:41,840
you know cannabis is its own

2226
01:14:40,238 --> 01:14:43,678
of course came along with very few

2227
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,079
pesticides and and it's been a big

2228
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:47,199
adopter of bio controls and still is

2229
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,679
um

2230
01:14:47,198 --> 01:14:52,158
but where i spend most of my attention

2231
01:14:49,679 --> 01:14:53,119
these days is um on the field ag side of

2232
01:14:52,158 --> 01:14:55,519
things

2233
01:14:53,119 --> 01:14:58,399
um how can we use some of these

2234
01:14:55,520 --> 01:15:00,320
beneficials outdoor for

2235
01:14:58,399 --> 01:15:01,920
food crop production you know in areas

2236
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:04,158
where they really haven't been used

2237
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:05,440
before at least when it comes to putting

2238
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:07,039
them on naturally because they occur

2239
01:15:05,439 --> 01:15:09,279
naturally but

2240
01:15:07,039 --> 01:15:11,198
in terms of actually manipulating them

2241
01:15:09,279 --> 01:15:12,880
and putting them out so that's really

2242
01:15:11,198 --> 01:15:14,399
exciting um

2243
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:16,960
there's a couple of things that i think

2244
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:19,279
driving that one driving that difference

2245
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,039
one is the greater availability of fire

2246
01:15:19,279 --> 01:15:22,880
control agents and

2247
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:25,679
more species available and the costs

2248
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:27,600
because come down in some places

2249
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,480
and then another another technique which

2250
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:32,239
is open that doors is the use of

2251
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:33,919
drones

2252
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,439
there's now a few companies that

2253
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:38,239
specialize in

2254
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:40,559
putting out bugs by drone so growers can

2255
01:15:38,238 --> 01:15:43,039
hire them and they'll pay on a per acre

2256
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:44,560
basis and

2257
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:47,679
you can apply

2258
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:49,840
biocontrol agents to a crop

2259
01:15:47,679 --> 01:15:52,560
you know you could treat 100 acres in a

2260
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:54,079
matter of an hour or two whereas

2261
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:57,600
it just wouldn't be the manpower to do

2262
01:15:54,079 --> 01:15:59,359
it by hand so it's opening the doors um

2263
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,079
as i've seen that happen to a certain

2264
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,960
extent with with phil grown cannabis and

2265
01:16:02,079 --> 01:16:06,880
and hemp um not so much where where i am

2266
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:08,719
but out west

2267
01:16:06,880 --> 01:16:10,640
where there's more field grown

2268
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:12,640
hemp and cannabis then i know that that

2269
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:15,600
is starting to be done

2270
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:16,450
um so that's exciting you know

2271
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:18,560
i also see

2272
01:16:16,449 --> 01:16:20,479
[Music]

2273
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:23,600
more and more adoption and more and more

2274
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:24,639
people i think using biocontrol as well

2275
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,239
um

2276
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,560
not just throwing a few things on and

2277
01:16:26,238 --> 01:16:30,879
then spraying and hoping but actually

2278
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:33,280
like having a good program and

2279
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:34,640
and cannabis is you know some of the

2280
01:16:33,279 --> 01:16:36,319
bigger cannabis growers now are very

2281
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:37,679
knowledgeable you know they they're

2282
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:40,399
great they they really know what they're

2283
01:16:37,679 --> 01:16:41,199
doing and uh

2284
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:42,879
their

2285
01:16:41,198 --> 01:16:45,839
insect identification skills are good

2286
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,039
and they they understand the business so

2287
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,880
um

2288
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:50,960
so that's also exciting to see because i

2289
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:52,640
think just a few years ago there was

2290
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:54,800
perhaps a lot less

2291
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:56,719
um understanding so i you know i credit

2292
01:16:54,800 --> 01:16:59,039
suzanne of course our mutual friend

2293
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,600
suzanne she's she's been one of the

2294
01:16:59,039 --> 01:17:03,279
um leaders in getting good information

2295
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:05,520
out there but

2296
01:17:03,279 --> 01:17:07,119
but yeah yeah it's been it's it's been

2297
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:09,199
exciting and uh

2298
01:17:07,119 --> 01:17:11,920
i'm happy that our you know company has

2299
01:17:09,198 --> 01:17:14,399
been able to um take advantage of some

2300
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:15,840
of the uh some of this industry because

2301
01:17:14,399 --> 01:17:18,079
of course we'll have to make a living

2302
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:18,079
right

2303
01:17:18,319 --> 01:17:22,000
yeah and

2304
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:24,238
uh you know there's very few actual

2305
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:26,479
insectaries out there that are actually

2306
01:17:24,238 --> 01:17:28,799
producing bugs you know bio-b being one

2307
01:17:26,479 --> 01:17:30,399
of them and so you know there's many

2308
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,119
there's many people

2309
01:17:30,399 --> 01:17:35,519
like myself that say are you know

2310
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:38,158
already do or going to be like i am

2311
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:40,080
distributing insects i'm not actually in

2312
01:17:38,158 --> 01:17:42,158
a sector i'm not rearing anything um

2313
01:17:40,079 --> 01:17:44,319
it's actually quite difficult to do from

2314
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:46,639
everything i've learned from suzanne

2315
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:48,238
about the process so

2316
01:17:46,640 --> 01:17:50,480
one thing to mention when people are

2317
01:17:48,238 --> 01:17:51,839
sourcing insects is try to get them

2318
01:17:50,479 --> 01:17:53,519
direct from insectary or from a

2319
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,840
distributor that's going to ship

2320
01:17:53,520 --> 01:17:58,560
directly from the insectary so there's

2321
01:17:55,840 --> 01:18:02,159
other distributors that will receive a

2322
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:05,440
larger population of insects and then

2323
01:18:02,158 --> 01:18:07,198
repackage them and that repackaging

2324
01:18:05,439 --> 01:18:09,839
while maybe convenient for smaller

2325
01:18:07,198 --> 01:18:11,839
growers can reduce the viability of the

2326
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:14,640
insects and it's important that they

2327
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:16,640
arrive hungry and alive so that you get

2328
01:18:14,640 --> 01:18:19,760
the effects that you want so

2329
01:18:16,640 --> 01:18:23,199
i just wanted to touch on that too

2330
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:24,159
yeah yeah but i've seen that definitely

2331
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:27,678
um

2332
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:29,599
with some of the um

2333
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:32,640
some of the online

2334
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:35,120
sources which are very easy to find and

2335
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:36,079
very easy to get bugs shipped um very

2336
01:18:35,119 --> 01:18:39,039
quickly

2337
01:18:36,079 --> 01:18:41,039
but you're right that they do sometimes

2338
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:43,198
get stored for longer than they longer

2339
01:18:41,039 --> 01:18:45,119
than they need to and so getting dead

2340
01:18:43,198 --> 01:18:47,279
bugs is not uh

2341
01:18:45,119 --> 01:18:49,359
it does happen um

2342
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:50,719
so yeah you need to have a good supply

2343
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:51,599
um

2344
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:53,198
and

2345
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:54,960
make sure that what you're getting is

2346
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:56,960
good quality and it's it's fresh and

2347
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:58,480
it's alive and

2348
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:00,319
um

2349
01:18:58,479 --> 01:19:02,319
whether you go work directly with a with

2350
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:04,639
a whether with a

2351
01:19:02,319 --> 01:19:06,719
producer such as ourselves

2352
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,320
um or a distributor that maybe will

2353
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,880
dropship

2354
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:13,359
so that you're still getting

2355
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:15,600
material sent directly from the source

2356
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:18,158
um some things store better than others

2357
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,960
i mean um yeah but when it comes to

2358
01:19:18,158 --> 01:19:24,479
things like predatory mites um

2359
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:26,399
uh priscilla's for example um

2360
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:27,839
they they really need to be fresh you

2361
01:19:26,399 --> 01:19:30,799
don't want them sitting around for more

2362
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:33,039
than a day or two before you use them

2363
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,119
um so yeah that's a great that's a great

2364
01:19:33,039 --> 01:19:36,319
point that's a great point you know it's

2365
01:19:35,119 --> 01:19:37,599
important to work with someone that can

2366
01:19:36,319 --> 01:19:38,639
give you the information you need as

2367
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,239
well as

2368
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:41,039
a good source of

2369
01:19:40,238 --> 01:19:42,959
um

2370
01:19:41,039 --> 01:19:45,519
fresh products

2371
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:47,359
yeah we've been slower on on launching

2372
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,440
this i'm kind of going to time our

2373
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,000
launch with this podcast but there's a

2374
01:19:49,439 --> 01:19:54,479
lot of challenges around it because

2375
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:55,920
one it's having a staff that is

2376
01:19:54,479 --> 01:19:57,919
knowledgeable enough or has the

2377
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:59,199
resources to get the answers to make

2378
01:19:57,920 --> 01:20:00,239
sure that the recommendations are

2379
01:19:59,198 --> 01:20:01,678
accurate

2380
01:20:00,238 --> 01:20:02,718
um

2381
01:20:01,679 --> 01:20:04,800
two it's you know having their

2382
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,719
relationship with with like in our case

2383
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,840
with you guys to make sure that we are

2384
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:10,880
sending things directly from the

2385
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:12,719
insectary we're not playing middlemen on

2386
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:15,760
um receiving packages and sending them

2387
01:20:12,719 --> 01:20:16,960
back out um and and then the most

2388
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:18,800
challenging part

2389
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,239
is the shipping because

2390
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:22,000
these things are alive they need to be

2391
01:20:20,238 --> 01:20:23,519
shipped overnight they can only ship out

2392
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,679
on certain days during the week to make

2393
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:28,320
sure that they arrive

2394
01:20:25,679 --> 01:20:29,840
in a timely fashion and then

2395
01:20:28,319 --> 01:20:31,519
having that information for the growers

2396
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:33,279
so they make sure that they know

2397
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:35,280
you know they're there to receive the

2398
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:37,039
package and know how to apply it there's

2399
01:20:35,279 --> 01:20:38,800
just a lot of steps involved there and a

2400
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:40,000
lot of the cost is shipping so you may

2401
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:42,079
pay more in shipping than you made for

2402
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,359
the insect itself so

2403
01:20:42,079 --> 01:20:45,198
trying to coordinate and make sure that

2404
01:20:43,359 --> 01:20:47,359
the website

2405
01:20:45,198 --> 01:20:49,759
can handle all of that has been a real

2406
01:20:47,359 --> 01:20:49,759
challenge

2407
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,039
and also make sure that the process

2408
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:54,479
works smoothly so that at the end of the

2409
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:56,158
day the customer is getting something

2410
01:20:54,479 --> 01:21:00,079
that is going to

2411
01:20:56,158 --> 01:21:02,479
perform as as it should so

2412
01:21:00,079 --> 01:21:04,238
yeah yeah that's a great point i i would

2413
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:05,119
say if i had to just give one general

2414
01:21:04,238 --> 01:21:07,039
tip

2415
01:21:05,119 --> 01:21:10,158
um you know the people maybe out there

2416
01:21:07,039 --> 01:21:12,000
that are considering using buyers um

2417
01:21:10,158 --> 01:21:14,079
one thing that's really helped that

2418
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,439
really helps the process and work a lot

2419
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,319
more smoothly

2420
01:21:15,439 --> 01:21:17,279
is

2421
01:21:16,319 --> 01:21:19,119
um

2422
01:21:17,279 --> 01:21:20,719
you know rather than going out scouting

2423
01:21:19,119 --> 01:21:22,960
on a monday finding some bugs and then

2424
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:24,399
deciding what you know some pests and

2425
01:21:22,960 --> 01:21:25,760
then deciding on tuesday what you're

2426
01:21:24,399 --> 01:21:28,000
gonna put out and hoping to get them on

2427
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,760
wednesday and then being frustrated when

2428
01:21:28,000 --> 01:21:32,479
you can um

2429
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:34,320
if you can understand what your issues

2430
01:21:32,479 --> 01:21:36,559
are historically going to be in that

2431
01:21:34,319 --> 01:21:38,719
area or what they're likely to be

2432
01:21:36,560 --> 01:21:40,480
and come up with a preventative plan

2433
01:21:38,719 --> 01:21:42,880
that covers those but at least covers

2434
01:21:40,479 --> 01:21:45,919
your basic options you can add

2435
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:46,800
add something down the road if necessary

2436
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,880
but

2437
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:52,560
and then work with someone like yourself

2438
01:21:48,880 --> 01:21:54,719
um to determine how many you need

2439
01:21:52,560 --> 01:21:56,639
and get that order get that on a program

2440
01:21:54,719 --> 01:21:58,639
you know have that ordered every week or

2441
01:21:56,639 --> 01:22:00,800
every other week or something based on

2442
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:03,279
your your production program

2443
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:05,039
and and get it get it set up in advance

2444
01:22:03,279 --> 01:22:07,279
you know that way

2445
01:22:05,039 --> 01:22:08,960
once once you have that the the risk of

2446
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:11,119
delays the risk of things not being

2447
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,560
available the risk of not being able to

2448
01:22:11,119 --> 01:22:14,639
get what you need when you want it is so

2449
01:22:12,560 --> 01:22:16,639
much less and it's just a much more

2450
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,880
reliable program

2451
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:21,039
than just kind of being reactive and

2452
01:22:18,880 --> 01:22:23,279
feeling on a what do i need today kind

2453
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,880
of thing just set it up as a program to

2454
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:26,960
cover you at least cover your basics

2455
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:28,400
your your spider mites

2456
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,480
your thrips if you're going to have them

2457
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:33,519
in the area your fungus mats you know

2458
01:22:30,479 --> 01:22:35,759
cover your basics and and uh set it up

2459
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,040
as a program that's just so much easier

2460
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:38,960
for everyone

2461
01:22:37,039 --> 01:22:41,039
when it comes to shipping

2462
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:43,439
that that's a really really great point

2463
01:22:41,039 --> 01:22:45,600
and um one of the things suzanne and i

2464
01:22:43,439 --> 01:22:47,519
discussed too

2465
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,120
was to have an option for growers that i

2466
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:52,560
was actually gonna i was gonna talk to

2467
01:22:49,119 --> 01:22:54,559
you about uh was to set up a

2468
01:22:52,560 --> 01:22:56,719
a maintenance

2469
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,960
uh option that's maybe a combination of

2470
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:01,198
a few different bio controls that would

2471
01:22:58,960 --> 01:23:03,279
be set up by square footage so that a

2472
01:23:01,198 --> 01:23:04,638
customer could go on the website and say

2473
01:23:03,279 --> 01:23:06,559
i have

2474
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,039
a hundred square feet or a thousand

2475
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:11,199
square feet and then have a given rate

2476
01:23:09,039 --> 01:23:13,039
or package that we could then recommend

2477
01:23:11,198 --> 01:23:15,678
based off of that for

2478
01:23:13,039 --> 01:23:19,119
you know this preventative maintenance

2479
01:23:15,679 --> 01:23:20,719
sort of uh application

2480
01:23:19,119 --> 01:23:23,599
right right and you could potentially

2481
01:23:20,719 --> 01:23:24,480
have a ship a central point of being

2482
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,679
shipped

2483
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,919
you know you could have everything sort

2484
01:23:25,679 --> 01:23:30,639
of shipped as one order and then

2485
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,239
distributed um amongst the various

2486
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:34,159
customers potentially

2487
01:23:32,238 --> 01:23:35,678
you know and that would that would be a

2488
01:23:34,158 --> 01:23:37,599
cheaper way to so you're not shipping

2489
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:39,840
lots of little boxes you're shipping

2490
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:42,000
smaller number of larger boxes

2491
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:43,119
yeah well my thought was you know for a

2492
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,359
given

2493
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:47,920
let's say just a facility or a given

2494
01:23:45,359 --> 01:23:49,599
grow would be to have a combination of a

2495
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:52,319
few different insects that i would know

2496
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:53,679
fit in a certain size box um so then i

2497
01:23:52,319 --> 01:23:56,399
could have the website calculate

2498
01:23:53,679 --> 01:23:59,199
accurately so someone could check out by

2499
01:23:56,399 --> 01:24:01,198
square footage for example and not

2500
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:02,799
necessarily have to worry about having

2501
01:24:01,198 --> 01:24:04,158
to

2502
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,520
figure out exactly what they need

2503
01:24:04,158 --> 01:24:07,519
because we could give them at least a

2504
01:24:05,520 --> 01:24:08,960
good starting

2505
01:24:07,520 --> 01:24:10,719
preventive program for people who want

2506
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:13,439
to start using bio controls that maybe

2507
01:24:10,719 --> 01:24:14,399
had a problem and now we're starting a

2508
01:24:13,439 --> 01:24:15,599
new run

2509
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:17,359
and they know that you know they're

2510
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,239
potentially going to

2511
01:24:17,359 --> 01:24:21,759
see you know they have historical

2512
01:24:20,238 --> 01:24:23,198
historically had to deal with say

2513
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,480
two-spotted or threats or whatever and

2514
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:25,839
we can come up with a sort of a program

2515
01:24:24,479 --> 01:24:26,959
like that they can put out that would be

2516
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,639
a little bit more of a generalist

2517
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:29,279
program

2518
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:31,679
yeah i know that's a great that's a

2519
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:34,319
great idea todd i think we can we can do

2520
01:24:31,679 --> 01:24:36,158
that for you definitely awesome

2521
01:24:34,319 --> 01:24:37,759
sorry i kind of dropped out on the in

2522
01:24:36,158 --> 01:24:39,198
the middle of a podcast for you so i'm

2523
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:41,039
excited uh

2524
01:24:39,198 --> 01:24:42,879
to do that and i i actually talked to

2525
01:24:41,039 --> 01:24:44,960
suzanne about it and she's like

2526
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:46,400
talk to steven and then she'll give her

2527
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:47,840
a thumb of approval and we'll get that

2528
01:24:46,399 --> 01:24:49,839
out on the website

2529
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:52,159
awesome um

2530
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:54,639
so last thing if you have time i

2531
01:24:52,158 --> 01:24:57,039
wanted to just really quickly

2532
01:24:54,639 --> 01:24:59,600
touch on your feed because you mentioned

2533
01:24:57,039 --> 01:25:01,760
you mentioned it briefly and i think

2534
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,760
it's really interesting

2535
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:06,239
that you guys have some ways to feed the

2536
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:08,320
insects the beneficial insects that

2537
01:25:06,238 --> 01:25:10,158
you know people may already have

2538
01:25:08,319 --> 01:25:12,158
bought or may have naturalized in their

2539
01:25:10,158 --> 01:25:14,638
area how would we incorporate that into

2540
01:25:12,158 --> 01:25:14,638
a program

2541
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,960
right so

2542
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,679
one thing i like to do is

2543
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:21,679
for example

2544
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:26,960
when we supply swarovski i like to

2545
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:30,239
recommend the swarovski

2546
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:32,560
version that contains food already

2547
01:25:30,238 --> 01:25:35,759
simply because i've seen you know it it

2548
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,679
just lasts better on the crop it's um

2549
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,079
it's uh

2550
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:41,199
you're providing a food source at the

2551
01:25:40,079 --> 01:25:43,359
time they're put out you don't need to

2552
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:44,960
mix anything it's very straightforward

2553
01:25:43,359 --> 01:25:46,079
so that that would be like an easy way

2554
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,760
to do it

2555
01:25:46,079 --> 01:25:49,600
um

2556
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:53,119
and it can also that can work with

2557
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:55,039
aureus as as well as cucumeris as well

2558
01:25:53,119 --> 01:25:57,119
so that that's really the simplest way

2559
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:59,119
to do it there are other feed products

2560
01:25:57,119 --> 01:26:01,760
as well on the market people can

2561
01:25:59,119 --> 01:26:03,119
experiment with but um

2562
01:26:01,760 --> 01:26:04,320
i think you know

2563
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:06,000
people don't want to do anything that's

2564
01:26:04,319 --> 01:26:07,759
necessarily more complicated if you can

2565
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,119
just get a different bottle that

2566
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,719
contains what

2567
01:26:09,119 --> 01:26:12,479
a food source in it

2568
01:26:10,719 --> 01:26:13,840
um

2569
01:26:12,479 --> 01:26:15,678
and you're working with a crop that's

2570
01:26:13,840 --> 01:26:18,079
pretty clean so you you don't have a

2571
01:26:15,679 --> 01:26:20,719
whole lot of pests for your beneficials

2572
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:22,559
to feed on then i find that just makes

2573
01:26:20,719 --> 01:26:24,000
sense you know it's just it's not a huge

2574
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:25,920
cost increase

2575
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,880
um and i've just seen the results in the

2576
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:31,119
field work work so much better

2577
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:32,719
so if i had if i had a small grow i

2578
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:34,479
could order

2579
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:36,079
the

2580
01:26:34,479 --> 01:26:38,000
you know the insects i need whether

2581
01:26:36,079 --> 01:26:40,880
that's you know swerve geek commerce the

2582
01:26:38,000 --> 01:26:43,198
lacewing aureus and then

2583
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:44,239
get this uh bioware feed at the same

2584
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,479
time

2585
01:26:44,238 --> 01:26:48,238
save on this you know massive shipping

2586
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:50,559
cost and maybe keep them alive a little

2587
01:26:48,238 --> 01:26:53,519
longer by shaking out some of the uh

2588
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:55,039
direct directly applying the feed

2589
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:57,360
you know to the leaf surface so to keep

2590
01:26:55,039 --> 01:26:58,479
the plant to keep the insects alive a

2591
01:26:57,359 --> 01:27:00,639
little longer i guess is what i'm

2592
01:26:58,479 --> 01:27:02,238
getting at extending the tree between

2593
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:04,079
orders

2594
01:27:02,238 --> 01:27:05,839
right right absolutely so yes you can

2595
01:27:04,079 --> 01:27:07,760
just buy the feed by itself and apply

2596
01:27:05,840 --> 01:27:08,960
some to the crop when you when you're um

2597
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:11,760
applying

2598
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:13,679
um if you're using a blower you can just

2599
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:15,760
add it to the mix that you're blowing

2600
01:27:13,679 --> 01:27:19,600
out assuming of what you're blowing out

2601
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:23,679
was compatible with the feed um

2602
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,679
so those are two ways to do it and

2603
01:27:24,479 --> 01:27:29,439
you know i i would definitely i might

2604
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:31,920
not necessarily do that in in flour

2605
01:27:29,439 --> 01:27:34,638
because of you know risky contamination

2606
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:36,399
but definitely in veg um

2607
01:27:34,639 --> 01:27:38,560
if you're using if you're putting out

2608
01:27:36,399 --> 01:27:41,119
predatory mites and lacewings and aureus

2609
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:42,880
and things like that in veg

2610
01:27:41,119 --> 01:27:45,039
add a few dollars and put some of this

2611
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:46,560
feed in it really it makes a big

2612
01:27:45,039 --> 01:27:48,000
difference to

2613
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:50,400
the length of time that your buyers can

2614
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:53,119
survive and how effective they'll be

2615
01:27:50,399 --> 01:27:54,879
so i've really i've already seen it it

2616
01:27:53,119 --> 01:27:57,119
worked very very effectively in that

2617
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:59,199
situation

2618
01:27:57,119 --> 01:28:00,800
awesome well i i really appreciate your

2619
01:27:59,198 --> 01:28:02,238
time today we've already

2620
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,760
gone longer because this was sort of a

2621
01:28:02,238 --> 01:28:05,119
complicated podcast so i really

2622
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,719
