00:00:17,679 --> 00:00:21,759
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:23,920
science podcast i'm your host tadd

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,679
hussey of kiss organics this is the

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,199
podcast where we discuss the cutting

6
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:29,358
edge of growing from a science-based

7
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,800
perspective and drawn top experts from

8
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
around the industry to share their

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000
wisdom and knowledge

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,399
this week i had the pleasure of chatting

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
with samuel hilfer sam is a 10-year

12
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,640
cannabis industry professional and

13
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,558
current head grower of proof cultivar

14
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,719
sam is finishing an agronomy degree at

15
00:00:42,558 --> 00:00:46,558
oregon state university and focuses

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,558
primarily on nutrient management

17
00:00:46,558 --> 00:00:49,599
irrigation techniques and cannabis crop

18
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:51,439
production

19
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,439
sam has created a novel cultivation

20
00:00:51,439 --> 00:00:55,280
model at proof cultivar while building

21
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:57,519
one of the most advanced and informative

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,000
data sets on cannabis nutrient values to

23
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,920
date sam's long-term goals include

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,319
establishing optimal nutrient ranges for

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,680
cannabis creating an open platform for

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,839
industry professionals to share

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,439
knowledge and to continue pursuing a

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,520
lifelong passion for researching

29
00:01:09,438 --> 00:01:14,879
cannabis cultivation now on to the show

30
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:17,118
hey sam thanks for coming on the show

31
00:01:14,879 --> 00:01:17,118
today

32
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:20,239
absolutely thanks for having me happy to

33

be here

34
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,759
yeah i'm excited we get a chance to talk

35
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:26,478
i know i got to come down and visit your

36
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,879
facility a few months ago now and see

37
00:01:26,478 --> 00:01:30,640
you guys in production but uh

38
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,560
let's go ahead and give listeners a

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,599
little background into uh who you are

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,600
and what you do over at proof

41
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,239
yeah absolutely so my name is sam

42
00:01:37,519 --> 00:01:43,199
hoelsler i'm currently a head grower at

43
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:45,280
proof cultivar in portland oregon

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,240
we're pretty large indoor organic

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,879
cannabis facility and my background with

46
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:53,039
cannabis is a little over 10 years now

47
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:54,959
grew up in pennsylvania and was

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,719
introduced to cannabis pretty early on

49
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:59,679
and started to grow almost immediately

50
00:01:58,718 --> 00:02:01,519
they've kind of bounced around the

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
country you're operating a number of

52
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:04,879
different facilities from working with

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,040
penn state and tissue culture and

54
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:10,560
greenhouses there to

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,560
southern oregon and large 50-acre

56
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,080
cannabis and hemp operations and

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,598
mushroom cultivation down in southern

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,440
california and

59
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:20,799
i bounced around and ended up at proof a

60
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,959
little over a year and a half ago

61
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,439
and have been working ever since to try

62
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,120
to revolutionize and overhaul the the

63
00:02:25,439 --> 00:02:28,239
cultivation model that was going on

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
there and

65
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:36,120
have since landed on a new program um

66
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:36,119
part of it uh due to kiss organization

67
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:40,800
yeah now in portland oregon and

68
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:42,079
having a blast and operating one of the

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,319
greatest facilities i've got to work

70
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,319
with

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,039
yeah this facility is uh

72
00:02:46,878 --> 00:02:51,199
quite technologically advanced in a lot

73
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,598
of ways and yet you guys are also facing

74
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:55,199
some other challenges um

75
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:56,799
because of the way the facility was

76
00:02:55,199 --> 00:02:58,079
generally laid out

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,519
i was going to get into this later but

78
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
since you mentioned the technological

79
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,200
aspect let's just you want to kind of

80
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,479
describe some of those things that you

81
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:08,079
have at proof and how

82
00:03:06,479 --> 00:03:09,759
you know how they've been either useful

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,040
or not as useful as you would have

84
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:14,000
thought when they were originally

85
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:14,000
installed years ago

86
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:18,559
yeah that's a really um interesting

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,680
topic proof kind of started out with

88
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,840
this really grand ideal of being able to

89
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,560
take cannabis cultivation to the next

90
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,158
level of scientific production and

91
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,080
technological production and so there

92
00:03:28,158 --> 00:03:32,318
was a lot of automation

93
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,879
early on back in the day from

94
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,479
custom-built robots that lift trays up

95
00:03:34,878 --> 00:03:38,479
and down and move them along transfer

96
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,199
line systems to

97
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:43,598
auto pot washers and auto dirt fillers

98
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:45,759
auto planters kind of

99
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:48,158
the whole purpose was to be able to

100
00:03:45,759 --> 00:03:50,000
stage plants get them in a room and then

101
00:03:48,158 --> 00:03:51,679
the automation kind of takes care of the

102
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,840
rest and

103
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,438
for all the ambition i think most

104
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,598
cannabis growers that have grown for a

105
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:59,438
number of years know that it's

106
00:03:57,598 --> 00:04:01,359
really hard to automate a human touch

107
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:03,680
when it comes to cannabis cultivation

108
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,319
and being able to produce

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,840
really great craft quality cannabis

110
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:10,479
automated just isn't something that's

111
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,560
always worked out and so we've

112
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:14,959
slowly and quite painfully over the year

113
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,358
kind of ripped out all of the initial

114
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,879
automation and gone back to just

115
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,039
hands-on labor and hands-on process and

116
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:25,680
at this point in the grow everything is

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,199
done by hand everything from propagation

118
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,639
to

119
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,720
about half of our watering to

120
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,879
transplanting and pruning and topping

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,040
harvesting weighing

122
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,918
packaging trimming everything is done by

123
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,439
hand

124
00:04:37,918 --> 00:04:41,279
there's really

125
00:04:39,439 --> 00:04:42,879
not a lot of automation that goes on at

126
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:45,279
all i think the

127
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,680
the little bit of you know technology

128
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:50,239
that we do utilize now is

129
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,199
is more for data collection and trying

130
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,400
to

131
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
control

132
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:56,719
everything around the plants rather than

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,720
the plants themselves so we work really

134
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,639
hard to use some custom

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,400
operating systems and softwares for our

136
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,759
climate control to

137
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:06,399
to deliver

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,400
accurate climates and set points

139
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:09,839
to the rooms themselves and then to

140
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:12,239
collect some really high-end data

141
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:14,239
regarding irrigation and try to bring

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,000
some of these new crop steering

143
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,240
principles and merge them into an

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
organic methodology

145
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,319
and make them work so it's this really

146
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,240
interesting blend of

147
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:27,199
starting out at high technology and then

148
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,639
kind of working our way backwards to

149
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
really where the basics are at and

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,639
trying to utilize some of the

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,720
the basic agronomic technology that's

152
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,759
been around for a number of years things

153
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:39,600
like tanziometers is super important in

154
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,400
the program that i've that i've designed

155
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
and

156
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:44,319
just

157
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,800
automated irrigation as much as possible

158
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,399
through trip lines and climate control

159
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
and being able to track those trends has

160
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:53,439
been really impactful versus

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
you know things that i haven't

162
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:58,319
found to be worth the money or you know

163
00:05:55,279 --> 00:06:00,399
the auto fillers the auto pots

164
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,800
things that

165
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:05,679
try to automate the labor aspect of it

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,600
for you it's really difficult to

167
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,840
to eliminate that from your program i

168
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,840
found

169
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,960
yeah you're one of the few facilities

170
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,280
i've seen that's kind of gone the other

171
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:16,959
way where you you started like highly

172
00:06:15,279 --> 00:06:18,719
technologically advanced and actually

173
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:21,359
have moved the other direction as you

174
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,000
guys have tried to pursue better craft

175
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,199
cannabis which is really interesting and

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,240
um

177
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:29,919
the other thing that i would possibly

178
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,000
highlight is you know a lot of the stuff

179
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:32,959
that's used

180
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,519
horticulturally

181
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,399
as technological tools don't necessarily

182
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:40,318
translate as well to cannabis um

183
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,679
it seems like uh

184
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,479
some of the plants and and you can

185
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,840
correct me on this if i'm wrong um

186
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:47,519
cannabis seems to be a little bit more

187
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:49,519
sensitive in terms of how it's handled

188
00:06:47,519 --> 00:06:52,159
versus some of these other uh you know

189
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:53,918
ornamental ornamental crops that we're

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,120
mass producing for the

191
00:06:53,918 --> 00:06:56,399
you know in these greenhouses and

192
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,280
industries what

193
00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:00,799
what are your experiences with it right

194
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:02,478
yeah that's

195
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
it's more

196
00:07:02,478 --> 00:07:07,120
difficult to

197
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,199
uniformly take technology and just apply

198
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,959
it to cannabis you know with with

199
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,000
ornamentals and these mass-produced

200
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:16,399
crops in greenhouses there's

201
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,399
kind of this one-size-fits-all

202
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:21,359
method to technology you come in and you

203
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:23,839
just create a uniform environment across

204
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,120
the entire space

205
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:26,799
and you're able to do all of your

206
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,800
processes without really having to

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,439
change much versus cannabis is very you

208
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,038
know every plant is is unique and alive

209
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,279
and growing and individual and the way

210
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:37,519
you shape it and form it

211
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:39,679
and work with it over its life cycle

212
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:40,478
really impacts the product on the on the

213
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,079
end

214
00:07:40,478 --> 00:07:44,478
and it's actively changing in its

215
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,639
climate i mean the climate change from

216
00:07:44,478 --> 00:07:50,878
propagation to veg to flower to mid

217
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,478
late and early flowers just

218
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,080
it's really different all the way

219
00:07:52,478 --> 00:07:55,598
through and so

220
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,758
there yeah you're right there's not a

221
00:07:55,598 --> 00:07:59,360
lot that you can take from

222
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,680
maybe these mass-produced industries

223
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,560
that have been around for much longer

224
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,400
and try to adopt that technology and and

225
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,918
furthermore it makes it a bit of a

226
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:10,560
challenge because

227
00:08:07,918 --> 00:08:13,120
these days most large companies whether

228
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,879
it be ornamentals or other

229
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,560
you know mass-produced farms they're

230
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
trying to

231
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
focus on the the money side of it first

232
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,598
they're trying to be as economical as

233
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,000
possible and it's really hard to take

234
00:08:21,598 --> 00:08:25,759
that and apply it to an organic

235
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,598
setting you know i've run into this

236
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,479
issue with

237
00:08:27,598 --> 00:08:32,240
trying to adopt volumetric water content

238
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:34,639
measurements and

239
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:37,918
things of that nature to

240
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:40,000
kind of a container-grown soilless media

241
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:42,399
for cannabis it just doesn't always work

242
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,639
out the same and so there's a lot of

243
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,759
adoption and adaption that has to happen

244
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,199
whenever you

245
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,720
try to take something from another

246
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,720
industry and apply it to cannabis

247
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,278
yeah and let's be clear your

248
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:57,679
your yields are are still quite good i

249
00:08:55,278 --> 00:08:59,600
believe you guys are the top producer in

250
00:08:57,679 --> 00:09:01,838
oregon i think is what jeremy was

251
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,120
telling me um if i remember correctly

252
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,040
yeah

253
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,200
we're still pretty good it's been a up

254
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:11,679
and down roller coaster for 2020 we were

255
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,278
the largest indoor producer by volume

256
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:15,199
like how much we produce for the

257
00:09:13,278 --> 00:09:17,360
majority of the year and

258
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
it gets a little difficult late season

259
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,759
when all these outdoor farms start

260
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,759
coming in and mass producing crops but

261
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:25,439
it it took a long while maybe a little

262
00:09:23,759 --> 00:09:27,200
bit of history about the grow as we we

263
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,839
didn't start out organic we started out

264
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:32,959
as a mineral two-part fertilizer you

265
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,320
know 52 gallon pots on a single tray and

266
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,479
it wasn't good

267
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,440
and then jeremy um brought in a

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,278
wonderful cultivation design jeremy plum

269
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,399
for those wondering

270
00:09:41,278 --> 00:09:44,720
and

271
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,799
created a really awesome organic program

272
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,120
and it took about two years to just to

273
00:09:46,799 --> 00:09:51,199
reach this point where it was

274
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:54,320
extremely dialed in and record-breaking

275
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,640
and hitting just massive number output

276
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
from our rooms and really happy with it

277
00:09:56,639 --> 00:09:59,360
and

278
00:09:57,679 --> 00:10:01,519
we're kind of diving into another topic

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,919
here but we we went through some pretty

280
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,200
massive changes in 2021 that were forced

281
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,039
upon us that

282
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,519
is inevitably how we ended up in this

283
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,719
new program to

284
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,480
to

285
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,160
really have to work our way backwards

286
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,240
and try to reach those numbers again and

287
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,000
it's been extremely difficult but

288
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
really happy with where we're at yields

289
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,278
are

290
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,278
are doing really well and um yeah happy

291
00:10:21,278 --> 00:10:24,639
to kind of walk through that transition

292
00:10:23,278 --> 00:10:27,439
that we had to go through if you want to

293
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:28,879
dive down that rabbit hole

294
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
yeah i think that's a good segue i do

295
00:10:28,879 --> 00:10:33,200
want to come back and talk to you about

296
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:36,480
what technological uh tools you found

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,720
are most useful in your grow so i i just

298
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,159
want to shelve that one but

299
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,680
i remember jeremy reached out to me

300
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:43,919
towards the end of last year a little

301
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:45,759
bit panicked like hey we need soil right

302
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:48,000
away um

303
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,319
we were fortunately able to get you guys

304
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,078
what you needed at the time but

305
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,640
basically and i'm not going to name any

306
00:10:52,078 --> 00:10:58,559
names here but you had been working

307
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:59,679
with a bottled nutrient line and

308
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,479
apparently they changed their

309
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,278
formulation during covid without telling

310
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,440
you

311
00:11:03,278 --> 00:11:07,439
and as i understand that created very

312
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,880
high levels of chlorides

313
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:12,880
uh in the in the soil or in your in your

314
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:15,278
solution and that um you want to talk a

315
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,559
little bit about what effects that had

316
00:11:15,278 --> 00:11:18,078
on the plants for people who aren't

317
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:21,278
familiar with

318
00:11:18,078 --> 00:11:22,719
uh chloride toxicities or yeah yeah

319
00:11:21,278 --> 00:11:25,600
it was

320
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,959
it was a really interesting situation um

321
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,560
like you said we have been using the

322
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:30,799
same program for about two or three

323
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:33,439
years we were using basically an inert

324
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:35,120
media that was cocoa and peat paste

325
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,040
and then we were using

326
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,959
bottled nutrients

327
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:40,799
and at the same time you know peak

328
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,559
demand was just through the roof and one

329
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:44,319
of the really big key producers in

330
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:46,399
canada had a bog fire

331
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,600
heat supply was just massively low and

332
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,759
they were scraping the bottom of the

333
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,839
barrel and the product we were getting

334
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:54,078
in was just like cake flour it was

335
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,480
powder there was just nothing to it that

336
00:11:54,078 --> 00:11:58,078
was allowing good growth and we put in

337
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,759
an order and they basically canceled it

338
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:02,159
and said sorry we can't supply you and

339
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:03,360
we only had eight weeks of supply left

340
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:05,120
so

341
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,879
soil media kind of being the foundation

342
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,560
of the program it was really difficult

343
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:11,600
to take them back okay we have to build

344
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:14,159
something new within eight weeks it was

345
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,759
a really scary endeavor which i think is

346
00:12:14,159 --> 00:12:17,278
you know when we gave you a call and we

347
00:12:15,759 --> 00:12:18,480
started to really pursue all those

348
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:20,159
options and

349
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,839
yeah at the same time i had been

350
00:12:20,159 --> 00:12:23,759
tracking for about six months before

351
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,959
this implant health issues seeing really

352
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,879
just

353
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,799
necrotic tissue starting to form

354
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:30,159
yellowing leaves that just died back

355
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,159
just rapid

356
00:12:30,159 --> 00:12:35,120
burning browning of the leaves that get

357
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,039
super crispy and it was really scary and

358
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,919
at the time i'm taking tests and i'm

359
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:40,480
doing

360
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:41,519
soil tests and sap analysis and tissue

361
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,879
tests and

362
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:47,519
i i was seeing ppm levels of chloride up

363
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:48,720
in the six seven eight thousand ppms in

364
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,120
the tissue

365
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,120
and the plants were just dying back

366
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,159
massively and it was terrifying to deal

367
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,120
with and

368
00:12:54,159 --> 00:12:59,838
i tested everything from our nutrients

369
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,720
to our supply lines our recipes our soil

370
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:05,040
every single cultivar our plant sap

371
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,759
soil solution saturated paste or you

372
00:13:05,039 --> 00:13:09,759
know an m3 test i went down a rabbit

373
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:12,480
hole of tests i even tested you know the

374
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,838
piping between our rooms to see

375
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,079
what is being

376
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:18,320
scraped away from potentially metallic

377
00:13:16,078 --> 00:13:20,879
pipes and stuff and

378
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,399
circle back around and conclusively

379
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,919
prove that the issue was with this

380
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,679
fertilizer that we were buying and i

381
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,078
reached out and they just you know flat

382
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:31,039
out denied it and and six to nine months

383
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,958
later come back around spring of 2021

384
00:13:31,039 --> 00:13:34,559
we're kind of faced with this issue and

385
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:37,278
jeremy and i ended up meeting with some

386
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:39,119
of the executives of that company

387
00:13:37,278 --> 00:13:41,039
and showed them like hey this is a

388
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,480
really big issue and they confided to us

389
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:43,838
that they did in fact change their

390
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,680
recipe and

391
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,440
they didn't really think it was going to

392
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:49,439
affect growers and

393
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,360
lo and behold it had a massive effect on

394
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,360
our output and the value of the company

395
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,199
and and how everything was going so we

396
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,120
ended up in this position of

397
00:13:55,198 --> 00:13:59,198
of having to completely change our

398
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,120
program from soil to nutrient and

399
00:13:59,198 --> 00:14:05,519
fertilizer and do all of it in about two

400
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,278
months time period and we were coming

401
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:09,198
off our biggest year ever just a

402
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:10,159
record-breaking year from 2020 and

403
00:14:09,198 --> 00:14:12,479
having

404
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:13,838
you know incredible output really happy

405
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,759
with where we were positioned in the

406
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:19,040
industry and now suddenly our whole

407
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:21,278
program just like crumbled in our hands

408
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:23,198
and we um we kind of took a step back

409
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:24,799
jeremy and i and we had a

410
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:26,000
i remember one day we were sitting in

411
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:28,319
the office and we had a really great

412
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,839
conversation about you know what is the

413
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,839
future of proof and where do we want to

414
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,760
take this brand and and what are our

415
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,680
core values and we agreed upon that we

416
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,519
wanted to stay organic but

417
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:39,039
in in this day and age i think jeremy

418
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:41,360
and i both agree that organic is never

419
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:42,799
really enough we want to move in a more

420
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,839
sustainable

421
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,198
model a a more advanced method it's

422
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,600
there's so many brands that just tack

423
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:50,879
organic onto their their label and it

424
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,399
doesn't really

425
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:55,198
mean much it doesn't mean it's you know

426
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,278
ecologically what's best for um

427
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:58,879
the planet so we

428
00:14:57,278 --> 00:15:00,879
we definitely

429
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:03,039
decided upon early on that we wanted to

430
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:04,480
go with living soil and we talked to a

431
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:06,879
number of different people and we called

432
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,360
you and had great conversation and

433
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:10,879
really happy with the soil and

434
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,399
i think one of the biggest issues that

435
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,919
came up is uh

436
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,559
you know the first challenge was

437
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:19,039
container sizes our our facility was

438
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:20,719
designed for two gallon pots and

439
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,958
the program that we had been running for

440
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,399
three years was three gallon pots and

441
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:26,479
now we're forced with this issue of

442
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,720
living soil which you know we're being

443
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,079
told should probably be grown in you

444
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,920
know 20 30 30 gallon pots or beds

445
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:35,439
ideally and

446
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,519
i think that was a really difficult

447
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,320
situation that we just kind of had to

448
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:42,799
trust our ability to figure it out and i

449
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,360
know you're curious about that container

450
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:48,399
pot issue as well and

451
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,240
yeah it's been a long road and now we

452
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,360
settled in 10 gallon pots with a really

453
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,879
interesting

454
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,120
method of kind of using traditional

455
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,838
fertilizers still through drip injection

456
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,679
and

457
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,199
how they kind of match the depletion of

458
00:15:57,679 --> 00:16:00,479
the soil with what we're putting in and

459
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:02,559
it's been a very

460
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,839
fascinating process i can

461
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,838
you want to talk about that or if you

462
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,959
want me to go back and

463
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
yeah

464
00:16:06,958 --> 00:16:10,319
think i think we can go right into that

465
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:13,039
i will just add that

466
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,519
normally um well so let me give a little

467
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,838
more context here um just from and

468
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:20,399
correctly if i get this wrong uh one of

469
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:24,160
the one of jeremy plum's big goals with

470
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:26,000
proof it was to create consistent

471
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:28,319
uh

472
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,078
consistent chemo type expression so if

473
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
you were a medical patient walking into

474
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,000
a store and you wanted

475
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,480
to and you let's say you had really good

476
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,320
results from this particular cultivar

477
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,360
that proof produced

478
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,879
you know jeremy would be able to

479
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:43,199
confidently say that he's going to have

480
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,600
the exact same result every you know

481
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:47,359
batch after batch and that that tends to

482
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,759
push you away from living soils and

483
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,680
towards uh you know a bottled nutrient

484
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:53,839
or a program where you can control every

485
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:55,278
aspect of the plant's fertility whereas

486
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,040
with living soils we're giving up a

487
00:16:55,278 --> 00:16:58,958
little bit of that control um and

488
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:01,360
counting on the microbes in nature to

489
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:03,278
sort of handle that for us so that's

490
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,279
that's a little context as to why proof

491
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:06,880
was growing the way they were growing

492
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,318
and normally too you know jeremy and i

493
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,600
talked about this and sam you and i

494
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,959
talked about how

495
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,719
you know this wasn't the ideal way to

496
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,480
make a switch over into another

497
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,519
production system normally you'd run

498
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,360
trials

499
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:18,959
you you know you run one room and see

500
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,798
how it performed and collect all that

501
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,880
data and then look to improve it make

502
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:24,480
sure the workflows make sense and sops

503
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:26,000
for your current staff

504
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,759
but um

505
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,000
you weren't able to do all that you kind

506
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:33,919
of had to make the make it yeah

507
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,679
did we jumped right off the deep end i

508
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:38,080
mean we were

509
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:40,000
we didn't even really have time to do

510
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:42,319
many trials or really any trials we kind

511
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,160
of we initially tried to sneak a couple

512
00:17:42,319 --> 00:17:45,359
into some production crops to trade here

513
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,880
or tray there and we we're just like

514
00:17:45,359 --> 00:17:49,359
yeah this isn't really working and it's

515
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,440
like you know we have one crop left of

516
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:53,678
our old soil of our old program like we

517
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:56,480
have to make a decision now and exactly

518
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,559
what you said yeah jeremy um his vision

519
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,480
with proof was always have a very

520
00:17:58,558 --> 00:18:02,240
consistent product for the end consumer

521
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,279
and that's still really important to us

522
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,599
and

523
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:07,918
i would say we're still able to hit that

524
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:10,480
even in the new program and it's

525
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:11,840
been one of probably the most difficult

526
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,839
um

527
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,359
things to really target is just to

528
00:18:13,839 --> 00:18:17,519
balance those minerals and that

529
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:19,759
nutrition for the plant so that the end

530
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:22,079
product you're getting is

531
00:18:19,759 --> 00:18:23,359
really really accurate with with what

532
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:25,439
we're saying it is and just the

533
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:26,240
consistency is there every single time

534
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,038
so

535
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:32,400
yeah it was a big leap of faith um but

536
00:18:29,038 --> 00:18:34,000
happily we've we've worked through it um

537
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,519
and so we went from

538
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,759
an old inert

539
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:40,079
you know three gallon pot highly liquid

540
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:41,519
injected inline injection drip system

541
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,759
where they're just getting

542
00:18:41,519 --> 00:18:46,960
a lot of organic

543
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:47,679
liquid feed to using a 10 gallon pot and

544
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,120
we

545
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,640
we ran the first crop we threw the

546
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:52,479
plants in and we're like okay you know a

547
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,720
10 gallon pot

548
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,240
as much as we want to do water only it

549
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,839
we know it's probably not going to last

550
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,160
on nutrients for the size our plants

551
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:01,678
grow and so at what point does it start

552
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,679
to deplete and at what point do we have

553
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,160
to kind of lift it and pick it up with

554
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:07,840
these fertilizers and that was a really

555
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
big question for us that we just didn't

556
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:11,839
have the answer into and so we kind of

557
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
crossed our fingers through a whole crop

558
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:15,439
into the pots and

559
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,798
immediately the plants love the soil i

560
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,240
mean they just started out looking

561
00:19:16,798 --> 00:19:20,240
awesome and

562
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,759
i started taking data and collecting

563
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,359
tissue and soil samples and just

564
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:24,640
recording this all and plotting it all

565
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:26,639
in crafts and

566
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,880
and really keeping an eye on it and then

567
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,520
about that same time frame we reached

568
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,200
out and we're talking to bryant mason um

569
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:35,440
soil doctor and had

570
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,600
really great conversation kind of

571
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,200
triangulating between you

572
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,798
jeremy and i and him

573
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,720
and

574
00:19:40,798 --> 00:19:44,639
we kind of just established that let's

575
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:47,679
get away from the bottle nutrients let's

576
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,679
kind of go go way back to just the basis

577
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:51,840
of fertilizer from

578
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,679
organic products and just and using

579
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:55,199
powders and you know every single one of

580
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,120
these bottled products come from these

581
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,440
raw sources anyway so

582
00:19:57,119 --> 00:20:01,359
let's just skip the whole liquid

583
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,880
injection and shipping this you know

584
00:20:01,359 --> 00:20:05,199
massive weight around the country this

585
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,880
massive freight you know shipping carbon

586
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,080
footprint around the country and just go

587
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,679
back to the basis and use this

588
00:20:08,079 --> 00:20:11,678
fertilizer so

589
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,120
we went back and now we use pretty much

590
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
everything attached to the sulfate you

591
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,879
know gypsum

592
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,600
epsom salt just

593
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,120
really basic stuff and so

594
00:20:19,599 --> 00:20:23,119
when we switch to this new program with

595
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,279
the living soil we're doing 10 gallon

596
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:26,719
pots and it's working phenomenally and i

597
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:29,678
think that's something that's really

598
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:31,360
unique and rare for an indoor

599
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:34,400
grower especially in an organic setting

600
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:36,959
to use a 10 gallon pot in a living soil

601
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,400
with minimal fertilizer inputs and have

602
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:43,200
it work as well as it's working for us

603
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:45,280
i really started by just observing

604
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:48,798
where our depletion was at on specific

605
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:51,279
nutrients on specific time frames so

606
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:53,038
in my program i track and trace every

607
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:55,359
single analyte you know whether it's

608
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:57,759
calcium and nitrogen or potassium

609
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:59,678
phosphorus manganese iron

610
00:20:57,759 --> 00:21:01,599
i track every single element

611
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,280
in every cultivar in every room

612
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:04,798
basically every single week and then i

613
00:21:03,279 --> 00:21:06,558
plot those

614
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,319
on a graph and i have rolling averages

615
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:09,759
that i that i track and trace and the

616
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:12,158
dashboards see

617
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,200
how we trend on a weekly basis and then

618
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,360
you know i've

619
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,640
grabbed what sufficiency ranges exist

620
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,558
out there for hemp and i've kind of

621
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,400
adapted them to cannabis and then set

622
00:21:18,558 --> 00:21:22,000
some of our own to really

623
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
establish where we want to be at for

624
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,038
those ranges

625
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:26,798
and then

626
00:21:25,038 --> 00:21:29,038
the hardest part was you know how much

627
00:21:26,798 --> 00:21:30,960
do we put in to kind of either step

628
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,200
these nutrients up or step them down

629
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,079
based on the trends of of what the plant

630
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,679
needs

631
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:40,558
in its specific lifestyle cycle phase so

632
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:42,640
you know as the plant goes through flour

633
00:21:40,558 --> 00:21:44,879
you know it may start to need less and

634
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,240
less nitrogen it may want to use more

635
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,000
mag it may up take more mag so how do we

636
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
not only balance what we're putting in

637
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,919
and our concentrations and how much is

638
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,440
going into the soil but how do we

639
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:58,159
balance what's being depleted out of the

640
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,720
kiss already and that was

641
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,880
a pretty big challenge for me and a

642
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
massive learning curve as i kind of work

643
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,840
through those problems and we're

644
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,640
about

645
00:22:05,839 --> 00:22:10,720
nine months into the program now and and

646
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
about five percent lower on yields than

647
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,960
we were in the old one after three years

648
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,880
so extremely happy with where we're at

649
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,880
product quality is just

650
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:22,880
through the roof our thc scores have

651
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:24,960
gone up from 19 to 27 on average

652
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,280
a lot of new genetics that we're working

653
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,519
with just really happy with the program

654
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,440
but it is entirely

655
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,558
novel and new in my opinion what we're

656
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,400
doing i've

657
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,720
i talked about this a lot at work that

658
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
we've kind of just grabbed from so many

659
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,240
other

660
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:41,439
methods of cultivation and made it work

661
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,640
in one

662
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,360
i'm kind of getting back to the

663
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,640
technology side of things i think

664
00:22:45,359 --> 00:22:49,759
it's

665
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:51,440
really easy to focus on technology when

666
00:22:49,759 --> 00:22:53,839
you're doing hydro and when you're doing

667
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,000
cocoa you know mineral fertilizers going

668
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,558
in i mean there's a number of companies

669
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,240
out there these days um

670
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,918
that are just focused on volumetric

671
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
water content and crop steering as a

672
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,240
whole and they're really precise and

673
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,000
just watching your ec and your dry backs

674
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,440
and doing all these really accurate

675
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,440
measurements

676
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,120
and when i first started looking into

677
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,720
that you know i was like okay this is

678
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:17,119
really great information but does this

679
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,440
even work in organics and

680
00:23:17,119 --> 00:23:21,918
from what i found the principles of it

681
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,759
do but the sensors and the data that you

682
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:26,159
need to actually drive and make those

683
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,558
decisions are not the same so

684
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,480
piggybacking off of kind of some of the

685
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:33,279
initial stuff that brian introduced to

686
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:35,519
us we we went way back to just original

687
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:38,399
orometer tensiometers and

688
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:40,400
we go we use those to really

689
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,080
match our attention in our to our

690
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
drybacks rather than volumetric water

691
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,359
content you know with our soil we have

692
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:46,079
to pay attention to our matrix potential

693
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:48,158
and

694
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:50,079
and really

695
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,640
play up you know keep an eye on that

696
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:54,480
data and play a pivotal role in when we

697
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,000
want to trigger certain developments in

698
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,360
the crop cycle

699
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,880
when we want to trigger them to flower

700
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,879
when we want them to bulk when we want

701
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,720
them to finish and the maturation the

702
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,720
morphology we can control a lot of these

703
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,159
things based off tension alone

704
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,079
um and then

705
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,960
you know how much water we have to put

706
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:12,480
in in order to hit those specific drive

707
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,640
backs with tension rather than

708
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,079
volumetric water content so

709
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,400
we've kind of

710
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:20,798
had this original automated facility

711
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,720
that we switched to a living soil that's

712
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:24,960
all hand crafted

713
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,159
and we're using you know outdoor quote

714
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,640
unquote technologies like ten theometers

715
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,559
indoor with small containers 10 gallons

716
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,840
and using classic powdered fertilizers

717
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:37,038
with a batch tank mixing system and

718
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,839
it's this

719
00:24:37,038 --> 00:24:42,000
very crazy model that we've been able to

720
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:44,000
build and work and

721
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,159
not only just get to work but

722
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,960
hit record-breaking yields again hit you

723
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,720
know record-breaking thc levels just

724
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,600
greatly improve our quality from a

725
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,278
program that was so well-defined before

726
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:57,359
and do it all within

727
00:24:55,278 --> 00:25:00,720
about six months

728
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:02,798
it's been really incredible so

729
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,400
so so sam take me back a little bit here

730
00:25:02,798 --> 00:25:06,480
um

731
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
you're talking about

732
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,038
using uh a tensiometer so you're

733
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,400
measuring the moisture tension of the

734
00:25:11,038 --> 00:25:15,519
soil

735
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,240
and then you're you're utilizing that

736
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:19,038
data as a way of intentionally

737
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,359
uh

738
00:25:19,038 --> 00:25:23,200
stressing the plant at certain stages of

739
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:26,000
growth can you can you kind of explain

740
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,919
that a little bit a little bit more

741
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,640
yeah absolutely so um the you know the

742
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,960
idea of tension you know is mature

743
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,520
potential is that the

744
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,519
[Music]

745
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,599
the soil particles are essentially

746
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,519
holding onto the water and roots want

747
00:25:39,599 --> 00:25:43,519
that water and they have to overcome a

748
00:25:41,519 --> 00:25:45,200
certain level of tension in order to

749
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:46,000
take that water away from the soil and

750
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,240
so

751
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,159
a tensiometer essentially measures you

752
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,400
know how hard those roots are having to

753
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,080
work in order to take that water away

754
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,600
from the soil particles and uptake it

755
00:25:54,079 --> 00:25:56,480
and that's a really

756
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,038
you know

757
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,278
very uh

758
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:02,960
non-descriptive method of of what is

759
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,480
actually happening on the from a

760
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
scientific standpoint but essentially

761
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,519
that's what is the basic principles of

762
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,759
it and so

763
00:26:07,519 --> 00:26:11,599
when you think about stress there's just

764
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:13,119
been this idea in cannabis cultivation

765
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:14,639
for a very long time that you know

766
00:26:13,119 --> 00:26:16,319
there's good stress and bad stress and

767
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
obviously nobody wants bad stress on

768
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:21,759
their plants but there is ways to use

769
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,679
stress on a plant to influence

770
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,359
how you want that plant to grow and some

771
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,798
of these principles have been adopted

772
00:26:25,359 --> 00:26:28,639
from um

773
00:26:26,798 --> 00:26:30,240
crop steering and some of them we've

774
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,400
just kind of had to create on there on

775
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,960
our own so

776
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:38,640
as far as using the tensiometers i think

777
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,558
what's really important for us is to

778
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,320
limit that stress and have almost no

779
00:26:40,558 --> 00:26:45,200
stress and vegetative and then during

780
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:47,200
flower there's a few different methods

781
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,558
people kind of tend to go two different

782
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,640
paths when it comes to flowers some

783
00:26:48,558 --> 00:26:52,558
people like to stress early in flower at

784
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,320
the flip to kind of initiate

785
00:26:52,558 --> 00:26:56,639
budding and then they go back to low

786
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:57,918
stress during bulk to really put the

787
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,080
weight onto the plant and then they

788
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,799
stress again late flower

789
00:27:00,079 --> 00:27:04,079
to finish out the maturation period and

790
00:27:02,798 --> 00:27:06,158
get them to really finish and that's

791
00:27:04,079 --> 00:27:07,599
what i kind of adhere to that

792
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,679
methodology but then there's other

793
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:11,278
people that kind of do the opposite and

794
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,600
they want low stress when you flip the

795
00:27:11,278 --> 00:27:15,519
flower and then stress mid-flower and

796
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:17,839
then no stress late flower so there's

797
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:20,000
kind of the inverse of each other but

798
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:22,319
what i found to be true is that if we

799
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,038
can hit a specific tension

800
00:27:22,319 --> 00:27:26,240
but

801
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:28,480
before we water every single time so

802
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,839
for for instance vegetatively in our

803
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,079
soil and this is going to change

804
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:33,599
depending on what soil we're at and

805
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:35,038
kind of how you want to grow your plants

806
00:27:33,599 --> 00:27:38,000
and at what rate

807
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:40,158
i like to let my veg plants get above 10

808
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,960
kpa and then

809
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,799
not any higher than 15 kpa and that

810
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
sweet spot right around 12 is where i

811
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:48,079
want my

812
00:27:45,839 --> 00:27:50,079
vegetative moms watered every single

813
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:51,839
time because it gives them enough dry

814
00:27:50,079 --> 00:27:53,359
back that oxygen is you know getting

815
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:56,480
into those pores it's getting around

816
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:57,759
those roots it's helping that plant to

817
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,038
breathe

818
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,679
and then you water again and you're

819
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:03,278
replacing that oxygen with more water

820
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,278
but if you wait too long you're

821
00:28:03,278 --> 00:28:06,720
stressing that plant because it's it's

822
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:08,480
starting to think that it's not going to

823
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,839
have enough water to

824
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,360
continue growing at the rate it's

825
00:28:09,839 --> 00:28:12,639
growing and start starts to limit its

826
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,798
own growth

827
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,799
versus if you water it too early not

828
00:28:14,798 --> 00:28:18,960
enough oxygen is replacing the water in

829
00:28:16,798 --> 00:28:20,720
the pores and you're

830
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,759
not getting enough aeration in your root

831
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,159
zone

832
00:28:21,759 --> 00:28:25,839
so trying to time it at this perfect

833
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
interval has been really important for

834
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:30,398
me in how we drive plant health

835
00:28:28,319 --> 00:28:32,798
and so for vegetative we try to hit you

836
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:34,398
know between 10 and 15 kpa and that's

837
00:28:32,798 --> 00:28:35,440
been really big for us and then for

838
00:28:34,398 --> 00:28:37,119
flower

839
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,038
we kind of do the opposite the method

840
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:41,199
you know the the principle behind that

841
00:28:39,038 --> 00:28:42,879
is that when you flip the flower you

842
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,798
want that plant to

843
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,399
have just a little bit of stress just a

844
00:28:44,798 --> 00:28:47,440
just a tiny bit of stress so that plant

845
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:49,199
knows that

846
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,720
now i'm not supposed to be growing at

847
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,319
max potential i'm supposed to be putting

848
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,839
energy in the bug production so we do a

849
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:56,319
little bit of stress right when we flip

850
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,079
the flower by letting that drive back or

851
00:28:56,319 --> 00:29:01,119
that tension increase a little bit

852
00:28:58,079 --> 00:29:02,879
higher maybe to 20 25 before we water

853
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:05,119
and then after that stretch period of an

854
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,039
you know early flower and they're done

855
00:29:05,119 --> 00:29:08,639
stretching and the bud sites are already

856
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,119
there it's not going to be flipping back

857
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,038
to vegetative at all

858
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:15,519
we want that plant to start bulking so

859
00:29:13,038 --> 00:29:16,879
around week two and week three

860
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:19,759
we start going back to kind of that

861
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,919
vegetative irrigation where we're

862
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,079
letting that tension stay pretty low in

863
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,679
that 10 to 15 range and so

864
00:29:24,079 --> 00:29:28,000
we're letting that plant get just enough

865
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:30,000
dry back that the roots get oxygen that

866
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,119
um you know it's happy with that dry

867
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,398
back and then we're hitting it with

868
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,479
water again

869
00:29:32,398 --> 00:29:36,959
and we're doing that every single day

870
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:39,440
and the and the trick is to

871
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,120
give it just enough water to get you

872
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,200
through to that point so that the next

873
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:45,038
time you need to water the following day

874
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,798
you're at the proper amount of tension

875
00:29:45,038 --> 00:29:48,480
and this will change based on

876
00:29:46,798 --> 00:29:50,158
climate factors how big your pots the

877
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,519
soil types how vigorous your plants are

878
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:53,039
growing everything kind of goes into

879
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,440
this but

880
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:57,278
we found it really impactful to kind of

881
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,919
hit these specific times when we're

882
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:02,240
watering do multiple irrigations a day

883
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,080
hit very specific tension measurements

884
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,880
from those tensiometers

885
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:06,960
and

886
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,799
hit it accurately and consistently you

887
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,399
know if you have inconsistent watering

888
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:11,918
you're going to have inconsistent flower

889
00:30:10,398 --> 00:30:14,479
as just a

890
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:15,919
very loose correlation there

891
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,440
so tensiometers have been really

892
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,278
impactful for us

893
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,320
in how we shape the plants if you want

894
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:23,359
to

895
00:30:20,319 --> 00:30:26,079
limit stretch and limit growth you can

896
00:30:23,359 --> 00:30:27,519
increase tension between waterings to

897
00:30:26,079 --> 00:30:29,839
limit how much they're able to stretch

898
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:31,599
if they don't have that water available

899
00:30:29,839 --> 00:30:32,879
to the plant they're not going to be

900
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:35,199
able to put

901
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,880
a ton of energy into growth or they're

902
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,120
going to be focused on reserving that

903
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:42,320
energy but if you

904
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:44,319
give them low stress low tension and you

905
00:30:42,319 --> 00:30:46,639
give them just you know adequate amounts

906
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:48,639
of oxygen replacement in between those

907
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,240
waterings and that plant has

908
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:51,200
no reason to stop growing you're going

909
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,960
to see

910
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:55,919
incredible growth

911
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,519
from your plants in both veg and even

912
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,880
early flower or bulking if you really

913
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,399
want it to so

914
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,399
there's other factors like lighting that

915
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:05,278
come into it when you want to

916
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:07,918
design you know the height of your plant

917
00:31:05,278 --> 00:31:09,759
and and how you really control that

918
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:12,880
from a light intensity perspective and

919
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:14,640
your internal density um in the overall

920
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,399
stretch of the plants but

921
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,559
yeah tension has been

922
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:20,479
really important for us in

923
00:31:18,558 --> 00:31:22,558
soilless mixes and when you start

924
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,440
looking at hydro it's something that you

925
00:31:22,558 --> 00:31:27,359
just nobody uses tensiometers really in

926
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,038
in rockwool or even cocoa that much

927
00:31:27,359 --> 00:31:31,038
because the matrix potential just it's

928
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:32,398
not there it just doesn't exist it's not

929
00:31:31,038 --> 00:31:34,558
something you really have to worry about

930
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:36,479
too much

931
00:31:34,558 --> 00:31:37,678
that's that's really fascinating and for

932
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
listeners to save you the time from

933
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:41,600
looking things up um if you're familiar

934
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,558
with millibar ratings the kilo pascal is

935
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:44,480
just a

936
00:31:42,558 --> 00:31:47,278
a tenth of that so a

937
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,960
a 10 kpa kpa would be

938
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,880
100 millibar

939
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:52,000
which is which is interesting and at

940
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,200
some point you know you and i haven't

941
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,119
talked about this

942
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,038
previously um so this is a little bit

943
00:31:55,119 --> 00:31:58,319
new to me too but uh

944
00:31:57,038 --> 00:32:01,278
you know some of the people that we work

945
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:04,480
with like justin for example runs

946
00:32:01,278 --> 00:32:07,119
much lower numbers so much wetter soils

947
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,120
he'll run in that 60 to 80 range or six

948
00:32:07,119 --> 00:32:10,639
to eight kpa

949
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,079
whereas you're letting things get a lot

950
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:13,679
drier

951
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:15,599
and in general running things a lot

952
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:17,038
drier so um

953
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,959
i think that's really interesting and i

954
00:32:17,038 --> 00:32:20,879
think uh one component of that we have

955
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:22,720
to look at too is also um your

956
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
environmental controls how you're

957
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,399
running temperature and humidity in the

958
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:28,240
room and what your vpd is as a as a

959
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:30,239
relationship to all of these other

960
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,359
numbers in terms of how fast yeah just

961
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,599
transpiring so it's it gets complicated

962
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:37,119
it's definitely oh oh it's very

963
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:38,480
complicated i was just i was this

964
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:41,439
morning i was down at the willamette

965
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,919
research center talking with uh

966
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,519
um dr nackley down there and one of the

967
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,360
conversations we love having when we're

968
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,679
talking about hemp is just like you know

969
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:51,359
in a research trial you try to control

970
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:53,360
everything you can like

971
00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:55,199
like we just want one variable that we

972
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:56,959
can focus on but there's never just one

973
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,038
variable and when it comes to designing

974
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,960
a program it's just there's so much

975
00:32:59,038 --> 00:33:02,798
going on it's it's impossible to try to

976
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,798
control everything so you just kind of

977
00:33:02,798 --> 00:33:06,480
try to control as much as you can but

978
00:33:04,798 --> 00:33:07,759
you're absolutely right i mean the

979
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,599
numbers i

980
00:33:07,759 --> 00:33:10,960
throw out are not going to be

981
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:13,199
directly

982
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,159
able to be taken and applied to another

983
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,360
system

984
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,960
because

985
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:19,199
one of the trials i've done over the

986
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,880
past two months is

987
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,278
you know for a soilless high organic

988
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,919
media you can't exactly send it off to a

989
00:33:23,278 --> 00:33:28,480
lab and get your water depletion curve

990
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,720
calculated you know it's not just

991
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,720
sand silt and clay making up your soil

992
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,558
there's so much organic matter

993
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,319
and so in order to have that depletion

994
00:33:34,558 --> 00:33:38,720
curve one of the things i did was just

995
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:40,879
to physically map it with data so i took

996
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:42,798
a tensionometer that's digital

997
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:45,440
that's just take take measurements every

998
00:33:42,798 --> 00:33:47,759
10 minutes and then i took two

999
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,080
volumetric water content probes

1000
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,679
and i put them at very specific levels

1001
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:53,278
within the

1002
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,640
pot

1003
00:33:53,278 --> 00:33:55,919
three inches from the bottom and then

1004
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,360
five inches from the bottom and then

1005
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,038
that two inch ceramic tip on the

1006
00:33:57,359 --> 00:34:00,879
tensiometer

1007
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,398
at that same range the bottom of it is

1008
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,720
at that three inch in the top of it is

1009
00:34:02,398 --> 00:34:06,398
at that five inch and i charted our own

1010
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,398
water depletion curves on the soil and i

1011
00:34:06,398 --> 00:34:10,638
did this with you know kiss oil straight

1012
00:34:08,398 --> 00:34:12,480
out of the bag i did this with

1013
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,800
kiss soil that's been used for two

1014
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,240
months after a plant we had you know had

1015
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,800
called and it's just completely

1016
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,719
compacted and it's so root bound and

1017
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,560
there's just like no pores left and it's

1018
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,638
really interesting to

1019
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,960
to be able to you know read something in

1020
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,480
a textbook about how poor size changes

1021
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,838
you know your water holding capacity and

1022
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,000
field capacity and your tension and

1023
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,000
things like this and then go physically

1024
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,679
measure it with sensors and to have that

1025
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,320
data correlate

1026
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,960
exactly to what you're reading about so

1027
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,399
absolutely you know for for justin um i

1028
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,320
i don't know him personally i haven't

1029
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:45,918
been up there yet but i know that they

1030
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:49,440
reuse their kiss they amend it they're

1031
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,358
doing all these things and so over time

1032
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,200
that media is going to change your

1033
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:55,279
porosity is going to change your pore

1034
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,439
size is going to change so i would yeah

1035
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,519
absolutely i would expect them to be

1036
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,400
running different numbers because

1037
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,960
even

1038
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:04,400
in our system just the difference of two

1039
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,679
months in a pot

1040
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,079
changes

1041
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:09,838
kind of those target set points so to

1042
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,039
speak of tension that we're trying to

1043
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,559
hit

1044
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:15,440
the available

1045
00:35:12,559 --> 00:35:17,759
water your volumetric water content at a

1046
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:19,200
specific tension is way higher in the

1047
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,119
kiss when it's fresh because of the

1048
00:35:19,199 --> 00:35:23,598
large aggregates the porosity is really

1049
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,920
fluffy than it is when it's

1050
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,280
more utilized you know when we start

1051
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,519
getting into that stuff that's more root

1052
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,839
bound lower pore space more root density

1053
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,519
it becomes really hard to accurately

1054
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:35,519
water your plants

1055
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:37,440
and i have this great uh presentation i

1056
00:35:35,519 --> 00:35:38,559
gave to you my watering team about this

1057
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,079
to kind of

1058
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:41,279
drill it into their heads is you know

1059
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,079
when you have

1060
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,640
this fresh soil and a low root density

1061
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:48,800
plant the water the soil can hold so

1062
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:51,039
much water but it can also hold oxygen

1063
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,079
so your window for irrigation you know

1064
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:54,320
maybe

1065
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:56,240
12 hours right if you accidentally miss

1066
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,160
and you wait eight hours you water that

1067
00:35:56,239 --> 00:36:00,879
plant it's probably not feeling a ton of

1068
00:35:58,159 --> 00:36:03,118
stress there's like i measured about a

1069
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:05,039
30 percent volumetric water content

1070
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,519
difference before there's a

1071
00:36:05,039 --> 00:36:10,559
3 kpa difference in that soil when the

1072
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:13,519
kiss is fresh so it can go from 45 vwc

1073
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:16,480
down to 25 bwc and it'll only move from

1074
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:18,559
about 6 kpa to 9 kpa

1075
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:20,800
so there you have a ton of water there

1076
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:22,159
like it's a really slow curve and then

1077
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,480
when you start looking at things that

1078
00:36:22,159 --> 00:36:26,399
are highly compact your low pore space

1079
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,159
you know really high root density

1080
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,838
that soil is starting to break down and

1081
00:36:28,159 --> 00:36:33,199
there's just not a ton of water holding

1082
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:35,599
capacity after it's been used for months

1083
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:38,559
you may drop five percent you know from

1084
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,119
30 down to 25 volumetric water content

1085
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:43,519
and you could have a 10 to 15 kpa

1086
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:46,160
difference so it's really

1087
00:36:43,519 --> 00:36:47,920
it's really about just trying to

1088
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:49,838
see how much stress your plants are

1089
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:52,559
having to utilize to get the water they

1090
00:36:49,838 --> 00:36:54,239
need and then what their water reserves

1091
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:56,078
are and how long they have before it

1092
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:57,519
runs out and in that you know the

1093
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,119
biggest factor i tried to drill into the

1094
00:36:57,519 --> 00:37:02,800
heads of the watering team is that

1095
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,480
when you have an old compacted plant

1096
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,720
like a mom that's been around for two or

1097
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,920
three months you know you may start to

1098
00:37:06,719 --> 00:37:09,838
water it and you're starting to see

1099
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,760
these over watering symptoms and it's

1100
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,199
not necessarily because you're just

1101
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
you're giving it too much water it's

1102
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:17,279
because the water holding capacity is so

1103
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,519
low that the only

1104
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,079
time it has enough water

1105
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:24,239
to actually keep the tension high enough

1106
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,240
so that the plant can take it in is at

1107
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:28,239
the same level when all the oxygen is

1108
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:29,838
displaced from the media

1109
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:31,679
so there's this

1110
00:37:29,838 --> 00:37:33,759
change that happens to a point where you

1111
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:35,679
can no longer give enough water to the

1112
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:38,079
plant without completely displacing

1113
00:37:35,679 --> 00:37:40,159
oxygen from the soil and it becomes

1114
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,560
really difficult to water plants after a

1115
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:44,239
specific point so container size is not

1116
00:37:42,559 --> 00:37:45,759
only important for available nutrients

1117
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:47,439
but how

1118
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:48,720
dense your roots are going to get and i

1119
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,159
say we're

1120
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:51,679
right on that threshold with our

1121
00:37:50,159 --> 00:37:54,159
flowering plants you know after eight

1122
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:56,399
weeks of being in that 10 gallon pot

1123
00:37:54,159 --> 00:37:58,239
they're pretty

1124
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,200
i wouldn't quite say root bound but root

1125
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,358
dense

1126
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:02,639
and we can't really go back that past

1127
00:38:01,358 --> 00:38:04,719
that you know eight to nine week

1128
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,879
maturation cycle without running into

1129
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:08,879
some issues but thankfully we you know

1130
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,559
we female hunt and we select cultivars

1131
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:12,079
and we kind of build our program to be

1132
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,838
designed around a

1133
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
you know an eight week

1134
00:38:13,838 --> 00:38:19,119
to eight and a half to maybe nine week

1135
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:20,720
maturation cycle

1136
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,880
yeah you brought up a lot of good good

1137
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,039
points there um and i think for folks

1138
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,000
that want to start playing around

1139
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,838
with this

1140
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,199
in their facilities i think this is

1141
00:38:27,838 --> 00:38:31,679
definitely something that people should

1142
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:35,439
be looking at and kind of figuring out

1143
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:36,399
based on the media that they're using um

1144
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,679
what

1145
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,119
what works

1146
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:41,358
in their rooms because

1147
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,240
you know watering cannot be

1148
00:38:41,358 --> 00:38:47,199
um understated it's it's something that

1149
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:50,078
i see over and over again as

1150
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:51,199
the biggest variable in terms of plant

1151
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,000
health

1152
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:53,679
and

1153
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,838
a lot of times the deficiencies that i

1154
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:58,239
see people are dealing with is a lot of

1155
00:38:55,838 --> 00:39:00,000
it relates back to improper watering so

1156
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:01,919
dialing in your watering is just

1157
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,159
critical and one of the things that you

1158
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,079
brought up that is a similarity across

1159
00:39:04,159 --> 00:39:08,159
both of your facilities and we'll get

1160
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:09,839
you up to justin's here sooner or later

1161
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:13,440
uh to check it out but

1162
00:39:09,838 --> 00:39:14,559
uh you know consistent watering

1163
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,639
i mean they're using blue mats so

1164
00:39:14,559 --> 00:39:19,599
they're getting water all the time but

1165
00:39:16,639 --> 00:39:21,519
this idea of increased water frequency

1166
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
uh like what you what you mentioned is

1167
00:39:21,519 --> 00:39:25,119
something that's very consistent across

1168
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,880
both facilities um

1169
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,200
and then staying within a given range

1170
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,559
you know whatever that defined range of

1171
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,439
watering is so that you're not getting

1172
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:34,239
those

1173
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,679
big wet and dry cycles that uh

1174
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:39,358
well we used to that you would you might

1175
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:41,519
be more likely to see in hydroponics um

1176
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:43,679
oh absolutely i mean yeah like you said

1177
00:39:41,519 --> 00:39:44,400
irrigation just it can't be understated

1178
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,559
it's

1179
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,079
actually this a couple days ago um

1180
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:49,759
because i didn't mention this in the bio

1181
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,280
but i do go to oregon state for uh

1182
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,520
agronomy and

1183
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:55,599
we were talking in one of my classes

1184
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:57,358
with faculty and the question came up

1185
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,599
you know like what is the the most

1186
00:39:57,358 --> 00:40:01,279
important climatic factor in crop

1187
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:02,480
production and it's a really difficult

1188
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,839
question right because there's just so

1189
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,159
much that goes into it you know you have

1190
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,078
your your temperature and your light and

1191
00:40:06,159 --> 00:40:10,960
you know ph of your soil and available

1192
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,560
nutrients and all these other things and

1193
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,720
i guess you know i settled on i was like

1194
00:40:12,559 --> 00:40:16,318
well it's water you know it's it's to me

1195
00:40:14,719 --> 00:40:18,239
water is always going to be the most

1196
00:40:16,318 --> 00:40:19,519
important factor when it comes to crop

1197
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:21,118
production

1198
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:22,559
and cannabis tests those limits right

1199
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,039
because there's just so much else that

1200
00:40:22,559 --> 00:40:26,559
goes into it but water to me is always

1201
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:28,239
kind of the foundation you start with

1202
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:29,519
your media you start with your nutrients

1203
00:40:28,239 --> 00:40:31,118
you start with your water and then

1204
00:40:29,519 --> 00:40:33,280
everything else kind of comes comes

1205
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:35,440
behind that you you work on your climate

1206
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,359
your temperature your rh and then at the

1207
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,159
very end you kind of focus on light

1208
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:42,239
intensity is like the last lever to pull

1209
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:44,559
and that's something that uh jeremy has

1210
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:46,639
helped to instill into me is every time

1211
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:48,719
i want to go pull a lever for light

1212
00:40:46,639 --> 00:40:49,920
intensity we we have to circle around

1213
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:51,598
and make sure that you know everything

1214
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,760
else is going good and

1215
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:55,920
we don't run you know we we have leds

1216
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,079
that we put in this year we're almost

1217
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,680
entirely led in our facility that's one

1218
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,119
of the really big efforts we undertook

1219
00:40:59,679 --> 00:41:02,960
this past year but

1220
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:05,358
we don't run them you know as high as

1221
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,639
the hydro guys or other facilities we

1222
00:41:05,358 --> 00:41:08,960
keep them

1223
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,960
relatively lower than i would say most

1224
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,559
facilities and i think part of that is

1225
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,318
just because we

1226
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:16,000
we don't see a need for luxury

1227
00:41:14,318 --> 00:41:18,000
consumption of light

1228
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,519
in our plants so

1229
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,599
yeah there's just so many factors but

1230
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:24,559
irrigation just it can't be understated

1231
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:25,920
and and super important and

1232
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:28,559
yeah i want to make sure i covered all

1233
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,599
those technology topics you wanted to to

1234
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:32,400
circle around upon i i think

1235
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:35,119
tensiometers is probably the most

1236
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:36,480
important thing for us

1237
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,079
some people

1238
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,318
were wondering i know i've talked to in

1239
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:44,079
the past you know why we don't use

1240
00:41:40,318 --> 00:41:47,440
ec sensors or media sensors

1241
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,599
and part of it is we just we don't

1242
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,760
we i've i've calculated what goes into

1243
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:54,160
the media well enough that i don't

1244
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:56,079
really worry about

1245
00:41:54,159 --> 00:41:58,239
how it's sitting in there and staying

1246
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,039
over time so that is a little bit

1247
00:41:58,239 --> 00:42:03,679
backwards to how some people work with

1248
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:05,199
cannabis like in cocoa or or hydro when

1249
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,838
you're actually getting lychee but in

1250
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,759
our new program we don't have any runoff

1251
00:42:07,838 --> 00:42:12,880
i mean what we put in water and mineral

1252
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:14,240
life it stays there we don't have

1253
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:16,720
anything that comes out the bottom of

1254
00:42:14,239 --> 00:42:18,399
the pot which has been a really awesome

1255
00:42:16,719 --> 00:42:21,919
thing to happen when we think about you

1256
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,240
know wastewater and waste streams and

1257
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,400
you know pollution that happens from

1258
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,559
really big cannabis facilities using

1259
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:30,800
liquid injection fertilizers and whether

1260
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:33,679
it's organic or not i mean we

1261
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,960
we really try to give them just enough

1262
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:37,679
so that they're hitting the point of

1263
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,519
what they need without crazy luxury

1264
00:42:37,679 --> 00:42:41,759
consumption of these nutrients and in

1265
00:42:39,519 --> 00:42:43,679
the perfect amount of water so that it

1266
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,440
evenly saturates and has the right

1267
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:47,440
amount of dry back

1268
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,960
it's a really tough balance it's really

1269
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:51,119
tough balance

1270
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,318
yeah what uh real quickly what ppfd

1271
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:55,039
levels that canopy are you guys

1272
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:55,039
currently using

1273
00:42:55,199 --> 00:42:59,358
um so we hit

1274
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,280
so we're between 900 and a thousand um

1275
00:42:59,358 --> 00:43:03,598
typically i mean we're not there's a lot

1276
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,800
of people with the new leds that want to

1277
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,480
push

1278
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,920
higher i mean i've seen stuff as high as

1279
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,000
1700

1280
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:13,358
oh wow and a lot of people average in

1281
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,119
that 12 to 1400 range is is pretty

1282
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:16,719
common um

1283
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,358
but we run our

1284
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:21,759
lights pretty low i mean we

1285
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:23,598
we get up to that range of that 900 to

1286
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,760
1000 pretty quickly

1287
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:28,240
and then it it kind of stays there on

1288
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:31,119
average we're not running any higher

1289
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:32,078
um new moles in our leds than we are

1290
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,440
with

1291
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:35,760
you know the couple of rooms that we

1292
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,358
still have on hps they're

1293
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:38,240
they're relatively the same i think what

1294
00:43:37,358 --> 00:43:40,719
we get

1295
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:42,959
is dimming control better

1296
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:44,719
significantly better efficiency

1297
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,119
um and just better spectrum in my

1298
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,118
opinion

1299
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:52,559
yeah that's great so um

1300
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:54,318
do you think you you will start to turn

1301
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,759
the dial on lighting and up lighting

1302
00:43:54,318 --> 00:43:59,279
intensity or do you feel like

1303
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,800
like like you mentioned not offering

1304
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,000
luxury levels do you feel like that's

1305
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,280
the level

1306
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,480
sort of where

1307
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:06,160
you guys are comfortable in your

1308
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,000
facility in terms of your yields and

1309
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:10,960
output and pushing the plant any harder

1310
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,960
won't necessarily

1311
00:44:11,039 --> 00:44:14,559
offer enough benefit to offset the

1312
00:44:13,039 --> 00:44:17,920
amount of wattage or electrical

1313
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:20,159
consumption that you'd be getting

1314
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:21,599
yeah i mean i think

1315
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:24,318
i think if there's potential for

1316
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,480
increased yield um

1317
00:44:24,318 --> 00:44:28,639
there's always that one drive to want to

1318
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:30,559
push for it and something that's been

1319
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:32,799
ingrained through

1320
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:34,318
um my education with agronomy is that

1321
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:37,280
just because it's higher yield doesn't

1322
00:44:34,318 --> 00:44:40,239
mean it's always worth but worth it um

1323
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,160
you know sometimes your inputs just

1324
00:44:40,239 --> 00:44:43,759
creep up higher than

1325
00:44:42,159 --> 00:44:45,440
that extra little bit of yield will get

1326
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:47,599
you and so i think there's there's

1327
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:49,679
definitely room to go higher but i think

1328
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,519
there's room to go higher at specific

1329
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:54,239
intervals so

1330
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:56,800
higher light intensity at specific times

1331
00:44:54,239 --> 00:45:00,000
to control morphology to control stretch

1332
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,599
to increase no density

1333
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:03,599
but i would say on average i don't

1334
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,000
really see us going above

1335
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,800
1100 or 1150 you know even when we're

1336
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,760
doing peak um

1337
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:15,599
yeah like peak absolute best cultivation

1338
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,000
and part of that is just facility design

1339
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:19,599
right so one of the reasons people run

1340
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,119
higher light intensities is because

1341
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,039
they're not doing

1342
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,800
trays like us so we have like an even

1343
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:25,679
canopy through the whole room we don't

1344
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,519
get

1345
00:45:25,679 --> 00:45:29,838
side lighting on the plants we don't you

1346
00:45:27,519 --> 00:45:32,239
know we have one really even canopy

1347
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,920
across the entire room versus a lot of

1348
00:45:32,239 --> 00:45:36,318
people running hydro or rockwool or

1349
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,119
thing you know greenhouse they're doing

1350
00:45:36,318 --> 00:45:40,960
like benches like uh rows table rows

1351
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,920
where they only have one plant on each

1352
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,159
row

1353
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:45,039
going you know maybe 100 plants long and

1354
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:46,480
so

1355
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:48,159
their light intensity has to be good

1356
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,760
enough not only to hit the top of the

1357
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,118
plants but also

1358
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,880
down the sides of the plants and try to

1359
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:54,079
get those lower buds at all as well

1360
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,760
versus

1361
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,560
our cultivation model we pretty much

1362
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,800
strip

1363
00:45:56,559 --> 00:46:00,960
everything back i mean we we go very

1364
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,599
heavy on our prune and then we just get

1365
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:05,119
a really big even canopy all the way

1366
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:07,599
across the top which is one of those

1367
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,280
ways that we also control consistency

1368
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,200
at proof is just to

1369
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:13,680
try to avoid the vertical growth as much

1370
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:16,159
as possible from you know top to bottom

1371
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:17,679
and just having an even canopy that's

1372
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:19,759
kind of on one level all the way

1373
00:46:17,679 --> 00:46:21,039
throughout the room

1374
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,880
can i ask a little bit about like what

1375
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:24,480
your pruning schedule is

1376
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,160
or philosophies

1377
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:29,358
yeah for sure um

1378
00:46:28,159 --> 00:46:30,879
i'll try to

1379
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,159
give as much info as i can without

1380
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:35,838
divulging too much but so we we do two

1381
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:37,759
prunes and we do them pretty early on in

1382
00:46:35,838 --> 00:46:39,279
flower we like to do one

1383
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,680
pretty much at the flip and then a

1384
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:43,200
couple weeks into flip and the first one

1385
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:45,279
is kind of just to get rid of some of

1386
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:46,879
those lower growth top the plants kind

1387
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
of shape them a little bit we don't we

1388
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,640
don't do too much and then the second

1389
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:52,720
one we cut out

1390
00:46:50,639 --> 00:46:54,159
and this is really specific for facility

1391
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:55,679
design right because i would not

1392
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:56,480
recommend our printing style to someone

1393
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:58,799
that's

1394
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,559
growing in a tunnel or greenhouse or

1395
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,839
doing hydro that you know has side

1396
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:03,039
lighting and stuff because they're

1397
00:47:01,838 --> 00:47:04,960
they're going to want to leave all these

1398
00:47:03,039 --> 00:47:07,279
lower branches on but we strip

1399
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:09,280
a ton back kind of in the second

1400
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:10,640
to third week of flower

1401
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,839
and

1402
00:47:10,639 --> 00:47:14,000
leave

1403
00:47:11,838 --> 00:47:16,799
pretty much only the top 20 to 25

1404
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,280
percent of the buds on there

1405
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,800
if not less and just really create an

1406
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:22,160
even canopy and we want just great

1407
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,359
airflow through that bottom of the

1408
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:25,838
canopy

1409
00:47:23,358 --> 00:47:27,440
and kind of being pulled up through the

1410
00:47:25,838 --> 00:47:28,799
through the canopy as best as possible

1411
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,240
but um

1412
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,400
yeah yeah i think that's probably as

1413
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:34,479
much as i can really no that was good

1414
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,800
without giving an actual class on it of

1415
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:39,199
course and describing pruning is a tough

1416
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:42,000
thing to do on a podcast so i understand

1417
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:44,399
uh yeah well let's let's change topics

1418
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:46,000
here i want to get over because um

1419
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,639
when i came to the facility one of the

1420
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,440
things that you guys were doing was this

1421
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,879
uh

1422
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,880
tank mixing

1423
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:56,480
an application of various sulfates so

1424
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,640
essentially i mean you guys are doing

1425
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:01,358
more testing than any other facility i

1426
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,118
know um i know when i first saw all your

1427
00:48:01,358 --> 00:48:05,598
tests i was like yeah do we need this

1428
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,280
many tests like you know

1429
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:08,960
and and you know we kind of went back

1430
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,319
and forth on that and

1431
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,960
um

1432
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:14,159
i i think it'd be you know you're so

1433
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,159
collecting data for the sake of

1434
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:18,000
collecting data is pointless but

1435
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:20,799
collecting data that you can use to

1436
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,800
allow you to make good decisions is is

1437
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:24,400
priceless and that's something that i

1438
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,079
think

1439
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,079
jeremy's told me about you is like

1440
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,880
you're very good at taking that data and

1441
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,800
then using it and um

1442
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,920
creating a program around it and and

1443
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
that's where i think would be

1444
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:38,559
interesting for listeners is sort of

1445
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:39,920
one like what you know you touched on

1446
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:41,760
briefly some of the tests that you're

1447
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:43,838
taking but then how are you taking all

1448
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:46,160
these tests and then creating a program

1449
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,920
that allows you to

1450
00:48:46,159 --> 00:48:49,920
target these different you know trace

1451
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:51,920
trace elements because one thing

1452
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:53,440
you know just as background like for me

1453
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,280
and this is something that bryant and i

1454
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:58,159
have philosophically like it's a minor

1455
00:48:55,280 --> 00:49:00,559
difference honestly um brian's great

1456
00:48:58,159 --> 00:49:03,199
i tend to focus more just on the macros

1457
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:06,079
um as long as i feel like the micro

1458
00:49:03,199 --> 00:49:07,838
the the the micro or trace minerals are

1459
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:10,400
there then i feel like we're we're

1460
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:12,558
probably good unless they're like crazy

1461
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,760
so my ranges are a lot bigger

1462
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,119
um

1463
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,800
and i tend to not fiddle with it but you

1464
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:18,480
guys you and you know and from working

1465
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,599
with brian you guys are really targeting

1466
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:22,880
those um

1467
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,519
yeah just talk to me about it

1468
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:27,358
yeah so i think uh first just kind of

1469
00:49:25,519 --> 00:49:28,719
giving a little context around this is

1470
00:49:27,358 --> 00:49:30,799
gonna be super important because i don't

1471
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:32,159
wanna i don't want to give advice for

1472
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,318
people and then they take it and run

1473
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:36,318
with it so to speak so

1474
00:49:34,318 --> 00:49:38,558
i completely agree for your situation

1475
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,400
when you're building soil that is like a

1476
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:42,640
baseline for so many different types

1477
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,880
grows and people and situations yeah you

1478
00:49:42,639 --> 00:49:46,879
just want to focus on kind of like these

1479
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,039
wide ranges getting enough of those

1480
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:51,599
macros and then micros are pretty easy

1481
00:49:49,039 --> 00:49:53,679
to supplement on like the facility

1482
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:54,880
um scale you know

1483
00:49:53,679 --> 00:49:57,440
so

1484
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:00,079
in my situation absolutely agree i

1485
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:01,760
probably do more testing than anyone

1486
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:04,240
else or any other facility i've come

1487
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:06,960
across i mean i've i've put a lot of

1488
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:08,318
faith and time money and effort into

1489
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,838
testing

1490
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:13,279
and it kind of just evolved

1491
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:15,279
naturally when we're when we were

1492
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:16,240
building this program

1493
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:18,559
i

1494
00:50:16,239 --> 00:50:21,519
there was a lot of feedback internally

1495
00:50:18,559 --> 00:50:24,000
and externally from people that kind of

1496
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:25,440
like the old method of growing i'm going

1497
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,440
to say old method of growing for

1498
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,599
cannabis where you just kind of

1499
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:31,519
observe the plan to keep an eye out for

1500
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,640
quote-unquote deficiency symptoms

1501
00:50:31,519 --> 00:50:34,318
showing up in the leaves and then you

1502
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:35,118
kind of just like self-diagnose and then

1503
00:50:34,318 --> 00:50:37,599
you

1504
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:40,079
add more or less and that's never been

1505
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:41,680
my preferred approach i am very much a

1506
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,920
numbers guy and

1507
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:46,719
i want to quantify everything and i want

1508
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,039
it to fit within this certain bracket

1509
00:50:46,719 --> 00:50:51,679
and so when we were building um

1510
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:53,279
the program from scratch we always knew

1511
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:55,199
that we were going to start out with

1512
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:57,280
just a ton of testing

1513
00:50:55,199 --> 00:51:00,318
and then slowly

1514
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,920
back off of that over time and now

1515
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:03,599
here we are you know

1516
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:05,519
six to nine months nine months is

1517
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:07,599
probably when from when we ran like the

1518
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:09,358
first crop and we had no idea how it was

1519
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:11,280
going to turn out versus

1520
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:13,119
six months from when we probably ran the

1521
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,839
first crop with a

1522
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:17,440
actual new fertilizer program that we

1523
00:51:15,838 --> 00:51:19,679
were like running for the first time to

1524
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:20,880
see how it went so so a little ways out

1525
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:22,960
from there

1526
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:25,599
now i only test

1527
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:27,280
a couple times a month and

1528
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:30,400
i still probably test every room and

1529
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:32,319
maybe two cultivars from every room so

1530
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,280
you know i still probably send out 30 to

1531
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,838
45 tests a month that include both

1532
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,119
tissue and soil versus before i was

1533
00:51:37,838 --> 00:51:40,880
sending out

1534
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,039
30 a week so

1535
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,800
there's a large difference there and

1536
00:51:43,039 --> 00:51:47,119
that will continue to dwindle over time

1537
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,599
to the point where we may only send out

1538
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,599
at key intervals in the maturation

1539
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,440
period but you're absolutely right data

1540
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:55,760
for the sake of data is

1541
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,358
really fun but not very practical

1542
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,480
especially in a production environment

1543
00:51:57,358 --> 00:52:00,880
so

1544
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,679
when i first started taking the data

1545
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,200
i

1546
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,358
did not have the knowledge i knew now

1547
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:07,439
and i was relying heavily on brian in

1548
00:52:05,358 --> 00:52:08,880
the lab and another consultant at the

1549
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,720
time and just like

1550
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:12,240
like how do i even take this and

1551
00:52:10,719 --> 00:52:13,919
interpret it and i think that's a

1552
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:16,558
situation that a lot of cultivators and

1553
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:18,159
farmers really end up in and my

1554
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,760
education around agronomy and just

1555
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:21,519
working with this day in and day out has

1556
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,440
really helped you kind of evolve my

1557
00:52:21,519 --> 00:52:25,039
understanding of it but

1558
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,480
when i started taking these tests you

1559
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:28,318
know i got the first test and i'm like

1560
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,559
okay great you know like i have

1561
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:32,480
some very rough sufficiency ranges that

1562
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:35,040
were you know published from various

1563
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,119
universities around the world on hemp at

1564
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:38,800
you know the week before flower

1565
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:40,160
that i'm gonna try to correlate to this

1566
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:41,839
but how do you take that and correlate

1567
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:43,440
it to veg and the you know the

1568
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:45,119
pre-flower and then early flower

1569
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,039
midflower late flower you know how do i

1570
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:49,119
kind of track this over time and

1571
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:51,199
those trends i i just kind of had to

1572
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,720
learn and graph over time but um when i

1573
00:52:51,199 --> 00:52:54,399
first get the first data set you know

1574
00:52:52,719 --> 00:52:55,919
i'm like well this is great i see this

1575
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,440
point in time that this is where my

1576
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,639
plants are at and now i can take this

1577
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:00,800
and i can

1578
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:02,318
make changes up or down and in the

1579
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,559
beginning of a nutrient program you can

1580
00:53:02,318 --> 00:53:06,000
kind of make pretty big changes you know

1581
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,599
if you're just like bottomed out on

1582
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,599
nitrogen right you can up your nitrogen

1583
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,359
or you know if your calcium is at like

1584
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:13,599
one percent it's pretty easy to make

1585
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:15,440
that change and add more calcium but you

1586
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:17,440
know as your program goes on

1587
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,880
it's harder to make changes almost

1588
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,838
because you're trying to move them

1589
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,358
really

1590
00:53:19,838 --> 00:53:23,519
minut

1591
00:53:21,358 --> 00:53:24,799
ways you know really really small ways

1592
00:53:23,519 --> 00:53:26,559
and there's a lot of nutrient

1593
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:28,400
interaction going on so

1594
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:30,000
the first test comes in i get it and i'm

1595
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,519
like great point in time then the second

1596
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:33,119
test comes in you know i only have two

1597
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,559
papers side by side but then i get the

1598
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:36,480
third and the fourth and the fifth and

1599
00:53:34,559 --> 00:53:37,839
like i'm in a month into this you know

1600
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:40,159
i've got like

1601
00:53:37,838 --> 00:53:41,519
a hundred data sample tests like all

1602
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:43,440
spread out around me and i'm like i have

1603
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,159
no idea how to take this information and

1604
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:45,838
like

1605
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:47,838
try to keep track of it and watch the

1606
00:53:45,838 --> 00:53:49,838
trends of everything so

1607
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:52,318
i developed a

1608
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:54,639
tracking model kind of just out of

1609
00:53:52,318 --> 00:53:57,440
necessity where i take all that data and

1610
00:53:54,639 --> 00:53:59,358
i put it into a table form in excel and

1611
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,280
i do these really basic graphs you know

1612
00:53:59,358 --> 00:54:03,119
to kind of track stuff and i

1613
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:05,440
i was i was tracking information like

1614
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:07,519
strains and data samples and plant

1615
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:09,358
health and you know where all those

1616
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:11,199
values of the analytes are at and then

1617
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:13,679
using graphs to kind of track that on a

1618
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:17,039
day of maturation cycle and

1619
00:54:13,679 --> 00:54:19,039
even still that was um good but it got

1620
00:54:17,039 --> 00:54:20,480
convoluted when i started getting up

1621
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:23,039
into having you know

1622
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,599
six to ten thousand different data

1623
00:54:23,039 --> 00:54:27,119
points in a in a single data set you

1624
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,920
know like for my soil i think i have

1625
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:29,760
like

1626
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,519
10 000 data points at this point for

1627
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,880
tissue probably a little bit more than

1628
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:35,039
that so

1629
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:37,838
wow at after time you know i end up

1630
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:39,599
having a hundred different tiny little

1631
00:54:37,838 --> 00:54:41,519
graphs that only attract individual

1632
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,400
cultivarism

1633
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,519
it it got to a point where

1634
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:46,880
there's a couple different things you

1635
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,199
need from your data you need to know

1636
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,838
what an individual crop in an individual

1637
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:53,358
cultivar in an individual room is doing

1638
00:54:51,838 --> 00:54:55,199
when you have multiple rooms right you

1639
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:57,119
can't just take that one room and try to

1640
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,439
apply it to everything but at the same

1641
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:02,400
time you need to change a

1642
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:04,480
feed program that affects everything and

1643
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,318
so you need both the macro and the micro

1644
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:10,559
picture of it all and so recently about

1645
00:55:08,318 --> 00:55:12,159
right before christmas vacation i filled

1646
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,519
out this new dashboard which i don't

1647
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:14,960
think i've had a chance to show you but

1648
00:55:13,519 --> 00:55:16,960
you'll you'll love it

1649
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:19,358
it takes all of those data points and

1650
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:21,679
all those data sets and has them in

1651
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:23,759
singular tables and then queries them

1652
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,798
into this dashboard and i can see and

1653
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:27,119
observe

1654
00:55:24,798 --> 00:55:29,599
any specific analyte i want on a single

1655
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:31,680
dashboard over a average week of

1656
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:34,160
maturation for any specific cultivar any

1657
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:37,358
specific crop any specific room and i

1658
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:39,519
can visually just see how those analytes

1659
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:41,920
move over time so

1660
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:43,519
i can see where we start with calcium at

1661
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,880
the start of flower and you know i know

1662
00:55:43,519 --> 00:55:46,798
that's a combination of what's already

1663
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,640
in the kiss versus what i'm putting in

1664
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,280
and i can see that trend line rise and

1665
00:55:48,639 --> 00:55:53,358
fall from week 0 to week 1 to week 2 to

1666
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:55,839
week 3 and have a trend line that

1667
00:55:53,358 --> 00:55:57,519
actually maps that average across that

1668
00:55:55,838 --> 00:55:58,880
period and at the same time on that

1669
00:55:57,519 --> 00:56:02,000
graph i can

1670
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,000
i have the sufficiency ranges that are

1671
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,679
um you know there's there's not great

1672
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,599
publication down on sufficiency range

1673
00:56:05,679 --> 00:56:09,519
for cannabis in my opinion there is some

1674
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:12,079
out there that is the best that we have

1675
00:56:09,519 --> 00:56:13,519
but i don't think it's conclusive at all

1676
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:15,359
yet um

1677
00:56:13,519 --> 00:56:16,480
but i took those and i ran with them

1678
00:56:15,358 --> 00:56:18,960
that kind of

1679
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,639
moved them based on what i thought is is

1680
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,159
best and what i've observed from a plant

1681
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:24,558
health and recorded from a plant health

1682
00:56:22,159 --> 00:56:25,920
perspective and so i have this dashboard

1683
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:28,640
that like you said it has to be

1684
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,119
practical that data and i i study this

1685
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:32,318
data daily and weekly now to the point

1686
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,240
where

1687
00:56:32,318 --> 00:56:36,159
every single time i add a new data set

1688
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:38,479
it's this self-learning

1689
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:40,639
data model that just continues to evolve

1690
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,920
over time i can see how we went from

1691
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:43,598
having

1692
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:46,000
a ton of our nutrients you know

1693
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:48,000
deficient or toxic or out of whack

1694
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,079
during week five initially with the

1695
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,440
program to now

1696
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:54,079
i would say

1697
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,480
pretty much all except maybe one or two

1698
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:58,480
elements are just exactly where we want

1699
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,079
them to be i mean they are dialed in and

1700
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,358
i even had a call last week with client

1701
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,119
where we're just

1702
00:57:01,358 --> 00:57:05,119
i call them up and we're like well you

1703
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:06,559
know at this point it's we're pretty

1704
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:07,760
stable it's like maybe you adjust

1705
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,079
something here maybe you adjust

1706
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,880
something there and so it's been really

1707
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:14,798
fascinating the past six months to just

1708
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,880
dive into this nutrient program take all

1709
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:19,119
this data you know convert it to

1710
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:21,358
something useful go apply it back to the

1711
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:22,880
plants and then see positive results but

1712
00:57:21,358 --> 00:57:24,318
a massive learning experience and

1713
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:26,559
undertaking and

1714
00:57:24,318 --> 00:57:28,159
and i'd say you know my goal is that by

1715
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:29,839
the end of january here that the

1716
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:31,358
nutrient program is finished and

1717
00:57:29,838 --> 00:57:33,759
stabilized and

1718
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:35,119
it is basically automated to the point

1719
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:36,799
where

1720
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:38,318
i can go and focus on other things now i

1721
00:57:36,798 --> 00:57:40,079
can start focusing on dialing and

1722
00:57:38,318 --> 00:57:42,480
pruning i can dial in our lighting i can

1723
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:44,000
dial in our vpd and all these other

1724
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,159
variables you know that you have on the

1725
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:48,000
table but for the past year

1726
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:49,838
nutrients have been the you know the the

1727
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,199
biggest limiting factor when it comes to

1728
00:57:49,838 --> 00:57:52,960
yield and

1729
00:57:51,199 --> 00:57:54,239
thankfully we're pretty much over that

1730
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:56,480
hurdle and we're back to hitting

1731
00:57:54,239 --> 00:57:58,639
record-breaking yields and we'll just

1732
00:57:56,480 --> 00:58:00,798
we'll keep moving along but

1733
00:57:58,639 --> 00:58:02,480
i i completely agree there's

1734
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:04,559
there's no like

1735
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,559
there's no great training manual on how

1736
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:08,960
to build a

1737
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:10,640
facility specific

1738
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,159
data set and how to

1739
00:58:10,639 --> 00:58:13,920
take these you know everyone recommends

1740
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:16,000
oh go to go get a soil sample oh get a

1741
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:18,079
you know tissue sample but short of

1742
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,719
having a full-time consultant how do you

1743
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,400
take that as a grower as a cultivator

1744
00:58:20,719 --> 00:58:23,919
you know whether your home or a large

1745
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,160
commercial operation

1746
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,000
and collect that data and correlate that

1747
00:58:26,159 --> 00:58:31,118
to yield correlate that to plant health

1748
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:33,039
and to influence your decisions and have

1749
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,880
proof of why you're doing this

1750
00:58:33,039 --> 00:58:37,279
throughout those changes

1751
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:38,960
and and guide your program along the way

1752
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:40,960
it's it's not something that i think is

1753
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:42,480
easily understood in the in the cannabis

1754
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,079
space

1755
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,838
oh i totally agree and one thing i want

1756
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,280
to highlight that you mentioned is this

1757
00:58:45,838 --> 00:58:49,440
idea of waiting until you see a

1758
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,119
deficiency in your plant well at that

1759
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:53,838
point really it's too late you've

1760
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:54,720
already stressed your plants so yep

1761
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:55,920
and

1762
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:57,358
i'll be the first to admit i need to

1763
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,720
learn a lot more about tissue testing it

1764
00:58:57,358 --> 00:59:00,960
wasn't something that was traditionally

1765
00:58:58,719 --> 00:59:02,959
available to cannabis growers and so

1766
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,358
it's something that i need to

1767
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,798
educate myself on here

1768
00:59:05,358 --> 00:59:08,480
so that's great you're able to you're

1769
00:59:06,798 --> 00:59:10,798
able to work with

1770
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:12,639
with that data and a lab to get that

1771
00:59:10,798 --> 00:59:14,318
testing um

1772
00:59:12,639 --> 00:59:17,279
out of curiosity

1773
00:59:14,318 --> 00:59:19,119
what sorts of trends did you find with

1774
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,880
our soil for people who are listening

1775
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:22,880
and and maybe use our soil in terms of

1776
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:24,000
things to watch for

1777
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,838
um

1778
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:28,480
yeah being in containers that they like

1779
00:59:25,838 --> 00:59:28,480
it's very bad

1780
00:59:28,559 --> 00:59:33,200
yeah so it's it's really interesting i

1781
00:59:30,798 --> 00:59:34,239
mean so i don't we kind of touched on it

1782
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,318
but the whole premise behind the

1783
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:38,399
container thing is like

1784
00:59:36,318 --> 00:59:39,279
living soil will work in any container

1785
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:41,599
but

1786
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:43,280
obviously the bigger you go the less

1787
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:44,880
additional fertilizer you have to put in

1788
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:48,240
because there's a bigger reserve bigger

1789
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:50,079
bank so if you if you do a 30 gallon or

1790
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,399
40 gallon or whatever size you go up to

1791
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:54,318
right you can do a water only program

1792
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:56,240
for the most part and not really have to

1793
00:59:54,318 --> 00:59:57,440
put anything in but for a 10 gallon

1794
00:59:56,239 --> 00:59:59,199
container

1795
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,880
it wasn't a question of if we would or

1796
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:02,879
we wouldn't run out of nutrients it was

1797
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:04,559
more question of when we would and what

1798
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,798
ones we would be running out at first

1799
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,559
and and you mentioned you know as a as a

1800
01:00:06,798 --> 01:00:10,880
soil builder your focus is kind of on

1801
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:12,559
those macros and most of the micros are

1802
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:15,358
kind of just there naturally from some

1803
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,480
of the inputs that you utilize but

1804
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:20,880
micros is important really important in

1805
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:23,519
media that buffers high

1806
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:26,240
ph i think one of the things that was

1807
01:00:23,519 --> 01:00:28,318
really beneficial is we brought

1808
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:30,318
a close associate and not too long ago

1809
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:32,639
because we were seeing like manganese

1810
01:00:30,318 --> 01:00:34,639
uptake like really high

1811
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,719
and we were using just like a tiny bit

1812
01:00:34,639 --> 01:00:39,440
of manganese but not anything like that

1813
01:00:36,719 --> 01:00:41,118
we would you know bat an eye at and

1814
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:42,559
i was really confused i'm like and like

1815
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:44,160
i pulled all the manganese out of the

1816
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,920
program and it's like okay i just won't

1817
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,440
put it in anymore and we were still

1818
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:49,680
getting this this issue and i was like

1819
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:52,079
man i'm just like scratching my head and

1820
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:53,440
turns out um that

1821
01:00:52,079 --> 01:00:56,559
it's it's one of those things where you

1822
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:58,400
wouldn't be able to just like

1823
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,400
look at a leaf and know what is going on

1824
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:02,318
because the plan is showing manganese

1825
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:03,838
toxicity right and manganese toxicity is

1826
01:01:02,318 --> 01:01:06,480
this very interesting

1827
01:01:03,838 --> 01:01:09,119
like camouflage purplish reddish brown

1828
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:10,719
like very very unique coloration that's

1829
01:01:09,119 --> 01:01:12,559
going on

1830
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:13,598
kind of this distorting whirling of the

1831
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,599
leaves

1832
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,480
and what's happening is that with the

1833
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:21,838
soil kind of buffering around a 7.0 ph

1834
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:24,159
6.8 to like a 7-1 it's pretty high but

1835
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,440
a good range in my opinion but iron

1836
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,358
oxidizes it at that point it

1837
01:01:25,440 --> 01:01:29,119
precipitates out um you know it

1838
01:01:27,358 --> 01:01:30,880
essentially becomes rust in your soil so

1839
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:33,280
it's not readily available to the plant

1840
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:34,960
so whenever that plant runs out of iron

1841
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,960
availability it starts taking up that

1842
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,838
manganese in replacement of it and we

1843
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,159
were just getting a huge

1844
01:01:39,838 --> 01:01:44,000
flush of manganese into the plants it

1845
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:46,639
was just like running into it

1846
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:49,519
and so one of the ways i changed that is

1847
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:51,358
we just we added iron to our weekly feed

1848
01:01:49,519 --> 01:01:53,119
program before i was adding micros at

1849
01:01:51,358 --> 01:01:54,880
the beginning of flower and then hoping

1850
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:56,720
that they would just like there would be

1851
01:01:54,880 --> 01:01:58,720
a reserve of them to kind of last

1852
01:01:56,719 --> 01:02:00,399
throughout that whole cycle

1853
01:01:58,719 --> 01:02:02,480
but iron was just precipitating out

1854
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,160
immediately and manganese was becoming

1855
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,960
hyper available and just getting taken

1856
01:02:04,159 --> 01:02:09,358
into the plant so now i push iron

1857
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:12,559
weekly two times a week and just low

1858
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:15,119
concentrations like in the 10 to 15 ppm

1859
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:17,280
range in solution

1860
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:19,358
and it just it keeps it available to the

1861
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,200
plant at all times and i don't see any

1862
01:02:19,358 --> 01:02:23,038
iron issues the manganese issue has gone

1863
01:02:21,199 --> 01:02:24,960
away but you know specifically with your

1864
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:26,319
soil i think it's amazing it's really

1865
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:28,318
great like you can take a plant put it

1866
01:02:26,318 --> 01:02:30,000
into it and it's immediately happy and

1867
01:02:28,318 --> 01:02:32,000
then there's some small optimization you

1868
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:34,639
can do from there there's a great amount

1869
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:36,000
of calcium so i you know if people are

1870
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:39,118
trying to take your soil and then throw

1871
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,519
calcium nitrate at it i probably

1872
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,880
probably not the right path to go

1873
01:02:41,519 --> 01:02:45,280
but uh

1874
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:47,039
calcium is is great in it it buffers

1875
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,440
kind of on a higher ph so those things

1876
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:51,760
that do have limited availability at

1877
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:53,760
high ph range just take a peek at those

1878
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:55,039
and kind of see how your plan is holding

1879
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:57,119
up but

1880
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:59,039
we really don't have to supplement a ton

1881
01:02:57,119 --> 01:03:01,200
you know those first three four weeks of

1882
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,599
flour

1883
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,719
we do input some stuff but it's mostly

1884
01:03:03,599 --> 01:03:07,440
uh

1885
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:09,279
luxury feed and it's putting it into the

1886
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,960
soil so that by the time

1887
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:12,319
what's available and the kiss runs out

1888
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:14,079
around week four

1889
01:03:12,318 --> 01:03:15,838
um the stuff we've been putting in for

1890
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:17,200
the past few weeks is becoming available

1891
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:18,960
and it's starting to be taken into the

1892
01:03:17,199 --> 01:03:19,759
plant so there's this kind of handoff

1893
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,199
from

1894
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,039
what is in the kiss to what we're

1895
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:25,199
feeding that has to happen about halfway

1896
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:27,200
through flower and it's such a pivotal

1897
01:03:25,199 --> 01:03:29,759
point in time but um

1898
01:03:27,199 --> 01:03:30,960
iron iron is super important the other

1899
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:32,880
micros

1900
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,480
i don't have to worry about too much i

1901
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:37,440
honestly don't really put

1902
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:39,119
much of anything in other than iron

1903
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:42,000
magnesium is something that when you

1904
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:44,559
have super high calcium in the soil

1905
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,079
and we also add you know you know

1906
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,319
sulfate of potash so we're adding in

1907
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:49,920
potassium as well that that mag can kind

1908
01:03:48,318 --> 01:03:52,079
of become a little restricted and we've

1909
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,480
seen really great results with just

1910
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:56,318
pushing either magnesium foliars and veg

1911
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:58,000
or just by adding

1912
01:03:56,318 --> 01:03:59,759
a little bit of mag into that that

1913
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,318
feeding program and kind of boosting

1914
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:02,319
that so

1915
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:06,559
wow we haven't talked about this until

1916
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:08,079
uh on air here so some of this is new to

1917
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:09,359
me it's really interesting yeah until

1918
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,599
now

1919
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:12,798
yeah i gotta show you the dashboard and

1920
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:14,400
some of the the data i've been

1921
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:16,239
collecting it's really

1922
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:16,960
really fascinating but overall i mean

1923
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:18,558
like

1924
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:20,400
for someone that wants a soil that they

1925
01:04:18,559 --> 01:04:22,079
can use a

1926
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:23,440
large pot or a large container or even a

1927
01:04:22,079 --> 01:04:25,440
bed or something like that and just put

1928
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:28,559
a plant into it and

1929
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:30,318
it it does 95 of the work for them yeah

1930
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:32,000
just kiss organics all the way i mean

1931
01:04:30,318 --> 01:04:34,318
it's amazing

1932
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,760
our facility is in this really unique

1933
01:04:34,318 --> 01:04:37,679
position where

1934
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:40,480
we're just restricted by container size

1935
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:42,798
and we kind of have to pick up a little

1936
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:43,920
of the work halfway through flowers so

1937
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:45,519
but yeah

1938
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:47,838
well i appreciate that it's been great

1939
01:04:45,519 --> 01:04:49,838
to work with you guys

1940
01:04:47,838 --> 01:04:53,038
the iron thing is really interesting the

1941
01:04:49,838 --> 01:04:54,798
magnesium thing is

1942
01:04:53,039 --> 01:04:57,359
not unexpected to me

1943
01:04:54,798 --> 01:05:00,159
because of the high calcium levels uh i

1944
01:04:57,358 --> 01:05:01,679
could see where magnesium could be you

1945
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,798
know potentially optimized by adding a

1946
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,960
little bit more

1947
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:06,480
um you have to be careful with magnesium

1948
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,119
because it will raise your

1949
01:05:06,480 --> 01:05:10,400
your ph if you're if a lot of the ways

1950
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,000
that people are adding it because it is

1951
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,960
a cation too so

1952
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:14,318
um

1953
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:15,679
yeah there's so many it's such an

1954
01:05:14,318 --> 01:05:17,838
interesting all the dynamics and the way

1955
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:19,519
these minerals uh work together with

1956
01:05:17,838 --> 01:05:23,199
biology and the physical properties of

1957
01:05:19,519 --> 01:05:24,880
the soil to optimize plant health

1958
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:27,279
yeah and i hope people will start

1959
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:28,400
looking at this and utilizing testing

1960
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:29,680
one of the things that you brought up

1961
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,760
that i think is

1962
01:05:29,679 --> 01:05:33,598
important is you know people get stuck

1963
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,920
because they're like okay well i can go

1964
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:37,760
get a soil test but then what the heck

1965
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:39,760
do i do with this thing like

1966
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:41,520
do i have to pay someone else to look at

1967
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:43,039
it and give me results and you know

1968
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,159
there's a lot of people doing that with

1969
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:46,960
varying

1970
01:05:44,159 --> 01:05:48,719
abilities and quality um

1971
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,559
you and i are both you know friends with

1972
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:53,439
and fans of bryant mason over at seoul

1973
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,599
doctor consulting um he does have a

1974
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:57,039
yep he does have a course um i'm gonna

1975
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:59,039
get him back on the podcast but he does

1976
01:05:57,039 --> 01:06:01,280
have a course where he teaches you how

1977
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,960
to evaluate a soil test that you can

1978
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:04,559
sign up for and i think there's a

1979
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:06,400
actually a coupon code

1980
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:08,319
if you put in the kiss organics you can

1981
01:06:06,400 --> 01:06:10,318
save a i think 100 bucks or something

1982
01:06:08,318 --> 01:06:12,239
200 bucks off the test stuff the course

1983
01:06:10,318 --> 01:06:13,759
yeah and i

1984
01:06:12,239 --> 01:06:16,000
completely stand behind that but you

1985
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:17,359
know both jeremy and i have

1986
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,798
gone through that course and looked at

1987
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:21,440
it and i've had a ton of conversations

1988
01:06:18,798 --> 01:06:23,199
with brian and you know for anyone that

1989
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,599
is kind of in that position of like okay

1990
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:27,519
you know i do get a soil test now what

1991
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,720
definitely utilize his course and also

1992
01:06:27,519 --> 01:06:31,358
utilize his

1993
01:06:28,719 --> 01:06:33,439
you know consulting he's been immensely

1994
01:06:31,358 --> 01:06:35,519
helpful and just

1995
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,760
kind of building a foundation for us and

1996
01:06:35,519 --> 01:06:40,159
then circling back around and just kind

1997
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:42,240
of giving it's really difficult to like

1998
01:06:40,159 --> 01:06:44,000
build a program almost by myself and

1999
01:06:42,239 --> 01:06:46,078
then be like okay you know

2000
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:48,480
i should probably get a second opinion

2001
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:50,079
on this and and talk to someone else and

2002
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,199
verify and every single time we talk

2003
01:06:50,079 --> 01:06:52,960
it's just like

2004
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:54,798
really confirming for

2005
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,720
the work we're doing and moving forward

2006
01:06:54,798 --> 01:06:58,400
and and so can't say enough about him

2007
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,639
he's an awesome person and highly

2008
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:02,318
recommend him to anyone listening

2009
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,920
yeah so you can you can get a test

2010
01:07:02,318 --> 01:07:05,440
through logan labs send it off to bryant

2011
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,720
he'll give you a result that is a great

2012
01:07:05,440 --> 01:07:10,240
option for people

2013
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:11,279
um who don't have the time or energy to

2014
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:12,719
you know want to learn all of it

2015
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,640
themselves um

2016
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:16,399
and i don't want this to turn into a

2017
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:18,480
you know shameless plug for kiss but if

2018
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:21,200
you are using our soil we will customize

2019
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:23,039
a nutrient pack for you um for free if

2020
01:07:21,199 --> 01:07:25,358
you send us a logan test test of your

2021
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:27,119
soil and if it's our soil we offer that

2022
01:07:25,358 --> 01:07:29,679
as a service but um we're not doing

2023
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:31,358
outside testing uh just due to i don't

2024
01:07:29,679 --> 01:07:33,199
have the time to do it and and bryant's

2025
01:07:31,358 --> 01:07:35,038
already doing a better job than i could

2026
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,358
at it so uh

2027
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:40,079
i don't need to reinvent the wheel

2028
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:42,159
but getting back to uh

2029
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:44,000
this this testing stuff so i do want to

2030
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:46,558
ask you you mentioned you're adding iron

2031
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,920
you mentioned you're adding uh magnesium

2032
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:49,760
um you mentioned doing a lot of these in

2033
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:51,838
sulfate form can you talk a little about

2034
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:53,440
how your you know what products or i

2035
01:07:51,838 --> 01:07:55,838
guess not products but like what

2036
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:59,358
amendments are you using to

2037
01:07:55,838 --> 01:08:02,719
raise these particular nutrients

2038
01:07:59,358 --> 01:08:04,480
yeah that's been um

2039
01:08:02,719 --> 01:08:07,118
it's been really fascinating we've just

2040
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:08,719
kind of taken like a

2041
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,280
i don't know a

2042
01:08:08,719 --> 01:08:12,719
30-year step back because obviously when

2043
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,039
you go to

2044
01:08:12,719 --> 01:08:16,318
any other farm production right i mean

2045
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:18,319
there's

2046
01:08:16,319 --> 01:08:20,319
if you go to outdoor ag or you know any

2047
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:21,839
kind of vegetable or produce or anything

2048
01:08:20,319 --> 01:08:25,120
people amend their

2049
01:08:21,838 --> 01:08:26,559
fertilizers with you know raw products

2050
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:28,399
they amend their fields and stuff with

2051
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:30,319
raw products versus cannabis has this

2052
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:31,278
very interesting

2053
01:08:30,319 --> 01:08:34,080
um

2054
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:35,520
hierarchy of nutrients where it's like

2055
01:08:34,079 --> 01:08:37,119
you know cannabis nutrients there's over

2056
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:39,359
100 different brands of cannabis

2057
01:08:37,119 --> 01:08:40,880
nutrients and they all pretty much come

2058
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:42,960
from the same place you know they're

2059
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:44,480
they all use the same

2060
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,158
raw ingredients the same base

2061
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:47,919
ingredients and so

2062
01:08:46,158 --> 01:08:50,719
one of the things that

2063
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:53,199
i i definitely adopted from

2064
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:54,480
bryant and completely agree with is like

2065
01:08:53,198 --> 01:08:57,198
just stop

2066
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:59,759
paying to ship water and to have someone

2067
01:08:57,198 --> 01:09:02,479
else you know build this nutrient for

2068
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:04,960
you when you have so much more control

2069
01:09:02,479 --> 01:09:06,639
using those raw products yourself so

2070
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:09,039
pretty much everything i use other than

2071
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:11,279
two products is going to be attached to

2072
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:12,319
a sulfate they're all omri certified

2073
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:13,279
they're all

2074
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,239
um

2075
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,359
you know just just base ingredients so

2076
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:20,479
pretty much everything other than

2077
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:22,239
nitrogen and phosphorus is uh is coming

2078
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:23,919
from a sulfate form so you know calcium

2079
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:26,318
we're using gypsum calcium sulfate

2080
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:28,960
magnesium you're using epsom salt

2081
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:30,400
iron sulfate sulfate of potash manganese

2082
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,399
sulfate

2083
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:34,079
everything is basically sulfate attached

2084
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:36,318
the only you know raw powder that we're

2085
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:38,000
not would be like

2086
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,239
sodium borate but

2087
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,560
we i have no need to add boron pretty

2088
01:09:40,238 --> 01:09:44,000
much at any time we're always at a grid

2089
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:46,798
level so

2090
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:49,279
i also don't like putting sodium into

2091
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:51,039
the soil so i just i never really use

2092
01:09:49,279 --> 01:09:53,279
that every the main ones i use we

2093
01:09:51,039 --> 01:09:55,359
honestly don't put it much i use um the

2094
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:58,000
nitrogen we use is like the fertile

2095
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:58,960
explorer the powdered based soy protein

2096
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:01,600
um

2097
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,439
powder it's good you could also use like

2098
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,800
crow or secret it's pretty much the same

2099
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:06,399
thing

2100
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,279
and then

2101
01:10:06,399 --> 01:10:11,039
i use chipsum i use a little bit of mag

2102
01:10:09,279 --> 01:10:14,079
for like full ears i use sulfate of

2103
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,079
potash and

2104
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:18,880
yeah some some cfos for phosphorous and

2105
01:10:17,198 --> 01:10:20,559
that's pretty much it in iron iron

2106
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:22,319
sulfate but other than that i mean i i

2107
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:23,120
think i only use

2108
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:25,679
four

2109
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:27,279
of the products out of you know i have

2110
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:28,960
every single one on hand in case for

2111
01:10:27,279 --> 01:10:32,079
some reason that something pops up on a

2112
01:10:28,960 --> 01:10:33,920
specific crop but the only thing we use

2113
01:10:32,079 --> 01:10:35,279
actively is gypsum

2114
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:36,399
epsom salt

2115
01:10:35,279 --> 01:10:38,079
fifos

2116
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:41,599
ferticell explorer

2117
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,800
and iron sulfate and potassium sulfate

2118
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,560
so it's

2119
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:46,000
really basic and the way i have like you

2120
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:48,400
said you mentioned that we use a batch

2121
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,760
tank system now which has been

2122
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,519
a big change for us because we used to

2123
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:52,719
do inline injections so we have a batch

2124
01:10:51,520 --> 01:10:53,600
tank that

2125
01:10:52,719 --> 01:10:55,520
we

2126
01:10:53,600 --> 01:10:58,079
mix everything in and then for

2127
01:10:55,520 --> 01:11:00,159
simplicity we only mix one recipe a day

2128
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:02,238
i have this schedule built out so that

2129
01:11:00,158 --> 01:11:04,158
you know mondays and thursdays we have

2130
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:05,759
one recipe tuesdays and fridays we have

2131
01:11:04,158 --> 01:11:07,359
one recipe wednesdays and sundays we

2132
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:09,600
have another recipe and then saturdays

2133
01:11:07,359 --> 01:11:11,599
is when we introduce like

2134
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,960
biologicals like microorganisms and

2135
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:17,039
stuff into the into the soil so

2136
01:11:14,960 --> 01:11:19,359
i i really only use three recipes one of

2137
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:21,760
them is just kind of your your nitrogen

2138
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,439
and iron another one is your

2139
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,159
calcium and potassium and the other

2140
01:11:23,439 --> 01:11:29,359
one's mag and they just get that at

2141
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:32,158
varying amounts whether they're in veg

2142
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:33,599
uh pre-flower early mid or late flower

2143
01:11:32,158 --> 01:11:35,839
and i just kind of manipulate the

2144
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:39,039
volumes going into the soil

2145
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:41,440
and track where that data is

2146
01:11:39,039 --> 01:11:43,198
on the soil test and in the tissue and i

2147
01:11:41,439 --> 01:11:44,799
can kind of i don't even have to change

2148
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:46,319
the concentrations of the feeds i just

2149
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:47,679
change how much volume of the feed is

2150
01:11:46,319 --> 01:11:49,759
going into the pot

2151
01:11:47,679 --> 01:11:51,840
on an individual crop or a whole

2152
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:55,640
facility-wide basis and it makes it

2153
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,640
really easy to control

2154
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:59,760
that's yeah that's really interesting um

2155
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,119
i'm just trying to think if there's

2156
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,800
anything else

2157
01:12:01,119 --> 01:12:04,719
we could share for

2158
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:07,600
uh you know a facility

2159
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:09,679
that's listening that wanted to try and

2160
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:12,239
embark on this path of collecting more

2161
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,640
data and then using it to make some of

2162
01:12:12,238 --> 01:12:16,718
these actionable decisions is is there

2163
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,800
any advice you would have because it is

2164
01:12:16,719 --> 01:12:20,158
pretty daunting to think about i mean

2165
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,840
you're kind of through the worst of it

2166
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,279
but

2167
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:25,039
um yeah where do you start

2168
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:26,479
i think

2169
01:12:25,039 --> 01:12:28,000
yeah that's that's a great question

2170
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:28,879
because i

2171
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,760
you know

2172
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,119
for

2173
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:32,560
everything i've learned over this past

2174
01:12:31,119 --> 01:12:34,319
year i don't have

2175
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:37,280
20 years experience working with these

2176
01:12:34,319 --> 01:12:40,319
nutrients so it's um it's been a lot

2177
01:12:37,279 --> 01:12:42,399
really fast and for anyone listening i

2178
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:44,559
would say

2179
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,960
start like first off just don't guess

2180
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:48,880
right i mean if you see a deficiency on

2181
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:51,520
a leaf you don't don't just guess and

2182
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:54,000
apply something testing has a really

2183
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:56,239
important place in agricultural and

2184
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:58,640
production and just

2185
01:12:56,238 --> 01:13:00,479
utilize the experts around you whether

2186
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,920
that be bryant whether that be your

2187
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:03,759
local university obviously here in

2188
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,039
portland i go to oregon state oregon

2189
01:13:03,760 --> 01:13:07,520
state

2190
01:13:05,039 --> 01:13:09,359
has no affiliation with cannabis but

2191
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,960
they are able to work with hemp and

2192
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:12,639
there's a lot of universities around the

2193
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,600
country that are able to work with hemp

2194
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:15,520
and so

2195
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:17,600
most of that data

2196
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:20,640
you know correlates to each other so if

2197
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:22,800
you're having questions about

2198
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,640
nutrients just utilize the resources

2199
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:26,159
around you like you said you can do

2200
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,400
testing through logan lamps but they

2201
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:30,479
also offer you know recommendations

2202
01:13:28,399 --> 01:13:32,960
based on their own test brian

2203
01:13:30,479 --> 01:13:36,319
has really great advice and he has his

2204
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:38,960
own course built around nutrients

2205
01:13:36,319 --> 01:13:42,399
not entirely for cannabis but you can

2206
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:44,319
use everything in it for cannabis

2207
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,399
and so it's there's just a massive

2208
01:13:44,319 --> 01:13:48,799
amount of resources there but they're

2209
01:13:46,399 --> 01:13:51,198
they're often hidden i mean

2210
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:53,600
the nutrient industry in cannabis is

2211
01:13:51,198 --> 01:13:55,039
so overpowering

2212
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,560
none of the nutrient companies are going

2213
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,198
to tell you like oh yeah you know you

2214
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,120
just go just go pay you know 10 percent

2215
01:13:59,198 --> 01:14:02,639
of the cost of our nutrients by buying

2216
01:14:01,119 --> 01:14:04,559
the raw product and being able to

2217
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:06,560
control calcium individually rather than

2218
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:08,480
having to put in you know five nutrients

2219
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,239
at a time like it's that's not

2220
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:12,319
mainstream in the cannabis industry

2221
01:14:10,238 --> 01:14:14,879
these days so trying to read between the

2222
01:14:12,319 --> 01:14:16,880
lines utilize local universities utilize

2223
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:18,000
university research utilize crop

2224
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,159
consultants

2225
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,840
utilize labs utilize people like you

2226
01:14:20,158 --> 01:14:23,519
that are building an awesome product and

2227
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,800
kiss soil so it gives you a strong

2228
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,760
foundation

2229
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:28,320
and then

2230
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:30,400
know how to organize your data

2231
01:14:28,319 --> 01:14:31,599
like you said data for data sake is

2232
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:34,000
never really

2233
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,440
good in a production model so take that

2234
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,960
data and have a way to track it and

2235
01:14:35,439 --> 01:14:39,519
trace it and to correlate it to other

2236
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:41,119
things i'm talking with you know suzanne

2237
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:42,880
wayne wright evans the

2238
01:14:41,119 --> 01:14:44,640
amazing entomology just you can

2239
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,039
correlate these

2240
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:49,440
mineral concentrations to pest pressure

2241
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:50,800
you can correlate it to

2242
01:14:49,439 --> 01:14:52,319
you know yield obviously you can

2243
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,239
correlate it to plant health you can

2244
01:14:52,319 --> 01:14:55,679
correlate it to how much you water you

2245
01:14:54,238 --> 01:14:58,000
can correlate it to all these different

2246
01:14:55,679 --> 01:15:00,079
factors but you have to have that data

2247
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,238
organized digitally in a table in a

2248
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:04,960
spreadsheet you have to be able to to

2249
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:06,718
use it and to manipulate at your will so

2250
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:08,399
don't just save it on paper and put it

2251
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:10,640
in a folder and put it in a box and

2252
01:15:08,399 --> 01:15:12,639
stash it away and try to remember it all

2253
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,679
it's really great to take the 20 minutes

2254
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,840
to just

2255
01:15:13,679 --> 01:15:18,319
transfer it to a digital file

2256
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:21,520
catalog it organize it and to use it to

2257
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,519
track your program overall

2258
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,719
yeah and i i guess i've

2259
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:28,400
got it got me thinking um

2260
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:29,119
but one of the things i was going to say

2261
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,799
is

2262
01:15:29,119 --> 01:15:32,238
uh be sure to take some pictures of your

2263
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:33,840
plant too so you can have a visual

2264
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,678
representation of

2265
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:37,119
what this test

2266
01:15:35,679 --> 01:15:39,520
actually uh

2267
01:15:37,119 --> 01:15:40,960
actually correlates with visually so you

2268
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,560
can go back and look at your crop and

2269
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:44,560
then um

2270
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:45,679
if you are doing working with an

2271
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,960
agronomist

2272
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:49,279
make sure they're familiar that with

2273
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:51,439
soilless media because a lot of people

2274
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:53,279
are growing in essentially peat based or

2275
01:15:51,439 --> 01:15:56,319
cocoa based soils which is

2276
01:15:53,279 --> 01:15:58,479
very very very different than actual

2277
01:15:56,319 --> 01:16:00,238
sand silt and clay soil so

2278
01:15:58,479 --> 01:16:02,319
yeah a lot of agronomists aren't

2279
01:16:00,238 --> 01:16:05,119
comfortable and a lot of the tests don't

2280
01:16:02,319 --> 01:16:06,639
correlate well like uh bryant did a

2281
01:16:05,119 --> 01:16:08,158
great instagram post the other day

2282
01:16:06,640 --> 01:16:11,039
talking about how we can't we can't look

2283
01:16:08,158 --> 01:16:13,198
at cation exchange capacity the same um

2284
01:16:11,039 --> 01:16:15,679
that number isn't really relevant on a

2285
01:16:13,198 --> 01:16:17,039
malik 3 test for example so

2286
01:16:15,679 --> 01:16:19,119
that's just something to be aware of and

2287
01:16:17,039 --> 01:16:20,238
then

2288
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:22,319
the other thing i was going to say on

2289
01:16:20,238 --> 01:16:23,919
this is uh when it comes to tissue

2290
01:16:22,319 --> 01:16:25,279
testing you mentioned that there were

2291
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:26,719
some sufficiency ranges that were

2292
01:16:25,279 --> 01:16:28,559
already published is that something that

2293
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:31,840
i'd be able to share on the podcast page

2294
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,840
when we put out the podcast

2295
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:37,199
yeah so um there's some great ones out

2296
01:16:34,479 --> 01:16:39,839
of north carolina north carolina state

2297
01:16:37,198 --> 01:16:41,759
north carolina university i believe

2298
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:42,880
and yeah i can i can share those and

2299
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:43,760
they're

2300
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:46,159
they're

2301
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:48,640
good foundations but i won't say to

2302
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:49,920
entirely rely on them bryant also has

2303
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:51,360
some really great

2304
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:53,359
ranges

2305
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:55,279
from from his experience that i believe

2306
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:57,119
are in his program that are that are

2307
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:58,800
awesome to utilize so

2308
01:16:57,119 --> 01:17:00,479
all the university ones out there just

2309
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:02,719
remember that

2310
01:17:00,479 --> 01:17:04,879
they can't touch cannabis right now so

2311
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:06,239
it's with hemp and most of them are

2312
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:08,640
doing

2313
01:17:06,238 --> 01:17:10,158
testing that is either not tracked in

2314
01:17:08,640 --> 01:17:11,600
the maturation cycle meaning that it

2315
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,960
could be done in veg it could be done in

2316
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:14,800
flower it could be done pre-flower it

2317
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,520
could be done at any of these times

2318
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:19,199
they're also testing a wide variety of

2319
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:20,640
hemp genetics and

2320
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:22,879
one of the things i remember reading in

2321
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:25,360
one of those publications is that you

2322
01:17:22,880 --> 01:17:27,440
know the max deficiency range for one

2323
01:17:25,359 --> 01:17:29,679
cultivar was below the minimum

2324
01:17:27,439 --> 01:17:30,960
sufficiency range of another one for

2325
01:17:29,679 --> 01:17:33,199
i think it was either nitrogen or

2326
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:35,920
calcium so there's there's a really wide

2327
01:17:33,198 --> 01:17:38,000
range that's genetic specific

2328
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:40,000
um so i'll yeah i'll try to get those

2329
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:41,198
over to you and um

2330
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,158
see if i can kind of give you some of

2331
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:46,000
those base values to go off of but yeah

2332
01:17:44,158 --> 01:17:47,920
it's definitely something you have to

2333
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:50,319
kind of figure out for your own facility

2334
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:52,399
and take up or down don't don't just you

2335
01:17:50,319 --> 01:17:54,799
know double your calcium because some

2336
01:17:52,399 --> 01:17:56,879
university growing hemp says that it's

2337
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:58,960
the proper amount to grow calcium at the

2338
01:17:56,880 --> 01:18:01,359
end of the day you know your plant's

2339
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,640
best you know when they look healthy

2340
01:18:01,359 --> 01:18:04,158
you know when they're yielding the best

2341
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:06,159
so if things are yielding well and the

2342
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:07,279
data is just slightly off you don't have

2343
01:18:06,158 --> 01:18:09,839
to change something if you're getting

2344
01:18:07,279 --> 01:18:09,840
good results

2345
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,600
yeah so all the more reason to collect

2346
01:18:12,158 --> 01:18:16,319
data for your own facility and your own

2347
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:18,239
genetics and then also when you do have

2348
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:20,238
a good you know

2349
01:18:18,238 --> 01:18:21,759
bumper crop you know your best yields

2350
01:18:20,238 --> 01:18:23,599
make sure to take a test so you know

2351
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,960
what your targets are for that cultivar

2352
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,960
and what you did in that room so that

2353
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:29,359
you have you know essentially you've

2354
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:31,439
essentially created your targets in in

2355
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:32,719
in a certain respect so

2356
01:18:31,439 --> 01:18:33,919
that's a good way to look approach it

2357
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,600
from the other range it's not always

2358
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,239
about a deficiency sometimes it can be

2359
01:18:35,600 --> 01:18:39,039
about a optimal target

2360
01:18:38,238 --> 01:18:40,399
so

2361
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:41,679
completely agree that's one of the

2362
01:18:40,399 --> 01:18:43,519
biggest things i hear from crop

2363
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:45,359
consultants all across the country it's

2364
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:46,960
like you know like people come running

2365
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:48,960
in terror whenever something is wrong

2366
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:50,399
with their facility and we they talk to

2367
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:52,079
us once or twice we give them a couple

2368
01:18:50,399 --> 01:18:53,439
of suggestions and you know their plans

2369
01:18:52,079 --> 01:18:55,039
start to look healthy again and like

2370
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:57,039
okay yeah i got this now and they just

2371
01:18:55,039 --> 01:18:58,800
like they disappear again and then they

2372
01:18:57,039 --> 01:19:00,960
come back four months later panicking

2373
01:18:58,800 --> 01:19:03,119
when things start going wrong it's uh

2374
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,119
it's really important to

2375
01:19:03,119 --> 01:19:06,719
take note when you're doing things right

2376
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:08,158
if not more important than when things

2377
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:10,399
are going wrong because obviously you're

2378
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:12,879
never trying to mimic when something is

2379
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:14,238
going wrong you want to always you know

2380
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,079
have that target set point for when

2381
01:19:14,238 --> 01:19:17,359
things are going right so great advice

2382
01:19:16,079 --> 01:19:19,039
there

2383
01:19:17,359 --> 01:19:21,279
yeah and just one thing to end on for

2384
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:23,119
people is at the end of the day it's not

2385
01:19:21,279 --> 01:19:25,279
the goal of all of this is not

2386
01:19:23,119 --> 01:19:27,439
the perfect test or the perfect tissue

2387
01:19:25,279 --> 01:19:30,319
test it's it's really about

2388
01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:32,879
yields it's about healthy plants so

2389
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:34,319
don't don't drive yourself crazy if your

2390
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,760
plants look good and your test is a

2391
01:19:34,319 --> 01:19:39,119
little bit off

2392
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:41,119
sometimes it's better not to tinker

2393
01:19:39,119 --> 01:19:42,319
so i just want to leave that as a

2394
01:19:41,119 --> 01:19:44,640
thought for people in the back of their

2395
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:46,479
heads too because

2396
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,840
yeah i mean there's sampling errors

2397
01:19:46,479 --> 01:19:49,279
there's

2398
01:19:47,840 --> 01:19:50,880
there's a variety of reasons that test

2399
01:19:49,279 --> 01:19:53,198
result might not line up but at the end

2400
01:19:50,880 --> 01:19:54,319
of the day your plants

2401
01:19:53,198 --> 01:19:56,319
your plant health is what we want to

2402
01:19:54,319 --> 01:19:57,439
look at so

2403
01:19:56,319 --> 01:19:59,759
um yeah

2404
01:19:57,439 --> 01:20:02,399
well this you know i like jeremy i could

2405
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:03,760
talk to you for hours here so um

2406
01:20:02,399 --> 01:20:05,759
right we should probably wrap it up but

2407
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:08,000
was there anything anything uh partying

2408
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:11,119
you wanted to add regarding uh

2409
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,119
anything we talked about today

2410
01:20:11,439 --> 01:20:15,039
i think we pretty much covered a good a

2411
01:20:13,359 --> 01:20:16,799
good start yeah i completely agree we

2412
01:20:15,039 --> 01:20:18,719
could end up talking forever and ever

2413
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,880
but there's probably enough information

2414
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,279
there for people to digest and

2415
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:24,880
really appreciate you having me on and

2416
01:20:23,279 --> 01:20:26,880
having a chance to talk and kind of

2417
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,159
share some of this information and can't

2418
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:30,800
wait to kind of show you some of the new

2419
01:20:28,158 --> 01:20:32,238
data and dashboards and info we got

2420
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:34,239
going on down here it's been a little

2421
01:20:32,238 --> 01:20:36,079
bit so we got to catch up

2422
01:20:34,238 --> 01:20:37,678
that'd be great and i i look forward to

2423
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:39,039
