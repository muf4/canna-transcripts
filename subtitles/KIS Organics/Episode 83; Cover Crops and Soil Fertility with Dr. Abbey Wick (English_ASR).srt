discuss the cutting edge of growing from

7
00:00:26,079 --> 00:00:29,278
a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:30,719
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:29,278 --> 00:00:31,678

00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,640
a north dakota state university

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,920
extension soil health specialist and

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,679
associate professor

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,600
and has experience working with farmers

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:45,679
on soil health building practices like

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,079
incorporating cover crops into rotation

19
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:50,558
and transitioning to no-till systems

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,320
since 2012 she has had her hands in over

21
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,399
50 000 acres of soil

22
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,920
and influenced management on over 200

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,439
000 acres of farmland

24
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,960
in the northern plains just with the

25
00:00:57,439 --> 00:01:00,079
personal relationships she's developed

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,439
with farmers

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,878
there are many other farmers she

28
00:01:01,439 --> 00:01:05,039
influences through her bi-weekly

29
00:01:02,878 --> 00:01:05,679
magazine articles and television segment

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,000
along with

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,159
discussion-based extension programming

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,680
she focuses on goal-oriented approaches

33
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,118
so that farmers can maximize the

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,640
benefits while reducing the risk

35
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:15,599
associated with incorporating new

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
practices

37
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,359
she has been featured in successful

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
farming magazine q a and bonus sections

39
00:01:19,359 --> 00:01:22,478
for her work with cover crops and

40
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:24,478
ability to connect with farmers

41
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:26,319
she was also senator hovind's selection

42

45
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,520
now on to the show hi abby thanks for

46
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:38,319
coming on the show today

47
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:40,239
yeah thanks for having me yeah i'm i'm

48
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:41,199
excited to talk to you about soil and

49
00:01:40,239 --> 00:01:42,798
soil health

50
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,759
today can we start off telling people a

51
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:48,320
little bit about your background

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,319
yeah i am an associate professor and

53
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:52,478
also an extension soil health specialist

54
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:54,559
at north dakota state university

55
00:01:52,478 --> 00:01:56,478
so i've been here eight or nine years

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,799
kind of working with farmers

57
00:01:56,478 --> 00:02:02,078
working with our county extension agents

58
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,399
also programs like with the nrcs

59
00:02:02,078 --> 00:02:06,478
or the soil conservation districts to

60
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,000
get some of these full health practices

61
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,199
uh better understood and then

62
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,159
implemented on farm here in north dakota

63
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:14,079
so that's kind of what i've been doing

64
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,759
now i have a you know i guess i've lived

65
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,560
all over the country i've

66
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:20,479
um you know i got my training in wyoming

67
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:21,598
i was at virginia tech prior to coming

68
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:23,519
to here

69
00:02:21,598 --> 00:02:25,280
worked in colorado for a bit and grew up

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,879
in ohio so

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,239
i feel like i've been around quite a bit

72
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,519
just looking at soils and always

73
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:31,200
interested in soils and

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,640
and it was kind of fitting that i ended

75
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:34,318
up here working with farmers because

76
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:36,079
it's just it's a lot of fun and i really

77
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:38,318
really enjoy working in soil health in

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,280
this area

79
00:02:38,318 --> 00:02:43,919
so what aspect of soils or soil health

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,080
do you feel

81
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:47,199
like you fit into most strongly i know

82
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
when we talked before

83
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:50,479
you mentioned that you work with a team

84
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,239
of people and you know

85
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:54,560
everyone sort of has their specialty you

86
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,680
have a soil biologist and a few other

87
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,640
uh folks that you work with what's

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,159
what's your

89
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:03,839
sort of niche in all of this oh

90
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:05,519
gosh you know i try to fit in wherever

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,680
the farmers need me and

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,519
um you know i was pretty fortunate when

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,640
when ndsu started this soil health

94
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,879
program

95
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,199
gosh eight or nine years ago they hired

96
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,120
six different positions and so

97
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:18,799
um so i'm the lead extension for the

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,239
state here on main campus and there's a

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,519
researcher

100
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:24,640
kaylee gash who is a soil ecologist and

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,080
so she's

102
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:27,919
she runs the research program for the

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,440
state she specializes in all those

104
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:32,798
microbes in the soils

105
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:35,199
soil carbon and organic matter

106
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,040
nutrient cycling soil biogeochemistry i

107
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:38,719
mean she's she's really

108
00:03:37,039 --> 00:03:40,479
specialized in a lot of different things

109
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:41,359
but mainly you know having to do the

110
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,759
soil

111
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,120
soil ecology and then there's some other

112
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,000
um let's see one of the other

113
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
specialists here

114
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,039
that's up in langdon he does the the

115
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,199
salts

116
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:53,840
so we have fairly young soils

117
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:55,919
geologically and so we have a lot of

118
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,438
salinity and also sodicity so we're

119
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:59,199
managing salts that are reducing our

120
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:00,878
crop productivity here

121
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:02,560
so he kind of specializes in that and

122
00:04:00,878 --> 00:04:04,959
then we've got a fertility person and

123
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,560
then also a wildlife biologist

124
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,799
which is kind of neat that they saw that

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,199
perspective of soil health as far as how

126
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,719
it

127
00:04:09,199 --> 00:04:14,000
influences wildlife so a pretty diverse

128
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:16,798
team we've we've also had one

129
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that was um he was working up in minot

130
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
and he has since moved to be the

131
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,639
director

132
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,040
of one of our research extension centers

133
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,918
but um but it's been a good program i

134
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,560
kind of fit in

135
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:28,079
you know with the keeping my finger on

136
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,079
the pulse of what farmers need

137
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:31,359
or want to learn about or apply to their

138
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:33,680
farms

139
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,479
and then i try to direct the program and

140
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,759
that

141
00:04:34,478 --> 00:04:39,279
in that way um so yeah i don't know it's

142
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,840
hard to say what i truly specialize in

143
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,359
but i love

144
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,839
like soil aggregates or something i've

145
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,759
worked a lot with infield assessment of

146
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:46,638
soil health and what are we seeing how

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,400
do we

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,639
how do we choose practices that fit our

149
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:52,079
goals on farm which may be

150
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,560
different for every single field that

151
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,839
the farmer works with

152
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,839
so yeah i don't know i just kind of

153
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,758
float around and try to make sure that

154
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:02,239
the program stays relevant and is is

155
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,199
answering farmer's questions

156
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,759
yeah so when you step onto a new field

157
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,400
uh

158
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,600
and you see you know this their soil how

159
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,959
do you

160
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,680
what's going on mentally in your head in

161
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:17,120
terms of the steps of sort of evaluating

162
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,120
that soil um you know the

163
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,478
the first thing when we step into a

164
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,800
field and i love doing this with the

165
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:24,478
farmer is

166
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,478
is hearing the history of the field from

167
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:29,120
them uh getting their

168
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:30,959
take on what they need to accomplish in

169
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,560
that field and maybe how soil health is

170
00:05:30,959 --> 00:05:34,079
going to help them get there

171
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,600
you know in some cases we go into field

172
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:37,038
and a farmer may just say you know i've

173
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,240
tried everything else and what have i

174
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:40,719
got to lose

175
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,319
and um and trying slow health practices

176
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
so sometimes they're open to anything

177
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,319
because

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,520
we sometimes go into their worst field

179
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,240
that they have on the farm that they've

180
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,758
just

181
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,360
they've deep ripped it they've chisel

182
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,319
plowed it they've

183
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,240
you know done all these different

184
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:52,800
practices trying to get that soil into

185
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,439
shape

186
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,160
for planting and now they're thinking

187
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:58,639
well

188
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
why not try reducing tillage why not try

189
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,918
something like cover crops

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,600
so we usually have that conversation

191
00:06:01,918 --> 00:06:04,959
first and you know find a little bit

192
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,199
about their logistics

193
00:06:04,959 --> 00:06:09,038
of their operation what what it can they

194
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,520
do with the time that they have i mean

195
00:06:09,038 --> 00:06:13,839
we're working with farms here that are

196
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:17,519
gosh you know 1500 acres to

197
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:17,839
40 000 acres so fairly large operations

198
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,799
and

199
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:21,519
and do they have the manpower to seed a

200
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
cover crop

201
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:26,000
or uh to run a strip till machine and

202
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:28,000
the expertise to do that

203
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,439
um so you know we kind of look at the

204
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,120
logistics and then

205
00:06:29,439 --> 00:06:33,199
i kind of like to see what the farmer

206
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,199
thinks of the soil first

207
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,960
you know do they think that it's healthy

208
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,520
do they think it's pulverized

209
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:40,959
do they you know what what's their take

210
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,279
on it and then we kind of talk through

211
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,439
it

212
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,879
um before i tell them anything about

213
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:46,240
what i think of their soils we kind of

214
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:47,279
talk through what they think of their

215
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,000
soils

216
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:51,598
and um and then i'm kind of sneaky in a

217
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,038
way i kind of slip in different ideas

218
00:06:51,598 --> 00:06:54,240
and i let the farmers kind of come to

219
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:56,639
their own conclusions

220
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,000
um so yeah that's kind of what's going

221
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,478
through my head is is how am i going to

222
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,160
learn about this field their operation

223
00:07:00,478 --> 00:07:04,079
and you know what they want to do with

224
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,039
this field before we even really

225
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:07,038
start talking soils

226
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:14,719
yeah i would think as a as a farmer

227
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:16,239
uh they're probably uh hyper fixated on

228
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,960
nutrients and this is just pure

229
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,720
speculation how often do you find

230
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:24,000
a nutri a particular nutrient to be the

231
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:27,919
limiting factor of growth

232
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,918
or do you find like

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,598
you know i don't know something to do

234
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:33,519
with the physical

235
00:07:31,598 --> 00:07:35,360
you know makeup or aggregation of the

236
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:38,639
soil to be

237
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,160
limiting crop health

238
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
ah you know that's that's a great

239
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,280
question and i think um

240
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,759
you know the fertility is definitely you

241
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:47,198
know

242
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,520
one of the primary concerns you know

243
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,919
what what's limiting in that system and

244
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:53,198
you know oftentimes though when you know

245
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,799
if a farmer especially has an

246
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,079
independent crop consultant or somebody

247
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,439
they're working with on their acres

248
00:07:56,079 --> 00:08:01,519
they've probably identified that issue

249
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:02,719
or they've looked into the ndsu research

250
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:03,758
or something like that and they've

251
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
they've kind of

252
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,800
figured out that it's a sulfur

253
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
deficiency or

254
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,800
you know something like that that's

255
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:14,079
causing their crop to not perform

256
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,400
i guess um and so it's it that seems to

257
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,918
be

258
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,279
the part of soils that farmers can

259
00:08:15,918 --> 00:08:19,038
really wrap their heads around or they

260
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:22,000
have the resources to

261
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:23,120
um to address already um and the soil

262
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
health stuff is just a little bit more

263
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,560
fuzzy because it's

264
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,479
it's a little less understood and it's

265
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,560
so based on you know the soil

266
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:31,680
bio biological component and how that

267
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,360
interacts with the

268
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,360
chemistry of the soil and the physical

269
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,120
properties and you know so sometimes

270
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,639
it's harder for

271
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,158
for farmers to pinpoint the issues that

272
00:08:38,639 --> 00:08:42,319
are associated with soil health

273
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:43,679
um but you know when we start talking

274
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,040
about it i'll ask him about

275
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,799
you know how's your traffic ability at

276
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:49,599
planting you know can you get

277
00:08:46,799 --> 00:08:51,278
your your tractor across this field or

278
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,759
what's it like when you're planting

279
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,439
um or at harvest you know do they have

280
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,600
issues if it's a wet harvest

281
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,519
or a late harvest getting that getting

282
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,879
their combine across the field and so a

283
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,240
lot of it just comes down to you know

284
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,480
how's their equipment

285
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:06,159
going across that field and then we can

286
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
kind of back that into relating it to

287
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:09,360
soil aggregation

288
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:11,039
as being the structure in that soil that

289
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,039
holds up your equipment

290
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:14,159
or the water management part of it that

291
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:16,480
says you know

292
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:18,319
if you're using water in the soil with

293
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,159
something like a cover crop or a longer

294
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,399
season crop

295
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,000
how is that influencing the way the the

296
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,839
water dynamics of this field

297
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,039
um and how's your water move into the

298
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,120
soil

299
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,879
so i think you know i always try to kind

300
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,399
of go back to

301
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,000
especially with solar health because it

302
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,919
can be so difficult to kind of

303
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,080
you know learn and understand as to how

304
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:39,439
is your performance on this field

305
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,120
you know with your crop but also with

306
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,160
your equipment because we can relate so

307
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,560
many of those things back to

308
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:46,559
back to soil health and how's that soil

309
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:48,838
um holding up that equipment or

310
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:50,879
managing managing the water in that

311
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,080
field

312
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:56,480
that's really interesting i i think that

313
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,759
your your comments really highlight how

314
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,879
complex

315
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:04,159
of a system soil health is and also

316
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:05,759
how that relates to each farmer's unique

317
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:07,519
situation

318
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:09,679
i would think even with similar soils

319
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,200
just with you know different

320
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:12,719
different water management different

321
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,440
equipment

322
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,560
or different crops you could have wildly

323
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,480
different outcomes

324
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:23,838
in in terms of yields and you know

325
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
i guess farmer satisfaction

326
00:10:24,078 --> 00:10:27,759
yeah i mean it is so based on that

327
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:29,679
because you know there are farmers that

328
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,720
we have some very sandy soils in north

329
00:10:29,679 --> 00:10:32,479
dakota and

330
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
and some farmers are raising corn on

331
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,879
those sandy soils and well corn is a

332
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:38,319
long season crop and most of the times

333
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:39,759
it runs out of moisture

334
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,440
but you see a farmer across the road

335
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:44,720
shifting to something like a

336
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,480
pea crop and so the peas go in early

337
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,480
they come off early before the moisture

338
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:49,519
is limiting and there's just two totally

339
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,120
different

340
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,200
management approaches just in the crop

341
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,879
that you select for that field so

342
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,399
um so yeah it is pretty interesting it's

343
00:10:54,879 --> 00:10:58,078
so customized and i think that's why

344
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,919
these conversations in the field

345
00:10:58,078 --> 00:11:01,278
you know with farmers and kind of an

346
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:02,958
outside perspective or just somebody

347
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:05,278
else looking at their field with them is

348
00:11:02,958 --> 00:11:08,559
is really important to identifying some

349
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:08,559
of these approaches that can be used

350
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,759
so you know we've you've touched on

351
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,200
cover crops a little bit

352
00:11:13,759 --> 00:11:19,759
in relation to some of their benefits

353
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,320
um can we talk a little bit about that

354
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:21,838
you know some

355
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
some of the things that cover crops add

356
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:26,320
to a field in regards to

357
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,879
you know fertility biomass some of those

358
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,600
sorts of things

359
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:32,559
yeah yeah i you know we're so we're

360
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,240
north dakota

361
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:37,518
or i am you're not you're in some place

362
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,519
probably much nicer in the winter

363
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
but in north dakota we have a really

364
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
short growing season our crops pretty

365
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,600
much are the

366
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,680
the main thing that's growing during

367
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
that season and um

368
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:49,120
and then we have this long long long

369
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:51,519
winter

370
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
um so we have a pretty limited amount of

371
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,560
time to get something to grow

372
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,480
um to do a job for us and so

373
00:11:56,559 --> 00:12:00,159
oftentimes with cover crops which you

374
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,079
know are are the

375
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:03,759
our management tool to grow something

376
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,759
between your cash crops

377
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:08,559
um between you know planting a harvest

378
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,200
or interseeding it into those cash crops

379
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:13,199
is is pretty challenging for us um so we

380
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,440
do end up doing a ton of

381
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,600
of planting a cover crop into a cash

382
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,959
crop harvesting that cash crops and then

383
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,320
that cover crop is already established

384
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:22,559
and it starts growing

385
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,800
and we get a few extra weeks of growth

386
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:27,199
because of doing that approach

387
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,240
so we're always trying to find new ways

388
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,639
to do things

389
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,079
um and we have very few cover crops that

390
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,278
actually overwinter

391
00:12:32,078 --> 00:12:37,439
in our winters here so we're you know

392
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:39,120
our basic tools for overwintering our

393
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,720
cereal rye or winter rye

394
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,720
and um and there's also this winter

395
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,519
camelina oil seed that we're kind of

396
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,800
looking into and exploring here um you

397
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,320
know as well as other places like

398
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,479
maryland they can get clovers over

399
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,040
winter because the winter is mild and

400
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:54,720
you know sometimes the like the clover

401
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,000
seeds that come out of oregon they say

402
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,278
well they'll they'll do well they're

403
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,360
winter hardy and we get them here and

404
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:01,600
it's like dead as a door now

405
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,639
right in the spring by the time spring

406
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,079
comes so

407
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:06,000
um so we kind of you know we have a

408
00:13:04,078 --> 00:13:08,479
limited window we need to pick things

409
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,399
that fit well with our cash crops in

410
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,000
rotation which we have

411
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
dozens of cash crops that we grow here

412
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,519
in north dakota so trying to

413
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,120
to fit them into those you know the

414
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,320
planting time and harvest time of those

415
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,039
and to make sure we don't transfer

416
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,959
diseases

417
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:24,078
between cover crops and cash crops um

418
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:26,479
and just kind of making sure that it

419
00:13:24,078 --> 00:13:28,958
works for the for the farmers with their

420
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,240
with their herbicide applications too so

421
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,838
um

422
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,079
it gets pretty tricky pretty fast but we

423
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,720
have some just basics that we go to of

424
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:38,479
you know cereal rye radish has worked

425
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,600
really well up here

426
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:43,600
oats work great winter wheat spring

427
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,199
wheat

428
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,560
we just kind of go to those basics

429
00:13:45,198 --> 00:13:47,919
turnips if you're grazing them with

430
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:51,518
livestock we'll

431
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:52,559
recommend some of that and flax has been

432
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,240
really good for us too because a lot of

433
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:56,638
farmers here have grown flax so

434
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,680
to put it in a cover crop mix is it's

435
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,278
just fine for them because they feel

436
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,879
like they can manage it so we try to

437
00:13:59,278 --> 00:14:02,399
choose things that are easy

438
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:04,000
that kind of do the job and then we

439
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:06,399
figure out how to get it going

440
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,240
in a cash crop by interceding it versus

441
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
waiting till harvest because

442
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,079
because we just don't have time after

443
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:15,120
harvest here

444
00:14:12,078 --> 00:14:16,239
so you know with cover crops it sounds

445
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,198
like there's a lot of

446
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,240
different options and it really depends

447
00:14:19,198 --> 00:14:24,799
on

448
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:27,278
what the farmer's goals are you know

449
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:29,278
if i miss any some of these benefits

450
00:14:27,278 --> 00:14:31,519
please please jump in

451
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,879
cover crops can work to help with weed

452
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,039
management they can help

453
00:14:32,879 --> 00:14:37,679
with water management they can help with

454
00:14:35,039 --> 00:14:40,399
reducing erosion

455
00:14:37,679 --> 00:14:42,559
they can help with increasing your

456
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,078
organic matter in soils on scale that's

457
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:45,919
you can't just bring in compost

458
00:14:44,078 --> 00:14:47,838
if you have 1500 acres that you're

459
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:50,559
managing that's just not very practical

460
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,760
in a lot of cases i would think what are

461
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:56,799
some of the other

462
00:14:51,759 --> 00:15:00,958
potential benefits of cover crops

463
00:14:56,799 --> 00:15:04,559
in terms of targeted goals yeah i think

464
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:05,759
um you know for us here erosion is a big

465
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:07,599
one and i think keeping

466
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:09,120
those fields covered especially after

467
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,759
like little residue crops

468
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,639
of for us soybeans are pretty low

469
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:16,399
residue crop peas are low residue

470
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,079
so getting something growing there to

471
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,198
protect those soils from erosion is

472
00:15:18,078 --> 00:15:21,838
usually number one

473
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:23,599
on our list you know the water

474
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:25,680
management having something over winter

475
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,360
like that cereal rye

476
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:29,599
or winter camelina that can use water

477
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,320
both in the fall and the spring

478
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,159
can really help us here too or you know

479
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,920
building up a residue

480
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:37,360
with something like oats that can reduce

481
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,919
evaporation from the surface

482
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,600
and actually retains the moisture in

483
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:41,919
those soils is pretty important and you

484
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,199
know

485
00:15:41,919 --> 00:15:45,120
the weed control like you're talking

486
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:45,919
about is excellent for us too we we're

487
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,480
starting to get

488
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,559
different resistant weeds up here um and

489
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,000
so having that early spring growth of an

490
00:15:50,559 --> 00:15:53,439
overwintering cover crop

491
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,799
competes with weeds and can help give

492
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
farmers a little extra time to get out

493
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:59,039
there and

494
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,079
manage the weeds on that field um and

495
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:01,759
then like you mentioned the increasing

496
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,679
organic matter is a big deal for us

497
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,360
especially in our sandy soils

498
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,559
we do have some composting that occurs

499
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,199
around here but you have to be close to

500
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:08,799
a dairy

501
00:16:07,198 --> 00:16:10,159
and like you said the logistics of

502
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,838
getting it on a lot of acres can be

503
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,519
pretty challenging

504
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,360
um you know one of the things that seems

505
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:16,959
like a pretty hot topic for a lot of

506
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:18,879
farmers or interesting cover crops is

507
00:16:16,958 --> 00:16:21,039
this you know

508
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:22,078
this catch and release idea that cover

509
00:16:21,039 --> 00:16:23,679
crops take up

510
00:16:22,078 --> 00:16:25,439
nitrogen and then they release them for

511
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:27,439
next year's crop

512
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,279
and we're not seeing a lot of that here

513
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,560
um it's pretty complex

514
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:32,399
you know we're talking about before it's

515
00:16:30,559 --> 00:16:35,278
a complex

516
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,879
soils are complex and you know if we if

517
00:16:35,278 --> 00:16:39,360
we oversimplify them to think

518
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:40,958
that we can grow a cover crop it'll take

519
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,879
up nutrients which they do

520
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:45,278
um we've measured that and they do take

521
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:46,559
up those excess nutrients in the soil

522
00:16:45,278 --> 00:16:48,799
but then assume that they're going to

523
00:16:46,559 --> 00:16:51,039
release them when a crop needs it the

524
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,919
next year is is a pretty big assumption

525
00:16:51,039 --> 00:16:53,759
and

526
00:16:51,919 --> 00:16:55,919
we're not seeing those nutrients

527
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:58,079
released for for several years

528
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:59,838
um we're just it's being bound up in

529
00:16:58,078 --> 00:17:01,120
that organic material and it's not being

530
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,440
released for

531
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,279
a cash crop in the short term of you

532
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,600
know four to five years

533
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,879
um and that's okay right it's still in

534
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,678
the soil at least it hasn't been lost

535
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,520
from the system

536
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,038
but but i think there's some you know

537
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:14,879
some of those benefits are have been

538
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:16,318
oversimplified a little bit and we just

539
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,679
need to kind of fine-tune that but but

540
00:17:16,318 --> 00:17:19,438
that is one that farmers are interested

541
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,679
in because they want to reduce

542
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,798
fertilizer costs and get it down to you

543
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,360
know

544
00:17:22,798 --> 00:17:27,199
more manageable return on investment for

545
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,879
each acre

546
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:32,000
so when you reference that i think

547
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:35,360
immediately of clover when we talk about

548
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:39,599
um you know nitrogen fixing

549
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:42,639
legumes and uh the bacteria that

550
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:44,240
fixes atmospheric nitrogen how

551
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:47,440
but what you're saying is that you're

552
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,480
not actually seeing that end

553
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,400
in a form that the plant can can access

554
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,319
uh as quickly as you would have thought

555
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:56,400
but you're not losing it too i know we

556
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,599
touched on this in another conversation

557
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,440
can you kind of elaborate on that a

558
00:17:57,599 --> 00:18:02,480
little bit

559
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,440
sure yeah we um so clovers are really

560
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,400
popular for

561
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:08,160
nitrogen fixers and and we're you know

562
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,400
north dakota they don't fare very well

563
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,480
for us because we need 60 days of growth

564
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,519
on clover as a cover crop to actually

565
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,839
offset the cost

566
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:18,000
the high cost for the seed and most of

567
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:21,038
the times we don't get 60 days of

568
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,558
prolific growth to really offset it

569
00:18:21,038 --> 00:18:25,200
so we use some other legumes in our

570
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:26,720
system peas or fava bean or something

571
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
like that that's a little more cold

572
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,519
tolerant and does a little bit better

573
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,200
as far as growth and so you know you've

574
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:34,720
got the nitrogen fixers doing that and

575
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,960
what can you expect from those and then

576
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:40,160
you have the other ones that capture

577
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,558
nutrients um you know the radish or

578
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,519
oats or you know any other basically

579
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:45,038
living

580
00:18:43,519 --> 00:18:47,519
cover crop is going to capture some of

581
00:18:45,038 --> 00:18:49,759
those nutrients and hang on to it and

582
00:18:47,519 --> 00:18:51,519
and we're just you know when you have

583
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:53,679
decomposition of that

584
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,960
organic material in that plant i mean

585
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,720
you have to have the right temperature

586
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,038
and the right moisture

587
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,480
for the microbes to work on that organic

588
00:18:59,038 --> 00:19:03,839
material and to release it

589
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:07,200
or for plants and oftentimes

590
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,519
when our crops need that

591
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,880
those microbes may not be as active as

592
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:11,519
we need them to be to release some of

593
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,679
those nutrients

594
00:19:11,519 --> 00:19:15,279
they might go after different forms of

595
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
organic material in the soil and maybe

596
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:19,440
not going after those

597
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:21,359
those cover crop forms i don't know how

598
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,640
you'd even measure that but

599
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:27,359
um but you know we're also so it's a

600
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,038
timeline of saying it may not be ready

601
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:31,599
um the conditions might not be right for

602
00:19:29,038 --> 00:19:34,240
the microbes to be releasing that

603
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:35,918
nutrient to the crop when it needs it um

604
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,558
but then also we've got these

605
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,520
um shrink swell soils here these high

606
00:19:38,558 --> 00:19:43,119
clay soils

607
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:44,639
that we're seeing some of the um

608
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:46,319
some of those nutrients get caught

609
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,919
between the clay layers

610
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:49,839
which is getting even more complex right

611
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,360
i mean this is soil maybe that's the

612
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:52,798
theme of this whole thing is soils are

613
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,599
complex

614
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:54,960
but we're finding some of those

615
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:56,399
nutrients get actually caught between

616
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,038
the clay layers and they don't get

617
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,919
released

618
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:01,119
for the plants to use them so um so

619
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,400
there's all kinds of places that these

620
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,558
nutrients are going

621
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
or being stored in the soils and and we

622
00:20:04,558 --> 00:20:06,319
just don't know

623
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,798
kind of when they're going to be

624
00:20:06,319 --> 00:20:10,000
released yet whether it's from a

625
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:12,400
nitrogen

626
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,880
fixing cover crop or one that just

627
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,159
captures nitrogen in the soils

628
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,000
so we're working on it we'll try to

629
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,520
figure it out when we you know when we

630
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,640
can but right now we just tell farmers

631
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:22,000
to

632
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,759
put on you know whatever rate of

633
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,720
fertilizer you need do a check strip on

634
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,319
the side that's a full rate of

635
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,319
fertilizer and then

636
00:20:26,319 --> 00:20:29,918
come back and side dress with nitrogen

637
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:30,960
if you feel like it's deficient and if

638
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,640
it's not then the

639
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,279
organic matter is turning over then then

640
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,919
you're good you save some money

641
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:38,879
okay but you're not seeing uh that

642
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,759
nitrogen

643
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,039
leech out either then necessarily you're

644
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:46,400
saying that it's still there

645
00:20:43,038 --> 00:20:47,919
it's just not accessible right

646
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,440
yep that's exactly it it's we're not

647
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:52,240
seeing it leached but we're also

648
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:53,038
not seeing it become available that's so

649
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,359
interesting

650
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:56,879
somewhere you know everyone in their

651
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:58,639
heads they think clover

652
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,720
nitrogen and you just assume it's going

653
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,120
to be available

654
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,319
but it sounds like like you said the

655
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:07,759
microbes

656
00:21:04,319 --> 00:21:08,798
temperature sunlight of crop timing all

657
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:13,038
of these things

658
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:15,440
actually make it quite a complex process

659
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:17,119
yeah i think so it's it's you know it's

660
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:19,679
not just this catch and release

661
00:21:17,119 --> 00:21:20,479
or i'm gonna plant clover in my corn so

662
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,919
that

663
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,679
you know it fixes nitrogen for my corn

664
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,840
you know i mean some of it's just that

665
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,600
these these nitrogen fixers are really

666
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:31,678
beneficial because they're

667
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:33,759
their dead material is so highly

668
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,120
desirable by microbes that it stimulates

669
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:37,440
the system

670
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:39,199
um you know there's some leaky weakness

671
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,880
happening there with the nitrogen coming

672
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,960
out of the roots and whatever else but

673
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,000
a lot of it's just that material that

674
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
dead material of

675
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,640
a legume is just really desirable for

676
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,320
microbes to decompose so

677
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,038
um so yeah i think that you know there's

678
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:55,599
been some oversimplification of these

679
00:21:53,038 --> 00:21:57,038
systems that i think

680
00:21:55,599 --> 00:21:58,639
you know makes it challenging i

681
00:21:57,038 --> 00:21:59,200
understand that you know not every

682
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,520
farmer

683
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,960
needs to be like a super soil

684
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,599
microbiologist

685
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:07,120
you know or into soil biogeochemistry to

686
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,319
to manage these things but i think there

687
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:10,000
are just some things we need to be aware

688
00:22:08,319 --> 00:22:11,599
of to make sure that

689
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,279
that we're you know getting the most out

690
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:16,158
of our crop in each field

691
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:17,759
uh and not relying too much on some of

692
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,080
these practices or ideas that

693
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,119
that you know we can catch it and then

694
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:24,879
release it

695
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:26,079
uh using a cover crop yeah you know that

696
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,000
that is one other benefit

697
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,519
of cover crops that you touched on there

698
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,240
that we didn't i didn't mention before

699
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,558
and that's uh

700
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,000
sort of microbial health in soils and

701
00:22:32,558 --> 00:22:36,399
how you know

702
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,519
bare soils just don't fare well compared

703
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,080
to stools that have

704
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,759
plants in them and i think that having

705
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:43,678
you know roots available these microbes

706
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:46,720
obviously increases your

707
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,080
microbial health

708
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,319
you know we had talked about how

709
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:53,599
you know my micro microbes get

710
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,918
oversimplified too

711
00:22:53,599 --> 00:22:58,798
to things like fa uh you know fungal to

712
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,880
bacterial ratios as a tool and that

713
00:22:58,798 --> 00:23:01,918
you know your research there found that

714
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,760
that wasn't as

715
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,000
useful i believe can you can you touch

716
00:23:03,759 --> 00:23:09,200
on that a little bit too

717
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,079
sure sure yeah the um yeah microbial

718
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,759
health is

719
00:23:10,079 --> 00:23:13,439
is extremely important and we try to

720
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:14,960
focus on that right and we try to

721
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,400
measure it right we're humans we want to

722
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,720
measure everything

723
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,320
and know if it's working or not or what

724
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,519
we have and

725
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:23,359
and you know with microbes it's just

726
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:24,879
tough to do that and so like you brought

727
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:26,798
up that fungal to bacterial ratio

728
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:30,320
there's there's been a ton of emphasis

729
00:23:26,798 --> 00:23:30,879
put on that and you know i know how they

730
00:23:30,319 --> 00:23:33,038
do it

731
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,039
it's all these phospholipid fatty acid

732
00:23:33,038 --> 00:23:36,879
analyses they're plfa

733
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:38,720
and you send the sample off to a lab you

734
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,480
pay whatever and get the sample back and

735
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,038
it tells you you've got

736
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,558
this type of bacteria and this type of

737
00:23:43,038 --> 00:23:46,158
ectinom i see you're

738
00:23:44,558 --> 00:23:48,158
just generalizations of like

739
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,679
gram-positive bacteria or gram-negative

740
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,760
bacteria or

741
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,038
you know this is how much fungal hyphae

742
00:23:51,759 --> 00:23:53,599
you have in your system and then they

743
00:23:53,038 --> 00:23:58,000
create this

744
00:23:53,599 --> 00:24:00,399
ratio of fung you know fungi bacteria

745
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,200
and if you're only sending off one

746
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,600
sample

747
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:05,679
from one point in time it's just going

748
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:06,879
to tell you about that point

749
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,278
that location where you pulled the

750
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:10,720
sample at that moment you know it's

751
00:24:09,278 --> 00:24:12,558
it's not telling you about the whole

752
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,400
system or what that looks like across

753
00:24:12,558 --> 00:24:15,119
the field or the variability that may

754
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,919
exist

755
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:20,558
or any of those things and and so we've

756
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
run you know thousands of samples

757
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,079
and it's like the variability is just

758
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,159
huge with that analysis

759
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:28,720
and it doesn't mean that it's not

760
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,320
worthwhile but it also means that

761
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,079
if you're sending off one sample and

762
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:34,720
you're gonna make you know

763
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:36,879
huge management decisions based on this

764
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,880
analysis of one sample from one point in

765
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,559
time on your field

766
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,760
that's pretty risky and it's not

767
00:24:40,558 --> 00:24:44,000
something that we want that we're

768
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:45,359
prepared for farmers to be doing

769
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,558
or to be interpreting really i mean

770
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:48,399
sometimes i look at that data and i'm

771
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:52,240
like i don't know what that means

772
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:55,278
so um so yeah i mean i think it's just

773
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:58,159
you know using the general practices

774
00:24:55,278 --> 00:24:59,519
of reducing tillage you know to create a

775
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,000
home for these microbes and these

776
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:03,038
diverse

777
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,519
microbes do exist giving them a food

778
00:25:03,038 --> 00:25:05,839
source

779
00:25:03,519 --> 00:25:07,119
right with with your cash crop and your

780
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:09,038
diverse rotation

781
00:25:07,119 --> 00:25:10,719
and then adding in some cover crops to

782
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,960
fill in the gaps

783
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,558
and have something growing you know food

784
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
and shelter is number one for these guys

785
00:25:14,558 --> 00:25:16,798
so

786
00:25:15,119 --> 00:25:18,239
so just kind of creating that habitat

787
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,158
for them is is probably the most

788
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:21,359
important thing you can do and then

789
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:22,960
just make the assumption that they're

790
00:25:21,359 --> 00:25:24,000
there and that they're diversifying and

791
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,840
that new

792
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,759
new microbes are coming in that maybe

793
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:28,959
weren't as prevalent before and

794
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,798
they're all kind of interacting with

795
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,200
this community under the soil surface

796
00:25:30,798 --> 00:25:35,519
and and hopefully doing the job that you

797
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,159
need them to do

798
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:39,839
so what i'm hearing is that that test

799
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:42,080
doesn't necessarily give you a lot of

800
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:43,678
actionable data

801
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:46,240
because because you're going to be

802
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:48,960
trying to do things to

803
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,839
uh in terms of like best practices for

804
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,159
microbial

805
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:54,558
health and soil health anyway and the

806
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,000
diversification

807
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:57,599
that you see i mean the standard

808
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,720
deviation that i've seen on

809
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:02,319
these tests can be so wide that i look

810
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,200
at them and kind of scratch my head and

811
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:05,599
say

812
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,440
you know how can i how can i really use

813
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:08,079
this or does this allow me to make any

814
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,038
changes

815
00:26:08,079 --> 00:26:13,519
in my garden or in my field and i just

816
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:16,480
don't see it as a tool at this point

817
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:18,319
um i i don't know what are your thoughts

818
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,400
on that

819
00:26:18,319 --> 00:26:22,000
oh i i agree with you i wouldn't make

820
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
any you know

821
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,119
management decisions on these biological

822
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,278
tests

823
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,959
you know at this point because they're

824
00:26:27,278 --> 00:26:29,919
so variable and they depend on when you

825
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,600
pull the sample

826
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,679
and where you pull the sample and how

827
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:36,399
many samples you pull and

828
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,960
um you know i think it's neat stuff to

829
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,360
know

830
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,720
um but you know i think a lot of this

831
00:26:41,359 --> 00:26:44,079
you can just make these assumptions and

832
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,759
i know people get freaked out about

833
00:26:44,079 --> 00:26:47,918
assumptions because

834
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:49,440
you're not collecting the actual data or

835
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,960
you know something like that but we have

836
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,000
collected the data we've run

837
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,079
all these soil health analyses on

838
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,519
you know one field we had 180 points

839
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:59,839
across that field and we

840
00:26:57,519 --> 00:27:00,720
sampled it multiple times and looked at

841
00:26:59,839 --> 00:27:04,319
these things and

842
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,079
and it's just um you know

843
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,678
you learn as much about your field and

844
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,240
the health of your field by using a

845
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
shovel

846
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:12,079
as you ever could um by running all

847
00:27:11,119 --> 00:27:13,359
these analyses

848
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:15,038
and so sometimes it's neat to know and

849
00:27:13,359 --> 00:27:16,240
you can use it as a baseline but i

850
00:27:15,038 --> 00:27:17,200
certainly wouldn't make management

851
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,798
decisions

852
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,960
based on that you know on a fungal

853
00:27:18,798 --> 00:27:23,599
bacterial ratio or

854
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,759
you know any of those things uh at this

855
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:27,519
point we're just not there yet and

856
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:28,879
and we'll get there maybe you know but

857
00:27:27,519 --> 00:27:29,359
in the meantime it's just good to know

858
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,559
that

859
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:33,038
that you're creating a good home for

860
00:27:30,558 --> 00:27:34,000
microbes you're covering your field and

861
00:27:33,038 --> 00:27:35,119
reducing erosion

862
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,119
you may be getting better traffic

863
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:38,719
ability um

864
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:40,959
you know whether it's a garden or a

865
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,558
field you can see these changes

866
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,159
that's that are occurring as you build

867
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:47,359
up your soils and maybe it's just good

868
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:50,480
to be to be happy with that

869
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:54,000
yeah i like that um

870
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,839
i i guess you know for me with the

871
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,919
with the with the microbes i i kind of

872
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:59,678
feel like like you said like let's just

873
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,600
let's just take on best practice i'm not

874
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,720
convinced we'll ever fully understand it

875
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:05,359
because it's such a

876
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,558
complex process and i'm not sure that we

877
00:28:05,359 --> 00:28:09,199
necessarily need

878
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:10,079
to ever you know completely understand

879
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:13,120
it

880
00:28:10,079 --> 00:28:14,158
um but i do think that uh is it's an

881
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:16,398
interesting

882
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,080
thing to continue to explore but you

883
00:28:16,398 --> 00:28:20,319
know one of the things is like

884
00:28:18,079 --> 00:28:21,519
if you have a fertilizer application if

885
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:23,200
it rained recently

886
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,720
if it hasn't rained all of these things

887
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,319
are going to affect

888
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,159
your microbial populations pretty

889
00:28:26,319 --> 00:28:29,759
quickly

890
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:31,278
to where i think it would be really hard

891
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:33,759
to make like you said a long-term

892
00:28:31,278 --> 00:28:33,759
decision

893
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,519
yeah yeah i like that i like that

894
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,200
approach so it's

895
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:40,960
so you're just kind of looking at what

896
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
management practices you're using are

897
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,519
they achieving some goals and maybe

898
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
microbes are just kind of coming along

899
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,839
with it and

900
00:28:44,398 --> 00:28:50,158
you're getting those benefits as you go

901
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:51,519
yeah so jumping around a little bit here

902
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,880
i kind of want to move back to

903
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,119
cover crops because we talked a little

904
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
bit about the benefits of them but we

905
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:58,639
didn't really touch on

906
00:28:56,398 --> 00:29:01,119
all of the comp complexities like when

907
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,880
you talk to a farmer

908
00:29:01,119 --> 00:29:04,398
it sounds like the first thing you're

909
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:07,440
looking at is their

910
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:08,798
their goals so like um can you give an

911
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,960
example of like uh

912
00:29:08,798 --> 00:29:13,440
a situation with a with a particular

913
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,240
cover crop in terms of a farmer's goals

914
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,278
and how you and

915
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:19,278
how you meet that yeah

916
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:21,278
um let's see so maybe i'll do we've got

917
00:29:19,278 --> 00:29:22,798
some crazy high clay soils here but

918
00:29:21,278 --> 00:29:24,159
um they're pretty specific to our region

919
00:29:22,798 --> 00:29:24,839
so maybe i'll talk about some sandy

920
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,278
soils

921
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:29,278
where um you know i came in a little bit

922
00:29:27,278 --> 00:29:30,558
after the fact on this one the farmer is

923
00:29:29,278 --> 00:29:32,319
already doing these great things because

924
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,839
he's got a crop consultant that's very

925
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,079
interested in soil health and very good

926
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:38,959
at making recommendations there so

927
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:40,480
um so there's you know there's a farmer

928
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,159
over by jamestown north dakota and he's

929
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,200
got some very sandy soils that he works

930
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,640
with

931
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,919
and um it's kind of like the tale of two

932
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,159
fields so he has one field that he's

933
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,759
been managing with no-till for

934
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:54,880
15 to 18 years probably added in cover

935
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:57,919
crops to that system

936
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,840
changed his rotation on it to grow

937
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,919
shorter season crops to be better suited

938
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:04,879
for those sandy soils

939
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,440
so for example corn and soybean would be

940
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
you know

941
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,798
kind of king here in north dakota in

942
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,720
that area you know that's just

943
00:30:08,798 --> 00:30:12,720
that would be the rotation well he grows

944
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
wheat on that field so it comes off a

945
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:15,759
little earlier

946
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,840
he grows peas on that field so again it

947
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,278
comes gets in early comes off early and

948
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:20,480
gives them a chance to plant a cover

949
00:30:19,278 --> 00:30:22,798
crop

950
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,519
in that field and so he started doing

951
00:30:22,798 --> 00:30:25,519
that he

952
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:27,359
um he'd follow it with like an oat cover

953
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:28,798
crop or something so it'll winter kill

954
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:30,558
and he doesn't have to worry about using

955
00:30:28,798 --> 00:30:33,440
too much moisture in the spring

956
00:30:30,558 --> 00:30:33,918
throws in a little radish some flax um

957
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,159
let's

958
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,440
you know some of the volunteer from the

959
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:40,000
cash crop come back

960
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,679
and he gets pretty much another growing

961
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,038
season out of that field and

962
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,519
and what he's doing with that is that

963
00:30:43,038 --> 00:30:47,119
he's increasing his organic matter he's

964
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:48,720
not only covering he's increasing

965
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:49,599
organic matter so that it holds more

966
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,360
moisture

967
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:53,038
on that in those sandy soils but then

968
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,079
he's also getting better cover on that

969
00:30:53,038 --> 00:30:56,398
field

970
00:30:54,079 --> 00:30:57,839
going into the winter to reduce erosion

971
00:30:56,398 --> 00:30:58,319
and so he's been doing this stuff for a

972
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:00,558
while

973
00:30:58,319 --> 00:31:03,119
and you know happy with the performance

974
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:05,678
on his field well he took over a new

975
00:31:03,119 --> 00:31:07,678
half section of land um kind of kitty

976
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:08,559
corner to that field it's the same soil

977
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,320
type

978
00:31:08,558 --> 00:31:12,398
and that field had been corn and soybean

979
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:13,519
and it had been chisel plowed and ripped

980
00:31:12,398 --> 00:31:16,479
and whatever else

981
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:18,000
and as you started farming that first

982
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,079
thing you put on it was a short season

983
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,679
crop like peas followed it again with a

984
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,439
cover crop to get that organic matter

985
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,240
built up and that first year

986
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,679
we grabbed some soils from from his

987
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,679
existing field where he'd been using

988
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
these practices for 15 or more years

989
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,960
and grabbed some soils from that new

990
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,120
field he took over and just

991
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,319
put him side by side to look at soil

992
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:38,558
color

993
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:39,599
and the practices he had been using with

994
00:31:38,558 --> 00:31:41,759
the

995
00:31:39,599 --> 00:31:43,678
reduction of tillage the incorporation

996
00:31:41,759 --> 00:31:44,879
of cover crops the changing of his crop

997
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,399
rotation

998
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,320
his soils that he'd been managing for a

999
00:31:46,398 --> 00:31:49,918
long period of time were much darker

1000
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:52,240
than those in the other field he'd just

1001
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:54,000
taken over and so that tells you there's

1002
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,720
more organic matter and he's probably

1003
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,159
getting better

1004
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,839
moisture retention on those fields

1005
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,039
especially in a drought like we are in

1006
00:31:57,839 --> 00:32:00,798
this year

1007
00:31:59,038 --> 00:32:03,119
he's probably got the moisture there

1008
00:32:00,798 --> 00:32:06,079
that he needs to get that crop going

1009
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:06,558
and um and he was pretty happy he he

1010
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:09,359
hadn't

1011
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:10,720
ever looked at those two solos side by

1012
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:11,759
side and it was kind of for him it was

1013
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,038
like okay well

1014
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,200
now i know that what i've been doing is

1015
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:16,558
working and i can just kind of see it

1016
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,240
visually

1017
00:32:16,558 --> 00:32:20,558
so he's doing the same practices on that

1018
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,399
other field to get it back in shape so

1019
00:32:20,558 --> 00:32:24,319
um so that would be you know one example

1020
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:25,678
of where some of those changes have

1021
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:28,158
really made a difference

1022
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:29,759
um for field and and you know kind of

1023
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,278
evaluating it too

1024
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,879
um but i think that's that's pretty

1025
00:32:31,278 --> 00:32:33,759
common when farmers change the the

1026
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,960
system

1027
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:38,079
um and suit it to those soils i think it

1028
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:41,360
can make a big difference

1029
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:44,319
in how those soils perform

1030
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,038
yeah what do you see when farmers first

1031
00:32:44,319 --> 00:32:46,480
start

1032
00:32:45,038 --> 00:32:48,158
making changes like this let's say you

1033
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:49,440
had a farmer who was farming fairly

1034
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:52,080
conventionally

1035
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,840
you know a lot of soil disturbance a lot

1036
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:57,839
of chemical fertilizers

1037
00:32:53,839 --> 00:33:01,278
um how how does that look switching over

1038
00:32:57,839 --> 00:33:04,000
in terms of cost and also

1039
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,200
yields as they make a change because i'm

1040
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,759
making the assumption that you have a

1041
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,278
farmer

1042
00:33:05,759 --> 00:33:08,960
they really work the land the soil is

1043
00:33:07,278 --> 00:33:10,640
fairly depleted they're seeing their

1044
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,000
yields go down and down and down and

1045
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
then they finally reach out to you and

1046
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,720
say

1047
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,678
abby help me fix this like what can we

1048
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,558
do

1049
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,559
what does that look like

1050
00:33:18,798 --> 00:33:22,398
boy um you know it looks again different

1051
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,000
for every farm but

1052
00:33:22,398 --> 00:33:26,079
but in general you know most of them

1053
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,000
have the equipment to no-till

1054
00:33:26,079 --> 00:33:30,079
right i mean their their cedars and

1055
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,278
their planters can all

1056
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:35,119
can all perform well in in residue um

1057
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:36,480
can you you know before you go any

1058
00:33:35,119 --> 00:33:38,239
further can you explain

1059
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,919
what that means on an agricultural level

1060
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,440
because

1061
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,960
i think that a lot of people that list

1062
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,159
this podcast don't know what

1063
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,759
no-till and minimal till really means

1064
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,679
agriculturally because it's a little

1065
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,359
different

1066
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:52,880
i think terminology i guess in that

1067
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:55,839
regard

1068
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,440
oh good yeah thanks thanks for that um

1069
00:33:55,839 --> 00:34:00,798
so no-till

1070
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,399
for us is you know just not making a

1071
00:34:00,798 --> 00:34:06,079
tillage pass with a chisel plow or

1072
00:34:04,398 --> 00:34:07,678
you know anything like that in the fall

1073
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:09,918
or the spring and so

1074
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,838
literally when you harvest that crop and

1075
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:13,199
leave that residue behind the combine

1076
00:34:11,838 --> 00:34:15,279
that's what you're going to plant into

1077
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,638
the next spring you're not going to

1078
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,760
disturb it at all with any kind of

1079
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,960
tillage

1080
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:23,760
um there's also kind of these you know

1081
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,000
ideas of using vertical tillage uh which

1082
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,879
is another management tool so it's not

1083
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,320
as disturbing of the soil as like a

1084
00:34:28,878 --> 00:34:33,598
chisel plow would be

1085
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:35,119
um which you know goes several inches

1086
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,720
into the soil but a vertical tillage

1087
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,960
would be you know goes maybe two inches

1088
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,078
in the soil and it just slices and sizes

1089
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,760
residue

1090
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,359
and so farmers will use that practice

1091
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,599
generally you know in the spring

1092
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:46,639
before planting if they feel like like

1093
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,320
they left that field

1094
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,838
we're going to try to go to no-till but

1095
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,960
the residue just you know

1096
00:34:49,838 --> 00:34:52,960
they're going to get not get a good

1097
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,599
stand uh with their equipment so they'll

1098
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,398
run this

1099
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:57,760
this tillage tool prior called vertical

1100
00:34:56,398 --> 00:34:58,960
tillage and they'll they'll kind of

1101
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,240
size up that residue and create

1102
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,679
something they can plant into a little

1103
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:03,118
bit better

1104
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:05,199
and then there's strip till which some

1105
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:07,599
farmers use here

1106
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:09,279
which is a whole different expensive

1107
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,920
piece of equipment

1108
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:13,200
but it creates strips in that field

1109
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,400
where you're going to plant your cash

1110
00:35:13,199 --> 00:35:15,919
crop

1111
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,680
and so generally you do that the fall

1112
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,119
before and you get your fertilizer down

1113
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:20,639
in those strips and

1114
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:22,320
you're only disturbing a third of the

1115
00:35:20,639 --> 00:35:23,679
soil so you've got the the tillage

1116
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,200
happening where you're planting a crop

1117
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:26,559
and then in between you're leaving

1118
00:35:25,199 --> 00:35:28,078
residue

1119
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:29,358
similar to like a no-till situation

1120
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,800
where you have good residue cover

1121
00:35:29,358 --> 00:35:31,838
between but you've got these berms or

1122
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,039
these strips

1123
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:34,239
that you're going to plant into that

1124
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:36,639
would be like chisel plastic so it's

1125
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:39,919
really kind of a hybrid type

1126
00:35:36,639 --> 00:35:41,199
tillage practice so so that's you know

1127
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,800
kind of what farmers would be looking at

1128
00:35:41,199 --> 00:35:44,000
there's all kinds of other variations on

1129
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,680
this but

1130
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,358
but those are kind of the general you

1131
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,879
know no-till

1132
00:35:47,358 --> 00:35:50,559
reduced tillage which would be kind of a

1133
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,480
vertical till and then um

1134
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:57,279
strip till okay

1135
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,000
yeah so um that's that's helpful so

1136
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,560
you're you're trying

1137
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,079
to reduce that um when are instances

1138
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,400
where you may encourage tilling does

1139
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,160
that

1140
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,320
does that occur yeah i mean

1141
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:10,239
there's you know in a wet harvest or

1142
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,680
something i mean farmers

1143
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:13,838
may cause some ruts in their field

1144
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:15,759
whether they're no-till or

1145
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:17,679
full tillage sometimes you just you have

1146
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,320
to get the crop off and it's wet

1147
00:36:17,679 --> 00:36:21,838
and equipment gets stuck or you leave

1148
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,519
some

1149
00:36:21,838 --> 00:36:25,358
some tracks or something in the field

1150
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,000
and you don't have to work the whole

1151
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:27,598
field or do

1152
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,760
the whole you know till the whole field

1153
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,039
to get it back in shape but

1154
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,119
but if you don't want to keep driving

1155
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:33,920
over those ruts for the next 10 years

1156
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,838
you know you need to

1157
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:37,920
go in and level them off with something

1158
00:36:35,838 --> 00:36:39,759
um and kind of

1159
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,358
get that soil back to where you know you

1160
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,800
can harvest uh

1161
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:44,960
you know with your header close to the

1162
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:47,359
ground and

1163
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,679
not catch dirt or ruts or you know

1164
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:50,960
something like that and also i mean

1165
00:36:49,679 --> 00:36:52,319
yeah farmers don't want to be bounced

1166
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,720
around in their equipment all the time

1167
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,240
so

1168
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:56,319
that's why i recommend tillage you know

1169
00:36:54,239 --> 00:36:58,399
mostly is if you've

1170
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,599
if you have some ruts in the field from

1171
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,119
a wet harvest or

1172
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,480
wet planting or something like that you

1173
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:04,400
need to get them out then that's an

1174
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,079
appropriate time to do tillage

1175
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,720
um you know i always ask farmers if

1176
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,280
you know if the tillage are doing what

1177
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,358
is the

1178
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,280
reason for that tillage you know if they

1179
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:16,719
can identify a specific reason to do

1180
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,040
that tillage

1181
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:19,919
and can you know a specific timing for

1182
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,199
it

1183
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,800
i think it's important to ask yourself

1184
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:23,759
that every time to make sure it doesn't

1185
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
become a habit

1186
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,040
and something that you're just doing

1187
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,159
because you've

1188
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:32,000
been doing it a while or you know

1189
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:33,358
is the field too wet to plant in the

1190
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,519
spring and you need to do a vertical

1191
00:37:33,358 --> 00:37:37,199
tillage pass then then do it

1192
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,239
but if the field is dry the next spring

1193
00:37:37,199 --> 00:37:39,919
and you're out there doing a vertical

1194
00:37:38,239 --> 00:37:41,439
tillage pass and you've lost that

1195
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,159
original reason for why you're doing it

1196
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,838
then

1197
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:45,679
then maybe you don't need to be doing it

1198
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:46,719
at that point so

1199
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:48,078
you know i think it's always good for

1200
00:37:46,719 --> 00:37:49,358
farmers to kind of check back in with

1201
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,400
why they're doing something on their

1202
00:37:49,358 --> 00:37:52,239
farm

1203
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,838
and you know if they can't identify the

1204
00:37:52,239 --> 00:37:56,399
reason anymore then

1205
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,199
maybe they don't need to be doing it

1206
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,639
yeah

1207
00:37:57,199 --> 00:38:00,719
i could see where you just get into a

1208
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,519
habit of treating your soil the same

1209
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:05,039
every year

1210
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:07,199
or your land uh what about like uh

1211
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:08,480
um if you have residue that's just not

1212
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:10,559
breaking down fast enough

1213
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,159
the microbes aren't you know breaking

1214
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,199
down whatever cover crop you'd run

1215
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:15,679
through the winter

1216
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:18,239
uh come planting time what do you do in

1217
00:38:15,679 --> 00:38:20,960
scenarios like that

1218
00:38:18,239 --> 00:38:22,399
uh you know that would be gosh i suppose

1219
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,400
that would be something that you could

1220
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:26,000
run a vertical tillage passover

1221
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,639
or something if you feel like you've got

1222
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,358
a lot going on out there and a lot to

1223
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:31,679
plant into

1224
00:38:29,358 --> 00:38:33,119
then um then yeah you may decide to do a

1225
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:34,799
vertical tillage pass and

1226
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,039
and kind of knock it back and size it a

1227
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,480
little bit um and that would be okay but

1228
00:38:37,039 --> 00:38:40,960
i you know before even doing that

1229
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,639
i encourage farmers to get their their

1230
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,000
planter out there and do a couple strips

1231
00:38:42,639 --> 00:38:45,598
into it and just see

1232
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,039
see what it's like to plant into you

1233
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,079
know i mean sometimes when you look at a

1234
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,358
field

1235
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,320
you think it's going to be a mess but

1236
00:38:49,358 --> 00:38:51,440
then you get out in it and your

1237
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,039
equipment does really well

1238
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,000
or you're not even seeding anything but

1239
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,440
you're just running your equipment

1240
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,079
through to see how it performs

1241
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,280
um i think that's okay too you know and

1242
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,560
maybe you don't need to

1243
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,960
incur that cost of of doing some kind of

1244
00:39:02,559 --> 00:39:06,559
you know additional pass so i'm always

1245
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,440
kind of encouraging farmers to try

1246
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:10,078
something first

1247
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,440
and if it's if it doesn't work then come

1248
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,599
back in with that

1249
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,880
you know whatever tillage path or

1250
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,720
adjustment or something but

1251
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:18,640
but give it a shot first and see see how

1252
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:21,919
it goes and and then

1253
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,879
kind of adjust from there yeah so all

1254
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,400
that residue

1255
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,119
is you know little little fertilizer

1256
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,480
bags

1257
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,800
and little water retention holders for

1258
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,760
you

1259
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:35,359
i would say what about the risk of

1260
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:38,160
disease though

1261
00:39:35,358 --> 00:39:39,838
you know potentially having more fungal

1262
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:42,480
issues or things as

1263
00:39:39,838 --> 00:39:45,119
or bacteria as those uh residues are

1264
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,119
breaking down

1265
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:48,960
definitely we're pest habitat i guess

1266
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,240
too yeah

1267
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,639
yeah i mean you're changing the whole

1268
00:39:50,239 --> 00:39:54,719
system right so the the diseases and

1269
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:57,440
pests that you may have had

1270
00:39:54,719 --> 00:39:58,719
or weeds you know with full tillage are

1271
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,960
not going to be the same

1272
00:39:58,719 --> 00:40:02,319
as in a reduced pill or a no-till

1273
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,240
situation so

1274
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,240
i mean gosh you can look at things like

1275
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:08,399
goss's wills and corn

1276
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:10,318
um that's you know transferred on

1277
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:12,000
residue i believe hopefully i'm not

1278
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:13,358
wrong on that i keep trying to remember

1279
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,358
all these different disciplines i work

1280
00:40:13,358 --> 00:40:17,279
with and sometimes it works sometimes it

1281
00:40:15,358 --> 00:40:19,920
doesn't so if i'm wrong let me know

1282
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:21,119
um but that can be an issue right i mean

1283
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,599
if you have that

1284
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:25,599
bacteria on that residue living there

1285
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,280
and if you go to the crop the next year

1286
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,680
and it transfers over that can be an

1287
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,720
issue

1288
00:40:27,679 --> 00:40:33,440
or you can have diseases transfer

1289
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:35,598
between cover crops so for us

1290
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,358
radish is also a host for club root

1291
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,480
which is a huge problem in canola

1292
00:40:37,358 --> 00:40:40,559
production

1293
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,599
so it's you know you have to be careful

1294
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:42,880
of those things

1295
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:45,119
as you change your system you're

1296
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,240
changing your management um and for sure

1297
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,519
like weeds

1298
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:49,279
you know in a full tillage system

1299
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:50,480
they're kind of an annual weed issue and

1300
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,839
then you go to no-till and it's a

1301
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,679
perennial weed issue and so you're

1302
00:40:51,838 --> 00:40:55,119
spraying at different times and

1303
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:57,679
you know trying to figure out how to

1304
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,960
manage those weeds in different ways so

1305
00:40:57,679 --> 00:41:00,639
it's definitely something to keep in

1306
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,760
mind that if you change one part of your

1307
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:03,759
system you're probably going to change a

1308
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,119
lot of parts of that system

1309
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:07,040
and just be prepared for it and keep

1310
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,240
your eyes open to it

1311
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:09,519
and talk with other people who have made

1312
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:10,239
that transition because they know what

1313
00:41:09,519 --> 00:41:11,358
to expect

1314
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,439
or at least to give you something to

1315
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,318
watch out for um

1316
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,000
but yeah don't i think a lot of the you

1317
00:41:16,318 --> 00:41:20,159
know failures that we see

1318
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,599
in people going to like no-till for

1319
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:24,639
example is that they just stop

1320
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,680
tilling but they forget to use the water

1321
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:29,710
after a wheat crop with a cover crop or

1322
00:41:27,679 --> 00:41:30,879
they forget to

1323
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:34,240
[Music]

1324
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,920
do different herbicide passes or

1325
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:37,679
you know change their rotation things

1326
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,119
like that um that's where we see those

1327
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:41,118
things fail because they're taking one

1328
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:42,720
practice and not treating it as a system

1329
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:44,480
and then adjusting you know the entire

1330
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:45,838
system for it

1331
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,519
so it's not as simple as just not

1332
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,960
tilling your field and then treating

1333
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:50,880
everything the same

1334
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:52,559
yeah right right i think we would call

1335
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,760
that direct seating right where

1336
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:55,599
you know you're just doing everything

1337
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,079
the same and you just kind of plant into

1338
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:57,440
it and

1339
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:59,519
it's not a system at that point it's

1340
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,920
just a practice um

1341
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:03,280
and so yeah i think yeah anyway anyone

1342
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:04,720
making changes or doing something new

1343
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,560
they need to treat it as a system and

1344
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:09,759
figure out what they can do

1345
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:11,599
um to make that system work

1346
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,200
um especially for different soil types

1347
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,160
so yeah it sounds really complex and you

1348
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,598
hate to

1349
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:17,838
make it complex before somebody even

1350
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,039
tries it but um but it's certainly

1351
00:42:17,838 --> 00:42:23,039
you hate to see failures also

1352
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:24,800
yeah so as someone and i got you off

1353
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,759
topic this is my fault when we started

1354
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,839
talking about tilling

1355
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:30,000
um as someone makes this transition to

1356
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:31,679
sort of this soil health perspective

1357
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:34,559
you know we talked about switching from

1358
00:42:31,679 --> 00:42:36,480
a you know very conventional

1359
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:39,358
agricultural model to something that's

1360
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,760
you know looking at soil health and and

1361
00:42:39,358 --> 00:42:43,679
reduced tillage and things like that um

1362
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,880
what what do you typically see and i

1363
00:42:43,679 --> 00:42:46,318
know every situation is going to be

1364
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,880
different but what do you see in terms

1365
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:49,119
of yields

1366
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,960
is that first year sort of a little bit

1367
00:42:49,119 --> 00:42:52,880
of a transition and then over time as

1368
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,280
that soil improves do yields typically

1369
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,280
go

1370
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,319
up what does that look like

1371
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,760
uh yeah that's you're right it looks

1372
00:43:00,318 --> 00:43:03,039
different for everybody and you often

1373
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,480
hear with

1374
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,000
you know if i'm gonna go to no-till i'm

1375
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,800
gonna take a yield hit for x number of

1376
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,519
years you know

1377
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,519
and and that's just kind of the general

1378
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:12,239
idea of it and how do i prepare for that

1379
00:43:11,519 --> 00:43:14,400
and

1380
00:43:12,239 --> 00:43:15,679
and i always remind farmers to look back

1381
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:17,440
at what's their return

1382
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:19,358
their roi you know what what's their

1383
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,358
return per acre

1384
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:24,000
are they doing you know swapping a

1385
00:43:21,358 --> 00:43:26,559
tillage pass for herbicide pass or

1386
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,358
um you know what are they doing that's

1387
00:43:26,559 --> 00:43:29,279
gonna

1388
00:43:27,358 --> 00:43:30,799
change those costs and and all the way

1389
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:32,480
down to labor and

1390
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,318
maintenance of your equipment or hours

1391
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,400
on your tractor or

1392
00:43:34,318 --> 00:43:38,318
um what it costs you to have a specific

1393
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,880
person out in the field doing a specific

1394
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:41,440
job

1395
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,640
um i want them to kind of look at all

1396
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,639
those different things

1397
00:43:42,639 --> 00:43:47,199
and then decide if it's a success or not

1398
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:49,920
because oftentimes you know the

1399
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:51,039
the farmers i work with for example i

1400
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,519
mean they would love to have a 200

1401
00:43:51,039 --> 00:43:54,079
bushel

1402
00:43:51,519 --> 00:43:55,039
corn yield on their field right i mean

1403
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,920
that would be kind of

1404
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:59,119
average and and they'd be perfectly

1405
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:01,039
happy with that and some years they do

1406
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:02,079
get that sometimes they get 220 bushels

1407
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:05,519
you know

1408
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,680
um but they sometimes their their

1409
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:08,800
yield goal or what they want to achieve

1410
00:44:07,679 --> 00:44:10,399
is 190

1411
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
and if they can consistently get that

1412
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,960
based on their inputs and the way they

1413
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,039
manage that field

1414
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:16,318
for corn then they're happy because

1415
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:18,480
they're they're having reductions in

1416
00:44:16,318 --> 00:44:20,079
fertilizer inputs

1417
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,920
that are kind of feeling that out to see

1418
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,960
how much they can cut back on fertilizer

1419
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,358
editions and

1420
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:26,800
and that could be a huge cost savings so

1421
00:44:25,358 --> 00:44:28,159
so maybe they're only

1422
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,000
they only getting maybe they're only

1423
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:31,838
getting 190 bushel corn and the

1424
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,519
neighbors getting 210

1425
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:34,960
but if they're applying less fertilizer

1426
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,079
they have less passes

1427
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,079
they're using different management

1428
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,200
approaches and it might just be that

1429
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,920
they're coming out ahead

1430
00:44:39,199 --> 00:44:43,118
you know cash wise on that field that's

1431
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:46,960
a great point

1432
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:49,119
um so we've kind of covered how complex

1433
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,480
not just soil health is but also just

1434
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:53,920
farming in general

1435
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:57,760
um and a lot of this uh what are some

1436
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,440
resources out there for farmers

1437
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,560
i know you have this website can you

1438
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,760
talk a little bit about some of the

1439
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:07,039
resources that you guys offer for people

1440
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:07,520
oh absolutely i'd love to um so we have

1441
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:10,159
you know

1442
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:12,079
ndsu soil health if you search that

1443
00:45:10,159 --> 00:45:13,920
anywhere you'll you'll find our webpage

1444
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:16,880
which is ndsu.edu

1445
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,880
soil health and um you know the things

1446
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:22,640
that i focus on providing to farmers

1447
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,240
are mainly videos um because they can

1448
00:45:22,639 --> 00:45:26,400
they can check those videos out while

1449
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:26,719
they're in the tractor in the combine

1450
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,838
and

1451
00:45:26,719 --> 00:45:29,598
generally they're less than three

1452
00:45:27,838 --> 00:45:30,880
minutes so you can watch it in one pass

1453
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,720
on a on a quarter

1454
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,920
of land it takes you about you know less

1455
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:34,959
than three minutes to get across the

1456
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,680
field

1457
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,559
so they can watch videos we also have a

1458
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,039
podcast

1459
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,639
called um soil sense and also a soil

1460
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:44,719
sense field check

1461
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,239
and so we try to you know kind of

1462
00:45:44,719 --> 00:45:48,239
highlight the things that farmers are

1463
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:50,879
doing the research that's being done

1464
00:45:48,239 --> 00:45:52,318
um you know kind of different places

1465
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:54,160
that you'll find soil health

1466
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:55,440
and and those collaborations that make

1467
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:57,279
it work um

1468
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:59,119
so so we've got some episodes there and

1469
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,760
then we did like this

1470
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:03,039
field check podcast that was a 10 minute

1471
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,640
episode

1472
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:06,318
with a question and answer type format

1473
00:46:04,639 --> 00:46:09,358
so you can get a lot of information in a

1474
00:46:06,318 --> 00:46:10,880
very short period of time as well

1475
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:12,960
and then i'd love to host meetings so

1476
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:14,880
we've got a ton of meetings coming up in

1477
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,960
workshops and now with everything you

1478
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,559
know being virtual last year now going

1479
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:20,240
back to face-to-face this year

1480
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:22,000
everybody wants a hybrid event so we're

1481
00:46:20,239 --> 00:46:23,679
doing some virtual

1482
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,119
and some you know with face-to-face

1483
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:27,358
components and

1484
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:29,519
just yeah the complexity too of our

1485
00:46:27,358 --> 00:46:31,199
programming has gone way up but

1486
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:33,039
but in a good way because it's just a

1487
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:34,639
lot better access so

1488
00:46:33,039 --> 00:46:36,960
yeah all that stuff can be found on that

1489
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:38,318
ndsu slow health web page and

1490
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:41,039
you can just probably get lost in there

1491
00:46:38,318 --> 00:46:41,039
in a rabbit hole

1492
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,800
there's a there's a ton of information

1493
00:46:42,719 --> 00:46:48,000
on here it's it's quite impressive

1494
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,359
uh one question i had can anyone join

1495
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,318
these sorts of things you don't have to

1496
00:46:49,358 --> 00:46:56,880
be a farmer in north dakota to

1497
00:46:52,318 --> 00:46:58,800
utilize you know some of these more uh

1498
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,000
some of these resources that are more

1499
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,280
interactive like the

1500
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,760
events i guess for instance oh yeah we

1501
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:07,519
love

1502
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,119
having people from all over join them um

1503
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:10,318
you know a lot of it is going to be kind

1504
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:12,079
of geared towards the farmers because

1505
00:47:10,318 --> 00:47:13,838
that's our general audience but

1506
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,359
but there's so much that you can pick up

1507
00:47:13,838 --> 00:47:17,440
on

1508
00:47:15,358 --> 00:47:19,679
you know not everything would make sense

1509
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,358
sometimes like say you're not

1510
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:23,279
you know you're just getting exposed to

1511
00:47:21,358 --> 00:47:24,880
agriculture or something like that but

1512
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,880
but you can pick things up i mean when i

1513
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,318
started my job here at ndsu nine years

1514
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:31,440
ago i didn't know

1515
00:47:28,318 --> 00:47:33,440
a combine from a tractor um i had never

1516
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:35,358
really set foot on a farm

1517
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,039
and so i'm always kind of keeping that

1518
00:47:35,358 --> 00:47:38,318
in mind that there's a lot of people

1519
00:47:37,039 --> 00:47:39,759
like me that want to learn about

1520
00:47:38,318 --> 00:47:41,358
agriculture

1521
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,760
and maybe don't have the chance to but

1522
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,519
if you're listening to episodes on

1523
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,319
farmers and their stories and how

1524
00:47:45,519 --> 00:47:48,000
they're

1525
00:47:46,318 --> 00:47:49,920
working with neighbors to achieve these

1526
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,880
practices or you're learning from some

1527
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:53,519
of the researchers

1528
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,920
or the extension people you know we're

1529
00:47:53,519 --> 00:47:55,759
pretty

1530
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,880
good at trying to share these messages

1531
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,240
in different ways for different

1532
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,318
audiences so

1533
00:47:58,239 --> 00:48:01,759
um so yeah i would encourage anyone to

1534
00:48:00,318 --> 00:48:03,039
hop onto these events and

1535
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:04,800
i usually try to keep them fun and

1536
00:48:03,039 --> 00:48:06,000
entertaining because there also has to

1537
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,480
be that kind of element to

1538
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,920
it can't just be all a bunch of eggheads

1539
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:12,240
you know talking about

1540
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:14,318
soil nerd talk and whatever so we try to

1541
00:48:12,239 --> 00:48:16,159
keep them fun and entertaining and

1542
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:17,679
um and you know what if most of them are

1543
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,318
free so if you get onto the event and

1544
00:48:17,679 --> 00:48:19,759
you're like

1545
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:20,880
uh that's not what i thought it would be

1546
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,480
you can always just get off and it cost

1547
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,079
you nothing so

1548
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:26,719
so that's kind of the other good thing

1549
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:28,318
about it too is a lot of flexibility

1550
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:30,719
yeah i'm looking at some of the topics

1551
00:48:28,318 --> 00:48:31,920
here on your on your soil health page

1552
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,159
and you have one on uh

1553
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,960
you know a quick video on incorporating

1554
00:48:34,159 --> 00:48:37,118
cover crops

1555
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:38,720
building soil health grazing cover crops

1556
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,400
there's a lot of really great

1557
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:45,039
topics on here so i highly suggest

1558
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:47,039
folks check it out can you talk a little

1559
00:48:45,039 --> 00:48:48,960
bit about what extension services offer

1560
00:48:47,039 --> 00:48:50,558
for people in various states and sort of

1561
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,920
what

1562
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:56,319
what that really is for for folks

1563
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,000
yeah i sure can because i had no idea

1564
00:48:56,318 --> 00:48:58,800
what extension was until i got my job

1565
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,838
here

1566
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,440
so um so yeah i mean extension is

1567
00:49:01,838 --> 00:49:04,719
usually it's a branch of the land-grant

1568
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,800
institutions right so

1569
00:49:04,719 --> 00:49:09,039
ndsu is a land-grant institution here

1570
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:11,519
like ohio state would be for ohio

1571
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:12,639
um colorado state university for

1572
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:14,960
colorado

1573
00:49:12,639 --> 00:49:16,799
and so so there's a branch of the

1574
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:20,079
university that gets information

1575
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,960
out to farmers but also to the public

1576
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:24,720
and our job is to it's to not

1577
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,838
necessarily do the research but to use

1578
00:49:24,719 --> 00:49:28,318
our colleagues who are doing the

1579
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:30,880
research to get that information

1580
00:49:28,318 --> 00:49:32,960
pre repackaged and into a format where

1581
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,640
it can be used and so

1582
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,400
so any of those land-grant institutions

1583
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:38,639
have this extension branch

1584
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,079
and oftentimes you know extension is you

1585
00:49:38,639 --> 00:49:42,480
know there's certainly a

1586
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,160
main campus presence so there's faculty

1587
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,838
that do this kind of stuff but

1588
00:49:44,159 --> 00:49:48,399
like in north dakota we have county

1589
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:50,318
agents that are in every single county

1590
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:52,000
and so they they go out they interact

1591
00:49:50,318 --> 00:49:55,440
with farmers with

1592
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,079
gardeners with kids in 4-h

1593
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:59,358
and just general the general public and

1594
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,880
and they're providing information all

1595
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:03,039
the time too so if you

1596
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:04,880
if you live in a state where you have

1597
00:50:03,039 --> 00:50:06,960
you know county extension you can sure

1598
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,318
give them a call and you know find out

1599
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,159
what they have to offer i mean

1600
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:11,519
it could even be that you have a disease

1601
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,759
on your trees

1602
00:50:11,519 --> 00:50:15,119
and you need to know what it is or a

1603
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,800
pest or something like that and you can

1604
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:18,000
send a sample into your extension office

1605
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,519
and they can tell you what it is and how

1606
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:21,440
to manage it so

1607
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:22,800
it's really it's a really diverse

1608
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:24,318
organization because it

1609
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:25,599
it also you know there's stuff in

1610
00:50:24,318 --> 00:50:26,000
agriculture but then there's all kinds

1611
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:29,359
of stuff

1612
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:31,119
in in community as well and

1613
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:33,679
building leadership skills at the

1614
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,519
community level or

1615
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:36,960
you know food preparation even for

1616
00:50:35,519 --> 00:50:40,079
canning and how do you do that

1617
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:41,599
keep yourself safe skin cancer i mean

1618
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:43,680
there's there's all kinds of resources

1619
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:45,838
available through extension so

1620
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,440
um so i i really value this part of the

1621
00:50:45,838 --> 00:50:48,960
universities i think it's a great way

1622
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,760
for them to interact better with the

1623
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:53,280
community and with

1624
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,079
with other people and um and to just get

1625
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,440
get the information

1626
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,440
out from this you know these kind of

1627
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:58,639
ivory tower campuses it's

1628
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:01,519
we got to get this information out

1629
00:50:58,639 --> 00:51:04,400
somehow so that's what extension does

1630
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:05,280
so it's sort of that bridging the gap

1631
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:08,000
between

1632
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,800
infield farming and and then academic

1633
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:12,239
research

1634
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,000
i guess is is what i'm hearing yeah

1635
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:15,598
yeah we're kind of the you know if you

1636
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:16,559
look at the campus and the faculty on

1637
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:18,720
campus too

1638
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:19,920
we're kind of the extroverts and then

1639
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,519
you have the introverts that are the

1640
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,440
researchers so

1641
00:51:21,519 --> 00:51:25,199
so we're the ones that like to be out

1642
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:26,960
chatting and whatever about stuff

1643
00:51:25,199 --> 00:51:28,239
and getting to know people and and

1644
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,559
sharing some of that information

1645
00:51:28,239 --> 00:51:31,919
so um yeah that's definitely that's

1646
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,240
definitely how it works there's there's

1647
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,159
stuff

1648
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:36,799
you know different faculty for different

1649
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:39,039
different jobs here for sure

1650
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,720
so since this podcast is generally

1651
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:43,838
speaking to people who are growing

1652
00:51:40,719 --> 00:51:44,558
you know cannabis or hemp what sort of

1653
00:51:43,838 --> 00:51:46,480
resources

1654
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:49,599
or relationships might someone be able

1655
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:51,519
to form with a county extension

1656
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:53,039
in that regard because i realize like in

1657
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:54,480
your case you guys don't have a lot of

1658
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:56,318
hemp growers in

1659
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:58,079
in north dakota i think i think you had

1660
00:51:56,318 --> 00:51:59,279
said

1661
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,800
but where do you think you might still

1662
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,760
be able to plug in and help someone if

1663
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:05,119
they were

1664
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:06,240
if they reached out oh gosh you know

1665
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:07,119
yeah we don't have a ton of hunt

1666
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,759
production up here

1667
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:11,200
um but you know the other thing with

1668
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,319
extension with the university is that

1669
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:15,279
we're great

1670
00:52:12,318 --> 00:52:16,960
for connecting people and so you know

1671
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,960
for example if i don't know anything

1672
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,639
about hemp right and i have a farmer

1673
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:23,039
that wants to grow it

1674
00:52:20,639 --> 00:52:25,920
i know at least a consultant and then

1675
00:52:23,039 --> 00:52:28,159
also a researcher on campus that

1676
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:29,358
that works with hemp or i also know

1677
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:32,719
somebody that was

1678
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:35,279
an agronomist that was you know

1679
00:52:32,719 --> 00:52:36,639
taking on cbd you know hemp for cbd

1680
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:37,680
production which i know very little

1681
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:39,279
about but i know

1682
00:52:37,679 --> 00:52:41,199
those people and i know how to reach

1683
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,440
them and so um

1684
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,838
so oftentimes you know if the extension

1685
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:47,358
person doesn't have the answer on a

1686
00:52:44,838 --> 00:52:49,358
specific thing they can certainly find

1687
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:51,679
someone who does and that's kind of what

1688
00:52:49,358 --> 00:52:53,440
they what we specialize in is our

1689
00:52:51,679 --> 00:52:55,118
our contact list and our cell phones and

1690
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,720
who we can call to help you get the

1691
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,000
answers you need

1692
00:52:56,719 --> 00:53:02,959
and i would add that you you know soils

1693
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,519
really well and you know a variety of

1694
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,800
crops

1695
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:09,920
in different soils that might you know

1696
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:11,599
respond similar to hemp and you know

1697
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,358
i think you could also probably make a

1698
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,720
cover crop recommendation

1699
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:16,239
to at least get someone started in the

1700
00:53:14,719 --> 00:53:18,159
right direction or at least what to

1701
00:53:16,239 --> 00:53:19,519
avoid as a cover crop based on your

1702
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:20,078
experience so i think there's a lot

1703
00:53:19,519 --> 00:53:23,199
there that

1704
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,160
you may be able to offer someone

1705
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:26,318
to at least get them pointed in the

1706
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:29,519
right direction as research grows on

1707
00:53:26,318 --> 00:53:31,838
you know this relatively new crop

1708
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,280
yeah i absolutely and i think you know i

1709
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,519
love learning about new crops too and

1710
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,800
kind of problem solving so

1711
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:38,639
that's certainly an area where we can

1712
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,760
help and i mean she was just at a

1713
00:53:38,639 --> 00:53:41,519
vineyard the other day

1714
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:43,040
and they want to do cover crops between

1715
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:44,318
the vines and i was like i don't know

1716
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,279
anything about vineyards other than i

1717
00:53:44,318 --> 00:53:47,920
like to drink wine

1718
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,440
so just like you know how am i going to

1719
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:51,119
make a recommendation but i can sure

1720
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,880
listen to the issues and when

1721
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,519
they need something to flower or not

1722
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,240
flower or attract pollinators or you

1723
00:53:55,519 --> 00:53:57,599
know i mean

1724
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,439
and then we can kind of come up with

1725
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:00,640
some solutions together so i would think

1726
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,838
you know it's the same deal with hemp

1727
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,679
and what can we

1728
00:54:01,838 --> 00:54:05,199
how can we help manage even the residue

1729
00:54:03,679 --> 00:54:06,480
on hemp um

1730
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:08,159
because i understand it's pretty tough

1731
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,599
right so it's you know how are you

1732
00:54:08,159 --> 00:54:11,199
managing that and

1733
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:13,440
you know what's your rotation look like

1734
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,879
or um yeah i think there's all kinds of

1735
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,318
ways that we can help and and

1736
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,240
in general when you want to learn about

1737
00:54:16,318 --> 00:54:21,279
something or you're curious

1738
00:54:18,239 --> 00:54:25,519
uh you seem to find the answer somehow

1739
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:27,040
yeah and i think you're vineyard

1740
00:54:25,519 --> 00:54:28,880
comment was really interesting because i

1741
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,920
know when i visited some vineyards and

1742
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:33,119
got to speak to

1743
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,800
the um the people in charge of of the

1744
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:37,280
soil and the fertility

1745
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:38,160
there i learned a lot from them on how

1746
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:39,519
they manage

1747
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:42,000
grapes that's so different than other

1748
00:54:39,519 --> 00:54:43,519
crops but then also coming with an

1749
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,519
outside perspective i had all these

1750
00:54:43,519 --> 00:54:48,719
things i kind of wanted to try

1751
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:49,358
or at least look into as someone who

1752
00:54:48,719 --> 00:54:51,279
didn't come

1753
00:54:49,358 --> 00:54:52,639
you know traditionally trained in in

1754
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:54,240
viticulture which

1755
00:54:52,639 --> 00:54:56,318
you know i think it allows for sort of a

1756
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:58,798
synergy of ideas

1757
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,759
and uh and things like that too as we

1758
00:54:58,798 --> 00:55:02,798
talk about different

1759
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:04,000
different systems and different crops oh

1760
00:55:02,798 --> 00:55:05,440
absolutely that's pretty cool

1761
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,119
yeah i'm sure you brought a lot to the

1762
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:08,880
table just you know

1763
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:10,079
i i you know i don't think i did in this

1764
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:11,119
case but it definitely got my brain

1765
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,039
thinking like oh

1766
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:14,160
gee i'd love to i'd love to try this or

1767
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:16,639
experiment with this or

1768
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:18,639
you know really dive in further and

1769
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:19,358
learn and and see if there were things

1770
00:55:18,639 --> 00:55:20,639
that we could

1771
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,000
you know that we were trying in other

1772
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,838
crops that might make sense with this

1773
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,960
crop or you know vice versa

1774
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:29,199
so yeah absolutely

1775
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,639

i'm looking at your

1780
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:41,679
uh soil sense page here you know you

1781
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,480
have soil health on the farm how to dial

1782
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,960
in fertility

1783
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,798
precision of soil health stuff on

1784
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,720
dealing with salts

1785
00:55:46,798 --> 00:55:51,280
building soil and cool and wet climates

1786
00:55:48,719 --> 00:55:55,279
like just so many great topics
