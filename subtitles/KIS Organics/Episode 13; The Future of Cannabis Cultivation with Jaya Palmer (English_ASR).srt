00:00:15,038 --> 00:00:18,500
welcome to the cannabis cultivation and

3
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:21,170
science podcast

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,480
I'm your host tad hussy of kiss organics

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,190
this is the podcast where we discuss the

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,320
cutting edge of organic growing from a

7
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:29,060
science-based perspective and draw top

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,039
experts from around the industry to

9
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:32,780
share their wisdom and knowledge now

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,120
this episode is a bit different than

11
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,620
previous ones for a few reasons I was

12
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:38,030
fortunate to be able to attend the

13
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,769
conference focused on the latest

14
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,170
advancements in photo biology and

15
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,460
equipment for commercial cultivation we

16
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,469
are talking about some of the largest

17
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,509
commercial cultivators of cannabis in

18
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,039
all of North America as well as some of

19
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:51,589
the big ornamental and vegetable

20
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,238
producers I was honored to be there made

21
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,550
some great contacts and learned a ton

22
00:00:53,238 --> 00:00:58,159
even met a few people who were familiar

23
00:00:55,549 --> 00:01:00,259
with the podcast which was awesome giant

24
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,909
Palmer was also able to attend and in

25
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:03,558
this episode we discussed some of what

26
00:01:01,909 --> 00:01:05,030
we learned as well as how these topics

27
00:01:03,558 --> 00:01:07,879
relate to the future of commercial

28
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:09,590
cannabis production if you listen to the

29
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:12,078
most recent podcast then you're already

30
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,759
familiar with Jaya he is a biological

31
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:15,589
horticulture consultant with a long

32
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:17,299
history in both cannabis and vegetable

33
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:19,490
production and a proponent of

34
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:21,469
regenerative agriculture he's also a

35
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:23,298
good friend and colleague the following

36
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:25,248
is just our unedited conversation

37
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,719
discussing our notes and takeaways from

38
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,759
what we learned this past weekend

39
00:01:26,718 --> 00:01:30,589
sometimes I get caught in a rabbit hole

40
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:32,239
here in Washington State and on our farm

41
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,978
and I'm not able to stay up-to-date with

42
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,778
all the exciting new advancements and

43
00:01:33,978 --> 00:01:38,028
products and changes in the cannabis

44
00:01:35,778 --> 00:01:39,528
industry this was a great chance to get

45
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:41,388
perspective on where the industry

46
00:01:39,528 --> 00:01:43,509
appears to be headed and how that will

47
00:01:41,388 --> 00:01:45,228
affect growers in the coming years so

48
00:01:43,509 --> 00:01:47,688
let's talk a little about this

49
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:49,310
conference we attended what what did you

50
00:01:47,688 --> 00:01:51,278
think of it any initial thoughts before

51
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:53,388
we dive into some of the speakers oh

52
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:55,539
it's just great to be in a room full of

53
00:01:53,388 --> 00:01:58,519
people who are all leading the field in

54
00:01:55,539 --> 00:02:01,118
controlled environment agriculture we

55
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,738
have the you know university professors

56
00:02:01,118 --> 00:02:05,989
finance ears

57
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:09,229
master growers some equipment

58
00:02:05,989 --> 00:02:14,090
manufacturers from a from a HVAC and

59
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:16,430
lighting and high-density storage

60
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:20,409
pretty much all the people you need to

61
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:22,580
design cutting-edge facility were there

62
00:02:20,409 --> 00:02:25,789
yeah I thought it was really interesting

63
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:28,190
it gave me some ideas on sort of where I

64
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:30,439
think the future of cannabis cultivation

65
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:33,259
and production is now that I've I've got

66
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:35,509
a little more insight as to what some of

67
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:38,030
these large-scale commercial facilities

68
00:02:35,509 --> 00:02:40,009
and large-scale horticultural facilities

69
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:41,479
are doing but before we get into those

70
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:45,409
thoughts I wanted to talk a little bit

71
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:47,689
about some of the specific speakers that

72
00:02:45,409 --> 00:02:49,729
we got to hear from one of them being on

73
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:52,159
the economic impact of light intensity

74
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:56,469
on yield and secondary metabolites and

75
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:59,180
that was Alison justice without cope and

76
00:02:56,469 --> 00:03:00,859
Alison is someone that I've talked about

77
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,379
in my talks I know you'd sent me an

78
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:05,840
article on her as well their facility

79
00:03:03,378 --> 00:03:08,060
when she came in she was a she had a PhD

80
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,509
in horticulture I believe and she came

81
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,930
in and they were using heavy 16 at this

82
00:03:11,509 --> 00:03:18,199
facility in California and she was able

83
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,540
to formulate over the next seven or

84
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:23,388
eight months her own mineral salt

85
00:03:20,539 --> 00:03:25,068
regimen that dropped their cost 27 times

86
00:03:23,389 --> 00:03:27,980
by what they were spending before on

87
00:03:25,068 --> 00:03:31,039
bottled nutrients and I don't believe

88
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,629
there was a single cannabis facility in

89
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,949
the room that was using bottled

90
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,930
nutrients because it just didn't make

91
00:03:33,949 --> 00:03:36,979
practical sense at the scale that what

92
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,969
they were at I mean we're talking about

93
00:03:36,979 --> 00:03:43,608
huge huge facilities and so that's a

94
00:03:40,969 --> 00:03:46,090
little bit about Alison now the actual

95
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:50,030
study that she was doing was looking on

96
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,280
how much light intensity cannabis can

97
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,169
take so we know that cannabis is a high

98
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,318
in high light plant Nick it takes a

99
00:03:54,169 --> 00:04:01,280
pretty high level of intensity but we

100
00:03:57,318 --> 00:04:05,479
didn't know exact on plant physiology

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:08,120
and yield and overall quality so I'm

102
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:10,879
looking at my notes here and it looks

103
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,079
like they took 90 cannabis sativa

104
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,959
variety was was hazy OG an average

105
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:20,989
temperature of 23 point 7 degrees

106
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:23,478
Celsius with a variance of 1.7 degrees

107
00:04:20,988 --> 00:04:27,379
Celsius an average average relative

108
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:31,479
humidity of 50 2.5%

109
00:04:27,379 --> 00:04:36,610
and CEO to around 1500 ppm and they Rand

110
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:41,110
fluence LEDs at 400 ppfd 600 ppfd

111
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:45,710
double-ended HP s at 700 ppfd and then

112
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:48,259
more fluence LEDs at 800 and 1,200 ppfd

113
00:04:45,709 --> 00:04:49,729
which shown a daily light interval which

114
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:51,370
is the amount of light that plant gets

115
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,090
over the course of the day ranging from

116
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,350
7.3 micromoles up to 50 1.8 it looks

117
00:04:56,089 --> 00:04:59,149
like going back and looking at the data

118
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:03,620
they collected fresh weight dry weight

119
00:04:59,149 --> 00:05:07,939
and trim weight and they saw a 26%

120
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:12,680
increase in shoot fresh weight from

121
00:05:07,939 --> 00:05:15,110
going from 400 to 600 as the average

122
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,230
ppfd and then from there on up you get a

123
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,910
slight increase like from 800 to 1200

124
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:22,250
ppfd you only saw an increase of about

125
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:24,650
5% on the dry weight that corresponded

126
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,279
to about 6% between the two so not

127
00:05:24,649 --> 00:05:30,019
significant statistically significant

128
00:05:27,279 --> 00:05:32,179
according to the data on the flower and

129
00:05:30,019 --> 00:05:34,639
trim weight they saw the same thing an

130
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:35,269
increase as you increase the light

131
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,569
intensity

132
00:05:35,269 --> 00:05:42,139
you know from 400 to 1200 and from 400

133
00:05:38,569 --> 00:05:46,370
ppfd to 600 ppfd you had a 51% increase

134
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:49,189
in trimmed flower weight let's see what

135
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:51,439
else here the the interesting thing the

136
00:05:49,189 --> 00:05:54,350
total THC inactive total active

137
00:05:51,439 --> 00:05:56,990
cannabinoids stayed exactly the same

138
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:59,510
with the exception of that 700 average

139
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,750
ppfd which was that Dublin at HPS light

140
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:05,149
had lower total THC and active

141
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,949
cannabinoids but then the total terpene

142
00:06:05,149 --> 00:06:09,319
concentrations were the same across the

143
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:12,800
board regardless of the light intensity

144
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,629
including that double ended HBS mm-hmm

145
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,889
does it's interesting that terpene

146
00:06:14,629 --> 00:06:18,560
concentration will stay the same

147
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:23,659
regardless of light technology or light

148
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:26,089
intensity but if we go from HP s to LED

149
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:30,500
then we see an increase in cannabinoid

150
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:36,619
percentage from 19% cannabinoids with

151
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:38,870
HBS to around 21 or 21.5 with LED light

152
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,569
yeah and then I know the next slide that

153
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,088
she showed

154
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:46,139
was one of your favorites from the whole

155
00:06:42,088 --> 00:06:48,689
conference looking at the grams per watt

156
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,788
and grams per square foot which gave us

157
00:06:48,689 --> 00:06:52,949
the amount of money generated per light

158
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:55,740
and then the amount of money generated

159
00:06:52,949 --> 00:06:58,619
minus your power consumption this is

160
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:03,538
where the LEDs really shined it looks

161
00:06:58,619 --> 00:07:04,259
like at 1200 ppfd you were at 1.2 grams

162
00:07:03,538 --> 00:07:07,978
per watt

163
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:12,119
but 72 grams per square foot mm-hmm

164
00:07:07,978 --> 00:07:16,438
now the most efficient light was the 400

165
00:07:12,119 --> 00:07:18,509
ppfd LED light at 1.7 grams per watt but

166
00:07:16,439 --> 00:07:21,449
then we're only getting 34 point 2 grams

167
00:07:18,509 --> 00:07:23,729
per square foot and a square foot is

168
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:26,819
just such an important aspect when we're

169
00:07:23,728 --> 00:07:29,218
talking about commercial production so

170
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:31,889
getting in that extra cost even though

171
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:33,088
your grams per watt drops seems to make

172
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:35,158
it well worth it going with the more

173
00:07:33,088 --> 00:07:40,019
powerful light yeah and according to

174
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:42,360
them the the grams per watt change they

175
00:07:40,019 --> 00:07:47,009
considered it statistically significant

176
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:50,879
but as we go from 400 ppfd to 600 ppfd

177
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:52,740
to 800 ppfd with LEDs the grams per watt

178
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,490
go from one point seven to one point

179
00:07:52,740 --> 00:08:00,180
five to one point six so the grams per

180
00:07:56,490 --> 00:08:03,050
watt doesn't change that much so if it's

181
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:07,139
statistically significant but still the

182
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:09,028
changes are really small so I feel like

183
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:11,658
the sweet spot according to this data

184
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:14,968
set the sweet spot seems to be 800 ppfd

185
00:08:11,658 --> 00:08:18,658
to achieve 66 grams per square foot

186
00:08:14,968 --> 00:08:22,348
because if we have the ppfd from 800 to

187
00:08:18,658 --> 00:08:25,019
400 we almost exactly have the grams per

188
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:27,389
square foot so very similar efficiency

189
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:31,288
they entered pbft seems to be the sweet

190
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:34,379
spot going up to 1200 ppfd the

191
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:37,740
efficiency goes down from 1.6 grams per

192
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:41,088
watt to 1.2 grams per watt so it's a

193
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,918
pretty big drop in efficiency but the

194
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:46,350
the grams per square foot goes from 66

195
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:50,399
to 72 yeah you're getting an extra point

196
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:52,670
2 pounds of cannabis by increasing that

197
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,340
you know at an extra 400 ppm

198
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:57,289
which in the case of cannabis being such

199
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:01,940
a high-yield crop that seems well worth

200
00:08:57,289 --> 00:09:06,370
it in this case their income minus the

201
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:10,340
cost of power shows that running at this

202
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:13,190
exceptionally high ppfd of 1200 is more

203
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:15,920
profitable if the pound price is based

204
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:18,050
off of 2000 if we change that pound

205
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:20,479
price to 1600 which might be a little

206
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:22,370
bit more reasonable then we might not

207
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,769
see a benefit from going up to these

208
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:28,129
higher light intensities and it would

209
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:29,990
you know it feels best to run the

210
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:32,779
lighting at an intensity which will give

211
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:36,500
us a higher efficiency so I'd still like

212
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:39,259
800 or maybe 1000 ppfd is our target but

213
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,860
this is definitely based off of one

214
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:45,019
strain this hazy og and we're gonna see

215
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:47,120
cultivars react very differently to

216
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:48,230
light intensity yeah that's a really

217
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,879
good point this is just a really

218
00:09:48,230 --> 00:09:51,529
preliminary study it hasn't been peer

219
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:52,879
reviewed or replicated there needs to be

220
00:09:51,529 --> 00:09:54,529
a lot more research but it is

221
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:56,809
interesting that people are starting to

222
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:59,000
look at this sort of thing and if we go

223
00:09:56,809 --> 00:10:02,269
to the next slide which looks at cost

224
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,779
recovery when we talk about LED versus

225
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:10,009
HPS and they compared that 700 ppfd

226
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:12,350
double in at HPS at $400 for that

227
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:15,950
fixture versus say the fluence fixture

228
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:19,940
at 800 ppfd which is going to cost you

229
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:23,090
almost $1,300 to outfit a room it's a

230
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:25,610
difference of 46 thousand dollars per

231
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:28,700
room for that fluence light verses 14

232
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:32,060
and a half thousand for that HPS light

233
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:36,170
now when it comes down to your power

234
00:10:32,059 --> 00:10:38,689
usage per room at 21 cents a watt you're

235
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:41,569
looking at thirty five hundred dollars

236
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:44,420
to run that fluence light versus fifty

237
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:46,790
three hundred to run that HPS light so

238
00:10:44,419 --> 00:10:49,069
your power plus fixture they have the

239
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:52,639
calculations here you're going to end up

240
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:54,790
over time saving money by reducing

241
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:57,289
you're reducing your energy consumption

242
00:10:54,789 --> 00:10:58,639
but it is an initial investment that's

243
00:10:57,289 --> 00:11:00,379
gonna be a lot higher than if you stuck

244
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:02,000
with that double-ended HPS did you have

245
00:11:00,379 --> 00:11:03,559
any thoughts on that yeah whether

246
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,350
whether you're running the lights

247
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:10,459
running LED lighting at 800

248
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:15,200
ppfd or 1200 ppfd versus the average of

249
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:18,080
700 ppfd with DHBs it's gonna be a wash

250
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:20,840
in the first crop whether you know the

251
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:22,400
profitability of using LEDs versus HP s

252
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:24,920
it's gonna be a wash on that first crop

253
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:27,139
but in subsequent harvests we're looking

254
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:29,689
at this twenty-five to thirty eight

255
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:33,080
thousand dollar increase looking at this

256
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:36,590
if we're looking at the same chart so

257
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:39,530
that's going to be cumulative over you

258
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:42,200
know five to six turns per year the LEDs

259
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,539
get much more profitable to run whether

260
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:47,660
we decide the twelve hundred ppfd is

261
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:49,730
worth it or not just slightly increasing

262
00:11:47,659 --> 00:11:54,159
the light intensity and ppfd with the

263
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:57,620
LEDs is um I can't come up a number

264
00:11:54,159 --> 00:11:59,959
right now but it's looking like ten

265
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,090
percent ten percent more profitable to

266
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,340
use LED that sounds about right

267
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,350
now the other thing I found interesting

268
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:09,139
about this is with the LEDs if you're

269
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:13,009
not using organic methods if you're

270
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:15,409
going with this multi-tiered LED and

271
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,519
hydroponic setup you can double stack

272
00:12:15,409 --> 00:12:19,279
the lights which allows you to

273
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:21,289
effectively double the amount of square

274
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,720
footage in a given room if the facility

275
00:12:21,289 --> 00:12:25,549
has a decent height because the LEDs

276
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,230
don't run don't generate the same level

277
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:28,969
of heat that you're getting with the

278
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:30,800
double-ended HPS that have to be as far

279
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:31,790
away from the canopy ya be I mean

280
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:32,899
they're definitely they're definitely

281
00:12:31,789 --> 00:12:35,629
more efficient in the difference they

282
00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:38,090
create less heat and they also don't cat

283
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:40,909
the heat they generate isn't being

284
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:44,149
projected out from the light you know de

285
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:47,240
HPS are gonna project that that heat

286
00:12:44,149 --> 00:12:50,419
that infrared from the light onto the

287
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:53,149
canopy when the majority of the heat

288
00:12:50,419 --> 00:12:56,959
from the LED is coming off the heat sink

289
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:59,449
on top of the fixture itself so double

290
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:01,670
stacking you know LEDs really make

291
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:04,100
double stacking possible in the in you

292
00:13:01,669 --> 00:13:07,189
know racking is expensive LEDs aren't so

293
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,170
cheap either but regardless of your cost

294
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:11,570
of real estate just building out a

295
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:13,669
facility with the proper HVAC and air

296
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:16,190
movement double stacking just makes

297
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:19,669
sense it definitely shows a return

298
00:13:16,190 --> 00:13:20,060
within a year okay the green organic

299
00:13:19,669 --> 00:13:22,969
Dutch

300
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:24,469
that was David Bernard Peron oh man I'm

301
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:27,500
butchering his name he's a good buddy of

302
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:29,120
mine David Bernard Peron and his talk

303
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,820
was on the future of organic cannabis

304
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,139
production at a commercial scale

305
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:35,629
do you want to highlight a little bit

306
00:13:33,139 --> 00:13:38,269
that we learned from that talk so thanks

307
00:13:35,629 --> 00:13:41,629
to David it looks like the green organic

308
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:44,360
Dutchman has chosen to go with 100%

309
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:46,669
organic program because David's coming

310
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:49,460
from Whistler medical marijuana company

311
00:13:46,669 --> 00:13:52,309
which is the first certified organic

312
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:56,060
cannabis farm in the world and I think

313
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:58,729
that I'm pretty sure that bringing David

314
00:13:56,059 --> 00:14:01,099
on with his his experience and skill set

315
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,159
gave them the confidence to commit to

316
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:05,779
doing a hundred percent organic facility

317
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:08,509
what's really interesting about this

318
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:13,669
place is they're doing a or they're

319
00:14:08,509 --> 00:14:14,389
creating a planting density and a how do

320
00:14:13,669 --> 00:14:16,759
I say this

321
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:19,220
they're they're creating the most

322
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:22,370
technologically advanced organic

323
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:25,850
production facility that I know of and

324
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:28,490
they're using concepts that draw from

325
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:30,290
draw from synthetic nutrients draw to

326
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,509
draw from conventional agriculture in

327
00:14:30,289 --> 00:14:35,719
that they look at sold mineralization

328
00:14:32,509 --> 00:14:37,970
and look at mineral mineral balance and

329
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:40,639
mineral ratios but they're also

330
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:43,220
committed to using all organic approved

331
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:46,039
inputs so it's a really biologically

332
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:48,440
driven farm and they're looking at how

333
00:14:46,039 --> 00:14:50,469
they can make this most efficient using

334
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:55,370
technology whether they're looking at

335
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:57,759
mineral anneli to analysis or looking at

336
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,909
how they can automate the processes of

337
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:03,409
transplanting our irrigation fertigation

338
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:05,269
recycling and runoff water they're

339
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:08,089
really taking I think what's interesting

340
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:13,460
about what a lot of people we like are

341
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:16,250
into is this merging of soil chemistry

342
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:19,600
and soil biology or bio intensive

343
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:23,179
farming and so to take that to scale

344
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:26,300
they know that they will periodically

345
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:29,419
have run off and that runoff is going to

346
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:33,309
be captured and aerated and tested and

347
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:34,990
amended and added back into the system

348
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:36,969
so not only no they're not wasting water

349
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,470
or wasting nutrients they're conserving

350
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:41,319
all those are keeping those all within

351
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,170
the within the facility but they're

352
00:15:41,318 --> 00:15:46,479
using all the technology available to do

353
00:15:44,169 --> 00:15:50,620
it as efficiently as intelligently as

354
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:53,528
possible to maintain these these narrow

355
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:56,139
ratios that we've developed and in soil

356
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:58,448
minerals yeah so this it's this merging

357
00:15:56,139 --> 00:16:01,509
of technology that's really interesting

358
00:15:58,448 --> 00:16:04,088
and this idea of using living soils in

359
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:07,329
controlled horticultural environments

360
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:10,139
and I I love what they're doing it's

361
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:12,729
really a proof of concept based off of

362
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:15,459
Whistler Medical Marijuana Corporation

363
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:18,249
where where David was one of the head

364
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:20,528
growers there just to throw some numbers

365
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:22,509
at listeners I pulled this off of the

366
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:23,919
green organic Dutchman website they're

367
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:26,409
looking at a hundred and fifty thousand

368
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:27,849
square feet they've raised over forty

369
00:16:26,409 --> 00:16:30,509
one and a half million dollars for this

370
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:32,769
project it's over a hundred acres and

371
00:16:30,509 --> 00:16:36,339
they're looking to have the capacity to

372
00:16:32,769 --> 00:16:38,470
produce fourteen thousand kilograms

373
00:16:36,339 --> 00:16:40,120
I believe that's annually it's just it's

374
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:42,278
crazy what these numbers are it's

375
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:44,889
staggering and these guys are shaping up

376
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:46,028
to be the largest organic cannabis

377
00:16:44,889 --> 00:16:49,539
producer in the world

378
00:16:46,028 --> 00:16:51,188
and I I feel pretty confident they're

379
00:16:49,539 --> 00:16:52,990
gonna achieve that well we need them to

380
00:16:51,188 --> 00:16:56,349
be successful because one of the other

381
00:16:52,990 --> 00:17:00,188
speakers they're moving on

382
00:16:56,350 --> 00:17:01,720
Cronos is got an even larger facility

383
00:17:00,188 --> 00:17:03,308
and I believe they had a I think they

384
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,730
said it was a 200 million dollar

385
00:17:03,308 --> 00:17:09,189
investment and they were they're really

386
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:11,649
taking over this space up in Canada it's

387
00:17:09,189 --> 00:17:15,189
pretty amazing i listening to them speak

388
00:17:11,648 --> 00:17:18,009
just hearing the just how intelligent

389
00:17:15,189 --> 00:17:20,649
they were and how business focus they

390
00:17:18,009 --> 00:17:22,990
were was really interesting and scary

391
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:24,009
kind of all at the same time there they

392
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,649
were talking about how they've actually

393
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:29,349
figured out how to on the pharmaceutical

394
00:17:26,648 --> 00:17:31,359
level export the cannabis that they're

395
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:33,519
going to Germany so that's opened up a

396
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:36,418
whole nother market to them they were

397
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:38,829
sitting on stage with some PhDs and

398
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:41,710
people with really really smart guys

399
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:43,329
with really strong horticultural

400
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:47,230
backgrounds and looking at everything as

401
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:49,960
automation so for them it's all about

402
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:52,120
lean manufacturing and operational

403
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,150
optimization they're not interested in

404
00:17:52,119 --> 00:17:58,239
being organic but rather pharmaceutical

405
00:17:55,150 --> 00:18:00,580
grade everything's gonna be sterile it

406
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,109
sounds like and they're looking at is

407
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,869
how do we reduce the number of touches

408
00:18:02,109 --> 00:18:06,719
on each plant it really it becomes a

409
00:18:04,869 --> 00:18:08,769
unit of measurement it's not really this

410
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,380
it's really not so much about the plant

411
00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:12,519
at this point it's really about just it

412
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,350
sounds like making a ton of money

413
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:16,900
there's really what they're looking to

414
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:18,879
do so you know I'm pulling for David and

415
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,669
hoping that these guys can produce a

416
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:24,460
model that shows that organics can

417
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:27,549
compete on the same level as hydroponics

418
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,110
in production on scale so we will just

419
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:31,179
have to wait and see how that all pans

420
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:34,269
out yeah that's that's what's exciting

421
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:38,259
to me the the level of automation and

422
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:39,910
the budget they have to do this at scale

423
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:43,558
with with the green organic dutchman

424
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:47,230
it's it's hard to wrap your mind around

425
00:18:43,558 --> 00:18:49,629
but what's exciting to me is that the

426
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:54,669
green organic Dutchman's system is based

427
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:57,630
on an organic reusable substrate when if

428
00:18:54,669 --> 00:19:00,850
you're a strictly bottom-line mentality

429
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:02,590
you're not concerned with whether or not

430
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:04,779
you discard the substrate all the

431
00:19:02,589 --> 00:19:06,668
matters is what does it cost to discard

432
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:10,058
the substrate and how much money is that

433
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:12,970
does that make us and if you live your

434
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:15,910
life or if you run your business just by

435
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:17,710
the numbers that of course works we have

436
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:19,720
plenty of examples of that and in

437
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:22,029
commerce it's the majority of examples

438
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,610
we have in commerce but that's not a

439
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:26,740
solution like we're trying to find an

440
00:19:24,609 --> 00:19:30,789
agricultural paradigm which is truly

441
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:35,380
sustainable and seeing perceiving

442
00:19:30,789 --> 00:19:37,178
substrate as disposable to me is it's

443
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:40,150
ridiculous and I consider it

444
00:19:37,179 --> 00:19:42,370
unintelligent it's easier just to throw

445
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:44,200
stuff away and then bring in a new

446
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:46,418
substrate and treat it how you want

447
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:49,000
knowing that it'll be discarded to

448
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:51,370
actually develop a program we are

449
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,058
mindful enough of the mineralization and

450
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:56,548
your pesticide program your IPM program

451
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:59,889
such that you can reuse the soil

452
00:19:56,548 --> 00:20:01,058
indefinitely that makes sense whether

453
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,190
you're using Coco koi or

454
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:06,970
peat moss it doesn't matter because this

455
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:08,440
is a single one-time purchase and the

456
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:12,730
green organic Dutchman intends to do

457
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:15,429
this at scale and use automation to

458
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:18,009
compete with these guys who have even

459
00:20:15,429 --> 00:20:22,149
more money and even more scale that

460
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:25,480
don't really care about the ecological

461
00:20:22,148 --> 00:20:28,329
impact or the carbon footprint or the

462
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:31,649
impact on species that this sort of

463
00:20:28,329 --> 00:20:35,558
extractive approach to agriculture has

464
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:37,839
for 40 god they're gonna Organa Dutchman

465
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:40,418
to take this on there they're using

466
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:42,308
they're using Dutch tables which are

467
00:20:40,419 --> 00:20:44,110
like rolling benches which typically

468
00:20:42,308 --> 00:20:47,470
roll side to side which is really space

469
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:51,538
efficient Dutch tables roll side to side

470
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:56,379
and front to back so you can take this

471
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:58,269
4x4 area which has plants in it in a bed

472
00:20:56,378 --> 00:21:01,658
and move it to wherever you want in the

473
00:20:58,269 --> 00:21:03,819
facility automatically so you can rotate

474
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:06,730
your crop through do perpetual

475
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:09,398
harvesting do efficient harvesting or

476
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:12,669
efficient training or pruning because

477
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:15,158
the machinery can move the plants that

478
00:21:12,669 --> 00:21:17,649
need to be worked on towards the head

479
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:20,080
house or towards the the centralized

480
00:21:17,648 --> 00:21:22,808
area where the most most hands-on work

481
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:25,928
has to happen so to do that with an

482
00:21:22,808 --> 00:21:28,359
irrigation system and with an organic

483
00:21:25,929 --> 00:21:30,879
IPM program is much more difficult than

484
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:34,778
with a synthetic program it's gonna be

485
00:21:30,878 --> 00:21:36,459
there they really are innovating hard in

486
00:21:34,778 --> 00:21:37,929
a lot of aspects but I think they're up

487
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,190
to it yeah they even said that some of

488
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,139
the technology that they're going to

489
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,940
need to be successful too isn't even it

490
00:21:41,138 --> 00:21:44,378
doesn't exist yet they're gonna have to

491
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:46,269
create some of it especially around

492
00:21:44,378 --> 00:21:48,038
harvesting it's pretty staggering when

493
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:50,769
you think about the numbers that these

494
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:53,048
guys are dealing with and in terms of

495
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:56,638
their harvests it kind of sounds like it

496
00:21:53,048 --> 00:22:00,220
sounds like a what do you call that a

497
00:21:56,638 --> 00:22:02,019
investor meeting with Elon Musk he's

498
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,909
like we don't we don't know how we're

499
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:07,089
gonna do it but we're gonna do it and

500
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:08,889
it's gonna be done in 12 months I did

501
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:11,089
kind of feel like I was at a TED talk

502
00:22:08,888 --> 00:22:13,879
for most of the weekend it was great

503
00:22:11,089 --> 00:22:15,980
now I will play a devil's advocate a

504
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,710
little bit here one thing that I am

505
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:21,950
encouraged by with people like Alice and

506
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,200
justice over at out Co and with Chronos

507
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,230
is they're not going to be excessively

508
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,819
applying phosphates and well and

509
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:31,220
nitrates and other and other mineral

510
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:34,119
salts it's just not cost-efficient so

511
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:36,279
what we'll see is less contamination

512
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:38,359
environmental contamination of

513
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:41,420
specifically phosphates in the cannabis

514
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:43,399
industry which is awesome like I was

515
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:45,710
talking with Allison about this you know

516
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:47,750
that evening and she was saying that

517
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:51,440
their their runoff is in terms of the

518
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:53,779
nutrient levels is minimal which is

519
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,490
awesome like if you're gonna be a you

520
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:57,680
know and can grow or if you're gonna

521
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:59,690
grow with mineral salts let's at least

522
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,460
do it responsibly so that's one good

523
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:04,190
thing I think coming out of all of this

524
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:06,920
as we move to scale and efficiency

525
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,220
mm-hmm if there's an excess amount of

526
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:12,890
mineral salts or there's an excess

527
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:14,390
amount of nutrients that are come out of

528
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:17,480
organic bed it doesn't matter what your

529
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:20,750
approach is if you have a runoff if you

530
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:23,450
have a waste stream it's it's a waste

531
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:25,250
stream made out of nutrients and water

532
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,319
which is what we're trying to apply to

533
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:30,529
the plants so whether you're a synthetic

534
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:33,439
row or organic grower you should capture

535
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:36,049
this runoff test this runoff amend it

536
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:38,559
appropriately and fertig ate it back

537
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:41,659
into the plants and it's just funny that

538
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:43,909
these synthetic farmers assume there is

539
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:46,880
a waste stream and so once there's

540
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:49,850
runoff they consider that waste but the

541
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:51,200
organic minded people see that runoff as

542
00:23:49,849 --> 00:23:54,259
a resource

543
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,350
yeah well said so moving along here and

544
00:23:54,259 --> 00:24:00,680
not to be outdone the next speaker was

545
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:02,929
village farm and I hadn't heard of them

546
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:07,160
but they are one of the largest

547
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:08,360
greenhouse production companies in all

548
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,509
of North America

549
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:15,679
they have greenhouses in the United

550
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:18,289
States in Canada in Mexico and their

551
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:20,460
offices are in Florida they have over

552
00:24:18,289 --> 00:24:23,069
200 acres of greenhouse

553
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:25,200
EPIK I remember he put he put this slide

554
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:27,179
up and we're talking about beautiful

555
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,450
glass environmentally controlled

556
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:32,880
greenhouses they're incredible and they

557
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:34,440
are looking to do 25 acres of that in

558
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,900
cannabis as their sort of their first

559
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,240
step into the Canadian market they

560
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,150
decide on Canada based on all the you

561
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,549
know politics and restrictions and laws

562
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:46,980
currently going on between you know

563
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,599
within North America looking at the

564
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,390
United States versus Canada they decided

565
00:24:48,599 --> 00:24:54,240
on Canada so that's three huge players

566
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:56,700
all in the same room throwing massive

567
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,740
amounts of cannabis what do you think

568
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,740
the effect of these sorts of farms are

569
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:03,539
going to be on smaller growing

570
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,970
operations I mean that was my very first

571
00:25:03,539 --> 00:25:08,940
concern I was like oh man I am so glad

572
00:25:05,970 --> 00:25:11,430
I'm not trying to run a legal facility

573
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,350
up in Canada right now I mean how would

574
00:25:11,430 --> 00:25:16,500
you even compete with these these other

575
00:25:13,349 --> 00:25:19,669
guys in Canada you really I don't know

576
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:23,369
if you can compete as a small-scale

577
00:25:19,670 --> 00:25:26,789
cultivator or a distributor or processor

578
00:25:23,369 --> 00:25:29,189
it's just it's so I want to say it's

579
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:31,769
it's so WTO you know it's so big

580
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:35,850
everything's at scale the economy of

581
00:25:31,769 --> 00:25:39,629
scale of these producers experience it

582
00:25:35,849 --> 00:25:41,939
just weeds out the small farms so but

583
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:45,690
we're in the US and so the question is

584
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:49,470
how are these mega Canadian producers

585
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:51,480
going to affect us rec producers and I

586
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:53,220
can tell you in Oregon there's already

587
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:56,130
been the first major acquisition of

588
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:58,079
chalice farms earlier this year I think

589
00:25:56,130 --> 00:26:01,380
for ten million dollars and they were

590
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:04,529
required by a Canadian company so the

591
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:07,380
influence of Canadian scaled producers

592
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:09,629
aren't going to influence US producers

593
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:11,100
because they're just not here producing

594
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:13,560
but they are going to be the way they're

595
00:26:11,099 --> 00:26:17,909
going to influence the market in the US

596
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:20,159
is through acquisitions so it's I guess

597
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,140
there's something to be mindful of that

598
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:24,660
eventually it's going to get very big

599
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,430
and consolidated just like most aspects

600
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:28,890
just like pretty much every other sector

601
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:32,610
of Agriculture it's something to make a

602
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:34,230
plan for like how do we how do you

603
00:26:32,609 --> 00:26:36,808
producers find

604
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:39,599
neish which makes it so they don't have

605
00:26:36,808 --> 00:26:42,149
to scale to these unbelievable these

606
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:43,980
unbelievable sizes just to compete

607
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:46,830
because these guys like you know this

608
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:49,319
tomato guy what's his name village farms

609
00:26:46,829 --> 00:26:51,480
Paul Selena was that he was the VP of

610
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:53,279
applied research yeah

611
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,429
so Paul Selena from village farmers

612
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:59,789
they're gonna convert a 25-acre glass

613
00:26:56,429 --> 00:27:02,280
house to cannabis which seems like it

614
00:26:59,789 --> 00:27:05,039
could be disruptive because he has the

615
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,740
infrastructure already built he has

616
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:10,048
experience with the scale but he's grown

617
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:12,539
tomatoes and tomatoes aren't easy like I

618
00:27:10,048 --> 00:27:15,929
it's not that cannabis is so much harder

619
00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:19,349
than Tomatoes but I think that a lot of

620
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:22,410
these people assume that cannabis is

621
00:27:19,349 --> 00:27:25,349
just another crop like tomatoes or

622
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:27,298
cucumbers or peppers but the way the

623
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:28,230
cannabis has been bred over the

624
00:27:27,298 --> 00:27:30,058
generations

625
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:33,029
it hasn't been bred for disease

626
00:27:30,058 --> 00:27:35,129
resistance or pest resistance or fungal

627
00:27:33,029 --> 00:27:37,798
pathogen resistance it's been bred for

628
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:42,179
yield and potency and so we have these

629
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:44,298
tender cultivars that when we pack them

630
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:47,190
into this massive facility where you

631
00:27:44,298 --> 00:27:49,889
really it's not feasible to have someone

632
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:53,450
scouting and pulling open each bud

633
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:56,580
looking for Politis these huge scale

634
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:58,950
facilities are gonna see enormous crop

635
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,079
loss and you know they're gonna be doing

636
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:03,029
everything highly automated highly

637
00:28:01,079 --> 00:28:06,058
mechanized when it comes to harvesting d

638
00:28:03,029 --> 00:28:09,899
leafing trimming so we're just gonna see

639
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:12,990
a lower quality of product so the real

640
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,710
question is how much better is craft

641
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:18,509
cannabis than industrial cannabis and

642
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,789
will the market support that you know

643
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:23,039
the way I took it was we're kind of

644
00:28:20,789 --> 00:28:25,230
moving in a few direction so cannabis is

645
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,629
going to be cultivated in a very limited

646
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:29,910
amount of ways moving forward we're

647
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,700
gonna have these huge suppliers doing

648
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:36,750
hydroponics and multi-tiered most likely

649
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,740
multi-tiered LED setups indoors or using

650
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:40,500
greenhouses

651
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:42,359
we'll have organic people cultivating

652
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,369
like what we're seeing with David

653
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:47,308
hopefully that'll be the other way and

654
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,028
then we'll have outdoor people like

655
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,528
Eddie

656
00:28:48,028 --> 00:28:53,788
down at phantom farms that'll be

657
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:55,259
cultivating large-scale giant trees you

658
00:28:53,788 --> 00:28:57,388
know like an outdoor crop essentially

659
00:28:55,259 --> 00:28:59,249
like a farmer would and then lastly

660
00:28:57,388 --> 00:29:01,738
we'll have you know probably that black

661
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:03,858
market home grower and that'll really be

662
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:06,509
it I'm not sure that these craft guys

663
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:08,968
will be able to survive unless the

664
00:29:06,509 --> 00:29:11,489
market demands it unless we get enough

665
00:29:08,969 --> 00:29:13,080
public outcry that says that we really

666
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:14,940
want to preserve these genetics we want

667
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:17,098
to preserve these jobs and we'll buy

668
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:19,859
based on a brand you know like I know

669
00:29:17,098 --> 00:29:21,858
that I like gold leaf gardens flower

670
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:25,378
because of the way it's grown and

671
00:29:21,858 --> 00:29:27,058
they've created this reputation in the

672
00:29:25,378 --> 00:29:29,218
industry but beyond that I think it's

673
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:30,868
gonna be really really tough I think the

674
00:29:29,219 --> 00:29:33,450
price of cannabis is gonna drop

675
00:29:30,868 --> 00:29:34,678
dramatically so we'll have it'll just be

676
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:36,179
like when you walk in the grocery store

677
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,669
you go to Costco you can get you know

678
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,909
bananas for like $2 it's it's insane how

679
00:29:38,669 --> 00:29:43,649
cheap things are so I don't know what

680
00:29:41,909 --> 00:29:45,419
your thoughts are on that but that's

681
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,819
kind of the way that's was my take away

682
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:50,429
from this this conference that's

683
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:54,718
probably the most important thing to be

684
00:29:50,429 --> 00:29:57,839
mindful of for producers is that margins

685
00:29:54,719 --> 00:29:59,399
are gonna steadily shrink there is I

686
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:01,440
heard mentioned in numerous times that

687
00:29:59,398 --> 00:30:04,858
margins like profit margins are

688
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:08,969
typically 1 to 5% and profit margins

689
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:11,028
farm to farm in cannabis vary so much

690
00:30:08,969 --> 00:30:14,330
because we're all learning how to

691
00:30:11,028 --> 00:30:18,569
balance nutrients and provide the

692
00:30:14,329 --> 00:30:20,218
appropriate biology to use automation or

693
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:22,558
use mechanical equipment to do

694
00:30:20,219 --> 00:30:25,558
processing the profit margin is what's

695
00:30:22,558 --> 00:30:26,908
really important producers have to keep

696
00:30:25,558 --> 00:30:30,358
their profit margins as tight as

697
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:31,799
possible but my concern is that it's

698
00:30:30,358 --> 00:30:35,278
going to lower quality and it's gonna

699
00:30:31,798 --> 00:30:35,819
not any quality I don't just mean how it

700
00:30:35,278 --> 00:30:38,669
looks

701
00:30:35,819 --> 00:30:40,979
I mean how it tastes and how the actual

702
00:30:38,669 --> 00:30:43,409
cannabinoid profile when there's more

703
00:30:40,979 --> 00:30:45,298
attention to detail we get a better

704
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:48,210
cannabinoid profile it's just like your

705
00:30:45,298 --> 00:30:49,558
attention to a garden as it a garden you

706
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,139
know a hundred square feet of tomatoes

707
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:54,118
versus a hundred thousand square feet of

708
00:30:52,138 --> 00:30:57,388
tomatoes you're just gonna grow more

709
00:30:54,118 --> 00:31:00,898
tasty tomatoes in your garden and the

710
00:30:57,388 --> 00:31:01,819
reason the taste is so important there's

711
00:31:00,898 --> 00:31:03,439
um I wish I could

712
00:31:01,819 --> 00:31:07,099
hide it but there's research showing

713
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:10,340
that tomato breeding done with open

714
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:11,899
pollination has bred these tomatoes that

715
00:31:10,339 --> 00:31:14,750
are the best-tasting and that's why

716
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:17,840
that's why I'm it's a drove the breeding

717
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:20,839
was taste but then we got the technology

718
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:23,389
to put these tomatoes into whatever

719
00:31:20,839 --> 00:31:26,809
machine to analyze their nutrient

720
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:29,450
content we found that by breeding by

721
00:31:26,809 --> 00:31:31,819
taste we bred the most nutritious

722
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,490
tomatoes we bred the most medicinal

723
00:31:31,819 --> 00:31:36,109
tomatoes so that's that's what's

724
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:40,160
important to me about cannabis is that

725
00:31:36,109 --> 00:31:42,740
we maximize or optimize the cannabinoid

726
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:45,110
interpretive profile because that is why

727
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:47,000
we use it that's why we embrace it

728
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:50,689
because it is medicinal or it is

729
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:55,430
psychotropic there are I've seen some

730
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:58,390
small tomato startups that are like 2 to

731
00:31:55,430 --> 00:32:01,279
10 acres or maybe 5 to 20 acres

732
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:03,950
typically under plastic under glass but

733
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,799
these are scales that are affordable to

734
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:09,080
you know to I don't know how you say it

735
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,569
like normal people and that if you

736
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:13,579
produce a tomato that just tastes better

737
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:15,409
than everyone else's tomato you can

738
00:32:13,579 --> 00:32:17,720
create a market niche you can sell

739
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:19,490
directly to restaurants or you can have

740
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,559
a presence in the farmer's markets and

741
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:23,150
people will seek you out you'll develop

742
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:25,250
a name for yourself just because your

743
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:27,440
Tomatoes taste better than any other

744
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:29,690
tomato you've come across and that's

745
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,490
what craft cannabis is right now it's

746
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:37,400
it's people who it's people who do

747
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:39,980
business and run their farm the way they

748
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:42,140
do because they love it because they

749
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:44,299
have a passion for it and that really

750
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:48,200
shows in the product I hope you're right

751
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:50,000
I really really do I I would hate to see

752
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:52,640
a lot of these smaller companies go away

753
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,839
that are doing really good work simply

754
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:59,540
because the cost to stay technologically

755
00:32:55,839 --> 00:33:02,589
competitive becomes too high agreed and

756
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:05,389
you know worst case scenario is that

757
00:33:02,589 --> 00:33:09,199
cannabis producers are forced to produce

758
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:13,340
at a very narrow margin and the upside

759
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,710
of that is that the most economical way

760
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:18,168
to grow is the most eco

761
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:20,538
logical way to grow so if we find

762
00:33:18,169 --> 00:33:21,470
ourselves in a commodity cannabis

763
00:33:20,538 --> 00:33:25,460
economy

764
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:27,890
we'll find full season outdoor becoming

765
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:31,370
the most relevant and for those growers

766
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:34,278
to enjoy an economy of scale they simply

767
00:33:31,369 --> 00:33:36,619
have to create a co-op or create a

768
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:38,898
distribution entity where they can pool

769
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:41,928
their product and sell it in large

770
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:45,709
amounts so the producers don't have to

771
00:33:41,929 --> 00:33:49,190
be concerned or don't to deal with the

772
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:52,548
cost of marketing or processing they

773
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:55,100
just focus on doing there or they focus

774
00:33:52,548 --> 00:33:59,230
on running their production with the

775
00:33:55,099 --> 00:34:02,019
lowest ecological and economical impact

776
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:05,390
which is another reason that we need

777
00:34:02,019 --> 00:34:08,148
some sort of certification in cannabis

778
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:10,579
for organics so that we have another way

779
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:12,289
of differentiating out plant you know

780
00:34:10,579 --> 00:34:15,019
plants that were grown organically for

781
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:16,909
consumers to feel confident in the

782
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:19,369
quality and safety of their crop I mean

783
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:21,050
right now there's a lot in the in the

784
00:34:19,369 --> 00:34:22,849
Washington rec market that I wouldn't

785
00:34:21,050 --> 00:34:24,649
trust simply because I know the

786
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:26,269
regulations aren't able to control

787
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:28,638
aren't able to do effective regulation

788
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:29,838
on spraying and I know that there's

789
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:32,329
companies out there that are taking

790
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:34,398
advantage of that yeah we've we've seen

791
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:36,529
a million recalls or whatever we've seen

792
00:34:34,398 --> 00:34:39,519
dozens of recalls or upwards of one

793
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:43,550
hundred recalls across the nation from

794
00:34:39,519 --> 00:34:47,148
pesticide tainted cannabis products and

795
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:49,250
if we enter this economy where the

796
00:34:47,148 --> 00:34:51,858
margins are really tight like a 1 to 5

797
00:34:49,250 --> 00:34:53,838
percent profit margin we're gonna see a

798
00:34:51,858 --> 00:34:57,650
lot of producers that are that are

799
00:34:53,838 --> 00:35:00,529
tempted or feeling forced to do certain

800
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:02,809
agriculture or utilize IRA certain

801
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:05,839
agricultural practices to push that

802
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:07,789
yield up X percent and so rather than

803
00:35:05,838 --> 00:35:11,389
awaiting for the government to regulate

804
00:35:07,789 --> 00:35:14,088
us if we use if the industry regulates

805
00:35:11,389 --> 00:35:17,358
itself like certified kind or the

806
00:35:14,088 --> 00:35:21,289
Renewable innovation Institute if we use

807
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:24,739
these these regulatory bodies that have

808
00:35:21,289 --> 00:35:28,099
grown out of the industry then we can

809
00:35:24,739 --> 00:35:29,329
assure that producers that stick to

810
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:31,250
their ethics

811
00:35:29,329 --> 00:35:33,980
can be compensated appropriately and

812
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:36,920
maintain their margins if you knowif

813
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:39,740
farm X and farm Y both have a 5% margin

814
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,420
the farm X has a higher cost of

815
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:43,069
production because they stick to organic

816
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:45,500
methods then they should be compensated

817
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:47,440
for that and that doesn't mean that the

818
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:50,900
organic cannabis would be twice as much

819
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,480
maybe it will only be 10 percent more

820
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:56,150
expensive or 15 percent more expensive

821
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,719
which will ultimately be a nominal

822
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:01,250
increase in in a retail price yeah I

823
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:03,139
mean there's a you pay a premium for

824
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:05,840
organic products already on the produce

825
00:36:03,139 --> 00:36:09,079
side because you believe in that

826
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:11,510
certification so if I well you and I

827
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,920
have the fortunate circumstance of being

828
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,870
good friends with Andrew black who owns

829
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,849
certified kind so we know the standards

830
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:19,159
to which she's holding growers that are

831
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:22,730
using his certification but I would

832
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:24,829
happily pay 20% more in a rec store for

833
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:26,389
that certification so the idea being

834
00:36:24,829 --> 00:36:29,210
that the certification would pay for

835
00:36:26,389 --> 00:36:31,279
itself for that grower in the sense that

836
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,409
the public would recognize that and say

837
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,330
hey I it's important to me to know that

838
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:38,299
someone is looking out over this farm

839
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:39,829
and actually I guess double-checking and

840
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,200
reassuring me that what they're claiming

841
00:36:39,829 --> 00:36:43,909
is is accurate and they aren't using any

842
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:45,679
inputs that aren't organic and they're

843
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:47,779
not spraying any pesticides that their

844
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:50,419
known carcinogens and only approved for

845
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:52,400
use on ornamental crops and doing the

846
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:55,190
testing that right now the the states

847
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,050
just can't keep up with yeah and I know

848
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:59,380
you know I'm friends with Andrew black

849
00:36:57,050 --> 00:37:02,030
and he's a amazing man

850
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:05,059
very high integrity and of course he

851
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:06,860
wants he wants to certify more farms so

852
00:37:05,059 --> 00:37:09,949
he can get his annual certification fee

853
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:12,530
but he won't certify a farm if it

854
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:15,889
doesn't meet the organic standards in

855
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:18,140
the whole point of this like the the

856
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:20,480
industry that he's supporting or the the

857
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:23,480
market that he's supporting is people

858
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:25,820
who do the work which is a lot of it's

859
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,670
love intellectual work to assure that

860
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,670
you can create an organic product to the

861
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:36,019
organic standard and make it competitive

862
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:38,840
in this in this free market so the the

863
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:41,900
game really is to stick to your ethics

864
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:43,130
and lower cost of production now since

865
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:46,460
we're on the subject I actually

866
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:48,590
did interview Andrew but both of us

867
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,300
agreed that the conversation just didn't

868
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:52,329
flow all that well it's not the most

869
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:54,470
exciting topic for a lot of listeners

870
00:37:52,329 --> 00:37:55,880
since we're talking about it I wouldn't

871
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:57,649
mind touching on it briefly though I

872
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,860
know that you were looking into setting

873
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,820
up a certification a while back and can

874
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,370
you talk about some of the challenges

875
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:05,780
around certification just you know for a

876
00:38:04,369 --> 00:38:07,429
minute or two and give people a little

877
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:09,860
background onto it because I had I had

878
00:38:07,429 --> 00:38:12,349
no idea what went into a certification

879
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:15,440
at all for setting up a company like

880
00:38:12,349 --> 00:38:19,339
that when I when I set out to develop my

881
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,800
own certification for cannabis I thought

882
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:25,760
that I could simplify the standard and

883
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,590
be clear about no synthetic inputs and

884
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,040
just make it very easy to understand the

885
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:32,720
standards and to condense the hundreds

886
00:38:31,039 --> 00:38:35,269
and hundreds of pages that must be

887
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:37,939
digested or referenced to render organic

888
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:41,389
program I thought I condense that into a

889
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:44,750
page or a sheet or a paragraph and what

890
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:49,969
I realize is that it's it's an ideal and

891
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:52,010
it can happen like you can use no

892
00:38:49,969 --> 00:38:54,169
synthetics you can practice regenerative

893
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:56,750
model with no synthetic inputs you can

894
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:59,000
use on-site or local resources to

895
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,699
provide for your fertility and your pest

896
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:04,909
management but that is the exception not

897
00:39:01,699 --> 00:39:06,939
the norm and the most important thing

898
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:09,500
which I said before is that organic

899
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,289
agriculture or regenerative sustainable

900
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:15,820
however you say it this must become the

901
00:39:12,289 --> 00:39:18,619
norm and this must compete and displace

902
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:22,309
synthetic unsustainable agriculture and

903
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:25,819
so we have to be a bit pragmatic in that

904
00:39:22,309 --> 00:39:28,460
my new amounts of synthetic nutrients

905
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:30,470
can be utilized so we can have crop

906
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:33,199
yields and crop quality in an organic

907
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:34,939
program that can compete and displace

908
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:37,159
the synthetic paradigm that we're living

909
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:39,470
in now which is you know destroying

910
00:39:37,159 --> 00:39:43,250
topsoil and creating large amounts of

911
00:39:39,469 --> 00:39:44,599
runoff and poisoning farm workers etc I

912
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,190
don't disagree with anything you're

913
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:48,920
saying there I do want to get back to

914
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:52,309
the topic of this conference and I want

915
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:54,470
to save my favorite speaker for last so

916
00:39:52,309 --> 00:39:56,480
I'm gonna jump out of order here one of

917
00:39:54,469 --> 00:39:59,059
the last panels I heard

918
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,858
from was Michael Williams director of

919
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:03,320
operations at flourish and Harborside

920
00:40:00,858 --> 00:40:05,389
Health Center Erik Culberson director of

921
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:08,330
cultivation at Columbia care and then

922
00:40:05,389 --> 00:40:10,279
Jeremy plumb comes out of Portland he's

923
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:13,639
co-founder and director of cultivation

924
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:15,430
at Pharma and proof and the three of

925
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:19,429
them were up there talking about

926
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:22,069
genetics chemo type expression and some

927
00:40:19,429 --> 00:40:24,199
of the medicinal value and research is

928
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:25,490
being done around these cannabinoids

929
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:27,108
do you want talk a little about what

930
00:40:25,489 --> 00:40:31,099
your takeaways were from their from

931
00:40:27,108 --> 00:40:34,400
their panel you know the the the topic

932
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:38,599
of conversation after their presentation

933
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,230
was genetic drift what is genetic drift

934
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:45,759
and is genetic drift an issue with

935
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:48,858
clonal propagation and should we be

936
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,200
really motivated to move from normal

937
00:40:48,858 --> 00:40:54,108
normal clonal propagation to

938
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:56,779
micropropagation tissue culture and even

939
00:40:54,108 --> 00:41:01,179
those guys on stage they had I feel like

940
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:04,580
they they each touched on the issue and

941
00:41:01,179 --> 00:41:08,059
some of them seem to backpedal around

942
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:11,358
this this genetic drift term because

943
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:14,299
it's just not an accurate term for why

944
00:41:11,358 --> 00:41:16,460
we're attracted to tissue culture so

945
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:19,940
what's really happening here it seems

946
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:21,199
that the major problem is not it's not

947
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:23,059
genetic dread first of all because we're

948
00:41:21,199 --> 00:41:25,219
not growing cannabis from seed it

949
00:41:23,059 --> 00:41:27,380
doesn't grow true to seed so that term

950
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:30,169
genetic drift is not accurate in terms

951
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:31,760
of mutations that we're seeing from a

952
00:41:30,170 --> 00:41:33,230
just a terminology perspective so we

953
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,550
really do need a new word for that and

954
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,530
that was something they're talking about

955
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:38,300
but what seems to be really happening is

956
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:40,280
that people are cloning from unhealthy

957
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,510
mother plants and that's a real problem

958
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,700
and that's where we're seeing the

959
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:45,940
degradation in quality over time or in

960
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:49,309
you know plant growth and health and

961
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:51,050
cannabinoid levels so I think we need to

962
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:53,000
encourage people to make sure that they

963
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,590
have really really healthy mother plants

964
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,449
prior to cloning and that's something

965
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:58,039
that I've seen in a lot of facilities I

966
00:41:56,449 --> 00:41:59,779
visited is the mother room is not the

967
00:41:58,039 --> 00:42:03,440
best looking room in the facility and it

968
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,970
really needs to be and Jeremy I believe

969
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,740
was the one talking about how he likes

970
00:42:04,969 --> 00:42:08,629
to even have a redundant mother room

971
00:42:06,739 --> 00:42:10,199
mm-hmm like he's willing to dedicate a

972
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,820
whole nother space

973
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:14,039
just to make sure that we're preserving

974
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:15,480
genetics and keeping up the quality of

975
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:18,838
the genetics because clonal propagation

976
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,550
is still the standard in the industry as

977
00:42:18,838 --> 00:42:23,009
tissue culture is slowly coming on and

978
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,230
people are doing more research around it

979
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,579
and the other thing they would talked

980
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,230
about that was interesting

981
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:31,740
I hadn't heard the term before but chain

982
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:33,630
cloning the idea of cloning your next

983
00:42:31,739 --> 00:42:36,358
crop off of your previous crop before

984
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:38,250
you put them into flour and the danger

985
00:42:36,358 --> 00:42:39,480
with that is really the idea of all the

986
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:42,150
disease you're spreading it's much

987
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,050
easier to keep one or a handful of

988
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:48,539
mother plants really really healthy and

989
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:50,970
bug free than it is to try and maintain

990
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:52,800
that across the entire crop so you may

991
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:57,059
be just perpetuating your disease

992
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,099
problems that way - mmhmm yeah like if

993
00:42:57,059 --> 00:43:01,858
you if you look in a tissue culture you

994
00:42:59,099 --> 00:43:05,609
understand what the benefits are of it

995
00:43:01,858 --> 00:43:08,219
and the potential of it to lower cost

996
00:43:05,608 --> 00:43:11,489
production and to increase how many

997
00:43:08,219 --> 00:43:15,358
crops per year a producer can can can

998
00:43:11,489 --> 00:43:18,568
can produce whether it is indoors or in

999
00:43:15,358 --> 00:43:22,650
a light deprivation greenhouse so the

1000
00:43:18,568 --> 00:43:24,559
technology is there implementing it at a

1001
00:43:22,650 --> 00:43:27,690
small scale is really difficult

1002
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:30,029
implementing at a large scale is I'm not

1003
00:43:27,690 --> 00:43:33,510
saying it's easy but it's just the way

1004
00:43:30,030 --> 00:43:38,910
that tissue culture is efficient is at

1005
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:40,800
scale so the idea that every farm or any

1006
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:43,348
like one acre farmers and have a tissue

1007
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,289
culture production facility I think is

1008
00:43:43,349 --> 00:43:46,920
really it's really idealistic it's not

1009
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:48,599
naive

1010
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:50,789
it just idealistic because there's a

1011
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,599
long learning curve that goes with T C

1012
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:57,599
and as we see T C become part of the

1013
00:43:54,599 --> 00:44:00,900
industry it's not going to be in a

1014
00:43:57,599 --> 00:44:03,030
decentralized way at first because the

1015
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,480
learning curve I think the reason people

1016
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:08,630
are so attracted to it is because a lot

1017
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,280
of people whether they're new or

1018
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:14,818
advanced or very experienced have this

1019
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,650
sort of like knee-jerk reaction to

1020
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,969
taking a clone of a clone of a clone of

1021
00:44:16,650 --> 00:44:20,880
a clone because they feel like they're

1022
00:44:17,969 --> 00:44:23,699
going to experience a gradation in

1023
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,650
reality that's not true

1024
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:27,929
taking a clinical in of a clone does not

1025
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:30,240
degree genetics it can it will maintains

1026
00:44:27,929 --> 00:44:34,529
nice just fine over enormous amounts of

1027
00:44:30,239 --> 00:44:37,199
time but if your cloning process is not

1028
00:44:34,530 --> 00:44:39,450
consistent and you're experiencing or

1029
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,429
you're you're creating stressed-out

1030
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:43,588
plants and remember the numerous of

1031
00:44:41,429 --> 00:44:45,659
these generations then that could damage

1032
00:44:43,588 --> 00:44:48,529
the genetics so the issue here is not

1033
00:44:45,659 --> 00:44:51,118
that we need to move away from

1034
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:53,339
consecutive cloning and then we need to

1035
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:55,680
move to TC the issue really is that we

1036
00:44:53,338 --> 00:44:57,750
need to get better at propagation yeah

1037
00:44:55,679 --> 00:45:01,169
my other concern too is that as we get

1038
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:04,070
these larger scale facilities and fewer

1039
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,210
fewer companies in the cannabis industry

1040
00:45:04,070 --> 00:45:09,390
we may lose some of that genetic

1041
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:11,730
diversity because right now in history

1042
00:45:09,389 --> 00:45:13,379
probably exists the largest amount of

1043
00:45:11,730 --> 00:45:15,599
genetic diversity around cannabis that

1044
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:18,539
has ever existed in the world since the

1045
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,338
beginning of time and my hope is that we

1046
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:21,838
can maintain and grow upon this I mean

1047
00:45:20,338 --> 00:45:24,179
you have people like the people on this

1048
00:45:21,838 --> 00:45:26,519
panel like Jeremy and Michael that are

1049
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:30,719
growing out you know hundreds of chemo

1050
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:33,960
types and and selecting for cultivars

1051
00:45:30,719 --> 00:45:38,489
that are going to be you know higher in

1052
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:39,990
CBG or contain different medicinal

1053
00:45:38,489 --> 00:45:41,939
properties as we learn more and more

1054
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:45,449
about the effects of these different

1055
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,760
cannabinoids on humans and on different

1056
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:49,858
diseases that we're facing so my hope is

1057
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:51,839
that we continue to grow that because it

1058
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:55,380
seems to me and not being a medical

1059
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:57,029
patient who relies on cannabis I can't

1060
00:45:55,380 --> 00:45:59,460
say a hundred percent but I've heard

1061
00:45:57,030 --> 00:46:01,890
this story where people who are patients

1062
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,829
will say you know I really only get I

1063
00:46:01,889 --> 00:46:06,659
get good results from this one cultivar

1064
00:46:04,829 --> 00:46:07,950
growing by these you know this one

1065
00:46:06,659 --> 00:46:11,219
person like I stayed with this brand

1066
00:46:07,949 --> 00:46:13,139
because it really helps it helps my you

1067
00:46:11,219 --> 00:46:15,179
know my treatment and that's something I

1068
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:17,400
hope we can remain tane it's true I've

1069
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:21,539
heard good research presented a brown

1070
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:24,720
around what cannabinoid ratio gives

1071
00:46:21,539 --> 00:46:28,108
relief to certain medical symptoms and

1072
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:30,269
maybe you need a one to one CBD to THC

1073
00:46:28,108 --> 00:46:32,190
ratio or maybe maybe a two to one or a

1074
00:46:30,269 --> 00:46:35,639
one or two or maybe it's a 10 to 1 or a

1075
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:36,900
1 to 10 and this really is based on

1076
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:40,109
people's

1077
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:42,660
doggedness endocannabinoids system and

1078
00:46:40,110 --> 00:46:46,019
what symptom they're trying to treat so

1079
00:46:42,659 --> 00:46:49,019
we do need this diversity of cultivars

1080
00:46:46,019 --> 00:46:51,539
or chemo types because that is what

1081
00:46:49,019 --> 00:46:54,960
solves the problem so this isn't just

1082
00:46:51,539 --> 00:46:56,610
about like this strain tastes so cool we

1083
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,800
have to maintain this like the skunky

1084
00:46:56,610 --> 00:47:00,180
pineapple flavor really it's that we

1085
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:02,190
found this cultivar that has this

1086
00:47:00,179 --> 00:47:04,529
cannabinoid ratio or this cannabinoid

1087
00:47:02,190 --> 00:47:08,730
turpenoid profile that will relieve the

1088
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:09,690
symptoms of X illness and that's just so

1089
00:47:08,730 --> 00:47:11,309
valuable

1090
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:13,700
we've never I don't think we've ever

1091
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:17,759
come across a plant that has this

1092
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:20,579
diversity of chemo types and that the

1093
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,970
chemo types are so important to specific

1094
00:47:20,579 --> 00:47:26,429
illnesses yeah I totally agree and that

1095
00:47:23,969 --> 00:47:28,619
being said in the in the interest of not

1096
00:47:26,429 --> 00:47:30,960
letting this podcast go too long I have

1097
00:47:28,619 --> 00:47:33,210
saved the best for last

1098
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,650
in my opinion the one that I'm most

1099
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,050
excited about and I'm still working to

1100
00:47:34,650 --> 00:47:39,240
get her on this podcast so we'll see but

1101
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:41,760
Suzanne Wainwright Evans also known as

1102
00:47:39,239 --> 00:47:45,149
the bug lady that's not an insult she

1103
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:47,820
refers to herself that way haha she I

1104
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:49,650
had never heard her speak jaya you've

1105
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:50,640
obviously had conversations with her and

1106
00:47:49,650 --> 00:47:51,990
i remember you telling me how excited

1107
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:55,019
you were the first time you heard her

1108
00:47:51,989 --> 00:47:57,119
speak at canna con she gave a really

1109
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:58,739
good talk and i kind of wanted to go

1110
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:00,299
through that one in a little more depth

1111
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:03,000
than we did with some of the other ones

1112
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:04,890
yeah i'll go ahead and start off with

1113
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:07,650
some of my notes because i took pretty

1114
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:09,509
extensive notes on this one and feel

1115
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:11,880
free to jump in where you feel

1116
00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:14,070
appropriate so she started talking about

1117
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:16,470
some of the reasons for using beneficial

1118
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:18,420
insects and one of the first things she

1119
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:21,239
talked about was worker safety

1120
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,519
so we're reducing pesticide sprays so

1121
00:48:21,239 --> 00:48:25,859
that's going to help protect the human

1122
00:48:23,519 --> 00:48:27,869
workers in the room it's also going to

1123
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:29,880
reduce the amount of pesticide

1124
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:32,069
resistance that we're already seeing as

1125
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:33,180
you know if you spray the same thing for

1126
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:35,490
your spider mites

1127
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:37,649
you know cycle after cycle they will

1128
00:48:35,489 --> 00:48:39,389
build up resistance and then it also

1129
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:41,400
will help with limitations that we're

1130
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:44,519
seeing both on a regulatory level but

1131
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,070
also from public outcry or public

1132
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:49,739
opinion in terms of pesticide residues

1133
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:50,550
on our crops the first thing that she

1134
00:48:49,739 --> 00:48:52,979
said in getting

1135
00:48:50,550 --> 00:48:54,660
started with beneficial insects was to

1136
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,190
form a relationship with someone who

1137
00:48:54,659 --> 00:48:59,099
knows what they are doing and what

1138
00:48:56,190 --> 00:49:00,840
they're talking about and that to me

1139
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:02,279
seems like the most important the most

1140
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,920
important tip that she gave right there

1141
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:06,690
so that's the first thing she said and

1142
00:49:04,920 --> 00:49:09,150
then she said commit to scouting your

1143
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,590
plants you really need to look really

1144
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,519
close to your plants and keep an eye on

1145
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,019
what's going on

1146
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:16,039
so you can get an accurate

1147
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:18,509
identification of the problem and

1148
00:49:16,039 --> 00:49:20,309
interesting enough she was saying how

1149
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:22,320
you know depending on if you're dealing

1150
00:49:20,309 --> 00:49:24,539
with a dirt floor or a concrete floor or

1151
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:26,850
a gravel floor can actually affect what

1152
00:49:24,539 --> 00:49:29,400
her recommendations are so it's not as

1153
00:49:26,849 --> 00:49:32,279
simple as saying this bug eats this bug

1154
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:34,200
or this bug survives in this this

1155
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:36,780
environmental condition or lighting or

1156
00:49:34,199 --> 00:49:39,119
temperature but you actually have to

1157
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:41,550
really have a pretty high level of

1158
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,480
knowledge of entomology to successfully

1159
00:49:41,550 --> 00:49:46,920
employ implement these these bugs

1160
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:48,539
definitely there is there's there's all

1161
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,070
these systems that you have to be

1162
00:49:48,539 --> 00:49:51,960
cognizant of when you're doing a

1163
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:55,500
production like if you're growing in

1164
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:58,800
pots versus in beds then the ability for

1165
00:49:55,500 --> 00:50:01,800
those bio controls to cover the space is

1166
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,510
much different there's only the only so

1167
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,200
many bio controllers can move from plant

1168
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:10,590
to plant so if you have a contiguous

1169
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:12,689
soil underneath your canopy then these

1170
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:15,180
bio controllers can move across the

1171
00:50:12,690 --> 00:50:16,800
landscape and colonize the space much

1172
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,980
more effectively than if you have

1173
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:21,510
individual pots and the idea it depends

1174
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:24,090
in the biocontrol some bio controls

1175
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:25,890
you're assuming they will not create a

1176
00:50:24,090 --> 00:50:28,440
breeding population and you're going to

1177
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:29,869
use an innovative release program to

1178
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:32,849
assure that you have proper control

1179
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:35,130
other bio controls will naturalize in

1180
00:50:32,849 --> 00:50:37,650
the space and if the space is such that

1181
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:40,289
they can navigate the square footage

1182
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:43,710
like in a bed or in long rows certain

1183
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:46,170
bio controls like soul dwelling soul

1184
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:48,480
dwelling predators will be able to move

1185
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:51,139
across that space and you can develop a

1186
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,789
breeding population which becomes

1187
00:50:51,139 --> 00:50:57,059
naturalized in that greenhouse or in

1188
00:50:53,789 --> 00:50:59,969
that site if the floor plan you know is

1189
00:50:57,059 --> 00:51:03,150
conducive to that that predator yeah she

1190
00:50:59,969 --> 00:51:03,578
talked about how we need to also improve

1191
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:06,700
our

1192
00:51:03,579 --> 00:51:08,859
practices as growers and stop spreading

1193
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:11,108
all of these bugs around especially with

1194
00:51:08,858 --> 00:51:13,358
our cuttings like the hem press it might

1195
00:51:11,108 --> 00:51:16,719
doesn't fly the reason it's being spread

1196
00:51:13,358 --> 00:51:18,548
so rapidly is because people would keep

1197
00:51:16,719 --> 00:51:21,009
bringing in their facility with new cuts

1198
00:51:18,548 --> 00:51:22,568
and new clothes and so one of the things

1199
00:51:21,009 --> 00:51:26,019
she talked about with that is we need to

1200
00:51:22,568 --> 00:51:27,940
do a better job of biocontrol with our

1201
00:51:26,018 --> 00:51:29,949
management strategies so she had talked

1202
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:32,318
about dipping cuttings like literally

1203
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:34,149
she had some photos of a colander with

1204
00:51:32,318 --> 00:51:37,088
the plant tissue or you're cutting

1205
00:51:34,150 --> 00:51:39,068
inside of it and dipping that into the

1206
00:51:37,088 --> 00:51:40,239
industry-standard apparently is Botanic

1207
00:51:39,068 --> 00:51:43,058
Garden Route shield which is a

1208
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:44,619
trichoderma product she also mentioned

1209
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,298
some oil X is another one that you could

1210
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:49,150
potentially use as a dip though they're

1211
00:51:46,298 --> 00:51:51,728
currently not certified for that but

1212
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:54,068
also keeping your tools clean and she

1213
00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:56,409
had a great photo of some clippers and

1214
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:58,389
there were three different stages on it

1215
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:00,518
so the first one was the the sanitizer

1216
00:51:58,389 --> 00:52:02,199
and then the second one was the the

1217
00:52:00,518 --> 00:52:03,608
second sanitizer to remove the larger

1218
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:05,949
plant material and then the last one was

1219
00:52:03,608 --> 00:52:07,778
a clean wash so that you could move from

1220
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:10,838
room to room or plant to plant without

1221
00:52:07,778 --> 00:52:12,969
spreading any of these bugs and then she

1222
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:15,338
also mentions poling dying foliage so

1223
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:18,009
not having you know dying leaves there

1224
00:52:15,338 --> 00:52:19,778
that could be potential habitat and then

1225
00:52:18,009 --> 00:52:23,380
lastly being really selective on who

1226
00:52:19,778 --> 00:52:25,599
enters your facility and she talked

1227
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:26,890
about how she goes to law facilities and

1228
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:28,719
they never even ask her where she's been

1229
00:52:26,889 --> 00:52:31,449
or what she's wearing they don't ever

1230
00:52:28,719 --> 00:52:33,159
put on coveralls I'm always very careful

1231
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:34,838
when I go out on a consult to make sure

1232
00:52:33,159 --> 00:52:36,670
that my clothes are clean I haven't been

1233
00:52:34,838 --> 00:52:39,699
in here any other cannabis plants or any

1234
00:52:36,670 --> 00:52:42,338
other vector plants and I know over at

1235
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:44,949
gold leaf they have a floor mat with a

1236
00:52:42,338 --> 00:52:46,808
sanitizing solution in there that you

1237
00:52:44,949 --> 00:52:48,459
step into before you walk into a room

1238
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:50,829
and they also limit room to room

1239
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:51,909
movement so on the potential that you

1240
00:52:50,829 --> 00:52:53,528
may have picked something up you're not

1241
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:55,298
carrying it into that next room your

1242
00:52:53,528 --> 00:52:57,298
workflow doesn't involve going into

1243
00:52:55,298 --> 00:53:00,219
multiple rooms in a in a given day

1244
00:52:57,298 --> 00:53:02,858
mm-hmm and whether you're running a

1245
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:06,068
facility which has which has really

1246
00:53:02,858 --> 00:53:08,380
strict biosecurity protocols where you

1247
00:53:06,068 --> 00:53:10,119
know all employees must shower and we

1248
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:11,858
put on their you know their bunny suit

1249
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:14,619
their shoe covers and head covers

1250
00:53:11,858 --> 00:53:17,199
whether you have a highly clean facility

1251
00:53:14,619 --> 00:53:19,358
or a pretty loose facility either

1252
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:22,358
way your flow hick your work flow

1253
00:53:19,358 --> 00:53:24,819
throughout the day should start in the

1254
00:53:22,358 --> 00:53:26,559
facilities that are in the sections of

1255
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:29,349
your facility which are cleanest and

1256
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:31,690
move throughout the day towards the

1257
00:53:29,349 --> 00:53:33,579
least clean space so you're not bringing

1258
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:35,019
you know you could have you could have

1259
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:36,700
spider mites and vege which are easily

1260
00:53:35,019 --> 00:53:39,909
dealt with but if you have spider mites

1261
00:53:36,699 --> 00:53:40,989
to flower it could ruin your crop and so

1262
00:53:39,909 --> 00:53:42,759
you have to think about how you move

1263
00:53:40,989 --> 00:53:45,039
through the facility throughout the day

1264
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:46,690
and they are not creating you know

1265
00:53:45,039 --> 00:53:48,579
you're not taking a minor problem and

1266
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:51,570
tracking it into his face where it'll

1267
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:53,769
become a major problem and and scouting

1268
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:57,519
scouting is the I think it's the

1269
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:59,739
foundation of IPM regardless of how

1270
00:53:57,519 --> 00:54:02,949
sustainable or not sustainable your IPM

1271
00:53:59,739 --> 00:54:08,259
program is you have to scout and get a

1272
00:54:02,949 --> 00:54:11,739
and create a an SOP around what is light

1273
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:14,140
pressure of this pest and what is medium

1274
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:16,659
pressure of this pest and find out a way

1275
00:54:14,139 --> 00:54:19,659
to quantify that quickly and easily and

1276
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:22,118
keep track of it so whoever is in charge

1277
00:54:19,659 --> 00:54:25,889
of running this facility can look at

1278
00:54:22,119 --> 00:54:28,900
this data and make a plan around your

1279
00:54:25,889 --> 00:54:31,750
insecticide or IPM or by a security

1280
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:35,170
protocol that keeps them below in

1281
00:54:31,750 --> 00:54:38,318
economic threshold because the idea the

1282
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:41,889
idea is not to have no pests it's to

1283
00:54:38,318 --> 00:54:43,929
maintain pests below an economic

1284
00:54:41,889 --> 00:54:45,400
threshold yeah she talks about how it's

1285
00:54:43,929 --> 00:54:46,838
really important to keep records so you

1286
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,608
can see when your pest pressures are

1287
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:51,009
occurring how heavy they are what you're

1288
00:54:48,608 --> 00:54:52,150
seeing in that room and one of the

1289
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,310
things she mentioned is that you don't

1290
00:54:52,150 --> 00:54:56,019
have to know every pest out there you

1291
00:54:54,309 --> 00:54:58,719
just have to know the pests that you end

1292
00:54:56,019 --> 00:55:01,030
up having to deal with in your facility

1293
00:54:58,719 --> 00:55:02,199
consistently over time and it's really

1294
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,390
important to know the different life

1295
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:07,118
stages of not only the pests but also

1296
00:55:04,389 --> 00:55:11,348
the beneficials and she uses the example

1297
00:55:07,119 --> 00:55:14,068
of let's see what was it here on that

1298
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:17,829
tip of uh you only need to know so many

1299
00:55:14,068 --> 00:55:19,420
pests to do proper scouting I really

1300
00:55:17,829 --> 00:55:22,900
feel that because at this point in my

1301
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:25,780
life if I am sent a photo of an insect

1302
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:27,639
that I've never seen before I assume

1303
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:29,019
it's not a pest because if it was a pest

1304
00:55:27,639 --> 00:55:30,909
I would have heard of it you know I'm

1305
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:34,599
not like I'm not a hard line that I know

1306
00:55:30,909 --> 00:55:37,118
I'm always if I see a new insect I want

1307
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:38,680
to know all right I will seek out the

1308
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,079
information to find out a visit pastor

1309
00:55:38,679 --> 00:55:42,940
or predator but there's only so many

1310
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:44,950
cannabis pests that we generally have to

1311
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:48,909
deal with yes so I want to I want to

1312
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:51,308
come back to scouting but the the

1313
00:55:48,909 --> 00:55:52,779
example she gave was Athens so this was

1314
00:55:51,309 --> 00:55:54,730
really interesting I'm talking a little

1315
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:57,670
about Athens she said that Athens can be

1316
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:59,798
color morphs which means that they can

1317
00:55:57,670 --> 00:56:01,568
actually change the color that they are

1318
00:55:59,798 --> 00:56:04,150
and so something like a green peach

1319
00:56:01,568 --> 00:56:05,858
aphid isn't necessarily green it could

1320
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:10,180
be red and it isn't necessarily going to

1321
00:56:05,858 --> 00:56:12,969
be on a peach so you really have to look

1322
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:14,828
at the morphology the characteristics of

1323
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:17,259
that aphid to determine what it is and

1324
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:18,970
the thing with aphids is they actually

1325
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:21,190
suck the sugars out of the plant and

1326
00:56:18,969 --> 00:56:23,679
exude this honeydew which is the sugar

1327
00:56:21,190 --> 00:56:25,838
that then the ants come along and then

1328
00:56:23,679 --> 00:56:28,659
wasps will eat that as well and then you

1329
00:56:25,838 --> 00:56:31,058
get the city mold that will develop on

1330
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:32,949
the honeydew and right now we have major

1331
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:35,319
insecticide resistance on white flies

1332
00:56:32,949 --> 00:56:36,548
and Western flower thrips and she was

1333
00:56:35,318 --> 00:56:38,650
saying a lot of the conference's she's

1334
00:56:36,548 --> 00:56:41,500
going to on entomology they think Athens

1335
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:43,778
will be the next wave and interesting

1336
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:46,028
enough aphids give live birth so if the

1337
00:56:43,778 --> 00:56:48,219
mom is resistant to insecticide these

1338
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:51,909
kids that are exact clone of her will be

1339
00:56:48,219 --> 00:56:55,598
as well so really really interesting

1340
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:58,868
stuff and she had a video of a green

1341
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:00,068
lacewing sucking the inside and it's an

1342
00:56:58,869 --> 00:57:00,970
immature it's low I think it's a

1343
00:57:00,068 --> 00:57:03,130
juvenile stage

1344
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:05,199
sorry juvenile stage is sucking the

1345
00:57:03,130 --> 00:57:07,750
inside of the aphids leaving these dead

1346
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:10,000
bodies behind and it's so important to

1347
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:12,250
know if something is still alive based

1348
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,659
on what bio control your agents so if

1349
00:57:12,250 --> 00:57:16,510
you know you're applying lace wings and

1350
00:57:13,659 --> 00:57:19,778
you should be seeing these leftover

1351
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:22,089
skins or shriveled versions of aphids

1352
00:57:19,778 --> 00:57:24,190
that are dead and so you really have to

1353
00:57:22,088 --> 00:57:26,739
get down in there and and start

1354
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:29,740
identifying these things she also saw

1355
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:32,019
the video of a predatory mite I can't

1356
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:34,838
remember if it was californica source in

1357
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:37,719
list for classes but it was feeding on a

1358
00:57:34,838 --> 00:57:39,130
red mite I'm not sure what kind of

1359
00:57:37,719 --> 00:57:41,558
spider mite it was but it was red in

1360
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:44,500
color and as it fed on the red mite it

1361
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,800
took on as a predatory mite fed on the

1362
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,630
red

1363
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,269
it took on the color of the red might

1364
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:51,750
and so these mites are the same size

1365
00:57:49,269 --> 00:57:54,849
same shape and then they can

1366
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:58,000
periodically be the same color so it

1367
00:57:54,849 --> 00:57:59,799
makes scouting a much more complex task

1368
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:04,000
because you really have to look at the

1369
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:06,970
eggs and see if there are exclusively

1370
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:10,570
spider mite X on the leaf or if there

1371
00:58:06,969 --> 00:58:12,849
are predatory mites there also and the

1372
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,920
way that I think is really like much

1373
00:58:12,849 --> 00:58:18,099
less like intellectual and more applied

1374
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:20,950
is looking at how spider mites move

1375
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:22,299
across a canopy because many people have

1376
00:58:20,949 --> 00:58:25,119
seen spider mites sweep across the

1377
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:28,300
canopy very quickly but with a proper

1378
00:58:25,119 --> 00:58:31,659
initative biocontrol release program you

1379
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:35,230
can observe or you can scout and monitor

1380
00:58:31,659 --> 00:58:37,569
spider mite hotspots that don't seem to

1381
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:40,030
spread because there are predators in

1382
00:58:37,570 --> 00:58:42,910
that area so when you take that leaf off

1383
00:58:40,030 --> 00:58:44,320
and you see those pests on the leaf you

1384
00:58:42,909 --> 00:58:45,940
really have to look at it and you're not

1385
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,440
just looking for how many pests are

1386
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:50,050
you're looking to see if there's a

1387
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:52,329
predator present scouting is not just

1388
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:54,580
about scouting for pests it's about

1389
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:55,929
scouting for predators she did talk more

1390
00:58:54,579 --> 00:58:58,179
about some of the tools with that so

1391
00:58:55,929 --> 00:59:00,819
you'll want to have a hand lens which

1392
00:58:58,179 --> 00:59:03,549
she's a bang board which is it looked

1393
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:05,710
like the top of a white cooler for lack

1394
00:59:03,550 --> 00:59:07,660
of a better definition I can visually

1395
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:09,880
describe and she says it's much better

1396
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:11,319
to knock the bugs off the plants onto

1397
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,450
the board where you can see him screwing

1398
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:16,420
around and trying to lift up the

1399
00:59:13,449 --> 00:59:18,789
undersides of leaves you need something

1400
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:22,030
to take photos with whether it's a

1401
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:24,009
camera or your cell phone

1402
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,990
scouting form so you're writing this

1403
00:59:24,010 --> 00:59:28,750
stuff down and then she did recommend a

1404
00:59:25,989 --> 00:59:30,969
handheld microscope that hooks up to USB

1405
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:31,840
then I wrote down somewhere in here I

1406
00:59:30,969 --> 00:59:34,569
don't know if you know off the top of

1407
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:36,550
your head yeah dynolite there's there's

1408
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:40,530
a lot of USB microscopes on the market

1409
00:59:36,550 --> 00:59:45,039
but dynolite sells scopes ranging from

1410
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:48,640
$50 to $1400 depending on the resolution

1411
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:52,889
and up the field that you desire but she

1412
00:59:48,639 --> 00:59:55,239
recommended $150 Dino light and sound

1413
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:57,250
horticulture also has a dino light in

1414
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:58,269
their website that I think is around 150

1415
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,599
or too

1416
00:59:58,269 --> 01:00:04,090
fifty dollars that is sufficient to take

1417
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:07,000
really nice really high-resolution

1418
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:10,510
photos of pests or predators so that you

1419
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:13,179
can document them track them and submit

1420
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:16,060
the photos to entomologist or in

1421
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:20,199
centuries so you can so everyone can be

1422
01:00:16,059 --> 01:00:21,940
sure of what the pest problem is yes so

1423
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:24,639
that leads us back to identification she

1424
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:26,409
says do not guess because it makes a big

1425
01:00:24,639 --> 01:00:29,109
difference what you're dealing with

1426
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:31,719
so she's thrips as an example there she

1427
01:00:29,110 --> 01:00:33,309
said that acai no drips require a

1428
01:00:31,719 --> 01:00:35,559
different mode of action the Western

1429
01:00:33,309 --> 01:00:37,539
flower thrips and beneficial nematodes

1430
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:39,250
don't work on any kind of thrips so if

1431
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:41,190
you go in dealing with thrips and you

1432
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:43,119
just you call up a company and they say

1433
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:44,590
you tell them you have thrips if they

1434
01:00:43,119 --> 01:00:46,210
don't ask you what kind of trip said

1435
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:47,680
they are then you shouldn't be doing

1436
01:00:46,210 --> 01:00:50,349
business with them she was very adamant

1437
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,179
about that and part of that is also

1438
01:00:50,349 --> 01:00:53,909
knowing this plant pest lifecycle

1439
01:00:52,179 --> 01:00:56,079
because the Western flower thrip

1440
01:00:53,909 --> 01:00:57,789
everyone targets the foliage you know

1441
01:00:56,079 --> 01:00:59,409
you spray the foliage I've done that but

1442
01:00:57,789 --> 01:01:00,909
they have other life stages that are

1443
01:00:59,409 --> 01:01:02,469
actually in the soil which was something

1444
01:01:00,909 --> 01:01:04,809
I wasn't aware of so we need to treat

1445
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:06,669
all stages if we really want to manage

1446
01:01:04,809 --> 01:01:08,679
this pest over time and get a handle on

1447
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:10,659
it so identification she said don't

1448
01:01:08,679 --> 01:01:13,599
guess really important don't ask people

1449
01:01:10,659 --> 01:01:16,089
on Facebook seems like a no-brainer but

1450
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,190
I can't tell you how many times I've

1451
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:19,780
seen that in forums so I'll put up one

1452
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:23,800
bug and they'll get twenty answers and

1453
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:25,690
it's like yeah it's pretty rough and

1454
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:27,280
people are confident too that's the

1455
01:01:25,690 --> 01:01:30,309
craziest part of it they like they know

1456
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,990
what it is but I take photos you can get

1457
01:01:30,309 --> 01:01:34,539
one of those Dynalite magnifiers and you

1458
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:36,159
can put the insects in alcohol and mail

1459
01:01:34,539 --> 01:01:39,639
them you know if you need to get an ID

1460
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:41,379
or take them to an expert you don't have

1461
01:01:39,639 --> 01:01:43,929
to take a leaf if it's cannabis that's

1462
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:45,760
illegal or you can't ship it this is a

1463
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:47,949
great way to get an identification -

1464
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:51,340
yeah when I was when I was when I was

1465
01:01:47,949 --> 01:01:53,259
deep in the broad my research the the

1466
01:01:51,340 --> 01:01:55,600
university research I found on it was

1467
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:58,390
just soaked or to dip a leaf into

1468
01:01:55,599 --> 01:02:00,279
alcohol and so all the broad mites we

1469
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:01,809
washed off into it and it would die and

1470
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:04,090
then they'll fall out a suspension

1471
01:02:01,809 --> 01:02:05,769
relatively quickly and so you can if

1472
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:09,070
you're dipping a you know so you dip

1473
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:10,780
four leaves into the alcohol solution

1474
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:12,010
and then you can count the broad mites

1475
01:02:10,780 --> 01:02:14,680
that come out of it or whatever

1476
01:02:12,010 --> 01:02:17,140
pesto's you can count those and figure

1477
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:20,259
okay I have this many pests per leaf and

1478
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:22,960
so whatever you're sampling or

1479
01:02:20,260 --> 01:02:25,450
monitoring protocol is as long as you do

1480
01:02:22,960 --> 01:02:28,179
it consistently you've got a constant

1481
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:30,849
and then your only variable is the

1482
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:32,500
actual quantity of pests that you're

1483
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:34,539
finding another thing that she talked

1484
01:02:32,500 --> 01:02:35,860
about Tia was pesticide compatibility

1485
01:02:34,539 --> 01:02:37,210
and she says there is a lot of

1486
01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:40,809
compatibility between many of these

1487
01:02:37,210 --> 01:02:43,360
pesticides and beneficial beneficial

1488
01:02:40,809 --> 01:02:47,009
insects and I'll put the list up

1489
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:50,620
there's Agra bio BASF bio best bio line

1490
01:02:47,010 --> 01:02:53,860
Co pert and these companies have mobile

1491
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:55,960
apps even and you can put in the generic

1492
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:58,420
name or even the brand in some cases of

1493
01:02:55,960 --> 01:03:00,490
what the pesticide is and then you can

1494
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:02,470
see the effects on a given species of

1495
01:03:00,489 --> 01:03:05,319
insect like you know Simitis or

1496
01:03:02,469 --> 01:03:06,730
California kiss and it'll say you know

1497
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:09,640
whether it's gonna kill all of them

1498
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:11,590
there's more than 75% or less than 25%

1499
01:03:09,639 --> 01:03:13,629
and it makes it different if you're

1500
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:15,490
doing a foliar application versus an

1501
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:17,590
irrigated application of that pesticide

1502
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:19,809
it's a great way to check and it'll tell

1503
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:22,240
you how long you need to wait before you

1504
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:23,590
can reintroduce those beneficial insects

1505
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:25,750
which is really important because you

1506
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,910
don't want to do a spray and then bring

1507
01:03:25,750 --> 01:03:29,500
in these beneficial insects and there's

1508
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:31,690
gonna be lingering effects of that spray

1509
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:32,949
and you may not get you know you may

1510
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:35,980
just be killing off whatever you just

1511
01:03:32,949 --> 01:03:37,529
spent money on the the databases that

1512
01:03:35,980 --> 01:03:39,550
they've built for this pesticide

1513
01:03:37,530 --> 01:03:42,700
compatibility with bio controls are

1514
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:44,560
really great but the majority of the

1515
01:03:42,699 --> 01:03:47,199
data is centered around chemical

1516
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:50,529
insecticides much of which are not

1517
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:52,029
permitted to be used on cannabis but

1518
01:03:50,530 --> 01:03:53,830
they're still useful it's definitely

1519
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,240
worth digging into those and and and

1520
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:58,150
getting as much information as you can

1521
01:03:55,239 --> 01:04:01,349
from them what I really want to see in

1522
01:03:58,150 --> 01:04:04,059
the in the next few years is not just

1523
01:04:01,349 --> 01:04:07,449
compatibility as in what will create

1524
01:04:04,059 --> 01:04:10,389
pest mortality but what insecticides

1525
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:11,769
could be a deterrent because there's

1526
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,509
there's you know there's probably like

1527
01:04:11,769 --> 01:04:16,840
neem which is a fantastic in

1528
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:19,630
side-to-side and anti feedings but neem

1529
01:04:16,840 --> 01:04:21,880
has a residual effect that is not

1530
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:24,340
insecticidal per se but it is a

1531
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,780
deterrent or an anti feeding so you

1532
01:04:24,340 --> 01:04:28,240
could spray neem

1533
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:30,730
it's a you spray a soap product or an

1534
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:33,399
oil product the following day it would

1535
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:35,409
be safe to apply predators and but if

1536
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:37,059
you were to spray neem the following day

1537
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:39,099
you could apply pet odors and it

1538
01:04:37,059 --> 01:04:42,400
wouldn't kill them but it might make

1539
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:46,179
them all walk away so it's really up to

1540
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:48,400
up to cannabis producers to apply these

1541
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:50,440
bio controls and observe their habits

1542
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:54,579
afterwards because we really are on the

1543
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:56,230
cutting edge of what what works so

1544
01:04:54,579 --> 01:04:58,599
interestingly enough we talked about

1545
01:04:56,230 --> 01:05:01,059
neem mm-hmm and she said that neem oil

1546
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:04,269
is not her favorite because it will

1547
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:05,679
actually prevent a large majority of the

1548
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:08,349
eggs as some of these beneficial

1549
01:05:05,679 --> 01:05:12,399
predatory mites from hatching so she

1550
01:05:08,349 --> 01:05:14,829
much prefers light paraffin based sprays

1551
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,599
one in particular stuff I'll X I'm

1552
01:05:14,829 --> 01:05:18,279
working with them trying to get set up

1553
01:05:16,599 --> 01:05:20,380
as a distributor with them right now but

1554
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:21,550
their small size containers two and a

1555
01:05:20,380 --> 01:05:23,590
half gallons you know they're really

1556
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:27,300
designed for large-scale commercial

1557
01:05:23,590 --> 01:05:29,800
greenhouses so looking for solutions for

1558
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:31,870
smaller growers is something that we're

1559
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:34,269
currently working on right now and I'm

1560
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:36,369
hoping to have Suzanne give more

1561
01:05:34,269 --> 01:05:39,460
feedback on to how these different

1562
01:05:36,369 --> 01:05:41,139
sprays affect you know various predatory

1563
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:43,360
mites but that's something you can do

1564
01:05:41,139 --> 01:05:45,940
yourself to at home and we can we can

1565
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:48,340
all learn together you know mm-hmm and

1566
01:05:45,940 --> 01:05:50,920
that and that that bang board that she's

1567
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:54,340
recommended like she was her example was

1568
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:56,409
the the lid of the styrofoam cooler that

1569
01:05:54,340 --> 01:05:59,019
the Predators arrived in that's handy

1570
01:05:56,409 --> 01:06:01,089
it's got edges and the fact that it's

1571
01:05:59,019 --> 01:06:03,460
white is crucial because I've

1572
01:06:01,090 --> 01:06:05,079
experienced you know receiving bio

1573
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:07,150
controls in the mail seeing them all

1574
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:09,309
walk around and as soon as I put it on

1575
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:11,019
the leaves of the plant I can't see them

1576
01:06:09,309 --> 01:06:12,730
with the naked eye I could see them when

1577
01:06:11,019 --> 01:06:15,429
they're on the immanent of the container

1578
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:16,840
or on a white piece of paper but once

1579
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:19,329
they're on the green leaf they're

1580
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,130
they're microscopic you really need a

1581
01:06:19,329 --> 01:06:23,049
hand lens to see him at that point so

1582
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:25,960
the bang board is this really it's so

1583
01:06:23,050 --> 01:06:28,780
simple but it's an amazing tool to to

1584
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:30,490
properly scout or monitor that brings up

1585
01:06:28,780 --> 01:06:33,310
another point she says she gives a whole

1586
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:35,919
hour-long talk just on insects suppliers

1587
01:06:33,309 --> 01:06:37,599
because if you depending on where you

1588
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,380
buy it it may go from one person to

1589
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:41,019
another

1590
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:42,940
to another by the time the insects get

1591
01:06:41,019 --> 01:06:44,559
to you they may already be dead

1592
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:46,389
or they may be so stressed out that

1593
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:49,150
they're not gonna want to eat or really

1594
01:06:46,389 --> 01:06:53,469
do anything so you as the consumer needs

1595
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:55,960
to learn how to identify healthy healthy

1596
01:06:53,469 --> 01:06:58,239
insects as they arrive at your facility

1597
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:59,740
so there's really a lot of knowledge

1598
01:06:58,239 --> 01:07:02,139
that goes into this it's quite amazing

1599
01:06:59,739 --> 01:07:02,739
how much you have to know gie is it's

1600
01:07:02,139 --> 01:07:06,069
never-ending

1601
01:07:02,739 --> 01:07:08,139
it's kind of like with with with you get

1602
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:10,120
a you get a package of predatory mites

1603
01:07:08,139 --> 01:07:11,589
the mail and you're trying to count them

1604
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:13,719
like are there a thousand in this

1605
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:15,610
container and I eat and I he's the

1606
01:07:13,719 --> 01:07:16,869
similar the similar technique that I

1607
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:18,970
learned from looking at compost tea

1608
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:20,589
where I'm looking at a looking at a

1609
01:07:18,969 --> 01:07:22,299
viewing area and it's like alright how

1610
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:24,760
many back here in this viewing area is

1611
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:27,700
it is it 50 is it 500 is it a thousand

1612
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:29,770
and so you learn to look at a corner

1613
01:07:27,699 --> 01:07:31,929
like a quarter of that viewing area and

1614
01:07:29,769 --> 01:07:33,280
say okay well there's 250 in that

1615
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:35,259
viewing in that quarter of the viewing

1616
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:38,050
area some of us have a thousand in this

1617
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,820
in this total viewing area and so

1618
01:07:38,050 --> 01:07:42,850
developing these little these little

1619
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:44,289
tricks to quickly count it's kind of

1620
01:07:42,849 --> 01:07:47,019
like if you need to count how many

1621
01:07:44,289 --> 01:07:49,300
leaves on a plant you count a small a

1622
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:51,849
representative section and multiply that

1623
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:53,530
across the square footage so you can so

1624
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:56,079
you can do this sort of observation

1625
01:07:53,530 --> 01:07:58,269
really quickly and come up with pretty

1626
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,130
accurate estimates is it so important to

1627
01:07:58,269 --> 01:08:01,480
identify how many there are just to know

1628
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:03,610
that they're alive and active and

1629
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:07,030
healthy upon arrival I would say you

1630
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:08,620
want to be cool if if you ordered 5,000

1631
01:08:07,030 --> 01:08:11,260
predatory mites then you should be able

1632
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:13,359
to count up close to 5,000 quickly if

1633
01:08:11,260 --> 01:08:16,300
you're only counting about a thousand

1634
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:18,220
it's like well you know I paid I paid

1635
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:20,650
for five files I only got one thousand

1636
01:08:18,220 --> 01:08:24,730
and you know one thousand might be still

1637
01:08:20,649 --> 01:08:27,489
be plenty but those predators if a fifth

1638
01:08:24,729 --> 01:08:29,709
of them no I wish I said yeah a fifth of

1639
01:08:27,489 --> 01:08:31,899
them have already died then the ones

1640
01:08:29,710 --> 01:08:33,550
that are left are starving and they

1641
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,619
probably don't have very much longer to

1642
01:08:33,550 --> 01:08:38,020
live and when we're doing these

1643
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:41,010
biocontrol releases we're not

1644
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:44,680
necessarily us we're not necessarily

1645
01:08:41,010 --> 01:08:46,480
desiring the Predators to naturalize do

1646
01:08:44,680 --> 01:08:51,039
these really short crop cycle is a

1647
01:08:46,479 --> 01:08:53,289
really high value crop and so our

1648
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:55,600
our approach is to release predators

1649
01:08:53,289 --> 01:08:57,699
every week or two or at least every four

1650
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,170
weeks and so we're not counting on them

1651
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:01,269
developing a breeding population we're

1652
01:08:59,170 --> 01:09:04,180
just counting on them having the energy

1653
01:09:01,270 --> 01:09:05,860
and the reserves the food reserves to

1654
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:07,960
walk around for a week or two before

1655
01:09:05,859 --> 01:09:09,250
they starve to death if they're you know

1656
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,720
three days away from starving to death

1657
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,369
then we're not getting our money's worth

1658
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:13,990
that's really interesting cuz that's

1659
01:09:12,369 --> 01:09:15,159
something she talked about that I hadn't

1660
01:09:13,989 --> 01:09:16,960
really thought about but she said you're

1661
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:19,779
right you're not trying to build ecology

1662
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:21,579
for these beneficial mites you want them

1663
01:09:19,779 --> 01:09:23,199
to start to death and she gives an

1664
01:09:21,579 --> 01:09:25,689
example of purr Symbolists needs higher

1665
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:27,519
humidity for their eggs to hatch but if

1666
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:29,169
you're introducing them every week or

1667
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:30,550
every two weeks and it doesn't matter if

1668
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:32,170
their eggs are hatching the adults can

1669
01:09:30,550 --> 01:09:34,270
still do their job so you can't just

1670
01:09:32,170 --> 01:09:35,590
look at that you know the the General's

1671
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:37,120
charts that are out there on

1672
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:39,430
personalists and say this isn't gonna

1673
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:41,739
work in my situation that's where having

1674
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:44,260
that expert is so important I mean her

1675
01:09:41,739 --> 01:09:46,149
knowledge was just incredible I do want

1676
01:09:44,260 --> 01:09:49,119
to get back to what she had to say about

1677
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:50,799
compost tea at the very end of this but

1678
01:09:49,119 --> 01:09:53,979
I want to finish up on the notes that I

1679
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:56,890
do have that from her talk during the

1680
01:09:53,979 --> 01:09:58,329
during the conference itself so she said

1681
01:09:56,890 --> 01:10:01,030
there was very limited research on how

1682
01:09:58,329 --> 01:10:03,909
lighting affects these beneficial

1683
01:10:01,029 --> 01:10:05,319
insects the research still needs to be

1684
01:10:03,909 --> 01:10:09,159
done it didn't seem to be a big

1685
01:10:05,319 --> 01:10:11,409
difference though between HBS and led

1686
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:13,119
she said in natural light like in a

1687
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:15,099
greenhouse you want your sticky cards

1688
01:10:13,119 --> 01:10:16,840
facing south to get optimal collection

1689
01:10:15,100 --> 01:10:19,120
we don't know what that is in an indoor

1690
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:21,010
room she said the research isn't there

1691
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:22,119
yet but I had never thought about that I

1692
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:23,920
did did you know that you're supposed to

1693
01:10:22,119 --> 01:10:25,869
have your your sticky cards facing south

1694
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,430
no that never even occurred to me but it

1695
01:10:25,869 --> 01:10:29,529
makes perfect sense yeah you get the

1696
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:31,060
most light from the south if you're in

1697
01:10:29,529 --> 01:10:32,859
North America I should probably specify

1698
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:35,740
that if you're in the you know northern

1699
01:10:32,859 --> 01:10:38,339
hemisphere yeah we're very what do you

1700
01:10:35,739 --> 01:10:41,829
call it northern hemisphere topic

1701
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:44,980
centric yeah centric northern hemisphere

1702
01:10:41,829 --> 01:10:47,680
centric but in the sticky cards the

1703
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:50,649
sticky cards do trap a fair amount of

1704
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:53,409
pests but they're not really they're not

1705
01:10:50,649 --> 01:10:56,529
they're not created or marketed as a

1706
01:10:53,409 --> 01:10:58,420
biocontrol to market it as a monitoring

1707
01:10:56,529 --> 01:11:00,699
tool that's why there's a grid on them

1708
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:02,859
so every day or every three days or

1709
01:11:00,699 --> 01:11:04,689
every week however whatever program you

1710
01:11:02,859 --> 01:11:06,250
develop you count

1711
01:11:04,689 --> 01:11:09,519
and the squares were useful is you don't

1712
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:11,710
account every single bug on the card you

1713
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:13,540
just count a few squares or a

1714
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:17,310
representative amount of squares and you

1715
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:19,510
can monitor what your pest pressure is

1716
01:11:17,310 --> 01:11:22,800
that's what they're for if you're trying

1717
01:11:19,510 --> 01:11:24,880
to catch pests with sticky with a sticky

1718
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:26,650
product then you should be using a

1719
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,230
sticky banner which is you know I got

1720
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:31,509
three inch wide by thousand foot long

1721
01:11:29,229 --> 01:11:34,329
roll which is really cost effective and

1722
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,920
easy to string up between stocks yeah I

1723
01:11:34,329 --> 01:11:38,109
have that on the website it is really

1724
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:40,029
it's really easy to use let me touch on

1725
01:11:38,109 --> 01:11:42,339
the last few points and then I want to

1726
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:44,109
talk a little bit about compost tea so a

1727
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:46,500
couple of our notes that she had was

1728
01:11:44,109 --> 01:11:48,488
aureus which is the pirate bug I believe

1729
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:51,369
she was talking about how they have

1730
01:11:48,488 --> 01:11:53,109
banker plants with pollen because they

1731
01:11:51,369 --> 01:11:55,510
need the pollen to survive and you can

1732
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:57,549
buy the pollen now but really you can

1733
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:58,659
grow the plants that they will so

1734
01:11:57,550 --> 01:12:00,010
they'll go out there and eat then

1735
01:11:58,659 --> 01:12:03,189
they'll come back to the pollen and

1736
01:12:00,010 --> 01:12:05,500
that's how you keep them keep them alive

1737
01:12:03,189 --> 01:12:07,359
in your greenhouse and the best plant

1738
01:12:05,500 --> 01:12:09,369
she said is a pepper variety called

1739
01:12:07,359 --> 01:12:11,729
purple flash and they're able to grow

1740
01:12:09,369 --> 01:12:13,420
the highest amounts of aureus using that

1741
01:12:11,729 --> 01:12:16,629
which I thought was really interesting

1742
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:19,000
and then the last thing was that she

1743
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:20,650
loves the slow release sachets she

1744
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,750
thinks they're great oh they're so cool

1745
01:12:20,649 --> 01:12:23,859
a lot of times these sachets you know

1746
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:26,109
that we were saying that you want your

1747
01:12:23,859 --> 01:12:30,069
bugs to be fresh and not about to starve

1748
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:32,170
to death because they can be fasting for

1749
01:12:30,069 --> 01:12:34,840
I don't know exactly how much but I know

1750
01:12:32,170 --> 01:12:36,760
two to four weeks they can be without a

1751
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:40,920
food source and still stay alive and

1752
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:46,239
keep on looking for looking for prey and

1753
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:49,449
the pepper plant as as a pollen source

1754
01:12:46,238 --> 01:12:52,269
for your predators is great especially

1755
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:55,029
because pepper plants are you know broad

1756
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:57,160
mites love pepper plants and in my

1757
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:58,539
observation I've seen broad you know

1758
01:12:57,159 --> 01:13:00,460
typically broad mites are found in the

1759
01:12:58,539 --> 01:13:03,729
lower side of the leaf but on pepper

1760
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:06,789
plants I find them in in relatively

1761
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:09,218
similar levels on the top side and the

1762
01:13:06,789 --> 01:13:10,779
bottom side of the leaf and it's when

1763
01:13:09,219 --> 01:13:13,210
you're putting a pepper leaf under the

1764
01:13:10,779 --> 01:13:15,039
microscope it's easier it's much easier

1765
01:13:13,210 --> 01:13:16,270
to look at a pepper leaf then I just

1766
01:13:15,039 --> 01:13:17,979
look at a cannabis leaf and you're

1767
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:18,619
scouting and the broad mites are

1768
01:13:17,979 --> 01:13:20,750
attracted

1769
01:13:18,618 --> 01:13:24,229
plant look at the top of the bottom and

1770
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:26,179
so it's a great indicator plant also for

1771
01:13:24,229 --> 01:13:28,669
certain pests I gotta say I learned so

1772
01:13:26,179 --> 01:13:31,969
much from her in that one hour talk and

1773
01:13:28,670 --> 01:13:33,679
I learned how much I don't know which is

1774
01:13:31,969 --> 01:13:36,170
great I love learning new things so that

1775
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:39,408
was really exciting so as a side note

1776
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:42,380
I've sort of been wooing her to try and

1777
01:13:39,408 --> 01:13:44,089
come on this podcast and hopefully

1778
01:13:42,380 --> 01:13:46,429
hopefully we'll still get there she

1779
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:48,250
hasn't said no or anything so I'm hoping

1780
01:13:46,429 --> 01:13:51,289
to follow up and maybe get her on here

1781
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:52,520
live but one of the things she said she

1782
01:13:51,289 --> 01:13:55,130
went to our website and she started

1783
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:57,860
looking at compost tea and her initial

1784
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:59,659
thought there was which is totally valid

1785
01:13:57,859 --> 01:14:01,039
I want to say is that compost eat

1786
01:13:59,658 --> 01:14:04,098
there's enough peer-reviewed science

1787
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:05,539
around it and so she doesn't promote it

1788
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:07,340
with growers and she doesn't like them

1789
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:09,529
to use it because we don't know

1790
01:14:07,340 --> 01:14:10,940
everything that all the effects of

1791
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:12,710
compost tea and she brought up some

1792
01:14:10,939 --> 01:14:14,629
really valid points from a scientific

1793
01:14:12,710 --> 01:14:17,630
perspective because you know we're

1794
01:14:14,630 --> 01:14:19,639
trying to be science-based in what we do

1795
01:14:17,630 --> 01:14:21,770
we're trying to use research and data to

1796
01:14:19,639 --> 01:14:23,929
drive the decisions that we make we're

1797
01:14:21,770 --> 01:14:25,400
not out here to try and sell and promote

1798
01:14:23,929 --> 01:14:27,260
snake oil or things that aren't

1799
01:14:25,399 --> 01:14:29,059
necessary or don't work I mean we all

1800
01:14:27,260 --> 01:14:30,679
there's plenty of research out there

1801
01:14:29,060 --> 01:14:33,949
supporting the use of compost and

1802
01:14:30,679 --> 01:14:36,800
there's plenty research supporting the

1803
01:14:33,948 --> 01:14:39,049
role of microorganisms in soil but there

1804
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,579
aren't a lot of good peer-reviewed

1805
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:41,659
studies or really anything out there

1806
01:14:40,579 --> 01:14:44,929
that I've seen that's definitive

1807
01:14:41,658 --> 01:14:45,948
regarding compost tea mm-hmm and I have

1808
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:47,179
some thoughts on this but there's

1809
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:50,928
anything you want to add before I

1810
01:14:47,179 --> 01:14:53,179
comment I mean I know I know the problem

1811
01:14:50,929 --> 01:14:55,849
with people's problem with compost tea

1812
01:14:53,179 --> 01:14:58,579
is is people as tall as biochar and that

1813
01:14:55,849 --> 01:15:01,279
there's not there's not a good science

1814
01:14:58,579 --> 01:15:03,649
to support the use of compost to your

1815
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:05,509
biochar and the reason is not that

1816
01:15:03,649 --> 01:15:08,479
compost tea and biochar don't work it's

1817
01:15:05,510 --> 01:15:12,650
that how the compost tea or the biochar

1818
01:15:08,479 --> 01:15:13,848
is created and that's so variable and I

1819
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:16,129
think that's why we've done good science

1820
01:15:13,849 --> 01:15:18,230
on it disagree with you there actually

1821
01:15:16,130 --> 01:15:21,349
was just talking with Rennell Anderson

1822
01:15:18,229 --> 01:15:23,059
over it black owl biochar and they

1823
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:25,760
actually are coming out with some really

1824
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:27,830
good research research from Cornell and

1825
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:30,560
some of these AG universities that she's

1826
01:15:27,829 --> 01:15:32,399
hopefully able to share share with me so

1827
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:33,750
in that regard I think

1828
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,019
Charts a little further along because

1829
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:38,039
they can produce it more consistently if

1830
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,840
you know in her case where they're

1831
01:15:38,039 --> 01:15:41,550
they're using something called virgin

1832
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:45,270
forest slash which is the leftover

1833
01:15:41,550 --> 01:15:48,900
debris after they log an area and that

1834
01:15:45,270 --> 01:15:51,150
stuff is oh it's a potential Jane danger

1835
01:15:48,899 --> 01:15:52,948
because it could catch fire and create a

1836
01:15:51,149 --> 01:15:55,738
fire hazard and they're able to

1837
01:15:52,948 --> 01:15:58,289
sequester the carbon and create a usable

1838
01:15:55,738 --> 01:16:00,658
product by burning it in these you know

1839
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:02,158
pyro lysing it in these kilns so all

1840
01:16:00,658 --> 01:16:04,889
I'll talk more about biochar with her

1841
01:16:02,158 --> 01:16:06,689
but the big issue I see with compost tea

1842
01:16:04,890 --> 01:16:10,289
is is something you touched on there

1843
01:16:06,689 --> 01:16:12,479
that it's inconsistent we're not getting

1844
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:14,210
the same batch of tea every time in fact

1845
01:16:12,479 --> 01:16:16,589
we're not even getting the same batch

1846
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:18,750
depending on how long we brew for so

1847
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:21,420
that brewing cycle can determine if we

1848
01:16:18,750 --> 01:16:24,960
have in excess of bacteria if we have an

1849
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:27,480
excess of Silius or protozoa flageolets

1850
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:30,779
it's just not going to be consistent so

1851
01:16:27,479 --> 01:16:32,669
any real research on that it's gonna be

1852
01:16:30,779 --> 01:16:35,609
hard to have good controls and the ones

1853
01:16:32,670 --> 01:16:37,770
I've seen really haven't done that her

1854
01:16:35,609 --> 01:16:40,529
other concern was also pathogens in

1855
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:42,150
compost tea things like e.coli

1856
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:44,309
Salmonella and there has been some

1857
01:16:42,149 --> 01:16:45,809
research in that regard but again you

1858
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:48,840
can make compost tea wrong and the

1859
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:50,909
potential is there for pathogens and the

1860
01:16:48,840 --> 01:16:53,159
potential is there for you know

1861
01:16:50,908 --> 01:16:54,479
something that may not be as helpful in

1862
01:16:53,158 --> 01:16:56,579
terms of increasing your nutrient

1863
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:57,658
cycling and plant growth I thought it

1864
01:16:56,579 --> 01:17:00,448
was an interesting point that she

1865
01:16:57,658 --> 01:17:02,099
brought up and I love that she was just

1866
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:05,129
very honest and frank with me about her

1867
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:07,440
opinions which I can totally respect but

1868
01:17:05,130 --> 01:17:09,359
I do see a lot of benefit to compost tea

1869
01:17:07,439 --> 01:17:11,460
and I think there are cases where it's

1870
01:17:09,359 --> 01:17:13,049
it's definitely worthwhile but we do

1871
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:14,069
need more trials and Studies on things

1872
01:17:13,050 --> 01:17:17,670
like this for sure

1873
01:17:14,069 --> 01:17:20,189
so I feel like your approach to compost

1874
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:23,908
tea is assuring the compost tea is

1875
01:17:20,189 --> 01:17:25,710
aerobic and that excludes pathogens so

1876
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:27,299
if there's all these different people

1877
01:17:25,710 --> 01:17:31,189
using different compost sources and

1878
01:17:27,300 --> 01:17:33,840
compost tea brewers what do you think

1879
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:36,719
determines whether a compost tea is safe

1880
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:38,520
or not safe so there's a few steps there

1881
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:40,408
one of them is yes maintaining that

1882
01:17:38,520 --> 01:17:42,239
oxygen levels high enough but things

1883
01:17:40,408 --> 01:17:43,649
like e.coli are facultative anaerobes

1884
01:17:42,238 --> 01:17:45,928
there in the soil they're everywhere we

1885
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:46,349
need to be aware of that and so we need

1886
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:51,239
to

1887
01:17:46,350 --> 01:17:53,130
use a compost source that is safe so for

1888
01:17:51,239 --> 01:17:55,710
us that means something that's not

1889
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:57,480
manure based though you could in theory

1890
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:59,189
use manure based compost if they were

1891
01:17:57,479 --> 01:18:01,199
fully composted but it's a little

1892
01:17:59,189 --> 01:18:03,299
riskier because we're talking about a

1893
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:06,269
compost pile that's massive and trying

1894
01:18:03,300 --> 01:18:08,369
to eliminate a bacterias it's really

1895
01:18:06,270 --> 01:18:10,470
really pretty challenging but it has to

1896
01:18:08,369 --> 01:18:13,500
all generate a you know a temperature of

1897
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:15,240
a heat above 131 degrees so for us it's

1898
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:17,430
a matter of having clean inputs and

1899
01:18:15,239 --> 01:18:18,989
controlling that and then controlling

1900
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:21,150
our oxygen levels and make sure we're

1901
01:18:18,989 --> 01:18:23,510
not overwhelming our compost tea brew or

1902
01:18:21,149 --> 01:18:26,039
with too many food sources so that the

1903
01:18:23,510 --> 01:18:29,340
microorganisms are reproducing at a rate

1904
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:30,960
that we can control so there is some

1905
01:18:29,340 --> 01:18:32,190
science involved and her other thing was

1906
01:18:30,960 --> 01:18:33,449
when we were talking about this is she's

1907
01:18:32,189 --> 01:18:34,710
like a lot of the growers I work with

1908
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:36,090
you know they're not they're not that

1909
01:18:34,710 --> 01:18:37,500
science minded they're not gonna do all

1910
01:18:36,090 --> 01:18:40,770
of these things it's not a safe

1911
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:42,329
technology for her to recommend based on

1912
01:18:40,770 --> 01:18:44,970
the fact that there are all of these

1913
01:18:42,329 --> 01:18:46,470
other variables it was an interesting

1914
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,300
point and not one that I had thought

1915
01:18:46,470 --> 01:18:50,310
about as a perspective in a long time

1916
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:52,050
because it's I've been you know so

1917
01:18:50,310 --> 01:18:54,240
narrowly focused in this industry and

1918
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:56,699
seen compost tea as a beneficial

1919
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:57,689
technology for so long but she brought

1920
01:18:56,699 --> 01:19:00,119
up a really good point

1921
01:18:57,689 --> 01:19:01,649
yeah was there anything else you wanted

1922
01:19:00,119 --> 01:19:05,309
to touch on regarding this conference

1923
01:19:01,649 --> 01:19:09,359
that really sparked your interest or got

1924
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:13,710
you excited you know the the the part

1925
01:19:09,359 --> 01:19:15,479
that is most most like how do I say it

1926
01:19:13,710 --> 01:19:18,810
the most exciting to me and the most

1927
01:19:15,479 --> 01:19:21,500
affirming to me is that all of these

1928
01:19:18,810 --> 01:19:24,810
different technological advancements are

1929
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:27,000
interdependent that we have to have we

1930
01:19:24,810 --> 01:19:31,170
have to utilize high-tech lighting in

1931
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:33,210
high-tech HVAC and and and use the the

1932
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:35,460
the latest utilize the latest science

1933
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:37,439
and bio controls and put all these

1934
01:19:35,460 --> 01:19:39,859
things together if we're gonna have a

1935
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:41,939
sustainable agricultural paradigm

1936
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:45,179
especially if we're gonna do it indoors

1937
01:19:41,939 --> 01:19:47,000
and I love indoor agriculture I love

1938
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:50,760
controlled environment agriculture and

1939
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:54,270
the inspiring thing about this

1940
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:56,430
conference was realizing that this I

1941
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:59,580
that it is affirmed to me that this

1942
01:19:56,430 --> 01:19:59,850
truly is the future of agriculture where

1943
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:02,149
we

1944
01:19:59,850 --> 01:20:05,310
increase yields a great amount and

1945
01:20:02,149 --> 01:20:08,549
create food and medicine for ourselves

1946
01:20:05,310 --> 01:20:10,470
in a much smaller amount of space so

1947
01:20:08,550 --> 01:20:14,690
they don't have to continually or

1948
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:18,060
continue to cut down the forest and

1949
01:20:14,689 --> 01:20:21,809
destroy or degrade more lands in order

1950
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:25,590
to provide for ourselves and so it it

1951
01:20:21,810 --> 01:20:27,500
kind of confirmed with me that this

1952
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:33,949
technological approach to agriculture

1953
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:36,119
will be a large part of the solution to

1954
01:20:33,949 --> 01:20:38,579
sustainable human settlement you know

1955
01:20:36,119 --> 01:20:41,099
that's a really good point for me the

1956
01:20:38,579 --> 01:20:42,869
thing I was most excited about was just

1957
01:20:41,100 --> 01:20:46,860
the amount of smart people in one room

1958
01:20:42,869 --> 01:20:48,119
there were all all focused on

1959
01:20:46,859 --> 01:20:50,189
horticulture I mean the amount of

1960
01:20:48,119 --> 01:20:53,399
growing knowledge in that room was

1961
01:20:50,189 --> 01:20:54,989
incredible was mind-blowing and the fact

1962
01:20:53,399 --> 01:20:57,479
that so many of the people there were

1963
01:20:54,989 --> 01:21:00,059
open minded to hearing different points

1964
01:20:57,479 --> 01:21:02,279
of view and all the different styles of

1965
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:05,340
cultivation I mean we had organic guys

1966
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:07,199
we had hydro guys we had HVAC guys and

1967
01:21:05,340 --> 01:21:10,529
everyone was a really a specialist and

1968
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:13,500
an expert in their own little part of

1969
01:21:10,529 --> 01:21:15,630
the industry and fairly successful at it

1970
01:21:13,500 --> 01:21:18,119
it was just really exciting to me to see

1971
01:21:15,630 --> 01:21:19,560
because there was no as they talked

1972
01:21:18,119 --> 01:21:21,359
about there was no secret sauce there

1973
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:23,280
there was no one selling you know

1974
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:24,929
particularly bottled nutrient brands

1975
01:21:23,279 --> 01:21:27,779
they wouldn't survive in a room like

1976
01:21:24,930 --> 01:21:30,300
that because those growers just don't

1977
01:21:27,779 --> 01:21:31,649
have the have the time or energy to deal

1978
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,239
with those kinds of those kind of

1979
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:35,309
companies they can't afford to use those

1980
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:36,449
kinds of products and they're you know

1981
01:21:35,310 --> 01:21:37,590
frankly they're smart enough that they

1982
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:40,199
that they can figure it out for

1983
01:21:37,590 --> 01:21:41,880
themselves it's great to see it's great

1984
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:44,250
to see that level of involvement in

1985
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:46,710
energy all in one room I had I had a

1986
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:50,279
great time yeah I've never been around

1987
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:53,460
so many people who are leaders in their

1988
01:21:50,279 --> 01:21:55,920
field who are so unassuming it was it

1989
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:58,140
was amazing that there is just a lack of

1990
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:00,119
ego in the room yeah that's a really

1991
01:21:58,140 --> 01:22:02,340
good point yeah people were so

1992
01:22:00,119 --> 01:22:03,779
open-minded and friendly and I love

1993
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:07,020
being able to go up and ask a question

1994
01:22:03,779 --> 01:22:09,059
and not not feel stupid for not knowing

1995
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:11,310
the answer you know and these were like

1996
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:13,110
you know people with PhDs people who had

1997
01:22:11,310 --> 01:22:15,000
been growing for 20 years

1998
01:22:13,109 --> 01:22:17,759
people are running million-dollar

1999
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:19,738
facilities really really cool one last

2000
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:21,210
thing I want to ask you if you want to

2001
01:22:19,738 --> 01:22:24,118
touch on it or not is I know you were

2002
01:22:21,210 --> 01:22:27,239
doing a trial recently that you were

2003
01:22:24,118 --> 01:22:29,729
kind of overseeing using the LED

2004
01:22:27,238 --> 01:22:32,519
lighting the fluence lights and beds

2005
01:22:29,729 --> 01:22:35,669
sort of this proof of concept that we

2006
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:38,670
saw from David with living soils under

2007
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:39,779
LED lighting in a bed can you talk a

2008
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:42,060
little bit about what some of your

2009
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:44,250
preliminary results were and what you

2010
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:46,289
were comparing I know the kiss law was

2011
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:48,029
one of the was one of the three beds you

2012
01:22:46,289 --> 01:22:50,279
were used yeah the data is still coming

2013
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:53,069
in on it so I don't want to I don't want

2014
01:22:50,279 --> 01:22:56,189
to be too firm in the numbers but we're

2015
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:58,649
we're getting data like 16 square foot

2016
01:22:56,189 --> 01:23:01,469
section by 16 square foot section which

2017
01:22:58,649 --> 01:23:03,149
is commonly referred to as a light even

2018
01:23:01,469 --> 01:23:05,550
though you know 16 square feet is a

2019
01:23:03,149 --> 01:23:08,219
light typically but even though we're

2020
01:23:05,550 --> 01:23:12,210
using more LED fixtures than that per

2021
01:23:08,219 --> 01:23:14,279
square foot but we're the comparison was

2022
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:18,300
between kiss soil and a couple of other

2023
01:23:14,279 --> 01:23:25,229
water only soils and seeing anywhere

2024
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:27,239
from 37 to 75 gram per square foot which

2025
01:23:25,229 --> 01:23:30,899
is just amazing you know depending on

2026
01:23:27,238 --> 01:23:33,809
cultivar 37 to 75 grams per square foot

2027
01:23:30,899 --> 01:23:37,460
and 70 grand 5 grams per square foot

2028
01:23:33,810 --> 01:23:41,690
under these LED lighting LED lights is

2029
01:23:37,460 --> 01:23:43,980
about 1.75 grams per watt so it's just

2030
01:23:41,689 --> 01:23:46,529
it's just amazing you know I mean the

2031
01:23:43,979 --> 01:23:49,709
yields are fantastic and the efficiency

2032
01:23:46,529 --> 01:23:51,988
is it's amazing and the cannabis looks

2033
01:23:49,710 --> 01:23:55,020
good I mean I haven't seen the final

2034
01:23:51,988 --> 01:23:57,238
product myself the you know the I

2035
01:23:55,020 --> 01:24:00,150
haven't got any cannabinoid terpenoid

2036
01:23:57,238 --> 01:24:03,299
tests done yet but look of it the try

2037
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:07,379
comp density is superb and the nose on

2038
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:09,449
it is amazing so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm

2039
01:24:07,380 --> 01:24:11,368
more than pleased but there's a result

2040
01:24:09,448 --> 01:24:14,129
I'm kind of blown away by it and I don't

2041
01:24:11,368 --> 01:24:16,439
even want to I feel I feel weird

2042
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:17,850
presenting the data before it's all in

2043
01:24:16,439 --> 01:24:20,069
because I want to be really clear about

2044
01:24:17,850 --> 01:24:22,380
like what strain yielded what per square

2045
01:24:20,069 --> 01:24:25,289
foot but the numbers coming in so far

2046
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:26,609
are some of the best I've seen all right

2047
01:24:25,289 --> 01:24:28,050
we'll just tease that then for

2048
01:24:26,609 --> 01:24:32,069
future episode we won't give it all the

2049
01:24:28,050 --> 01:24:33,600
way her it's coming well thanks John I
