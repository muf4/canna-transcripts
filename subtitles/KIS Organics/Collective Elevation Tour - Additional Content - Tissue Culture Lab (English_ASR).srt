1
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,798
yeah so as you can imagine this is the

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,839
most sterile environment on the property

3
00:00:12,798 --> 00:00:19,000
so our head of extraction uh he went to

4
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,600
MSU and got his uh plant science degree

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:26,000
um so he kind of started off with this

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,640
but then you know he as the company grew

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,320
you know we got he got pulled more into

8
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,679
the extraction side and there wasn't a

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,840
whole lot of time for him to do this so

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:39,960
um probably a few months ago we just uh

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,680
hired a girl from MSU um with a plant

12
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,120
biology degree so she's kind of coming

13
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:47,960
in under the his ropes and he's kind of

14
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:49,679
teaching her all the nuances of the disy

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,960
culture lab and she's kind of running

16
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:54,399
with it right now so we're excited to

17
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,759
actually you know get somebody in here

18
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,198
who has the time and you know knowledge

19
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:02,238
so is the main purpose uh just to speed

20
00:01:00,198 --> 00:01:04,399
up your propagation or is it to get

21
00:01:02,238 --> 00:01:06,079
cleaner cleaner are you trying to

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,439
cleaner plants address something in

23
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:10,959
particular yeah um so I would say

24
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:13,839
definitely cleaner plants um also kind

25
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:16,359
of like a you know genetic Bank you know

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,759
we there's a few strains that you know

27
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:20,239
aren't selling much at the time being

28
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,920
you know we can kind of keep them on

29
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:26,158
reserve in here for a while until maybe

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,359
one on do another run of it and see if a

31
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,960
great yeah yeah so um but yeah yeah so

32
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:36,920
it's actually you know looking pretty

33
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,919
good um yeah you can inside there

34
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,560
okay this past uh winter and summer um

35
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:54,158
we did some breeding of our own and are

36
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:57,759
really trying to get a strain that um

37
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:01,079
finishes really early um because as you

38
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:04,519
can imaginea Montana you know weather I

39
00:02:01,078 --> 00:02:07,319
mean we can have you know snow in middle

40
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:10,878
of September you know I've seen snow end

41
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:13,120
of August before um so some of our

42
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:15,039
breeding projects we actually harvested

43
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,640
about you know I would say four weeks

44
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:20,679
ago um which was really exciting um for

45
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:22,279
us so how big were the plants uh you

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,280
know they're they're nice you know they

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,080
weren't huge but you know and some we

48
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,360
started a little bit later than others

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,040
you know some were about this big and

50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,760
some were about this big that's great

51
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:34,878
yeah so I mean and all that's going to

52
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:37,959
go towards uh just biomass for

53
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:39,759
extraction right now until we kind of um

54
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:41,319
get the ball rolling and kind of get

55
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,079
everything honed in a little bit more on

56
00:02:41,318 --> 00:02:45,238
the genetics side there was uh quite a

57
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,800
bit of

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,319
variation um so yeah so I'm excited for

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:55,680
next summer that'll be cool to kind of

60
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:58,759
hone that in but um yeah all right very

61
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,480
cool thank you TI culture

62
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:05,079
lab that's in a 40ft container out here

63
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:08,318
yep yeah we love the shipping containers

64
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:08,319
out here they're pretty

65
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:12,799
nice
