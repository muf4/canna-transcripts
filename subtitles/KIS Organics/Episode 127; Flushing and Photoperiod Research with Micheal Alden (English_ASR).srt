00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:04,000
director at stairway holding and

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,719
explores methods to improve efficiency

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,920
and productivity in cannabis cultivation

26
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:11,280
he spent the past 5 years as a graduate

27
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,439
research assistant with Dr Jim fost

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,799
studying the flowering physiology of

29
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:18,559
pointus for his Masters and for his PhD

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,480
he studied cannabis at Clemson

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,759
University now on to the

32
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:26,759
[Music]

33
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,719
show Michael thanks for coming on the

34
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:33,438
show today hey TD thanks for having me

35
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:36,640
absolutely I I got to watch your future

36
00:01:33,438 --> 00:01:39,039
cannabis project presentation and I'll

37
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,719
link to that in the in the podcast

38
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,920
episode page but if you could tell us a

39
00:01:41,719 --> 00:01:44,239
little bit about yourself and some of

40
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,399
the research you you started doing that

41
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:49,519
would be great sure yeah absolutely um

42
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,640
so I started I I got my bachelor from

43
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:53,158
the University of Florida in

44
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,759
Horticultural Sciences uh I wanted to go

45
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,240
to graduate school and so I got hooked

46
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:58,959
up with Jim fa here at Clemson

47
00:01:56,239 --> 00:02:00,679
University uh did my Ms on point study

48
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:01,959
research uh Point study of flowering

49
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,039
physiology with photo period and

50
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:06,078
temperature responses and then we kind

51
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:07,920
of rolled that into a dissertation

52
00:02:06,078 --> 00:02:10,478
project with cannabis we had got an

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,199
approval to start growing hemp on the

54
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,680
greenhouse green houses on Clemson

55
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:18,719
campus um in 2020 um and so we wanted to

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:21,000
kind of roll what we were doing with uh

57
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:22,400
poetas already into cannabis but then

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,400
wanted to expand a lot of those things

59
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,400
as well photo period was the first

60
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,039
interest for Gemini starting off the

61
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,239
project and that kind of naturally

62
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:31,878
rolled into asking questions about flush

63
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:35,519
and height control and some other

64
00:02:31,878 --> 00:02:37,439
projects as well so what um what made

65
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,400
you so interested in photo period and

66
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,878
how does that relate to your research

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:45,200
with pointus yeah you

68
00:02:41,878 --> 00:02:46,560
know I remember taking my undergrad like

69
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,399
physiology classes and I always saw

70
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,280
photo period was so interesting and I

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,039
think the professor had Rebecca Darnell

72
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,318
uh took two semesters of flowering phys

73
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:56,878
or plant physiology with her um and she

74
00:02:55,318 --> 00:02:57,958
had a really really interesting way of

75
00:02:56,878 --> 00:02:59,158
just talking about some of the

76
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:01,239
differences that we see with photo

77
00:02:59,158 --> 00:03:03,439
period and just even how the genetic

78
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,280
regulation of flowering and such um with

79
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:09,120
that um that always just was kind of

80
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640
interesting to me and then um with poas

81
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,878
the the project we had gotten started on

82
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:15,119
was heat delay um and that's where it

83
00:03:12,878 --> 00:03:17,959
you know around September when poas will

84
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,680
naturally start flowering um if there's

85
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,200
high temperatures at that time it'll

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,120
delay the flowering which will

87
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:25,959
inevitably result in the points is being

88
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,920
um immature when they need to be shipped

89
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:29,200
out to the consumers so essentially

90
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:30,280
you're sitting on plants that won't get

91
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,798
sold

92
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:35,039
so one thing that we looked at was okay

93
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,319
well you know if you're at September you

94
00:03:35,039 --> 00:03:38,759
photo periods are going to be close to

95
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,598
about 12 hours well what if we lengthen

96
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,959
or sorry shorten the photo period and

97
00:03:40,598 --> 00:03:45,199
lengthen the night length um and so what

98
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
we found eventually was that if you can

99
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,878
overcome a lot of this heat delay by

100
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,759
just providing a longer night length and

101
00:03:48,878 --> 00:03:53,078
so that's just means using blackout for

102
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:54,359
a longer duration than you would now if

103
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,439
you're going under natural day

104
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,640
conditions you know if you don't have

105
00:03:55,438 --> 00:03:58,078
black cloth available then you're kind

106
00:03:56,639 --> 00:04:00,399
of you're stuck with those temperatures

107
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,040
but a lot of point or ornamental Growers

108
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,158
do have black cloth available so you

109
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:07,318
know that was kind of our um end result

110
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:09,878
of That So when you say heat delay are

111
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:12,518
you talking about being too

112
00:04:09,878 --> 00:04:14,359
warm yeah yeah so Greenhouse temperatur

113
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:16,079
is getting around 80 to 90 degrees

114
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,560
during the day especially um and

115
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,199
especially High night temperatures can

116
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
have a detrimental effect on the

117
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,759
flowering initiation that's really

118
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,639
interesting so even if it was still too

119
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,680
warm if you just reduce the amount of

120
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:34,400
light specifically in in terms of photo

121
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,199
period that that really fixed it yeah so

122
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,000
you know if you think about it the with

123
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,120
short day plants as they're going from

124
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,319
long days in the summer to short days in

125
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,079
the uh the winter you know there's this

126
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:45,639
gradual increase in the flowering

127
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:48,879
stimulus that's being produced by these

128
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:50,478
shorter days and so when you're in

129
00:04:48,879 --> 00:04:52,519
September around a 12-h hour photo

130
00:04:50,478 --> 00:04:54,519
period you know there's let's say A you

131
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:57,478
know a level five level five out of 10

132
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:59,240
flowering stimulus being generated well

133
00:04:57,478 --> 00:05:00,800
if that you have high temperatures at

134
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,319
that time then it's going to knock that

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,918
you know that flowering stimulus level

136
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:06,719
maybe to like a three or two right but

137
00:05:04,918 --> 00:05:09,439
if we extend out that pH or if we

138
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,440
shorten that photo period then we we can

139
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:13,240
raise it up to if it's you know nice

140
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:15,319
temperatures maybe to like a nine or a

141
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:16,680
10 like a perfect flowering rate but

142
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,079
then the high temperatures being still

143
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,639
there they'll you know knock it down a

144
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:22,439
little bit so you never eliminate heat

145
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,360
delay entirely by shortening the photo

146
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:25,719
period but you overcome a lot of it that

147
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,720
would otherwise make your plants too

148
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:32,000
late to be shipped in time so what was

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,560
your hypoth is in regards to hemper

150
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:37,160
cannabis and how that might how it might

151
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,478
respond to photo periods because I mean

152
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,639
it's obviously a very strongly

153
00:05:39,478 --> 00:05:46,399
correlated photoperiodic

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,840
plant yeah yeah so you know we knew that

155
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:52,439
um the standard was 1212 for flowering

156
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:54,719
and 186 for vegetative um we were just

157
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:56,079
curious would anything else work because

158
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,080
we had seen that you know using

159
00:05:56,079 --> 00:06:01,240
different photo periods with poetas was

160
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:03,198
having a tremendous effect and with the

161
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,560
the second chapter of my photo period

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,038
research with point is you know we found

163
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:09,800
that once you get past the flower

164
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:11,639
initiation phase the different night

165
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,319
lengths that you can provide um really

166
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:15,478
don't impact flowering too much you can

167
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,039
provide a 10 11 or 12 12h hour photo

168
00:06:15,478 --> 00:06:18,519
period and the flowers are mostly the

169
00:06:17,038 --> 00:06:20,000
same the only thing that changes with

170
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:21,758
the shorter photo period is that those

171
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,598
lower braas are just a little bit more

172
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,800
red a little more Deep In Color um and

173
00:06:24,598 --> 00:06:29,560
so I figured with with cannabis maybe

174
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,639
that some of these varieties that don't

175
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,560
necess flower too well at 12 hours maybe

176
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,960
there's some benefit with going shorter

177
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,918
and we had seen that with sunset with

178
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:39,478
sunset's you know an animal naturally

179
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:40,918
and um if you flower it at 12 it's never

180
00:06:39,478 --> 00:06:42,959
going to be ready in eight weeks to

181
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:44,560
harvest um and so that's that was kind

182
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,038
of what we were interested in and then

183
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,240
also the vegetative side you know we

184
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,079
wanted to see you know is there any

185
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
difference with going to a 16-hour photo

186
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:53,680
period or um you know we know some

187
00:06:51,839 --> 00:06:56,279
indoor Growers are providing 24hour

188
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,560
photo periods inside um you know for

189
00:06:56,279 --> 00:07:00,038
their vegetative propagation or you know

190
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,120
stock plants

191
00:07:00,038 --> 00:07:03,038
yeah let's let's just talk a little

192
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,399
about your experimental design so you

193
00:07:03,038 --> 00:07:06,478
decided to set up this experiment to

194
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:09,399
look at

195
00:07:06,478 --> 00:07:10,598
different you know day lengths I guess

196
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,318
they night lengths how you want to look

197
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:15,519
at it um what what did you decide on for

198
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:18,919
your experiment just to back up a little

199
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:20,639
bit so yeah we've done um five different

200
00:07:18,918 --> 00:07:21,758
photo period experiments but I guess you

201
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,038
know we can just talk about this first

202
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,038
one because the other ones are pretty

203
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:27,439
similar um we just we kind of tweaked

204
00:07:25,038 --> 00:07:30,079
the experiment a little bit the the main

205
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:33,399
idea was that we wanted to we had three

206
00:07:30,079 --> 00:07:35,399
varieties Sunset um OG and tiger and

207
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:36,878
that was because aliceon Justice at the

208
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:38,959
hempline she had provided us with the

209
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,599
genetics and she told us you know these

210
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,918
were three that were clearly different

211
00:07:40,598 --> 00:07:44,598
from each other in the field and so we

212
00:07:42,918 --> 00:07:46,158
wanted to use you know different

213
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:48,719
varieties because if you just use the

214
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:49,719
same kind of same photo period responses

215
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,199
you're not going to get too much

216
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:54,240
differences so you know we want to cast

217
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,038
a wider net um the next thing we did was

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,519
okay we want to provide different photo

219
00:07:56,038 --> 00:07:58,680
period treatments and of course the

220
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,560
question is how you're going to achieve

221
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:02,879
that um because naturally you know if

222
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,800
you think about providing a 10 11 or 12h

223
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,158
hour photo period Then you say well the

224
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,639
12-hour photo period is going to have a

225
00:08:06,158 --> 00:08:10,959
lot more light than a 10hour photo

226
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:13,720
period would so that's true and that's

227
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:15,120
what we did later on in the photo period

228
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,159
experiments where we you know we

229
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,478
compensate or we we expected that we

230
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,959
were going to have different dlis with

231
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:21,719
these treatments but this first

232
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,079
experiment all of the photo periods had

233
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:26,599
the same exact DLI and the way we did

234
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:29,279
that was we had the this green or this

235
00:08:26,598 --> 00:08:30,560
blackout Greenhouse um and we had four

236
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:33,120
benches that we split into these

237
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,000
different zones so all the plants got

238
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,320
supplemental lighting and natural day

239
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,519
sunlight uh for 10 hours every day and

240
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,599
then the greenhouse would close down um

241
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,879
so all the lights would shut off except

242
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,720
for these little bulbs that we had in

243
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:48,000
each of these zones that were separated

244
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:49,560
from each other and so let's say with a

245
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,240
10-hour photo period all the lights

246
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:52,239
would turn off and the bulbs would turn

247
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,759
off right at you know when the

248
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,680
greenhouse closed with the 11-hour photo

249
00:08:54,759 --> 00:08:58,958
period those little bulbs would stay on

250
00:08:56,679 --> 00:09:00,879
for just one more hour right the 12-hour

251
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,359
photo period would stay on for 2 hours

252
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:03,799
and so those little bulbs they were just

253
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,560
enough to keep the plants awake

254
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:09,199
essentially um to stimulate the the day

255
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:10,518
length photo period response um but not

256
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,519
enough to you know create any

257
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:16,278
differences in yield or plant mass or

258
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:19,679
anything like that so so the the

259
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:21,838
differences in photo period length were

260
00:09:19,679 --> 00:09:23,278
controlled just by this little tiny

261
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:24,839
light bulb is what you're saying that

262
00:09:23,278 --> 00:09:28,278
they didn't so they didn't get any extra

263
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,920
light per se really just they weren't

264
00:09:28,278 --> 00:09:33,320
able to really

265
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:37,319
see a night period for quite as long

266
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:38,680
that's okay yeah that's right it's yeah

267
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,760
and so that way you know we could say

268
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:43,278
the 10 and 12-hour photo period for

269
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:45,480
example they had the same DLI now how

270
00:09:43,278 --> 00:09:47,039
did the morphology of the plants change

271
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,720
based on the photo periods that's really

272
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:50,759
what we were more interested in the

273
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,160
morphology the you know cannaboids and

274
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:54,958
all that kind of things yeah and and for

275
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,199
listeners who aren't as familiar with

276
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,958
some of the terms like morphologist

277
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,920
means morphology just refers to like

278
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:03,399
sort of the structure the shape of the

279
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:06,278
plant and and so when you're when you're

280
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:08,278
talking about this one question I had

281
00:10:06,278 --> 00:10:10,480
when you said that you chose uh

282
00:10:08,278 --> 00:10:13,320
cultivars that were all very different

283
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,959
were they different in terms of

284
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:16,760
cannaboid expression were they different

285
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,639
in terms of turfing expression or were

286
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:22,120
they different in terms of like days to

287
00:10:19,639 --> 00:10:23,559
finish or height like what were the what

288
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,839
were these differences that Al and kind

289
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:29,518
of highlighted for you yeah so the I

290
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,320
believe it was primarily pH period

291
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,720
differences um essentially that she

292
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,360
would put these out in the field at the

293
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,480
same time and certain varieties are

294
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,480
flowering you know in August and then

295
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,680
others aren't flowering until maybe late

296
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:45,200
September um you know ready to harvest

297
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:47,559
until October um and so one variety like

298
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,278
tiger uh that one you know Alison had to

299
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:51,199
put supplemental Lighting in the fields

300
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:52,240
even in the summer to keep it vegetative

301
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,079
because otherwise it would just start

302
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,320
flowering under any day length outside

303
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:59,039
that's that's a very handy trait for a

304
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:02,040
lot of Growers around the country

305
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:03,679
country that's cool yeah yes especially

306
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:04,919
if you're in like a tropical area and

307
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:07,199
you have a variety that can kind of

308
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:08,958
flower at you know 16 18 hour photo

309
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:11,839
period you know you can get two three

310
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:15,679
crops a year outside which is you know

311
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,519
tremendous yeah so uh I guess let's

312
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:19,479
let's skip ahead to the results then so

313
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,919
what were your findings based off of

314
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:24,278
this the photo period

315
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:28,360
differences yeah so for the the first

316
00:11:24,278 --> 00:11:29,958
experiment um you we found that the the

317
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,039
the shorter the photo period basically

318
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,879
the smaller the plants were um and so

319
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:38,000
that can be beneficial for a number of

320
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:39,519
reasons um but the the biggest thing was

321
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,759
that we weren't really measuring this on

322
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,600
like a a peret squar basis so we weren't

323
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:45,399
really interested in yield per se we

324
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,079
were just more interested in the the

325
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:51,320
changes in the actual mass of the plant

326
00:11:48,078 --> 00:11:53,278
and so we found that the the plant Mass

327
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:55,000
was lowest at these the shorter photo

328
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:56,720
periods but they also had these really

329
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,078
really compact flowers and the flowers

330
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,200
looked like a lot more mature and

331
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:03,039
welldeveloped like the stigmas were very

332
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,000
orange and brown which indicates that

333
00:12:03,039 --> 00:12:07,679
the you know the infloresence are fairly

334
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,159
developed uh very frosty looking uh

335
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:11,439
versus as you get to the 11 the 11 was

336
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:13,600
pretty much the same but once you start

337
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,000
to get to the 12 or even the 13 you

338
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,560
notice that the inner noes start getting

339
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,958
a little bit bigger the flowers look a

340
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:21,039
little fluffier a little less uh

341
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:23,518
frostiness to them and the stigma start

342
00:12:21,039 --> 00:12:26,000
to become a little more uh White rather

343
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:28,198
than orange and brown uh which would

344
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,120
indicate that the flower isn't quite as

345
00:12:28,198 --> 00:12:31,838
matured as it is at the shorter photo

346
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:34,480
period and then it gets worse and worse

347
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,399
as you go to like 13 14 and up to you

348
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:40,879
know 16 18 like that so the the plant

349
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:43,480
matured faster at shorter photo periods

350
00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:45,679
at 10 hours that was 10 hours was your

351
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,159
Baseline right yeah yeah 10 hours was

352
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:50,000
the shortest period that was your

353
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:52,559
minimum okay so at 10 hours the plants

354
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,399
matured faster but your overall biomass

355
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:57,439
was lower and you didn't really look at

356
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:00,360
yields did you have

357
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,199
a like a hunch on where yields would

358
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,278
land on this were they Landing probably

359
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:06,919
lower yeah so you know the and this

360
00:13:05,278 --> 00:13:08,240
would be a great follow-up experiment

361
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:09,958
moving forward with people that do photo

362
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,639
period research is that you know when

363
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,879
you have these smaller plants at the

364
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,039
let's say a shorter photo period right

365
00:13:12,879 --> 00:13:15,679
you're getting you're getting major

366
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:18,639
electrical cost savings if you're a soul

367
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:20,039
Source grower um you know then if you

368
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,879
have these smaller plants you can't

369
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:23,879
necessarily look at like growing these

370
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:25,799
like you would with you know much bigger

371
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:26,759
plants what the advantage is is that

372
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:28,078
you're going to have these smaller

373
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,799
plants that you can eliminate a lot of

374
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:32,799
trellis netting with and then you can

375
00:13:29,799 --> 00:13:35,439
also put more plants per you know square

376
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:37,479
meter so if you can grow let's say 10

377
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,920
plants per square meter at a 12-hour

378
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,720
photo period well you can probably get

379
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:43,159
14 15 16 plants at a 10-hour photo

380
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,680
period And so those are some of the

381
00:13:43,159 --> 00:13:46,078
Dynamics have to be accounted for I

382
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:49,399
think when you're looking at yield on an

383
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:52,519
area basis that way yeah so with your

384
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:56,519
example there 14 plants instead of 10

385
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:58,000
plants in the same 4x4 space using a

386
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,078
10-hour forward period so you're saving

387
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,480
two hours of electricity every

388
00:14:00,078 --> 00:14:05,559
night to create essentially what you're

389
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:08,360
saying would be possibly the same canopy

390
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:10,838
and possibly close to the same

391
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:12,959
yield just

392
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:14,480
faster because the plants are maturing

393
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:17,198
quicker is that is that kind of what

394
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,600
you're what you're saying potentially

395
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:20,439
yeah and I think with our high control

396
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,440
research you know this is a whole

397
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:25,079
different topic but we found that the

398
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,680
more plants you can fit into a growing

399
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:28,319
area basically the the more yield you're

400
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:30,239
going to get and this is well studied in

401
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,680
many crops you know you can just type in

402
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,198
planting density uh on Google Scholar

403
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:36,120
and you'll find tons and tons of

404
00:14:34,198 --> 00:14:37,958
research on this and so pretty much

405
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:39,959
every other crop in the world is grown

406
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:42,039
at these super high planting densities

407
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:44,758
to maximize Photon capture on an area

408
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:46,759
basis um and so with these bigger plants

409
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:48,600
it's really a lot more inefficient and

410
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:51,039
so by getting your plant smaller with a

411
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,278
shorter photo period you can in increase

412
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:56,278
the uh Photon capture and really overall

413
00:14:54,278 --> 00:14:58,039
I would expect improveed yield but you

414
00:14:56,278 --> 00:15:00,159
know we never did that per se so I don't

415
00:14:58,039 --> 00:15:02,039
want to say that's a anything with that

416
00:15:00,159 --> 00:15:04,240
I've always said it this way and and

417
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:05,319
correct me if it's wrong but it's fairly

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,480
similar to what you're saying but

419
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:10,759
slightly different so in cannabis you'll

420
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,120
have people growing one plant and

421
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:15,399
they'll veg for three months sometimes

422
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:18,120
four months because they need to fill

423
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:19,440
the canopy and there may be plant counts

424
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,320
you know back in the day and then you'll

425
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,759
have other people doing the the sea

426
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:25,000
green style where you put out a whole

427
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,560
bunch of plants um at once to create a

428
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,159
similar canopy and I've always looked at

429
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:32,719
it like it doesn't matter your plant

430
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:35,360
count so much as your canopy your canopy

431
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,079
dictates your yield whether you use one

432
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,959
plant or 20 plants to create that canopy

433
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,958
your yields I would assume would be

434
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,719
comparable if your canopies are

435
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:46,198
comparable though one plant's highly

436
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,800
inefficient because of the amount of veg

437
00:15:46,198 --> 00:15:49,679
time and electricity it requires to get

438
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:52,078
that to create the

439
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,078
canopy is that kind of another way of

440
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:56,439
saying what you're saying or are you get

441
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:59,239
are you saying that like that 20 plant

442
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:02,680
SE green style is going to yield that

443
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:04,919
one plant even with comperable canopies

444
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:06,679
yeah I I would expect that the the sea

445
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:10,399
of green would always out out compete

446
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:12,638
the bigger plant um and the you know the

447
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,039
the thinking too is that with these

448
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,639
smaller plants essentially you're

449
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,399
eliminating so much of that veg time

450
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,919
that you're spending labor to defoliate

451
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:20,679
the plant on the back end right so

452
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,360
you're spending all this time growing

453
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:24,519
all this vegetative Mass to just have

454
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,159
Labor going and strip it all so to me

455
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:27,679
it's like well why not just skip all of

456
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:30,078
that you know start off with much

457
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:31,479
smaller plants and you know maximize

458
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:34,198
your planting density that way and

459
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:36,839
improve your yield um you know I think

460
00:16:34,198 --> 00:16:38,039
you can achieve maybe a similar effect

461
00:16:36,839 --> 00:16:39,920
and I think what you're you're kind of

462
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,519
getting at is like a choot density

463
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:43,399
rather than a planting density you know

464
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:46,198
how many shoots do you have you know

465
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:48,679
throughout a canopy area yeah yeah bud

466
00:16:46,198 --> 00:16:50,078
sites flowers flower SES yeah I think

467
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:51,879
that's a very good way of thinking about

468
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:53,638
it for sure um I think it's a little

469
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:56,159
more challenging with bigger plants to

470
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:58,120
get kind of a flat canopy across the top

471
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:00,120
very uniform uh but you can achieve that

472
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,600
much e easier with uh you know higher

473
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:06,240
density of smaller

474
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:08,919
plants interesting so um were were all

475
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:12,759
the cultivars Fairly similar in their

476
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:15,880
response to this 10hour uh photo period

477
00:17:12,759 --> 00:17:17,558
how did the genetics differ so the the

478
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:20,199
responses were similar but they kind of

479
00:17:17,558 --> 00:17:23,038
shifted a little bit to left or right so

480
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,558
um let's say with sunset sunset really

481
00:17:23,038 --> 00:17:29,319
only flowered uh well at the 10hour

482
00:17:25,558 --> 00:17:31,038
photo period um at 11 the the shoots the

483
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:33,639
inner nodes became a lot more elongated

484
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:35,798
the flowers were really much less mature

485
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:38,038
and um you know they were not acceptable

486
00:17:35,798 --> 00:17:39,879
let's say for smoking quality by uh week

487
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:42,759
eight of the experiment then you got the

488
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:46,600
12 and 12 is like borderline vegetative

489
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:49,119
and then 13 13 to 24 was all vegetative

490
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:51,959
with OG it was flowering pretty well at

491
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:53,639
10 11 and 12 got a little worse at 13

492
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,600
and then by 14 it was basically

493
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,759
vegetative tiger was flowering 10 to 14

494
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:01,119
hours no problem but once you got to 16

495
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:02,679
hours it was actually it was still kind

496
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:05,000
of developing quite a bit of

497
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:07,240
inflorescences along the shoot um but

498
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,480
then you get out to 18 and it's mostly

499
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:11,759
vegetative after that so the

500
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:14,000
similarities between them I'd say is the

501
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:17,240
vegetative end if you provide a 18 to

502
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,599
24hour photo period all the same um

503
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,120
definitely some differences in the

504
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:22,199
intermediate photo periods I don't think

505
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:25,239
anyone would really use anyway like 14

506
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:27,840
through 17 that was definitely some

507
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,519
differences there with the genetics um

508
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:30,879
and then with the the shorter photo

509
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:33,599
periods that you'd be shooting for for

510
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,679
flowering um you know you see a wider

511
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:38,199
Optimum with like tiger OG but sunset uh

512
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:40,720
really required that shortest photo

513
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,960
period And when you're talking about you

514
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,159
know greater inter no spacing more

515
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,759
immature

516
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,880
flowers what week are you looking at

517
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:53,038
this flower to kind of determine the

518
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,919
maturity so we uh terminated every

519
00:18:53,038 --> 00:18:56,440
experiment well we had a couple other

520
00:18:54,919 --> 00:18:57,840
experiments but uh all these photo

521
00:18:56,440 --> 00:19:00,440
period experiments we terminated the

522
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:02,119
experiment on a week eight okay yeah

523
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:04,600
because I was so 56 days after we

524
00:19:02,119 --> 00:19:06,639
started that was one question I had just

525
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:09,918
from thinking about this like

526
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,960
if if uh you had a cultivar that was you

527
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:16,919
know flowering

528
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:19,519
faster at the the 10 hour photo period

529
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:22,080
but you know maybe a little bit larger

530
00:19:19,519 --> 00:19:24,000
biomass at the 12h hour photo period at

531
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:26,759
some point in time I would expect there

532
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
to be uh I would expect those lines to

533
00:19:26,759 --> 00:19:31,279
cross where potentially that 12h hour

534
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,359
photo period could still be superior in

535
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:35,359
just the amount of increased yield that

536
00:19:33,359 --> 00:19:37,158
you may get due to the you know overall

537
00:19:35,359 --> 00:19:38,879
biomass

538
00:19:37,159 --> 00:19:41,880
production I I don't know what are your

539
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,120
thoughts on that yeah so I think from

540
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,880
what we've seen from the experiments

541
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:47,798
we've done is that usually the 12-hour

542
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,039
photo period um and the most the one

543
00:19:47,798 --> 00:19:51,158
I've worked with the most is Southern OG

544
00:19:50,038 --> 00:19:52,640
um it's just you know it's a very

545
00:19:51,159 --> 00:19:55,679
consistent and good variety work with

546
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,919
and doesn't stretch too badly um with OG

547
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,759
it was consistently better yields at 12

548
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,159
hours

549
00:19:58,759 --> 00:20:02,480
as far as flower mass is concerned but

550
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,240
the thing that comes with that is you

551
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,880
get a lot more trim as well right and so

552
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,159
the the amount of you know you could be

553
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,840
getting more flow Mass but if you're

554
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,360
spending a lot more labor to trim all

555
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:14,158
that flower Mass you know is that yield

556
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:16,759
actually you know creating a benefit to

557
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,440
you as a grower um versus potentially

558
00:20:16,759 --> 00:20:19,558
going with a shorter photo period that

559
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,000
would you know you're going to lose a

560
00:20:19,558 --> 00:20:23,038
little mass per plant but you're going

561
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,558
to have a lot less trim and a lot better

562
00:20:23,038 --> 00:20:27,119
quality of a flower than you would at 12

563
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:30,079
and were you pruning or defoliating

564
00:20:27,119 --> 00:20:34,158
these plants during dur the flowering

565
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:36,720
cycle um early on no um for the later

566
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,919
experiments yes um and that was a really

567
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,880
kind of a minimum defoliation um it was

568
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,559
really only removing leaves that were at

569
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,480
the near the substraight line um our

570
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:48,240
usual indication was you know if the

571
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,159
leaf is getting anything less than 50

572
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,319
micro moles then just get rid of it you

573
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,600
know it's not really worth it to keep it

574
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,720
yeah and I realized that like

575
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:56,839
defoliation is tricky because it adds a

576
00:20:55,720 --> 00:21:00,079
whole another variable to your

577
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:02,319
experiment so for researcher who's not

578
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:04,798
necessarily looking to maximize yields

579
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:06,798
that that just adds another variable

580
00:21:04,798 --> 00:21:08,679
that you have to account for yeah so I

581
00:21:06,798 --> 00:21:11,400
can see why you wouldn't want to

582
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:13,640
necessarily remove stuff yeah yeah

583
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:15,559
absolutely we would remove some of them

584
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:17,840
um just and we would do it consistently

585
00:21:15,558 --> 00:21:20,399
for all the plants but uh with growing

586
00:21:17,839 --> 00:21:22,599
in Clemson uh where it's very very humid

587
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,960
in the greenhouse all the time uh some

588
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,038
issues with powdery meal de can be

589
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,679
pretty common um and so defoliating can

590
00:21:26,038 --> 00:21:30,038
help with with some of that absolutely

591
00:21:28,679 --> 00:21:32,159
and and did you see a difference in

592
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:33,960
pester pathogen pressure across these

593
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,440
different photo periods or do you feel

594
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,480
like that wasn't really a factor you

595
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,360
know that's actually a really good

596
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:43,599
question um because my yeah what I'm

597
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:45,278
thinking about is petritis too um

598
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:48,519
because that was inevitable with a lot

599
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:49,720
of our experiments um I can't say off

600
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:51,079
the top of my head but you know what I

601
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:53,960
will look back in some of my photos and

602
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:56,720
I can let you know for sure um okay I

603
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:58,319
would say probably not um I would say

604
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,640
like once you get to like the 13 hour

605
00:21:58,319 --> 00:22:01,960
photo period where they become a little

606
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:03,640
more vegetative um they're kind of more

607
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,558
in that transition zone I'd say yeah

608
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:09,240
they're you know very low risk of having

609
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:11,319
Bettis happen um but if you have really

610
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:14,319
dense flowers which you would at like 10

611
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:18,918
11 and 12 with OG I think it was all the

612
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:21,879
same see I and I I get why you would say

613
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:23,679
that because Bettis likes flowers you

614
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:25,360
know wants to form within that but it

615
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:29,038
wants that area that's not getting a lot

616
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:30,599
of uh air flow for examp a real small

617
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:33,319
microclimate but at the same time I

618
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:36,678
think of a a plant at you know 13 14

619
00:22:33,319 --> 00:22:38,480
hours that inter intermediate period

620
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:39,880
that would be really stressed from you

621
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,319
know all the different hormonal

622
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:43,720
responses it's going through as it's

623
00:22:41,319 --> 00:22:46,240
trying to go back into you know pushing

624
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:49,120
vegetative growth I would think that

625
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:51,759
would make it more susceptible to

626
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:53,839
pathogens as as well just because of all

627
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:56,319
the different physiological changes it's

628
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:58,000
trying to deal with yeah due to photo

629
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:59,678
period I I don't know yeah with the uh

630
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,119
you know the plant isn't necessarily

631
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,798
trying to revert back to vegetative um

632
00:23:02,119 --> 00:23:05,000
which we have done that as well where we

633
00:23:03,798 --> 00:23:06,879
take plants and we put them under a

634
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,519
12-hour photo period for like five weeks

635
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,320
and then we put them back to long days

636
00:23:08,519 --> 00:23:12,558
at like 18 hours that for sure will

637
00:23:10,319 --> 00:23:14,759
stress stress the plants out um but like

638
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:18,519
a 13-hour photo period it's it's just

639
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:20,480
flowering much slow much more slowly um

640
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:22,038
so it's much more gradual and you know

641
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,720
something like Sunset that really wasn't

642
00:23:22,038 --> 00:23:26,359
flowering well at 11 or 12 that's partly

643
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,400
because we Harvest at week eight now if

644
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:30,359
we just let that plant go to like week

645
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,038
12 week 13 it probably would actually

646
00:23:30,359 --> 00:23:33,959
look pretty good but you know that's not

647
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:35,919
acceptable from a a Grower's perspective

648
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,200
to have a a cul of that requires 13

649
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:39,520
weeks to harvest yeah so one other

650
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,240
question I've been wanting to ask you

651
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:44,359
about this experiment too was did you

652
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,599
measure cannaboids or

653
00:23:44,359 --> 00:23:51,399
Turpin and how those might change based

654
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:54,359
on Photo period yeah yeah um and so with

655
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,559
OG that's the one we did the most with

656
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:58,399
um you do see an Optimum a very clear

657
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:01,599
Optimum with these that the 12 our photo

658
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,000
period for OG was was the best and it

659
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:06,359
wasn't even close um the canabo were

660
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,679
lower at the 10 and they got higher at

661
00:24:06,359 --> 00:24:12,399
11 went higher at 12 but then really

662
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:14,440
dropped down at 13 um and so from you

663
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,679
know from an extraction standpoint if

664
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:17,320
you're doing these different photo

665
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:19,640
period treatments you can see which

666
00:24:17,319 --> 00:24:20,960
photo period is clearly the best for you

667
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,278
um if you're growing for flower though

668
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,159
of course there's more considerations

669
00:24:22,278 --> 00:24:27,319
than just the canabo

670
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,799
percentage Yeah though I'm just trying

671
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:32,879
to think of life applications for your

672
00:24:29,798 --> 00:24:36,879
for your experiment it sounds like 12

673
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:40,000
hours is still the ideal spot because of

674
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:42,799
the diversity in cultiv ours or that we

675
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,440
run in cannabis like rarely do I talk to

676
00:24:42,798 --> 00:24:47,119
a grower who's just growing all the same

677
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:50,159
plant in one room and can really play

678
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:51,398
with photo period I mean how would you

679
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:54,039
what do you see as the real life

680
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:56,519
application of This research if any yeah

681
00:24:54,038 --> 00:24:58,679
you know I I think with especially for

682
00:24:56,519 --> 00:25:00,960
an indoor grower soul Source lighting if

683
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:02,640
you have multiple rooms that you can

684
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,399
break your varieties up into these

685
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,038
different photo period responses you

686
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:08,319
know like your Sunset the only flowers

687
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:11,879
well at 10 hours or like an OG that that

688
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:13,038
flowers is good between 10 to 12 um you

689
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,399
know because there I'm sure there are

690
00:25:13,038 --> 00:25:16,798
plenty of varieties like Sunset that

691
00:25:15,398 --> 00:25:19,119
they don't necessarily flower too well

692
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,839
they stretch really bad at 12 hours and

693
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,439
they're probably good genetics but

694
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,079
they're they require a shorter photo

695
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,679
period and that can also play into your

696
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:28,199
breeding uh breeding strategies as well

697
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:30,320
like maybe some of these that don't

698
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,960
necessarily flower well at 12 well maybe

699
00:25:30,319 --> 00:25:34,639
they have some other good um genetics to

700
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,159
breed with and it just takes a little

701
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:38,960
bit shorter photo period to make it good

702
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:41,120
um and I think you know one of the other

703
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,640
benefits is the the electrical cost that

704
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:46,079
goes into it um for for sure that

705
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,559
cannabis scowers are spending a ton of

706
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,000
money at running their lamps and

707
00:25:47,558 --> 00:25:50,319
everything like that so every single

708
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,880
minute those lamps are running is

709
00:25:50,319 --> 00:25:54,278
costing money um and then the you know

710
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,600
the other thing as well is that we saw

711
00:25:54,278 --> 00:25:57,679
with these shorter photo periods that

712
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,278
your your flower to trim ratio is just

713
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,880
is so much higher than it is at a

714
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:03,679
12-hour photo period And so that can

715
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,679
also cut down tremendously on your post

716
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,159
Harvest cost yeah those are all good

717
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,480
points I mean it would

718
00:26:07,159 --> 00:26:12,480
require so so what I'm thinking about

719
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:15,399
when you say this is one most folks run

720
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,720
multiple cultivars but maybe maybe they

721
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:19,038
have those cultivars can have

722
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,679
similarities that could allow you to

723
00:26:19,038 --> 00:26:23,278
start experimenting with this on a

724
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,480
smaller scale and then maybe expand into

725
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:26,759
a

726
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:29,319
room because there are advantages like

727
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:31,720
you said to less

728
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:33,278
trimming faster finish it sounds like

729
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,798
with some of these plants and and

730
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:39,278
obviously the electrical savings but the

731
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:41,398
other thing we I find in commercial

732
00:26:39,278 --> 00:26:44,679
indoor cannabis is that uh you end up

733
00:26:41,398 --> 00:26:47,000
having to switch out your cultivars

734
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,159
quite a bit based on market demand you

735
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,759
know these hype cultivars and it's like

736
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:53,039
by the time you research one and get it

737
00:26:50,759 --> 00:26:55,398
dialed in I bet you're having to kick it

738
00:26:53,038 --> 00:26:57,200
to the curb for something else in a lot

739
00:26:55,398 --> 00:26:58,759
of cases just to stay with the market

740
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,200
which is

741
00:26:58,759 --> 00:27:04,398
frustrating yeah no I totally I totally

742
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,798
empathize with that and um I think

743
00:27:04,398 --> 00:27:07,678
that's I think it's kind of more of a

744
00:27:05,798 --> 00:27:09,200
short-term problem right now it's it's

745
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,919
what the Growers have to deal with now

746
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,480
to make the market work for them

747
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,799
absolutely um will that be the case you

748
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,360
know for years to come I don't think so

749
00:27:15,798 --> 00:27:20,079
I think some of these generics are going

750
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:21,479
to get dialed in as clearly Superior um

751
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:23,480
and ones that you know they'll be in

752
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,240
your 71s you know your standard you know

753
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,558
Southern OG and your pre-roll packs you

754
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,720
know those are going to be the well res

755
00:27:27,558 --> 00:27:30,879
sear ones that are going to be kind of

756
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,798
mass marketed that way but as far as the

757
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,320
you know trying to make new varieties

758
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:36,000
all the time for especially for more

759
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,720
craft Growers I think they're yeah it's

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,798
a it adds a challenge to have to do all

761
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:41,919
these cultivar evaluations and you know

762
00:27:39,798 --> 00:27:44,359
many you know for variety that might

763
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:46,278
only stick around for a few months yeah

764
00:27:44,359 --> 00:27:48,839
I mean it just has me thinking if some

765
00:27:46,278 --> 00:27:51,759
if a breeder was able to come out with a

766
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:56,079
cultivar that had like really good you

767
00:27:51,759 --> 00:27:58,679
know a real good kovar expression and

768
00:27:56,079 --> 00:28:01,038
then um a 10 hour photo period or

769
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,720
something shorter that they could prove

770
00:28:01,038 --> 00:28:05,960
worked really well I could see that

771
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,558
being uh being a huge hit yeah that's

772
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:10,120
that's really exciting very interesting

773
00:28:08,558 --> 00:28:11,798
yeah I could see for sure that some of

774
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:13,719
these breeders you know the like you

775
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:15,319
said the kovar I think that is hands

776
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:18,159
down the best way to classify these

777
00:28:15,319 --> 00:28:19,278
different cannabis varieties um I think

778
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:21,039
eventually people are going to be able

779
00:28:19,278 --> 00:28:22,798
to start patenting these different

780
00:28:21,038 --> 00:28:24,038
varieties and be able to mass Market

781
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:25,798
them to different Growers around the

782
00:28:24,038 --> 00:28:26,599
country and in those regards that's

783
00:28:25,798 --> 00:28:28,960
where you're going to want these

784
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:31,839
cultivar value to show this is how it

785
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,519
performs at 10 hours 11 hours 12 hours

786
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:36,278
and different temperatures as well

787
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:38,759
there's so many variables with genetics

788
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:42,440
um I mean you I know they've discovered

789
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,640
the uh certain genetic markers

790
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,440
associated with powdery mil do now and

791
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,960
resistance which is really interesting

792
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:50,399
I'm sure we'll find out there's ones

793
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,000
related to petritis and other you know

794
00:28:50,398 --> 00:28:54,239
other major pathogens that could make

795
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,359
growing this plant a lot easier over

796
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,240
time so uh yeah I appreciate the

797
00:28:56,359 --> 00:29:00,000
research that you and others were doing

798
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,200
to really push us forward in the

799
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,919
industry yeah it's fun you know it's

800
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:05,679
it's very exploratory for sure and that

801
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,640
was kind of more so the the purpose of

802
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:10,880
us getting into photo period was there

803
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:12,880
was nothing done um I think Ron whiper

804
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,159
had done maybe one study and that was

805
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,760
really just looking at whether plants

806
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,600
stay vegetative at 16 and above um but

807
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:20,119
as far as kind of looking at where are

808
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,639
some of these opportunities that might

809
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:23,398
be there with shorter different photo

810
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:25,278
periods for flowering that's kind of the

811
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:26,759
ground we wanted to break on and uh

812
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:28,200
we're hoping some of this this work that

813
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:30,720
gets out there will inspire more

814
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,558
photopic research in the future yeah so

815
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,278
you mentioned this was sort of a prel

816
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:36,759
like your initial study but then you did

817
00:29:34,278 --> 00:29:40,159
some followup work on this with some

818
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:41,599
further studies or experiments what what

819
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,039
were those and how did those sort of

820
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:47,319
either align with or or maybe not

821
00:29:44,038 --> 00:29:49,839
aligned with the data you already had so

822
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:54,158
the the last photo period experiment

823
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:55,959
that we did um we did a 10 11 and 12h

824
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,840
hour photo period with OG just those

825
00:29:55,960 --> 00:30:01,480
three um

826
00:29:58,839 --> 00:30:03,240
what we found was that um oh I'm sorry

827
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:05,120
so for the 10 11 12 hour photo periods

828
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:08,599
in the previous experiment the DLI was

829
00:30:05,119 --> 00:30:10,319
all the same for this last one the the

830
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:12,199
11-hour photo period would have the

831
00:30:10,319 --> 00:30:14,319
supplemental light the LEDs run for

832
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,759
another hour the 12-hour photo period

833
00:30:14,319 --> 00:30:17,599
would have the supplemental LED stay on

834
00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:19,319
for two more hours right so these three

835
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:21,278
treatments have different DLI and

836
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:23,200
different photo periods so it's a little

837
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:25,480
more difficult to untangle whether this

838
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,480
a photo period or DLI response but it's

839
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,360
a more practical way of looking at itz a

840
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,960
grower is not going to do it the way

841
00:30:29,359 --> 00:30:33,079
that we did our first experiment they

842
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,159
want to know a 10hour photo period plus

843
00:30:33,079 --> 00:30:36,839
10 hours of DLI how does that compare to

844
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:40,360
a 12-h hour photo period plus you know

845
00:30:36,839 --> 00:30:43,678
12 hours DLI um and so what we found was

846
00:30:40,359 --> 00:30:45,240
that the results were you know I guess

847
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:49,038
almost self-fulfilling that of course as

848
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:51,359
you increase your DLI that the the mass

849
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,919
increases right but we found it again

850
00:30:51,359 --> 00:30:54,278
where at the 12-hour photo period that

851
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:56,159
the flowers were a little less developed

852
00:30:54,278 --> 00:30:57,960
than they were at the 11 or 12 or the

853
00:30:56,159 --> 00:31:00,360
the 10 or 11

854
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,038
um and so again this wasn't an area

855
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:04,479
basis so we didn't try to measure the

856
00:31:02,038 --> 00:31:07,079
plants and get well what is the yield on

857
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,240
area basis for 12 hours versus 10 um

858
00:31:07,079 --> 00:31:12,439
just again more observational and

859
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,319
morphology based so for the second

860
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:18,278
experiment just to make just to clarify

861
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:21,319
you ran plants at 10 hours 11 hours and

862
00:31:18,278 --> 00:31:23,960
12 hours and you rather than using a

863
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:26,038
tiny light bulb to extend the day length

864
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:28,720
you actually just let them get a full

865
00:31:26,038 --> 00:31:30,919
amount of light for an extra hour or two

866
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,639
versus that 10 hour Baseline is that

867
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:36,639
right yes exactly and you saw an overall

868
00:31:34,638 --> 00:31:39,359
increase in biomass so the plant was

869
00:31:36,638 --> 00:31:41,719
bigger or produced more leaves and

870
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:44,199
flowers but you said they were it was

871
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:45,159
less mature overall like the flowers

872
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,399
weren't as

873
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:49,039
finished yeah yeah the flowers

874
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,839
definitely were less resinous less

875
00:31:49,038 --> 00:31:53,119
Frosty the stigmas were a little bit

876
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:58,158
more white rather than orange and orange

877
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:59,359
and brown um and the the what was

878
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,240
interesting though with this was that

879
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:02,918
the flower to trim ratio like how much

880
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,960
flowers and how much trim you had around

881
00:32:02,919 --> 00:32:08,159
those influences were actually fairly

882
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:10,000
similar um so it seems like with the the

883
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:11,519
earlier experiments where we were just

884
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,119
more so stimulating the photo period

885
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:17,200
response that there's um you know a lot

886
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:18,918
more mass I guess uh more Leaf

887
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,639
production more trim production and the

888
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:22,120
flowers were just smaller but in this

889
00:32:20,638 --> 00:32:23,519
scenario we're providing more light

890
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:26,038
those flowers actually kind of got

891
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:27,558
bigger as well with the trim um and so

892
00:32:26,038 --> 00:32:29,679
our flower to trim was almost identical

893
00:32:27,558 --> 00:32:31,759
from 1011 to 12 which is

894
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:34,600
interesting that is really interesting

895
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:36,759
it but it kind of aligns with uh the

896
00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:39,879
work the work by uh Bruce bugby in the

897
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:42,759
sense that the the more light you give a

898
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:46,080
plant being these are highlight

899
00:32:42,759 --> 00:32:47,759
plants just the more biomass it produces

900
00:32:46,079 --> 00:32:48,678
it seems to be able to handle light

901
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,440
quite

902
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:51,440
efficiently I don't know if you have any

903
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,759
thoughts on

904
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,200
that yeah no absolutely um I think a lot

905
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,919
of what we started transitioning to with

906
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,159
um the photo research and the high

907
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:03,240
control research um was trying to

908
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,240
minimize trim because we understand how

909
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:07,359
how much labor and money is spent on

910
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,519
trimming these plants after the fact so

911
00:33:07,359 --> 00:33:09,638
anything that we can do in the

912
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,359
greenhouse while these plants are

913
00:33:09,638 --> 00:33:14,398
growing to minimize that part of the

914
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:16,359
part of the Harvest um is really what

915
00:33:14,398 --> 00:33:19,839
we're trying to find some value

916
00:33:16,359 --> 00:33:21,479
in and when you say the plants were less

917
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:23,240
mature are we still talking about like

918
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,240
da 55

919
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:29,880
56 range for Harvest yeah yep right at

920
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:31,919
the end of harvest yep um and we did

921
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:33,919
find that the canabo were again the

922
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,240
highest at 12 hours but it wasn't too

923
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:39,200
much higher this time with the with the

924
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:41,200
strictly photo period one um the it was

925
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,480
clearly better at 12 hours which would

926
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:44,440
indicate that there's something about

927
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,639
the 12h hour photo period itself

928
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:49,159
regardless of the DLI that's stimulating

929
00:33:46,638 --> 00:33:51,240
a higher canabo concentration um with

930
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:52,760
this experiment it wasn't as much of a

931
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,159
difference between the 10 11 and 12 but

932
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:58,158
you could see a pretty similar

933
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:59,639
Trend do you think that this this is

934
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:01,120
probably a more esoteric question but

935
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:02,798
like do you think this just relates more

936
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:07,398
to the way these plants have been bred

937
00:34:02,798 --> 00:34:10,960
and cultivated by humans over the last

938
00:34:07,398 --> 00:34:13,759
decades centuries to flower optimally at

939
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,320
12 hours or do you think this is

940
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:18,960
something that is uh relates back to the

941
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,359
genetics of the plant you know

942
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,358
originally yeah so I think it depends on

943
00:34:21,358 --> 00:34:25,598
where the the varieties are coming from

944
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:27,559
um I know there's the the traditional uh

945
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:29,720
you know what people consider the

946
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:30,960
the sativas are the ones that originated

947
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:33,319
from more like

948
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,480
Afghanistan um and then the indicas are

949
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:40,359
supposedly originating from the Hindu

950
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:42,559
Kush areas um or the Hindu areas um it's

951
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:44,559
always called Hindu Kush um and so I

952
00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:46,279
think if it depends on where those you

953
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:48,039
know the the photo period that they're

954
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:50,320
exposed to naturally when they're first

955
00:34:48,039 --> 00:34:52,000
you evolving by themselves and then how

956
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,200
we bred them afterward you know of

957
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,639
course we were mixing them back and

958
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,000
forth so you it definitely will depend

959
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:59,440
on the genetics that you're working with

960
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,559
with the the challenge is trying to go

961
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,358
back in time and say okay well what you

962
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:04,838
know what lineage did this cultivar come

963
00:35:03,358 --> 00:35:07,559
from to understand you know what the

964
00:35:04,838 --> 00:35:08,880
photo period Optimum might be is there a

965
00:35:07,559 --> 00:35:10,880
chance we could eventually discover

966
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,160
there's genetic markers related to photo

967
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:17,640
period that we might be able to identify

968
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:20,358
and and then know how a plant would be

969
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:23,480
optimally grown from a light

970
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:25,960
perspective yeah I I would say I would

971
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:28,079
say yes for sure I I think genetic work

972
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:31,039
can find out but basically anything

973
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,760
anything related to physiology um and I

974
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:35,400
think what I'm thinking is that the you

975
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,880
know some of these differences are just

976
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,039
a classic induction of flowering right

977
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:42,480
the the the leaf perceives the photo

978
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:44,559
period it creates a stimulus it trans

979
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,760
translocates that stimulus from the leaf

980
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:48,719
to the choot Apex and then that stimulus

981
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:52,119
elicits a change in the maristone from

982
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:53,598
Vegeta to flowering um you know that's

983
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,960
just part of the flower initiation

984
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:57,559
process of just making a reproductive

985
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,960
maristone of course there going to be

986
00:35:57,559 --> 00:36:00,559
all sorts of genetic components right

987
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,599
there then you think about the

988
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:04,559
development of the cannaboids and the

989
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:06,000
actual appearance and even like the the

990
00:36:04,559 --> 00:36:07,559
amount that the plant stretches and

991
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,719
things I think of course all these

992
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,279
things are going to be genetically uh

993
00:36:09,719 --> 00:36:13,000
regulated and you know there would be

994
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,400
some serious opportunity to kind of

995
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,599
manipulate every step of the process

996
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,240
yeah yeah was there anything else

997
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,039
related to This research or other photo

998
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,318
period research that you wanted to talk

999
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:26,358
about before we move on to some of your

1000
00:36:23,318 --> 00:36:28,358
other some of your other work sure yeah

1001
00:36:26,358 --> 00:36:30,639
the the one other thing that we really

1002
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:33,239
saw was kind of interesting was with

1003
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,879
sunset um now with sunset really only

1004
00:36:33,239 --> 00:36:36,719
flowering well at the 10hour photo

1005
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,440
period what we also saw is that every

1006
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:41,078
time we would flower sunset at this

1007
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:43,079
10-hour photo period um the leaves would

1008
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:44,880
always get really really purple which

1009
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:46,800
would indicate that phosphorus is being

1010
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,920
mobilized from the leaves up to the

1011
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,760
flowers um and as you mentioned with

1012
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:53,599
Bruce before him and his graduate

1013
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,760
student Mitch West Morland um they put

1014
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:57,640
out the phosphorus paper a couple years

1015
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,200
ago uh showing that essentially if

1016
00:36:57,639 --> 00:37:00,358
you're putting more than 30 PPM of

1017
00:36:59,199 --> 00:37:02,439
phosphorus on your plants you're just

1018
00:37:00,358 --> 00:37:04,039
wasting it at that point um but the

1019
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,599
other thing that they showing is that

1020
00:37:04,039 --> 00:37:08,079
the this response of mobilizing

1021
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,880
phosphorus from the older parts of the

1022
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,920
plant into the growing flowers is a

1023
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:14,000
fairly common response in a lot of other

1024
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,639
species um I'm forgetting them off the

1025
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,838
top of my head but he has them in the

1026
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:20,078
publication um and so we've really only

1027
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,838
saw that with sunset where if you have

1028
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,599
it at the shortest flower or the

1029
00:37:21,838 --> 00:37:25,599
shortest photo period that you are

1030
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:27,720
getting this this what looks like

1031
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:30,440
phosphorous deficiency in the leaves and

1032
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:32,519
what that tells you is that perhaps that

1033
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,720
this is the strongest flowering stimulus

1034
00:37:32,519 --> 00:37:37,119
and this is what's causing the plant to

1035
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,480
hyper uh you know move phosphorus from

1036
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:41,318
the leaves to the flowers uh much more

1037
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,079
aggressively than it does at a short uh

1038
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:45,400
sorry a longer photo period like 12 um

1039
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:47,160
and so there's one part of just looking

1040
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:49,200
at the flowers of saying okay well maybe

1041
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:51,039
these are more compact or less more or

1042
00:37:49,199 --> 00:37:52,519
less Frosty but then also just looking

1043
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:53,838
at the leaves themselves and seeing how

1044
00:37:52,519 --> 00:37:55,318
they're behaving because they're all in

1045
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:57,400
the same fertilizer program so there's

1046
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:59,239
no reason why you know a 10-hour photo

1047
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:01,160
period should be any less you know

1048
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:03,239
healthy than a 12-hour photo period with

1049
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:05,559
the same fertilizer

1050
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:07,799
program sorry I'm I'm just processing

1051
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,000
that that's that's not what I would have

1052
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:13,359
expected to hear so you're you're just

1053
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:17,920
just to reiterate you're saying at a

1054
00:38:13,358 --> 00:38:19,598
shorter DLI 10hour photo period you saw

1055
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,200
phosphorus

1056
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,519
deficiencies being demonstrated on the

1057
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:28,000
plant in the form of like purple purple

1058
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:30,679
stems and that relates to the plant

1059
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:34,119
trying to grow or essentially growing

1060
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:37,719
flowers or maybe sesing faster is

1061
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:39,880
that kind of what you're saying yeah so

1062
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:41,838
the the leaves would get uh what looks

1063
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,920
like phosphorus deficiency and what

1064
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:46,440
Mitch and Bruce have hypothesized is

1065
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,119
that um the the plants are doing this

1066
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:50,760
they're mobilizing phosphorus from the

1067
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,280
leaves to the flowers in order to uh

1068
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:55,319
provide phosphorus to make phytic acid

1069
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,960
which is an energy source for the seeds

1070
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:58,199
now of course that's kind of redund in

1071
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,440
cannabis cultivation because we're

1072
00:38:58,199 --> 00:39:01,919
growing unpollinated plants but it is

1073
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:03,639
interesting to observe that what the

1074
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:06,880
plant can do at the shorter photo period

1075
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:08,559
because of that the you know in nature

1076
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,280
if a plant is having a 10hour photo

1077
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:11,639
period the plant's oh [ __ ] you know

1078
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,359
Winter is right around the corner here I

1079
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,719
need a flower as fast as possible make

1080
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:19,000
seed 12h hour not so much it's still got

1081
00:39:15,719 --> 00:39:21,919
time to grow so this is almost like a

1082
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:25,599
crop steering sort of a approach here

1083
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,920
where you're you're creating a scenario

1084
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:31,519
that for is intentional plant stress oh

1085
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,440
unintentional in this case but um

1086
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:37,440
potentially an intentional response from

1087
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,880
the plant so seeing that you did have a

1088
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:44,358
a noted phosphorus deficiency how did

1089
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,800
that impact the final flower oh the the

1090
00:39:44,358 --> 00:39:48,039
flowers at the Town our photo appeared

1091
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,800
were much smaller for sure um but they

1092
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:52,599
were dense clusters which was

1093
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:54,480
interesting uh very very frosty and

1094
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,519
dense clusters but way way smaller than

1095
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:58,039
the 12-hour photo period um the the

1096
00:39:56,519 --> 00:40:00,639
trade-off though with the 12-hour photo

1097
00:39:58,039 --> 00:40:03,079
period that the the stigmas were pretty

1098
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:06,000
much all white and really underdeveloped

1099
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,160
but that's kind of more unique case with

1100
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,800
uh Sunset that it doesn't flower well 12

1101
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:12,039
hours um I'm sure there's other genetics

1102
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,440
out there that you could probably see

1103
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:15,199
some of these natural phosphorus

1104
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,240
deficiencies which that doesn't mean you

1105
00:40:15,199 --> 00:40:17,799
need to go and dump a bunch of

1106
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:20,078
phosphorus on the plants it means your

1107
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,480
plants are flowering you know kind of as

1108
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:27,960
they should yeah I so I've

1109
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,519
associated purpling with genetics some

1110
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,800
genetics just seem to express that and

1111
00:40:30,519 --> 00:40:34,559
feel free to correct me on any of this

1112
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:36,160
with your own experiences um cold

1113
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:38,920
temperatures cold root temperatures will

1114
00:40:36,159 --> 00:40:42,358
obviously limit phosphorus mobility in

1115
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:44,920
the plants um but you rarely see that in

1116
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:48,400
indoor facilities these days um and then

1117
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:50,760
the other thing is uh what about sort of

1118
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:53,519
a

1119
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:57,240
uh man I'm blanking on the

1120
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:58,920
term the the purpling due to

1121
00:40:57,239 --> 00:41:00,838
the lighting in this case it it wouldn't

1122
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:03,800
apply but high-intensity lighting

1123
00:41:00,838 --> 00:41:05,799
creates uh it's not antioxidant I my

1124
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,640
brain's just not working right now but

1125
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,079
uh you see it with like tomatoes and

1126
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:12,879
things like that that that purple color

1127
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:14,119
there's a term for it and I had it five

1128
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,280
minutes ago but I can't think of it

1129
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:17,440
right now do you know what do you know

1130
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,599
men you're talking about um yeah I don't

1131
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,559
I don't remember the term either but I

1132
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,880
feel like I know what you're talking

1133
00:41:19,559 --> 00:41:23,318
about it it'll come back to me it'll

1134
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:25,318
come back to me it's an

1135
00:41:23,318 --> 00:41:27,400
antioxidant but that's another thing

1136
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:29,159
that essentially coats the le as a as a

1137
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:32,400
plant response as a way of protecting

1138
00:41:29,159 --> 00:41:34,960
the leaf due to the

1139
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,119
Highlight I apologize for uh for

1140
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:38,480
blanking on that anyway wor those are

1141
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,800
all things I associate in my head with

1142
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:41,639
purpling um I don't know if you have

1143
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,400
anything to add to that so but but what

1144
00:41:41,639 --> 00:41:46,239
you're saying is essentially that this

1145
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:47,920
uh this deficiency that you're seeing

1146
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:49,799
with the purple stems is not necessarily

1147
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,599
a negative thing and that the plants

1148
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,400
really rapidly trying to complete its

1149
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:58,400
life cycle yeah essentially yeah exactly

1150
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,079
and it really would only start happening

1151
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:03,680
um I I think about week six so about two

1152
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:05,200
weeks before we Harvest um and so by

1153
00:42:03,679 --> 00:42:07,679
that point all the vegetative mass is

1154
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:09,039
done growing anyway and so really uh

1155
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:11,719
it's going to be mobilizing everything

1156
00:42:09,039 --> 00:42:14,119
from the older growth into the flowers

1157
00:42:11,719 --> 00:42:15,919
um and I think uh Bruce and Mitch will

1158
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:17,440
have some data in the coming months to

1159
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,200
show but they show I think something

1160
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,159
like 30% of the total photosynth

1161
00:42:20,199 --> 00:42:24,039
photosynthetic capacity of the plant is

1162
00:42:22,159 --> 00:42:26,358
coming directly from those flowers which

1163
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:27,318
is which is kind of cool uh cuz you know

1164
00:42:26,358 --> 00:42:28,838
of course the flowers or the

1165
00:42:27,318 --> 00:42:30,759
inflorescences are surrounded by all

1166
00:42:28,838 --> 00:42:32,358
these tiny BRS and those are all you

1167
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:34,520
know capable of doing

1168
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:36,480
photosynthesis so to put this in Growers

1169
00:42:34,519 --> 00:42:37,960
terms your sugar leaves are

1170
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,838
photosynthesizing even though they're

1171
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,039
covered in tricomes and they're actually

1172
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:44,679
producing a significant amount of photos

1173
00:42:43,039 --> 00:42:46,960
that that actually makes sense to me

1174
00:42:44,679 --> 00:42:49,358
because you hear about these these

1175
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,240
methods where people are removing the

1176
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:53,799
vast majority of fan leaves yet the

1177
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:55,679
plants are still yielding pretty well or

1178
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:57,640
even better in some cases so they have

1179
00:42:55,679 --> 00:43:00,399
to be photosynthesizing from somewhere

1180
00:42:57,639 --> 00:43:03,239
so that that kind of you know makes

1181
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:07,200
sense to me yeah yeah it's it's really

1182
00:43:03,239 --> 00:43:08,759
cool uh to think about it and um yeah

1183
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:10,399
I've seen pictures like that where you

1184
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,880
know the whole plant is defoliated but

1185
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,160
they still have you know massive flowers

1186
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,720
on it it's like how the heck is that

1187
00:43:13,159 --> 00:43:17,279
happening um but Nar Bernstein did a

1188
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:18,879
study like this a couple years ago where

1189
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,960
she had different pruning treatments for

1190
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,240
her plants and she found that the the

1191
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,880
yields were lower of course when you

1192
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,598
remove the leaves compared to the ones

1193
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:28,318
that were not defoliated and such um but

1194
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:30,680
the the yields were still pretty high on

1195
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,318
ones that she aggressively defoliated so

1196
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:34,759
much so that it was basically just the

1197
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:37,199
flow the inflorescences along the the

1198
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,599
plant shoot yeah I'd love to see more

1199
00:43:37,199 --> 00:43:42,199
research around that I might have to try

1200
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,680
and try and get a hold of uh I've seen

1201
00:43:42,199 --> 00:43:46,318
that name I don't even know if it's a

1202
00:43:43,679 --> 00:43:48,558
man or woman but the Nar Bernstein

1203
00:43:46,318 --> 00:43:50,400
correct am I pronouncing it correctly

1204
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,920
yeah ner Bernstein she a woman yeah

1205
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,559
she's she's a wonderful yeah she's a

1206
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:58,440
wonderful researcher in Israel I've met

1207
00:43:55,559 --> 00:43:59,960
her a few times now uh pleasure to talk

1208
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:01,318
to I'm sure she would happy to be on

1209
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,559
this but she's done some tremendous

1210
00:44:01,318 --> 00:44:04,239
studies you know if you just search her

1211
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:06,240
name on Google Scholar a bunch of

1212
00:44:04,239 --> 00:44:08,199
studies will pop up with her I believe I

1213
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:10,959
read a paper and and emailed her about

1214
00:44:08,199 --> 00:44:12,799
it regarding micro isal fungi and heavy

1215
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,639
metal uptake that I think she might have

1216
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:16,559
done years ago I believe that was her um

1217
00:44:15,639 --> 00:44:18,118
but yeah there's some there's some

1218
00:44:16,559 --> 00:44:19,440
amazing researchers and and more

1219
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:21,200
research coming out all the time it's

1220
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:23,960
really actually hard to keep up at this

1221
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:26,879
point yeah yeah my my stack I mean

1222
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:29,318
that's why I sorry go ahead oh that's

1223
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,838
why I love this industry is because um

1224
00:44:29,318 --> 00:44:33,800
there's you know there's so few crops

1225
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:36,000
that we can still do research on it's

1226
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:39,519
really interesting I mean at least to me

1227
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,880
I feel like yeah yeah absolutely the uh

1228
00:44:39,519 --> 00:44:42,559
that's what was so exciting too about

1229
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,240
getting started with this this cannabis

1230
00:44:42,559 --> 00:44:45,920
research was that you know with point

1231
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:47,879
studia you know people doing Point

1232
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,559
studia research for decades now so most

1233
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:52,599
of the stuff has been worked out already

1234
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:54,519
um you except maybe heat delay which was

1235
00:44:52,599 --> 00:44:56,480
what my whole Master's project was on

1236
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:58,480
but you know with cannabis just anything

1237
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,280
you do in a formal experiment is

1238
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:02,199
interesting it's brand new and everybody

1239
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,079
wants to see well how did it go even if

1240
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:05,919
it's you know not anything unique to any

1241
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:08,519
other plants but you want to demonstrate

1242
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,760
that it it happens as well with

1243
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:13,280
cannabis yeah and I see Growers trying

1244
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:15,480
things all the time that are interest I

1245
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,000
mean you go back far enough and you'll

1246
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:20,039
see people dumping Kool-Aid on their

1247
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,159
plants you see people pouring ice cubes

1248
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,838
on their on their media I mean you name

1249
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:25,519
it cannabis Growers have tried it you

1250
00:45:23,838 --> 00:45:28,440
know they shove shove their soil in in

1251
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:31,358
an oven to sterilize it like they're a

1252
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:33,800
creative you know Innovative Bunch not

1253
00:45:31,358 --> 00:45:36,480
all it works but you know they'll try

1254
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:38,119
anything yeah you know as far as

1255
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,960
scientific inquiry I think cannabis

1256
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:42,440
Growers have a remarkable Edge because

1257
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,159
they do come up with some wild scenarios

1258
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,599
of things to try and that's you know

1259
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,759
that's part of science is just seeing

1260
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:49,039
what works and what doesn't and you know

1261
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,400
I guess part of it is just having

1262
00:45:49,039 --> 00:45:52,838
something more formal and something

1263
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,079
repeatable but the ideas are there to

1264
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:56,960
pursue new pursue new avenues you know

1265
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:58,359
explore the unexplored yeah a couple

1266
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:00,280
topics that I would love to see more

1267
00:45:58,358 --> 00:46:02,920
research on because I've seen Growers

1268
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:05,880
stting experiment with them are

1269
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:07,159
um jasmonic acid I don't know if you're

1270
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:10,400
very familiar with

1271
00:46:07,159 --> 00:46:13,039
it no yeah it's it's it's an interesting

1272
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,440
one and then uh I've seen more stuff

1273
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:16,159
just on social media I haven't seen any

1274
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,599
research around it but some research

1275
00:46:16,159 --> 00:46:20,358
would be good just to either disprove it

1276
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:22,000
or actually show some some ethicacy but

1277
00:46:20,358 --> 00:46:22,759
the electric culture stuff that people

1278
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:26,280
are

1279
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:29,359
doing the electric culture yeah you seen

1280
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:31,280
that no it's not it's essentially

1281
00:46:29,358 --> 00:46:34,639
running a low level of electricity

1282
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:37,359
through your soil oh as a way of somehow

1283
00:46:34,639 --> 00:46:39,920
increasing plant growth people are doing

1284
00:46:37,358 --> 00:46:42,639
it in their Gardens and I've even seen

1285
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,519
canas Growers doing it um haven't seen

1286
00:46:42,639 --> 00:46:46,679
any research to support it but I also

1287
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:48,199
haven't really dug into it at all I know

1288
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:50,199
there's a lot of stuff around alkaline

1289
00:46:48,199 --> 00:46:53,358
water that's been pretty well debunked

1290
00:46:50,199 --> 00:46:55,598
but yeah know I can't imag yeah I have

1291
00:46:53,358 --> 00:46:57,358
no idea where the idea would be coming

1292
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,160
from but would love to hear about it you

1293
00:46:57,358 --> 00:47:01,039
know it's always new idea to pursue if

1294
00:46:59,159 --> 00:47:03,598
you can find funding for it then go you

1295
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:07,318
know go at it yeah all well let's get

1296
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:10,000
back to uh some actual research stuff um

1297
00:47:07,318 --> 00:47:12,800
so what other experiments or projects

1298
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,199
have you been working on Beyond photo

1299
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,800
period yeah so um The Other Well my

1300
00:47:16,199 --> 00:47:20,199
dissertation have four chapters photo

1301
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:22,000
period is one of them uh the second is

1302
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:25,078
growth analysis so how do these plants

1303
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,800
change over time um the third is

1304
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:28,280
Flushing with we did a pretty hefty

1305
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,519
amount of research on and then fourth

1306
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:32,480
was high control you know how do we stop

1307
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:33,960
this this crazy flowering stretch that

1308
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:35,800
happens after you start short days you

1309
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,679
know you go from a plant that's a foot

1310
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,599
tall to three feet tall within two weeks

1311
00:47:37,679 --> 00:47:41,838
you know how do you how do you curb

1312
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,680
that so

1313
00:47:41,838 --> 00:47:46,480
happy yeah yeah okay well let's let's

1314
00:47:44,679 --> 00:47:50,318
start with that

1315
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,838
um how yeah what variables impact Beyond

1316
00:47:50,318 --> 00:47:54,960
genetics how do we how do we control for

1317
00:47:52,838 --> 00:47:56,440
that stretch because ideally we want as

1318
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:58,639
Growers

1319
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,519
we want that stretch to be smaller so we

1320
00:47:58,639 --> 00:48:03,159
don't have to use as much trellis and we

1321
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:05,440
want to keep our inner noal spacing as

1322
00:48:03,159 --> 00:48:09,920
small as possible so yeah what what did

1323
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:11,358
you find yeah so um this this whole idea

1324
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,599
it's called height control and it's

1325
00:48:11,358 --> 00:48:14,279
really you know if you think about

1326
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:15,720
managing the height of the plant but

1327
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,480
it's really managing the inter node

1328
00:48:15,719 --> 00:48:20,000
space of the plant um and so me and my

1329
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
best friend George Grant he's the

1330
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,639
technical services manager now with

1331
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:25,358
Griffin greenhouse supply he and I

1332
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:28,078
writing an article and with Jim fa of

1333
00:48:25,358 --> 00:48:29,759
course as well uh on non photo or

1334
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,839
non-chemical high control methods for

1335
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,559
cannabis Growers which I sent over to

1336
00:48:31,838 --> 00:48:35,078
Michelle sakis yesterday at canvas

1337
00:48:33,559 --> 00:48:37,280
business times so that should be coming

1338
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:39,240
out in a few weeks that's the first part

1339
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,960
that we'll talk about um and the number

1340
00:48:39,239 --> 00:48:42,439
one thing that we say in there is you

1341
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,838
want to control height in your plants

1342
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,679
you have to pick genetics that don't

1343
00:48:43,838 --> 00:48:47,279
stretch now of course as you mentioned

1344
00:48:45,679 --> 00:48:48,799
that the market sometimes demands

1345
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,880
certain cultivar so you don't have the

1346
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,000
option to not grow that really stretchy

1347
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:55,400
cultivar um but there's you know a

1348
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,440
number of other options available um so

1349
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,400
like with poetas or you know other

1350
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,400
ornamentals is you know one is

1351
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:03,358
controlling the the diff the difference

1352
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:06,039
between your day and night temperature

1353
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:08,000
uh with poinet is if you run a warmer

1354
00:49:06,039 --> 00:49:10,759
night temperature than a day temperature

1355
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:13,318
you actually create much shorter plants

1356
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:15,079
um another thing is uh this one's always

1357
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:17,119
a mouthful to say is thigmo

1358
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:18,680
morphogenesis this is where you actually

1359
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:20,798
touch your plants and this causes them

1360
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:23,480
to grow shorter and so so what some

1361
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:25,798
Growers have demonstrated um I can't

1362
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:27,838
remember what crop this was with um but

1363
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:29,480
basically if they just vibrate the table

1364
00:49:27,838 --> 00:49:30,880
the bench bench tables a little bit just

1365
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:33,159
to create a little bit of Wiggle in the

1366
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,318
plants it causes them to stay a lot

1367
00:49:33,159 --> 00:49:38,879
shorter um and so some of the what we

1368
00:49:36,318 --> 00:49:40,519
wanted to find with this research was I

1369
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:43,280
guess maybe more innovative ways to

1370
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:44,838
control some of this um and the first

1371
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,280
one that was kind of obvious was

1372
00:49:44,838 --> 00:49:50,159
pinching um you know topping your plants

1373
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:51,839
at the start of your short days um to

1374
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:54,679
just physically remove some of that

1375
00:49:51,838 --> 00:49:56,440
stretch right um I know some Growers

1376
00:49:54,679 --> 00:49:58,399
they they don't Pinch at the start of

1377
00:49:56,440 --> 00:50:00,079
short days or even after that they do it

1378
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,920
you know for the last time a few weeks

1379
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,240
before starting short days and then they

1380
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,000
result in these huge shoots um so the

1381
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:08,598
that was the one aspect that we tested

1382
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,440
was you know what is the difference

1383
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:12,160
between uh pinching your plant let's say

1384
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:13,679
a week before you start short days

1385
00:50:12,159 --> 00:50:15,399
pinching it at the start of short days

1386
00:50:13,679 --> 00:50:17,798
and then pinching it a week after

1387
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,559
starting short days the other one the

1388
00:50:17,798 --> 00:50:20,798
other Technique we wanted to try and you

1389
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,880
I guess I haven't really come up with a

1390
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:24,358
good term for this uh one that rolls off

1391
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:26,760
the tongue a little easier but I'm

1392
00:50:24,358 --> 00:50:28,279
calling it fertilizer restri ition um

1393
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:30,240
and it's really the same idea of

1394
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:33,280
flushing but it's flushing the plants at

1395
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:34,919
the start of short days and and the idea

1396
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:37,400
is that basically you're going to you

1397
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,240
you cut off fertilizer when you start

1398
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:42,559
the short days at the start of short

1399
00:50:40,239 --> 00:50:44,159
days the plant is getting the signal um

1400
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,960
the physiological signal to stretch

1401
00:50:44,159 --> 00:50:47,838
because of the short photo periods and

1402
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,240
so if you put the plant into a starve

1403
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:50,480
state that can't stretch because it

1404
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:52,759
doesn't have the nutrients and the

1405
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:55,119
energy to do so then you know you can

1406
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:57,119
keep the plant shorter then once the the

1407
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:59,440
stretch ing period is over usually by

1408
00:50:57,119 --> 00:51:00,640
week two or week three of short days

1409
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,000
then go ahead and resume all your

1410
00:51:00,639 --> 00:51:05,960
fertilizer and the plants are good to go

1411
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:07,719
the the the height I guess management

1412
00:51:05,960 --> 00:51:09,079
that way is permanent too so the plants

1413
00:51:07,719 --> 00:51:11,879
won't stretch like crazy once you give

1414
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:14,119
them fertilizer again a lot of questions

1415
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:16,039
but let's start with the fertilizer one

1416
00:51:14,119 --> 00:51:18,838
so first off I want to say this only

1417
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:21,000
works for uh people growing with mineral

1418
00:51:18,838 --> 00:51:23,119
salts chemical Growers so if you're

1419
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:25,079
growing in you know living soil Organics

1420
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:26,640
that you don't have that level of

1421
00:51:25,079 --> 00:51:29,880
control

1422
00:51:26,639 --> 00:51:30,960
so don't try it with Organics um at

1423
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,119
least that that would be my

1424
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:36,119
recommendation feel free to contradict

1425
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,838
me on that um with the fertilizer

1426
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:42,720
restriction though are you

1427
00:51:38,838 --> 00:51:45,759
seeing are you seeing any plant

1428
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,598
deficiencies or creating you know a

1429
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:50,680
greater stress response through this

1430
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:51,920
restriction oh yeah yeah the plants look

1431
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:54,318
like they're on the verge of death when

1432
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:55,680
you uh when you do this so the

1433
00:51:54,318 --> 00:51:58,440
fertilizer restriction treat treatments

1434
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:00,759
that we had were 0 one in 2 weeks after

1435
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:03,760
starting short days so what's

1436
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:05,760
interesting is that the the plants with

1437
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,160
one in two we fertilizer restriction the

1438
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,720
leaves would get really yellow the

1439
00:52:07,159 --> 00:52:11,639
plants would clearly be smaller and just

1440
00:52:08,719 --> 00:52:13,118
overall stunting um but with the the

1441
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:15,199
onewe fertilizer restriction you know

1442
00:52:13,119 --> 00:52:16,880
we're just doing it from day Zero to day

1443
00:52:15,199 --> 00:52:20,598
seven then we give plants fertilizer

1444
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:22,240
again till till Harvest um by week two

1445
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:23,880
where that two we fertilizer restriction

1446
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,519
treatment is it's even worse you know

1447
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:27,599
some of the the bottom leaves are

1448
00:52:25,519 --> 00:52:29,519
actually falling off and upsizing okay

1449
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,440
um but that that onewe fertilizer

1450
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:33,400
restriction looks totally healthy a week

1451
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,039
later and then that also that two week

1452
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:37,720
fertilizer restriction by week three

1453
00:52:35,039 --> 00:52:40,159
looks totally good looks totally fine

1454
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:42,039
okay okay and did you measure yields at

1455
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:45,879
the end to see how that was impacted by

1456
00:52:42,039 --> 00:52:47,480
this uh stress event yeah so this is

1457
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:49,838
where we've really gotten into the idea

1458
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:51,519
of planting density with this so the

1459
00:52:49,838 --> 00:52:53,239
fertilizer restriction causes a

1460
00:52:51,519 --> 00:52:54,920
permanent stunting of the plant as far

1461
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:56,000
as the the length by width dimensions of

1462
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:57,838
the plant

1463
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,599
and so what we did was we measured the

1464
00:52:57,838 --> 00:53:01,719
yields on all of them but we also

1465
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:03,880
measured the actual length the

1466
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:05,519
dimensions of the plant and so what we

1467
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:07,599
found was that the longer you apply

1468
00:53:05,519 --> 00:53:09,519
fertilizer restriction for the smaller

1469
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,640
the plants get the lower the yields on a

1470
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:15,039
per plant basis but if you put that on a

1471
00:53:12,639 --> 00:53:18,558
per area basis then the yields are

1472
00:53:15,039 --> 00:53:20,079
actually significantly higher um and so

1473
00:53:18,559 --> 00:53:22,280
what that requires then is that you're

1474
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:24,000
growing more plants per meter square but

1475
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,760
the yields are tremendously

1476
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,760
higher yeah that makes

1477
00:53:27,838 --> 00:53:32,639
sense okay I don't know that I have a

1478
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:36,599
lot of other questions around

1479
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:37,679
that getting back to your touching one

1480
00:53:36,599 --> 00:53:39,000
though you're gonna have a bunch of

1481
00:53:37,679 --> 00:53:41,919
people run through their rooms touching

1482
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:45,679
their plants um could you receive the

1483
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:48,920
same physiological response by just

1484
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:50,719
having a fan that's moving the plant

1485
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:52,760
yeah yeah actually I think it could um

1486
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,919
if you have enough airf flow yeah yeah I

1487
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:55,400
think you could where you're getting the

1488
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,920
plants to kind of move back back and

1489
00:53:55,400 --> 00:54:00,119
forth a little bit I think that would

1490
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:02,519
work fantastic um another method that I

1491
00:54:00,119 --> 00:54:04,880
think they do with uh basil I want to

1492
00:54:02,519 --> 00:54:07,119
say is that they have like a little

1493
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,318
brush motor that goes over the plant as

1494
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:11,440
you know just goes down the bench um

1495
00:54:09,318 --> 00:54:13,119
just to touch the top of the plants and

1496
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,159
that you know is another good stimulus

1497
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:16,920
and that helps sometimes kick up some uh

1498
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:19,440
insects as well and get them trapped on

1499
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:21,200
sticky cards oh that's interesting I

1500
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,000
would love to see that the video of that

1501
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:26,039
in action I've never heard of that yeah

1502
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,920
if you look up uh shenon DOA Growers I

1503
00:54:26,039 --> 00:54:29,039
think they're in Virginia um they I

1504
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:32,760
think they have all sorts of videos

1505
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:34,358
online you could see very cool yeah I I

1506
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:35,880
come from a landscaping background my

1507
00:54:34,358 --> 00:54:37,279
parents owning a nursery landscaping

1508
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:39,838
business so I just know from planting

1509
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,200
trees that you know the way we stake

1510
00:54:39,838 --> 00:54:43,960
them um we want that tree to move around

1511
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,078
a little bit because it creates a better

1512
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:47,599
root

1513
00:54:45,079 --> 00:54:49,599
mass and actually has better structure

1514
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:52,039
root structure and is a healthier tree

1515
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,798
that won't require as much staking if we

1516
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:55,599
if we plant it correctly and I could see

1517
00:54:53,798 --> 00:54:57,400
how this would correlate with you know

1518
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:01,318
what you're doing with cannabis if

1519
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:03,920
you if you baby the plant and it has no

1520
00:55:01,318 --> 00:55:04,798
stimulus you know in terms of movement

1521
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,798
back and

1522
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:10,960
forth on the stem itself you don't have

1523
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:12,838
quite as robust of a uh foundation in

1524
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:14,480
the roots to support the plant because

1525
00:55:12,838 --> 00:55:16,159
it doesn't it doesn't put energy into it

1526
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:19,760
because it doesn't need it I

1527
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:21,719
guess yeah yeah 100% agree um I I think

1528
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,559
having a little bit of mechanical stress

1529
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:26,038
in that way is very very beneficial um

1530
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:28,039
especially so many Growers are using

1531
00:55:26,039 --> 00:55:30,839
trellis netting which to me is it's such

1532
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:32,520
a pain to use um a lot of my experiments

1533
00:55:30,838 --> 00:55:34,599
were geared towards how do we eliminate

1534
00:55:32,519 --> 00:55:36,400
trellis netting and uh you know so I

1535
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:38,119
think some of this higher air movement

1536
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,440
is one one way for sure that you could

1537
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:41,559
add some benefit that

1538
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:44,440
way you I have to go back and look

1539
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:47,280
because I know there's a there's an

1540
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:49,200
optimal amount of air flow across the

1541
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:52,798
leaf surface according

1542
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:54,480
to Dr nadaba the Dr Greenhouse I don't

1543
00:55:52,798 --> 00:55:57,400
if you're familiar with her research

1544
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,400
she's probably the top airflow HVAC

1545
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,960
expert in the industry that especially

1546
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:05,880
with cannabis and ornamentals um and and

1547
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,760
one of the things that she she talks

1548
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:10,358
about is how and you're probably wear

1549
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:12,119
this with um calcium especially but if

1550
00:56:10,358 --> 00:56:13,838
you get too much air flow across the

1551
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:15,640
leaf surface the plant's not able to

1552
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:17,838
transpire fast enough and so you'll get

1553
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,759
calcium deficiencies expressed in the

1554
00:56:17,838 --> 00:56:22,719
leaf or or Leaf tip burn things like

1555
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:24,680
that so there's a balance there between

1556
00:56:22,719 --> 00:56:26,959
too much air flow and then enough air

1557
00:56:24,679 --> 00:56:28,879
flow for gas

1558
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:30,679
exchange you know kind of like anything

1559
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:32,280
else there's there's an optimal range

1560
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,639
there that people want to make sure

1561
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,200
they're hitting so you're not just

1562
00:56:33,639 --> 00:56:38,679
blasting your plant with with

1563
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:40,639
air yeah that's interesting to me

1564
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:42,598
because you know with especially with

1565
00:56:40,639 --> 00:56:44,679
transpiration that you know if you have

1566
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:46,559
stagnant air it creates a microclimate

1567
00:56:44,679 --> 00:56:49,480
right under underneath that leaf at the

1568
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:51,559
the the subs Cy U well between the

1569
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:54,000
stamata and the outside environment and

1570
00:56:51,559 --> 00:56:56,079
so if you are constantly running air

1571
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:57,838
then you don't have any like human

1572
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:59,480
microclimates right around that stamata

1573
00:56:57,838 --> 00:57:01,119
so there should always be a very high

1574
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,639
gradient between the leaf into the

1575
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,559
atmosphere so my thinking would be at a

1576
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:06,558
higher air air movement that you would

1577
00:57:05,559 --> 00:57:08,920
have more

1578
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:11,200
transpiration do perhaps but at some

1579
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:13,639
point the plant can't Apple transpira

1580
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:16,159
fast enough to keep up with or or

1581
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:19,000
transpire fast enough to keep up with

1582
00:57:16,159 --> 00:57:20,558
that air flow does that make sense and

1583
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:24,280
that's when you see what people call

1584
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,798
wind burn or or Leaf burn oh okay

1585
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,640
interesting yeah I wonder you know I

1586
00:57:25,798 --> 00:57:29,239
guess how fast is that wind going CU

1587
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:30,759
that could be some other things and also

1588
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:32,078
the temperature too once you you know

1589
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:34,319
once you're blowing so much air it's

1590
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:35,960
going to cool off some of these areas so

1591
00:57:34,318 --> 00:57:37,679
um because that's that's for sure you

1592
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:39,400
know calcium is taken up passively has

1593
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,639
to move with water and so if you're

1594
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:42,079
having low water movement then you're

1595
00:57:40,639 --> 00:57:43,920
going to have Calcium

1596
00:57:42,079 --> 00:57:47,400
deficiency yeah because it's going to

1597
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:52,880
the xylm yeah exactly yeah interesting

1598
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:55,240
well um okay so just just to recap uh

1599
00:57:52,880 --> 00:57:58,798
you're saying the ways we can control

1600
00:57:55,239 --> 00:58:00,759
height are fertilizer restriction first

1601
00:57:58,798 --> 00:58:04,440
couple weeks of flow if you're a

1602
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:06,960
chemical grower um we can control it

1603
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:09,200
through topping or

1604
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,199
pinching I would assume training the

1605
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:14,118
plant down into the trellis also just

1606
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:16,919
breaking that sort of

1607
00:58:14,119 --> 00:58:19,400
oxen pathway

1608
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:22,559
um to the plant similar to pinching that

1609
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:23,720
would work too and then um mechanically

1610
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,640
moving the

1611
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:29,719
plant are those the three main ways that

1612
00:58:26,639 --> 00:58:32,159
was did I miss one yeah yeah um you know

1613
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:34,679
plant spacing is one as well if you have

1614
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:36,798
plants really crowded together um it's

1615
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:38,639
going to be there's well the the plant

1616
00:58:36,798 --> 00:58:40,880
will become the environment will become

1617
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:43,879
far red enriched and far red light will

1618
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:45,200
stimulate stretching um and so this

1619
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,400
actually kind of reminds me too with

1620
00:58:45,199 --> 00:58:49,558
with Bruce's research he has you know

1621
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:51,440
clearly shown that far red photons dry

1622
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:54,160
photosynthesis and that's absolutely a

1623
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,920
fact um what I you know what he and I

1624
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:57,879
have talked about a couple times is that

1625
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:00,000
with far red light although you can

1626
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,440
drive more photosynthesis in certain

1627
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,239
cultivars far red light will promote

1628
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:05,720
stretching and so maybe far red light

1629
00:59:04,239 --> 00:59:07,239
isn't always appropriate to add to your

1630
00:59:05,719 --> 00:59:10,239
LEDs if you're if you're growing

1631
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:12,038
varieties are tended to

1632
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:14,358
stretch yeah I know there's been more

1633
00:59:12,039 --> 00:59:16,480
research around far red I'm not as up to

1634
00:59:14,358 --> 00:59:20,038
date on the lighting research as I want

1635
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:23,318
to be um but I do know that there's some

1636
00:59:20,039 --> 00:59:27,720
folks that claim you know HPS still

1637
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:31,000
produces a superior flow due to either a

1638
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:34,239
the heat leaf leaf surface that you get

1639
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:39,599
from HPS that you don't get with LED or

1640
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:42,959
that you have more red in the Spectrum

1641
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:44,760
itself the some people just like the the

1642
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,519
expression that they get off of that

1643
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:48,240
better than they do off of L you know a

1644
00:59:46,519 --> 00:59:51,239
full spectrum LED but I don't know if

1645
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:52,879
you have any thoughts on that yeah so

1646
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:55,118
for sure that the if you're using like

1647
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:57,280
an HPS that's super Overdrive with red

1648
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:59,838
photons U yes you will basically

1649
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:03,039
eliminate the you know or you'll create

1650
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:04,880
a very high red to far red ratio uh

1651
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:06,240
which will help negate some stretching I

1652
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:08,000
think the other thing too is at least

1653
01:00:06,239 --> 01:00:09,879
traditionally the HPS lighting is

1654
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:12,519
usually very high light intensity and so

1655
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:14,160
that's another factor is that um the the

1656
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:15,440
lower the light intensity the more the

1657
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,920
plants is going stretch because it's

1658
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,440
trying to capture as many photons as

1659
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:20,039
possible if you're providing a really

1660
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,798
really high light intensity then plant

1661
01:00:20,039 --> 01:00:24,119
has no reason to

1662
01:00:21,798 --> 01:00:25,639
stretch okay so another way we could

1663
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:27,838
potentially control it then you're

1664
01:00:25,639 --> 01:00:30,639
saying is increasing the light intensity

1665
01:00:27,838 --> 01:00:33,159
the power levels pbfd at

1666
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:34,879
canopy yeah yeah no that's challenging

1667
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:37,399
too because you know the plants will

1668
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,480
still grow and so you know ideally what

1669
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:41,119
you could do is have it almost like um

1670
01:00:39,480 --> 01:00:43,358
with blinds where you're you have a

1671
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:45,039
chain where you can lower and raise them

1672
01:00:43,358 --> 01:00:46,679
um and so ideally you know as the plant

1673
01:00:45,039 --> 01:00:48,760
is growing you know every week you can

1674
01:00:46,679 --> 01:00:50,318
just slightly raise the lamps a little

1675
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,640
bit just so the the flowers aren't too

1676
01:00:50,318 --> 01:00:53,358
close to the lamps and not burning them

1677
01:00:51,639 --> 01:00:54,838
or anything but that would really be a

1678
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:56,519
tremendous way to control height was

1679
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:58,960
being able to adjust your lamps on the

1680
01:00:56,519 --> 01:01:01,239
on the fly but that's you know that's a

1681
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:04,559
significant engineering project right

1682
01:01:01,239 --> 01:01:06,038
there yeah I mean I've talked to uh you

1683
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:08,319
know a grower on scale and he's like

1684
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,960
it's $4,000 every time I want to raise

1685
01:01:08,318 --> 01:01:11,798
or lower my lights like it's because of

1686
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:14,480
the amount of labor involved and so I

1687
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:16,920
totally get that but as a home like as a

1688
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:18,838
homeg grower it's it's quite easy to do

1689
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:21,400
though I will admit like I have LED

1690
01:01:18,838 --> 01:01:25,519
lights um but they're very high quality

1691
01:01:21,400 --> 01:01:27,680
LED lights and uh I allowed the lights

1692
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:32,519
to allowed the plant to grow too close

1693
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:35,318
to the light and so I ended up with um

1694
01:01:32,519 --> 01:01:38,798
some some issues on the leaf itself just

1695
01:01:35,318 --> 01:01:41,400
from the plant not being able to just

1696
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:43,880
receiving too what I would classifies

1697
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,720
too much light relative to the fertility

1698
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:49,079
in the soil and the environment that it

1699
01:01:45,719 --> 01:01:51,318
was in CO2 everything else in a hom

1700
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:53,559
grow but I know Bruce has done research

1701
01:01:51,318 --> 01:01:55,719
that shows that the plants can handle

1702
01:01:53,559 --> 01:01:57,319
significantly higher levels of light

1703
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:59,719
than we ever thought

1704
01:01:57,318 --> 01:02:01,599
possible cannabis specifically is what

1705
01:01:59,719 --> 01:02:03,598
I'm talking about here um which I

1706
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,278
thought was really interesting and it

1707
01:02:03,599 --> 01:02:07,200
correct me again on this one but from

1708
01:02:05,278 --> 01:02:08,920
what I understand of his of his research

1709
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,719
at least his old research was that

1710
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:13,079
Spectrum was much less important than

1711
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:15,719
light intensity so getting higher light

1712
01:02:13,079 --> 01:02:17,798
levels had a greater impact on yield

1713
01:02:15,719 --> 01:02:19,399
gambo expression all that than what

1714
01:02:17,798 --> 01:02:22,599
spectrum you were

1715
01:02:19,400 --> 01:02:24,680
running absolutely um so it's

1716
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,519
interesting too the spectrum is that

1717
01:02:24,679 --> 01:02:28,159
with uh other research has shown that if

1718
01:02:26,519 --> 01:02:30,000
you provide a lot of blue light it'll

1719
01:02:28,159 --> 01:02:31,920
keep the plants a lot shorter as well

1720
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:33,039
but that's really only under low light

1721
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,039
conditions with certain crops like

1722
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:37,240
salvia where you're only growing them at

1723
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:38,480
maybe five to 10 moles of light per day

1724
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:40,278
that where you can start to make some of

1725
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:42,119
these differences but with cannabis you

1726
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:44,440
know where you're trying to get 60 80

1727
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:45,960
even 100 moles per day of light you know

1728
01:02:44,440 --> 01:02:48,039
the the light quality is much less

1729
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:50,000
important for sure you know you'll get

1730
01:02:48,039 --> 01:02:52,000
much more benefit of increasing the ppfd

1731
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:55,719
or DLI all right Michael I'm G throw you

1732
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,960
a curveball here um sure all right

1733
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:59,919
so uh something I was thinking about the

1734
01:02:57,960 --> 01:03:02,480
other day I posted this on social media

1735
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:04,278
I got a wide variety of responses and I

1736
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:07,400
want to hear your thoughts about

1737
01:03:04,278 --> 01:03:08,639
cannabis leaves praying are you familiar

1738
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:11,599
with what I'm talking about when I say

1739
01:03:08,639 --> 01:03:14,519
that it's this uh sort of 45 degree

1740
01:03:11,599 --> 01:03:16,599
angle yeah yeah Leaf angle that you get

1741
01:03:14,519 --> 01:03:18,199
and this has always been associated with

1742
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:21,480
a very happy plant you know you're

1743
01:03:18,199 --> 01:03:25,118
getting good turgidity in the in the

1744
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:27,400
stem apparently um what are your

1745
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,000
thoughts on this because one of the

1746
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:30,480
thoughts I was had as I was in my room

1747
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,000
looking at this and that the plants were

1748
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:35,000
getting way too much light at the time

1749
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,838
and they weren't perfectly happy in my

1750
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:39,000
opinion but yet they were doing this

1751
01:03:36,838 --> 01:03:41,960
praying motion I'm like this is a this

1752
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:44,679
is a less than optimal angle for for

1753
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:46,838
receiving photons too versus you know

1754
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:48,759
having them be completely

1755
01:03:46,838 --> 01:03:52,599
flat I don't know what are your thoughts

1756
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:55,039
about it yeah so um forgetting the term

1757
01:03:52,599 --> 01:03:57,000
is but to me that would be because

1758
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:58,559
there's not enough air flow um and so

1759
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,960
what the plant is doing is it's trying

1760
01:03:58,559 --> 01:04:03,760
to raise up or expose more so the the

1761
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:06,920
bottom surface of the leaf to get those

1762
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,839
stamata exposed and get more air flow

1763
01:04:06,920 --> 01:04:11,400
and eliminate some of that um the the

1764
01:04:09,838 --> 01:04:15,798
humidity that's sticking right around

1765
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:17,400
the stamata um and so yeah I I would

1766
01:04:15,798 --> 01:04:19,038
think that it's it's caused by not

1767
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,039
enough air flow going through the

1768
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:23,599
facility or another way to think about

1769
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:25,640
is the the VPD isn't high enough um

1770
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:27,039
either too much humidity or you know

1771
01:04:25,639 --> 01:04:28,679
what what have you but basically the

1772
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,440
plant's not transpiring enough it wants

1773
01:04:28,679 --> 01:04:32,598
to raise the leaves expose the stamata

1774
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,400
more so to the air flow to help drive a

1775
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:36,519
higher transpiration

1776
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,760
gradient interesting someone did talk

1777
01:04:36,519 --> 01:04:41,639
about that in relation to yeah the

1778
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:43,640
stamata and CO2 potentially playing a

1779
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:46,000
role in that as well and and

1780
01:04:43,639 --> 01:04:47,519
interestingly enough now when I'm when

1781
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:51,000
you say that and I'm thinking about it

1782
01:04:47,519 --> 01:04:53,519
um I had I have under canopy air flow in

1783
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:55,679
the room and all my lower leaves look

1784
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:57,838
fine like they're not doing that but the

1785
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:59,598
top of my canopy where there is less air

1786
01:04:57,838 --> 01:05:00,639
flow uh I am seeing that so I'm I'm

1787
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:01,838
gonna have to experiment with that a

1788
01:05:00,639 --> 01:05:04,038
little bit

1789
01:05:01,838 --> 01:05:06,000
I yeah I appreciate your you know

1790
01:05:04,039 --> 01:05:08,640
sharing your your knowledge on

1791
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:10,960
that yeah you know I think it's too is

1792
01:05:08,639 --> 01:05:12,400
that as the the plant develops um Mitch

1793
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,000
has some really nice photos of this is

1794
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:16,160
that what they did was um take some

1795
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:18,318
thermal imaging of canabas plants and

1796
01:05:16,159 --> 01:05:20,598
flower and you can see that the flowers

1797
01:05:18,318 --> 01:05:22,480
are so much hotter than the leaves and

1798
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:24,559
so that kind of contributes to what I

1799
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:26,880
think is the issue with some betr with

1800
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:29,720
cannabis is that the the flowers are

1801
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,119
transpiring less as the time goes on and

1802
01:05:29,719 --> 01:05:32,519
so if they're transpiring less they're

1803
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:34,880
not moving as much calcium into those

1804
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:36,519
inflorescences and we know calcium is

1805
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:39,039
what helps prevent betras infection and

1806
01:05:36,519 --> 01:05:41,119
a number of other crops um so I could

1807
01:05:39,039 --> 01:05:42,640
imagine that with the top of the canopy

1808
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:44,440
where there's not as much air flow it's

1809
01:05:42,639 --> 01:05:46,960
also much hotter and so the plant's

1810
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:49,480
trying to transpire to you know maintain

1811
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:50,519
its physiological balance but uh you

1812
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,960
where you have more air flow at the

1813
01:05:50,519 --> 01:05:53,719
bottom where it's cooler and not as

1814
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:54,838
bright you plants the leaves probably

1815
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:57,679
look fine

1816
01:05:54,838 --> 01:06:00,838
yeah you described it exactly that's

1817
01:05:57,679 --> 01:06:02,679
that's awesome so uh in regards to

1818
01:06:00,838 --> 01:06:04,440
calcium though I think I can't remember

1819
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:05,838
if you said it on air or not because we

1820
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,278
talked a little bit beforehand but you

1821
01:06:05,838 --> 01:06:11,440
talked about spraying calcium and how

1822
01:06:08,278 --> 01:06:13,599
that wasn't as effective for can you

1823
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:17,519
just why don't you you say what you

1824
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:20,119
already said sure sure yeah so uh my my

1825
01:06:17,519 --> 01:06:22,278
labmate Melissa Munos she did her doctor

1826
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:24,880
at work with calcium sprays and

1827
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:27,679
different um pesticide sprays for pres

1828
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,880
preventing a Bettis on Rose I think

1829
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:33,239
Gerber Daisy and something else um and

1830
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:35,559
so what she found is that if you spray

1831
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:38,639
calcium onto the flour tissue it can

1832
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:42,119
help reduce petrius infection and so we

1833
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:44,719
wanted to try that with cannabis right

1834
01:06:42,119 --> 01:06:46,400
uh the issue was that by the time you

1835
01:06:44,719 --> 01:06:47,639
were spraying it by the time you

1836
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:49,680
actually have these welldeveloped

1837
01:06:47,639 --> 01:06:51,679
inflorescences and they're kind of in

1838
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:53,679
that time where Petrus can start

1839
01:06:51,679 --> 01:06:55,798
infecting and becoming a problem it's

1840
01:06:53,679 --> 01:06:57,598
too late to be applying calcium you

1841
01:06:55,798 --> 01:06:59,759
can't really get it into the flowers

1842
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:01,079
like you can with a rose and you know

1843
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:02,799
the way you do it with a rose is that

1844
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:06,318
you just turn it upside down you dunk it

1845
01:07:02,798 --> 01:07:09,318
into a solution of calcium you can't do

1846
01:07:06,318 --> 01:07:11,759
that with a cannabis plant right um and

1847
01:07:09,318 --> 01:07:14,199
so the idea instead is that what we need

1848
01:07:11,760 --> 01:07:15,920
to do is that you can't really spray lat

1849
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:17,719
to flour what you need to be doing is

1850
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:19,920
providing higher calcium and potentially

1851
01:07:17,719 --> 01:07:22,159
silica right from the start of flowering

1852
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,000
or even beforehand and maintain very

1853
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:26,199
very high concentrations of calcium in

1854
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:27,960
silica in the plant to potentially

1855
01:07:26,199 --> 01:07:29,519
reduce petritis we don't have data for

1856
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:31,960
that or anything but what we know for

1857
01:07:29,519 --> 01:07:35,000
sure is that spraying either pesticides

1858
01:07:31,960 --> 01:07:37,358
or calcium late in flowering does

1859
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:39,318
nothing yeah so you're saying get raise

1860
01:07:37,358 --> 01:07:42,358
the levels of fertility in terms of

1861
01:07:39,318 --> 01:07:45,199
calcium and silica in your media ahead

1862
01:07:42,358 --> 01:07:47,400
of time and uh I know we talked about

1863
01:07:45,199 --> 01:07:49,159
wellas night already is you know calcium

1864
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:51,480
silicate is one of the things that you

1865
01:07:49,159 --> 01:07:53,639
used in your experiment and it's a very

1866
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:56,400
affordable easy thing to just add in

1867
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:59,000
your grow we're using it with all of our

1868
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,519
slow recommendations

1869
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:04,440
now instead of you know more traditional

1870
01:08:02,519 --> 01:08:06,679
agricultural lime oyster shell flow

1871
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:09,119
things like that as a way of it doesn't

1872
01:08:06,679 --> 01:08:12,399
move the needle on ph up quite as much

1873
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:14,760
but it does allow us to get more calcium

1874
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:18,480
silica very affordably into the media

1875
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:20,159
yeah yeah yeah you know silica really

1876
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:22,678
goes a long way with eliminating powdery

1877
01:08:20,158 --> 01:08:24,079
mildew and some other species as well so

1878
01:08:22,679 --> 01:08:25,560
you know you really I don't think really

1879
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:26,838
need to apply that much into the

1880
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,679
substrate or you don't really need to

1881
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:30,838
mix that much in but you know just a

1882
01:08:28,679 --> 01:08:33,798
little bit will go a long way um I think

1883
01:08:30,838 --> 01:08:35,960
it's probably for a large scale grower

1884
01:08:33,798 --> 01:08:37,439
it's more practical to just mix it um

1885
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:39,000
into the substrate or potentially do a

1886
01:08:37,439 --> 01:08:40,960
drench but for the home grower you know

1887
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:42,759
I think you can just take your standard

1888
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,399
um substrate or meter that you're using

1889
01:08:42,759 --> 01:08:45,798
and just you know take a handful of your

1890
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,719
last tonight and just kind of mix it in

1891
01:08:45,798 --> 01:08:52,880
and fill your pots with

1892
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:54,520
that yeah yeah awesome um well that kind

1893
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:57,319
of covered the research that I'm aware

1894
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:58,640
of that you've done is there other

1895
01:08:57,319 --> 01:09:00,600
research or information that you want to

1896
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:02,000
share with Growers or we can always uh

1897
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:04,159
we can always do another podcast here

1898
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,920
down the road when you have more more

1899
01:09:04,158 --> 01:09:09,119
information to share yeah um you know we

1900
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:11,880
did a number of flushing experiments too

1901
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:15,238
um oh that's yeah yeah you know I think

1902
01:09:11,880 --> 01:09:17,079
the the interest with uh flushing is

1903
01:09:15,238 --> 01:09:19,000
that the there's a lot of canvas Growers

1904
01:09:17,079 --> 01:09:20,798
using very very expensive fertilizers

1905
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,520
the you know the Athena kind of a

1906
01:09:20,798 --> 01:09:24,519
nutrients the ones that have cute labels

1907
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:26,000
on them and stuff that they aren't any

1908
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,839
different than going down to your you

1909
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,399
know your your local Farm star and

1910
01:09:27,838 --> 01:09:33,198
buying the the salt yourself um you know

1911
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:35,679
there anything for saying

1912
01:09:33,198 --> 01:09:38,000
that if there's anything I can say on an

1913
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:40,679
air to an audience is please if you are

1914
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:42,399
buying a product that is only s sold to

1915
01:09:40,679 --> 01:09:43,880
Canabis Growers please stop buying it

1916
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,198
you're wasting your money completely you

1917
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:47,880
can go buy any other product that's used

1918
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:51,000
to grow other crops and used on Canabis

1919
01:09:47,880 --> 01:09:52,319
and it's just fine it's no problem um

1920
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:53,838
and so that's kind of the one of the

1921
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:55,400
biggest I think benefits with with

1922
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:57,000
flushing though is the Growers that are

1923
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:58,679
on it they're looking at it it's like

1924
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,560
well [ __ ] I can cut out one or two weeks

1925
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:02,199
of fertilizer which is a substantial

1926
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:04,960
cost and then you know still get a

1927
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,519
pretty good yield um I think from the

1928
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,719
experiments that we've done that you

1929
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:10,080
know flushing one to two weeks you will

1930
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:12,319
once you get to about two weeks flushing

1931
01:10:10,079 --> 01:10:14,880
you do start negatively affecting yield

1932
01:10:12,319 --> 01:10:16,880
um but you know there it's not too bad

1933
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:18,520
of a loss and that there's also some

1934
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,920
potential increases in the smoking

1935
01:10:18,520 --> 01:10:22,000
quality that we never got to do because

1936
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:24,279
you know human clinical trials are

1937
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:27,198
highly regulated especially with

1938
01:10:24,279 --> 01:10:28,519
University and such and that's that's

1939
01:10:27,198 --> 01:10:29,919
one area that I think the flushing

1940
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,400
research you know at least from the

1941
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,440
studies that we've done we've shown

1942
01:10:31,399 --> 01:10:35,679
pretty well how it affects the flower

1943
01:10:33,439 --> 01:10:37,599
mass and the cannaboids but the the

1944
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,119
smoking quality is really just that is

1945
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:41,480
the big mystery right now and I think

1946
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:44,238
that's a huge area for future

1947
01:10:41,479 --> 01:10:46,519
research So when you say flushing let's

1948
01:10:44,238 --> 01:10:49,079
just clarify for well one thing I want

1949
01:10:46,520 --> 01:10:51,000
to clarify is yes you can Abol look to

1950
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:54,519
traditional egg or other egg resources

1951
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:58,238
for nutrients especially on the chemical

1952
01:10:54,520 --> 01:11:00,360
side mineral salt side um but be aware

1953
01:10:58,238 --> 01:11:02,238
that you still have to be cautious of

1954
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:04,759
heavy metal content and you may they may

1955
01:11:02,238 --> 01:11:07,119
not be as clean for depending on the

1956
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:08,760
regulatory bodies of your state um they

1957
01:11:07,119 --> 01:11:10,479
may have higher levels of arsenic lead

1958
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:11,760
things like that they could raise the

1959
01:11:10,479 --> 01:11:14,519
risk it's just something I think people

1960
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:16,760
need to be cautious of with wherever

1961
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,800
they Source their nutrients but I I

1962
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:20,840
totally agree with you that the canvas

1963
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:24,039
industry is ripe with marketing and hype

1964
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:25,880
that they're overpaying you know

1965
01:11:24,039 --> 01:11:27,640
phosphoric acid is phosphoric acid

1966
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:30,119
nitrates are nitrates the plant cannot

1967
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,719
tell the difference whether you know

1968
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:34,920
there was a fancy label on the product

1969
01:11:31,719 --> 01:11:36,359
or not so yes yeah I wantan to I want to

1970
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:38,319
just highlight that because that that

1971
01:11:36,359 --> 01:11:41,079
was a really good point you brought up

1972
01:11:38,319 --> 01:11:42,119
um but getting back to the flushing so

1973
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,679
when you're talking about flushing

1974
01:11:42,119 --> 01:11:46,679
you're talking about growing with

1975
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:49,760
mineral salts chemically chemical you

1976
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:53,039
know in rock wol or cocoa or something

1977
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:57,199
like that um and then running water

1978
01:11:53,039 --> 01:12:00,760
through it to remove any nutrients any

1979
01:11:57,198 --> 01:12:03,519
ionic salts from the media as a way of

1980
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:06,480
crop steering or creating a a plant

1981
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:08,280
stress is that is that right yeah yeah

1982
01:12:06,479 --> 01:12:13,158
so we would uh we grew all of our plants

1983
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:14,679
in peep based media um and so yeah how

1984
01:12:13,158 --> 01:12:16,759
we would apply our flushing treatments

1985
01:12:14,679 --> 01:12:19,119
is that we would um put trip emitters

1986
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:22,159
into the top of the substrate uh past

1987
01:12:19,119 --> 01:12:24,599
Clear Water usually about 15 to 20 L was

1988
01:12:22,158 --> 01:12:26,719
enough to drop the EC down but you pass

1989
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:28,880
the water through until you get a low

1990
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:30,960
substrate EC so the idea is removing all

1991
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,800
the mineral nutrients from the substrate

1992
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:34,960
so the plant is really only getting

1993
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:37,880
exposed to water you know just water to

1994
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,800
keep it alive um until you harvest the

1995
01:12:37,880 --> 01:12:42,440
water you know in Clemson water is

1996
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:44,719
fairly pure there uh when I say pure it

1997
01:12:42,439 --> 01:12:46,719
means you know no calcium magnesium and

1998
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:48,119
other things are naturally in water U

1999
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,119
but that depends on the area that you're

2000
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:51,639
in but that's the base idea is remove

2001
01:12:50,119 --> 01:12:53,479
all the nutrients from the substrate and

2002
01:12:51,639 --> 01:12:55,800
let the plant finish with just whatever

2003
01:12:53,479 --> 01:12:58,559
is already inside of its plant

2004
01:12:55,800 --> 01:13:00,079
body yeah and what when are are you

2005
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:03,560
doing it at the end of the flowering

2006
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:05,439
cycle then yeah so we did uh up to four

2007
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,000
weeks before Harvest and so we always

2008
01:13:05,439 --> 01:13:09,638
Harvest at week eight and so that means

2009
01:13:07,000 --> 01:13:11,238
for for our four-week treatment that's

2010
01:13:09,639 --> 01:13:13,920
half the plant life cycle is without

2011
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:16,519
fertilizer wow um and surprisingly the

2012
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:18,199
ones that were flushed for four weeks um

2013
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:20,639
they the flowers look really nice

2014
01:13:18,198 --> 01:13:22,079
actually um you know and the trim the

2015
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,880
the bra all around the flower were

2016
01:13:22,079 --> 01:13:26,158
really small the yields were lower for

2017
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:27,800
sure but you know the the the bracks and

2018
01:13:26,158 --> 01:13:29,399
the trim were much smaller the flowers

2019
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,119
were much more round and you know it

2020
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:34,238
actually looked like a fairly nice

2021
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:35,840
product just your yields were

2022
01:13:34,238 --> 01:13:37,399
garbage yeah yeah they were

2023
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:40,199
significantly lower than they were with

2024
01:13:37,399 --> 01:13:42,359
the control um what I found is now our

2025
01:13:40,198 --> 01:13:43,678
flesh is very aggressive where you are

2026
01:13:42,359 --> 01:13:45,359
you know pouring water through the

2027
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,079
substrate and removing everything some

2028
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,559
Growers just switch to clear water so

2029
01:13:47,079 --> 01:13:51,000
that way there's still some nutrients in

2030
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:52,760
the substrate you know as they progress

2031
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:54,840
uh we were removing everything right

2032
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:57,239
when we started the flushing treatments

2033
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:59,639
um and so even with that aggressive of a

2034
01:13:57,238 --> 01:14:01,759
flush the one we flush didn't infect

2035
01:13:59,639 --> 01:14:05,319
yield at all um and we've done a number

2036
01:14:01,760 --> 01:14:07,600
of experiments um but the twoe flush

2037
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:10,799
sorry did the onee yield have any impact

2038
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:14,400
whatsoever did it help did it not help

2039
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:15,800
like no Impact versus no impact at all

2040
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:17,920
okay between that and the control which

2041
01:14:15,800 --> 01:14:19,600
was given fertilizer the whole time no

2042
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:21,760
difference which might also tell you

2043
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,000
that you know by week seven of flowering

2044
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,560
that the plants really insensitive to

2045
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:27,479
you know changes in the substrate in

2046
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,679
that last week of flowering So based off

2047
01:14:27,479 --> 01:14:30,519
your research no one should be

2048
01:14:28,679 --> 01:14:32,319
fertilizing the last week if you're if

2049
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:34,960
you're growing with chemical mineral

2050
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:36,719
salts because you're just wasting

2051
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:39,399
nutrients yeah I think there's some

2052
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:41,198
potential to yeah yeah yeah you know I'm

2053
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:42,879
always for Trying to minimize any input

2054
01:14:41,198 --> 01:14:44,079
because every input costs more money

2055
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:47,880
right and we're always trying to cut

2056
01:14:44,079 --> 01:14:49,800
cost Crop Production yeah um from now

2057
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:51,199
this was only with the one variety but I

2058
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,560
think you know there's some substantial

2059
01:14:51,198 --> 01:14:54,119
benefit that you know if you're if

2060
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:56,440
you're looking to cut back on what your

2061
01:14:54,119 --> 01:14:57,439
inputs are a onewe flush should be okay

2062
01:14:56,439 --> 01:14:58,359
but you know I don't want to promise

2063
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:00,399
anything

2064
01:14:58,359 --> 01:15:02,238
there yeah it's it's something though I

2065
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:04,599
think that's people should look into I

2066
01:15:02,238 --> 01:15:06,919
mean a week of nutrients I mean I think

2067
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:10,320
a lot of people already kind of do this

2068
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:12,719
at least a week already um but I think

2069
01:15:10,319 --> 01:15:13,799
it's something people should consider so

2070
01:15:12,719 --> 01:15:14,880
what happened when you moved it out to

2071
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,960
two

2072
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:19,159
weeks the yields went down um and that

2073
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:21,000
that's where it was a statistical

2074
01:15:19,158 --> 01:15:24,399
difference where is a statistically

2075
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:26,880
worse than the zero or one we flush

2076
01:15:24,399 --> 01:15:29,158
um now what's interesting too is that if

2077
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,639
you combine flushing with fertilizer

2078
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:32,238
restriction there's actually a

2079
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:34,039
substantial amount of fertilizer you can

2080
01:15:32,238 --> 01:15:35,439
cut out from each crop cycle you know if

2081
01:15:34,039 --> 01:15:36,840
you do one week of fertilizer

2082
01:15:35,439 --> 01:15:38,759
restriction at the start and then one

2083
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,600
week flush at the end well then really

2084
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:42,520
you're only providing fertilizer for six

2085
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:43,840
weeks in the middle and that helps you

2086
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:45,840
curtail some of the stretch at the

2087
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:47,440
beginning and also helps you you know

2088
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,319
potentially improve the smoking quality

2089
01:15:47,439 --> 01:15:51,960
and all the things that you know canvas

2090
01:15:49,319 --> 01:15:53,599
G seem to believe that does which you

2091
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:56,760
know I have I have no data to say one

2092
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,639
way or the other but sure yeah and when

2093
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:01,560
you're flushing midcycle you're not

2094
01:15:58,639 --> 01:16:03,880
removing any nutrients from the plant

2095
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:06,039
itself like nutrients are not flowing

2096
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,039
back out of the roots and and or

2097
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:10,960
anything like that but what you are

2098
01:16:08,039 --> 01:16:14,439
doing is reducing the amount of further

2099
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:17,560
nutrient uptake which people may say you

2100
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:20,599
know ex excessive nitrates could cause a

2101
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:22,199
harsher finished product um I typically

2102
01:16:20,600 --> 01:16:24,360
hear it associate with nitrates but I

2103
01:16:22,198 --> 01:16:25,638
suppose it could po apply to other

2104
01:16:24,359 --> 01:16:29,039
minerals as

2105
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:30,800
well yeah I've heard um amides as well

2106
01:16:29,039 --> 01:16:33,840
which is a nitrogen based compound as

2107
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:36,880
well um that I believe creates a more

2108
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:39,119
grassy or smell in some other crops as

2109
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:40,719
well um and so that's potentially

2110
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:43,479
another reason to get rid of nitrogen as

2111
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:45,920
you're going into the end of the Harvest

2112
01:16:43,479 --> 01:16:47,359
we had written me Jim and Alison Justice

2113
01:16:45,920 --> 01:16:48,960
we had written a flushing article last

2114
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:51,799
year on just you know what might be some

2115
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,439
of the applications of flushing and in a

2116
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:57,159
lot of crops you see that High nitrogen

2117
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:59,000
especially later in flowering increases

2118
01:16:57,158 --> 01:17:00,439
pest susceptibility so that could be

2119
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,039
another reason as well to get rid of a

2120
01:17:00,439 --> 01:17:03,319
little bit of fertilizer towards the end

2121
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:06,198
is just helping with a little bit of

2122
01:17:03,319 --> 01:17:08,238
pest pressure that way did you look at

2123
01:17:06,198 --> 01:17:10,839
just removing

2124
01:17:08,238 --> 01:17:12,799
nitrogen yeah so in terms of rather than

2125
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:14,840
flushing everything just flushing

2126
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:16,239
nitrogen yeah so not formally it won't

2127
01:17:14,840 --> 01:17:19,199
be published but I did some side

2128
01:17:16,238 --> 01:17:22,079
experiments with this what I did was um

2129
01:17:19,198 --> 01:17:23,519
I remove just nitrogen just phosphorus

2130
01:17:22,079 --> 01:17:25,600
the combination of nitrogen and

2131
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:27,199
phosphorus and then all nutrients and

2132
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:30,480
then also out of control that we gave

2133
01:17:27,198 --> 01:17:32,399
everything um cuz phosphorus is also

2134
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:35,079
associated with stretching it's not just

2135
01:17:32,399 --> 01:17:37,799
nitrogen um and so what it seemed like

2136
01:17:35,079 --> 01:17:40,000
was with if you remove the nitrogen or

2137
01:17:37,800 --> 01:17:41,480
phosphorus that it does help curtail

2138
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:45,039
some of the growth but not as much as

2139
01:17:41,479 --> 01:17:48,198
you if you remove both of them um to me

2140
01:17:45,039 --> 01:17:49,719
with the fertilizer restriction the the

2141
01:17:48,198 --> 01:17:51,919
best way to go about it would be to

2142
01:17:49,719 --> 01:17:53,560
remove nitrogen phosphorus for just that

2143
01:17:51,920 --> 01:17:55,199
first or second week but there's no

2144
01:17:53,560 --> 01:17:56,800
reason to cut off things like potassium

2145
01:17:55,198 --> 01:17:58,279
calcium sulfur you know why would you

2146
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,440
get rid of all those but for my

2147
01:17:58,279 --> 01:18:02,679
experiments it was just it was just

2148
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:05,279
easier to just go no fertilizer or

2149
01:18:02,679 --> 01:18:07,079
fertilizer okay yeah I mean if in a

2150
01:18:05,279 --> 01:18:09,800
perfect world I think keeping potassium

2151
01:18:07,079 --> 01:18:12,800
in there it's so critical for so many

2152
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:16,000
flowering development functions um

2153
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:17,600
related to yield that I yeah AB

2154
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:20,279
absolutely so that makes a lot of sense

2155
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:23,840
and that could be as simple as something

2156
01:18:20,279 --> 01:18:26,479
like pottassium sulfate

2157
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:29,239
you know gypsum calcium sulfate um those

2158
01:18:26,479 --> 01:18:32,799
sorts of things would still allow you to

2159
01:18:29,238 --> 01:18:35,279
keep you know keep those cat ions coming

2160
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:37,719
in but not uh you know eliminating

2161
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:40,319
nitrogen and and phosphorus yeah yeah

2162
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:41,639
absolutely we had seen with one now

2163
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:43,880
there's a recent study that's showing

2164
01:18:41,639 --> 01:18:46,119
that a lot of the tpin or the the Aromas

2165
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,239
that we desire with cannabis are largely

2166
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:49,719
linked to the sulfur-based compounds and

2167
01:18:48,238 --> 01:18:50,959
so that's where it's like with flushing

2168
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:52,520
it's like well are you sure you want to

2169
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,239
eliminate everything cuz you know

2170
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:55,840
potentially providing a little sulfur to

2171
01:18:54,238 --> 01:18:57,000
the end of this cycle maybe that's

2172
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,719
helpful for bringing out some of that

2173
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,319
skunky kind of rotten eggs and burnt

2174
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:03,198
mats kind of smell that we all love with

2175
01:19:01,319 --> 01:19:04,840
cannabis yeah and just to give you a

2176
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:06,559
little background I know you're not uh

2177
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,199
you hadn't heard of the podcast when you

2178
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:12,000
came on which I truly appreciate you

2179
01:19:08,198 --> 01:19:13,359
doing this um but uh my background and

2180
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:15,039
Company's background is really around

2181
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:17,639
what people are calling living soil

2182
01:19:15,039 --> 01:19:21,800
these days this idea of

2183
01:19:17,639 --> 01:19:23,840
organic media that's you know full of

2184
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:26,079
you know nutrients a time it's very

2185
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,480
biologically active and then we're doing

2186
01:19:26,079 --> 01:19:30,760
less nutrient management and feeding

2187
01:19:28,479 --> 01:19:32,718
during the cycle so we don't have a lot

2188
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:35,320
of these tools that you're talking about

2189
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:36,920
here um we're we're kind of giving the

2190
01:19:35,319 --> 01:19:39,198
plant

2191
01:19:36,920 --> 01:19:40,639
everything so in my head I'm I'm trying

2192
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,000
to think how some of these things might

2193
01:19:40,639 --> 01:19:45,279
apply to the style of growing that we

2194
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:46,279
like to do uh because you know one of

2195
01:19:45,279 --> 01:19:48,158
the things you talked about is

2196
01:19:46,279 --> 01:19:51,000
sustainability this idea if there's ways

2197
01:19:48,158 --> 01:19:52,359
to reuse your media and not have to move

2198
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:54,439
media in and out of your facility like

2199
01:19:52,359 --> 01:19:56,039
that can have a lot of Labor savings but

2200
01:19:54,439 --> 01:19:59,599
it also brings in a lot of pest and

2201
01:19:56,039 --> 01:20:00,880
pathogen risk and um risk around your

2202
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:04,520
crop if you're not managing your

2203
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:05,400
fertility properly so pros and cons but

2204
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:07,440
I just want to give you a little

2205
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:09,039
background because uh I'm approaching it

2206
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:10,319
from entirely different perspective as

2207
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:11,479
you are where you're able to Target

2208
01:20:10,319 --> 01:20:13,759
every single thing and you're you know

2209
01:20:11,479 --> 01:20:16,599
you're using mineral salts to really

2210
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:17,920
dial it all in yeah yeah absolutely and

2211
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:19,639
I think that's been one of the the

2212
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:21,760
biggest counterarguments that I've heard

2213
01:20:19,639 --> 01:20:23,359
with flushing you know supposedly

2214
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,560
improving the smoking quality

2215
01:20:23,359 --> 01:20:26,439
cuz you've heard you know we've all

2216
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:28,719
heard for years that the outdoor organic

2217
01:20:26,439 --> 01:20:30,479
cannabis is the the highest quality and

2218
01:20:28,719 --> 01:20:33,039
they don't flush so you know where is

2219
01:20:30,479 --> 01:20:35,158
that coming through um you know why is

2220
01:20:33,039 --> 01:20:36,560
it that only with you know maybe Soul

2221
01:20:35,158 --> 01:20:38,158
Source lighting environments or you know

2222
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:39,800
chemical based fertilizers are you

2223
01:20:38,158 --> 01:20:42,158
getting this benefit that you don't with

2224
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,079
Organic but who knows that would be a

2225
01:20:42,158 --> 01:20:46,198
good future study as

2226
01:20:44,079 --> 01:20:49,359
well yeah I mean there's definitely a

2227
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:51,960
preference in the market towards living

2228
01:20:49,359 --> 01:20:53,039
soil flour I think and part of that is

2229
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:54,439
just because there's so many people

2230
01:20:53,039 --> 01:20:57,158
growing with Athena you know it's like

2231
01:20:54,439 --> 01:20:58,559
do you want the same old expression the

2232
01:20:57,158 --> 01:21:00,279
same thing that everyone else is is

2233
01:20:58,560 --> 01:21:03,400
providing whereas living soil gives you

2234
01:21:00,279 --> 01:21:05,719
I think that that biological component

2235
01:21:03,399 --> 01:21:08,158
adds something that we can't quite

2236
01:21:05,719 --> 01:21:10,039
reproduce solely with chemicals just

2237
01:21:08,158 --> 01:21:13,319
that nutrient cycling and you're not

2238
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:15,560
forcing ionic salts into this plant um

2239
01:21:13,319 --> 01:21:17,158
the plant's controlling that process a

2240
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:19,560
lot more through the biological

2241
01:21:17,158 --> 01:21:22,079
interactions in the rizosphere that I

2242
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:24,960
think could lead to a unique you know

2243
01:21:22,079 --> 01:21:27,399
cannaboid intering expression versus you

2244
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:29,399
know just using the same essential

2245
01:21:27,399 --> 01:21:31,519
minerals that you get in a in a salt

2246
01:21:29,399 --> 01:21:33,319
program so yeah that's that's a good

2247
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:36,880
point that you brought up because we

2248
01:21:33,319 --> 01:21:38,679
really don't flush you know you can't

2249
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:40,239
yeah exactly yeah if you're a field

2250
01:21:38,679 --> 01:21:42,239
grower of course too how you going to

2251
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:43,599
flush too that's that's impossible it's

2252
01:21:42,238 --> 01:21:46,399
only possible if you're growing in

2253
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:48,600
containers you know in

2254
01:21:46,399 --> 01:21:52,119
inside yeah and I did just make a video

2255
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:53,920
on flushing um because in in the organic

2256
01:21:52,119 --> 01:21:55,719
soil the way we grow when I talk about

2257
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:58,840
fleshing what I'm talking about is after

2258
01:21:55,719 --> 01:22:00,480
the plants out of the soil or you know

2259
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:03,000
it's truly soiless media but out of

2260
01:22:00,479 --> 01:22:06,158
living soil we're we may want to flush

2261
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:08,198
the media to lower sodium and chlorides

2262
01:22:06,158 --> 01:22:10,238
but we're not doing it midcycle as a way

2263
01:22:08,198 --> 01:22:11,678
of crop steering or or stressing the

2264
01:22:10,238 --> 01:22:14,039
plant or removing nutrients because

2265
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:16,840
there's so much nutrients in the soil

2266
01:22:14,039 --> 01:22:18,679
you know we that we can't flush out mid

2267
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:20,880
cycle like you could with you know what

2268
01:22:18,679 --> 01:22:23,319
what you guys are doing yeah no that's

2269
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:25,600
interesting um yeah I have not done

2270
01:22:23,319 --> 01:22:27,039
anything with the living soil aspect U

2271
01:22:25,600 --> 01:22:28,600
but it's definitely very interesting to

2272
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:31,840
me I think there's going to be a ton of

2273
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:34,960
research opportunities for it see that's

2274
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:37,199
that's something I'm I'm less optimistic

2275
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:39,239
about I I I haven't seen a lot of

2276
01:22:37,198 --> 01:22:41,799
interest coming from researchers

2277
01:22:39,238 --> 01:22:46,678
regarding organic production and I

2278
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:49,000
totally get it because it's so hard to

2279
01:22:46,679 --> 01:22:52,119
control for all the variables when we

2280
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:54,679
add in biology and we add in you know

2281
01:22:52,119 --> 01:22:56,319
that natural nutrient cycling process

2282
01:22:54,679 --> 01:22:57,960
that I think it would be really hard to

2283
01:22:56,319 --> 01:23:00,639
get

2284
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:01,920
replicable data unless we want to just

2285
01:23:00,639 --> 01:23:06,279
go with a very

2286
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:07,840
broad conclusion you know um you know I

2287
01:23:06,279 --> 01:23:11,039
mean do you get what I'm saying like

2288
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:12,400
just everyone's compost is different so

2289
01:23:11,039 --> 01:23:16,639
like any research around that is going

2290
01:23:12,399 --> 01:23:18,359
to be super variable um it I just think

2291
01:23:16,639 --> 01:23:19,760
it's really challenging and I understand

2292
01:23:18,359 --> 01:23:21,198
why researchers wouldn't want to you

2293
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:23,520
know put their name on it versus

2294
01:23:21,198 --> 01:23:24,399
something where they can dial everything

2295
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,520
in

2296
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:28,960
exactly yeah I think it's a little

2297
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:30,520
easier to fund like uh kind of the

2298
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:32,560
greenhouse research we're doing now

2299
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:35,120
because yeah we can specifically

2300
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:37,039
manipulate individual variables um but

2301
01:23:35,119 --> 01:23:39,279
you know I see you know personally I

2302
01:23:37,039 --> 01:23:40,679
think the long-term Market with cannabis

2303
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:42,198
is that of course there's going to be

2304
01:23:40,679 --> 01:23:44,039
the the big Growers like there's going

2305
01:23:42,198 --> 01:23:45,399
to be a Marboro one day for cannabis

2306
01:23:44,039 --> 01:23:47,519
that's selling you know cannabis in

2307
01:23:45,399 --> 01:23:49,359
every state for as low cost as possible

2308
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,520
but there's also going to be a you know

2309
01:23:49,359 --> 01:23:52,799
very thriving um craft business just

2310
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,280
like there is with beer you have your

2311
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:56,400
Bud Lights you have your Budweisers and

2312
01:23:54,279 --> 01:23:57,719
Miller lights and all that you know junk

2313
01:23:56,399 --> 01:23:59,198
and then you have all these other

2314
01:23:57,719 --> 01:24:00,279
breweries and businesses that are you

2315
01:23:59,198 --> 01:24:02,119
know available as well that are

2316
01:24:00,279 --> 01:24:03,238
providing a much higher quality product

2317
01:24:02,119 --> 01:24:04,599
I think if you get enough of them

2318
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:06,319
together you know a certain area like

2319
01:24:04,600 --> 01:24:08,079
California or Oregon enough organic

2320
01:24:06,319 --> 01:24:09,679
Growers and potentially they could do

2321
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:10,639
something but yeah I think it's in the

2322
01:24:09,679 --> 01:24:12,279
short term it's definitely a little more

2323
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:14,400
challenging to put that research

2324
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:16,158
together yeah I mean we'll see a lot of

2325
01:24:14,399 --> 01:24:19,158
the big corporate canvas companies are

2326
01:24:16,158 --> 01:24:21,158
failing bedman just totally failed

2327
01:24:19,158 --> 01:24:23,238
recently and I think that's

2328
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:24,559
interesting I think people are finding

2329
01:24:23,238 --> 01:24:27,718
there's a lot more to Growing this crop

2330
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:30,039
on scale than they realized and uh I

2331
01:24:27,719 --> 01:24:34,399
think there's also like you said there's

2332
01:24:30,039 --> 01:24:37,880
there is more demand in the market for

2333
01:24:34,399 --> 01:24:40,638
craft flour still but I think our

2334
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:43,000
Market's still maturing so who knows you

2335
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:45,359
you could be right we we will see in

2336
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:48,319
legalization you never really know I

2337
01:24:45,359 --> 01:24:49,839
don't try to guess at it yeah yeah it's

2338
01:24:48,319 --> 01:24:51,359
not surprising me to see like a company

2339
01:24:49,840 --> 01:24:52,960
like Med men fail because you know there

2340
01:24:51,359 --> 01:24:55,639
there's companies out there that have no

2341
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:56,840
regard for what it costs to grow a crop

2342
01:24:55,639 --> 01:24:58,279
and that's something my adviser has

2343
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,039
drilled into my head from the day I

2344
01:24:58,279 --> 01:25:01,840
started graduate research is that you

2345
01:25:00,039 --> 01:25:04,000
have to be focused on every aspect of

2346
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,000
the cost for growing any plant and if

2347
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,679
you are ignoring that the labor the

2348
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,039
trimming and you know the substrate

2349
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:10,679
fertilizers and everything you're

2350
01:25:09,039 --> 01:25:12,840
setting yourself up for

2351
01:25:10,679 --> 01:25:14,279
failure yeah I I totally agree with you

2352
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:16,719
and I do agree that the cost of

2353
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:18,519
production has to come down because the

2354
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:20,158
value of the crop is coming down

2355
01:25:18,520 --> 01:25:22,760
absolutely the more we produce the less

2356
01:25:20,158 --> 01:25:23,960
it's worth and the less it's worth the

2357
01:25:22,760 --> 01:25:25,760
more efficient you have to be as a

2358
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,800
grower I mean I'm in Washington state

2359
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:30,360
where we've had legal recreational

2360
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:32,880
cannabis for you know one of the longest

2361
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:34,559
running States now in the country and so

2362
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:36,079
our Market is much more mature than some

2363
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,199
of these other you know newly

2364
01:25:36,079 --> 01:25:39,880
established markets and that's what

2365
01:25:37,198 --> 01:25:41,319
we've seen is that you have to be a good

2366
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:42,960
grower the people who are surviving are

2367
01:25:41,319 --> 01:25:45,439
the ones that are either producing top

2368
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,679
quality cannabis you know relatively

2369
01:25:45,439 --> 01:25:49,960
affordably or they're just pumping it

2370
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:52,920
out and you can go to to the dispensary

2371
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:54,960
and get you know $60 ounces the

2372
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:56,158
you know pretty low quality product but

2373
01:25:54,960 --> 01:25:57,359
some people just that that's what

2374
01:25:56,158 --> 01:25:59,279
they're looking for so you kind of have

2375
01:25:57,359 --> 01:26:00,679
to fall into one of those two camps yeah

2376
01:25:59,279 --> 01:26:02,679
absolutely it's a it's a race to the

2377
01:26:00,679 --> 01:26:04,520
bottom that's happening now with you

2378
01:26:02,679 --> 01:26:05,639
know in any state and it's you know it's

2379
01:26:04,520 --> 01:26:07,360
a race to the bottom that's happened

2380
01:26:05,639 --> 01:26:08,719
with every other crop like Point St is

2381
01:26:07,359 --> 01:26:11,519
you know a grower might make a couple

2382
01:26:08,719 --> 01:26:13,118
pennies per plant um and really a lot of

2383
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,400
times points ideas are only grown is

2384
01:26:13,118 --> 01:26:16,118
just so they can keep their labor

2385
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:17,198
employed for the rest of the year

2386
01:26:16,118 --> 01:26:18,599
because they make more of their money on

2387
01:26:17,198 --> 01:26:20,960
the bedding and spring

2388
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:23,119
plants yeah I'm good friends with uh

2389
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,520
Suzanne wingright Evans bug lady I don't

2390
01:26:23,118 --> 01:26:28,839
know if you you're familiar with her

2391
01:26:25,520 --> 01:26:31,040
she's amazing entomologist um and she

2392
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:32,719
talks about that and it blows my mind

2393
01:26:31,039 --> 01:26:35,198
that uh you know the difference is

2394
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:37,679
pennies and so from her perspective on

2395
01:26:35,198 --> 01:26:41,678
the entomology side you have they have

2396
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:43,920
to be so dialed in with their uh IPM

2397
01:26:41,679 --> 01:26:47,158
program because we are talking pennies

2398
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:49,199
per plant that uh you know if if they're

2399
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:51,799
doing something you need to pay

2400
01:26:49,198 --> 01:26:53,319
attention because uh it's probably there

2401
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,960
there's a reason behind it I guess is

2402
01:26:53,319 --> 01:26:57,479
what I'm getting at yeah yeah there's

2403
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:59,239
there's a lot to be learned I think in

2404
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:01,158
the canvas industry from other Growers

2405
01:26:59,238 --> 01:27:02,959
and it's as simple is just you know go

2406
01:27:01,158 --> 01:27:04,920
take a tour at a you know Metrolina kind

2407
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:06,800
of facility where they're growing plants

2408
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,279
at scale you know a few hundred acres

2409
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:09,880
you know that's the techniques and

2410
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:11,359
practices that they're using is what you

2411
01:27:09,880 --> 01:27:13,079
know cannabis Growers will for sure need

2412
01:27:11,359 --> 01:27:15,319
to adapt

2413
01:27:13,079 --> 01:27:16,880
to awesome well hey I I really

2414
01:27:15,319 --> 01:27:18,679
appreciate your time today I would love

2415
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:21,279
to follow up with you down the road the

2416
01:27:18,679 --> 01:27:22,840
more research as it comes available um

2417
01:27:21,279 --> 01:27:25,599
and I'd love to remote and share what

2418
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:27,400
you're doing um as as your research is

2419
01:27:25,600 --> 01:27:29,960
published published so thank you for

2420
01:27:27,399 --> 01:27:31,960
your for your time today yeah absolutely

2421
01:27:29,960 --> 01:27:34,239
glad to be here um yeah I just took a

2422
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:35,719
job out here in uh Oregon so I'm happy

2423
01:27:34,238 --> 01:27:38,279
to be living on here on the West Coast

2424
01:27:35,719 --> 01:27:40,439
