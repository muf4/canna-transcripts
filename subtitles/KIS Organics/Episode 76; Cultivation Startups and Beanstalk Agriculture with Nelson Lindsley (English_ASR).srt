discuss the cutting edge of growing from

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,598
a science-based perspective

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,039
and drawn top experts from around the

9
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,000
industry to share their wisdom and

10
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:33,840

under poetry of plants

15
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:41,519
nelson has been cultivating cannabis for

16
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,359
over a decade and working in the

17
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,200
industry for over two decades

18
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:46,799
an artist by heart and an innovator by

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,320
trade he has worked with the majority of

20
00:00:46,799 --> 00:00:49,679
leading grow room technology and

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,558
techniques that are available on the

22
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:52,079
current market

23
00:00:50,558 --> 00:00:54,558
and studied their application for

24
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
efficient large-scale cultivation

25
00:00:54,558 --> 00:00:57,599
over the past three years he has

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
consulted on cultivation sites in

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,760
washington oregon colorado pennsylvania

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,439
and california

29
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:05,198
after working with nelson we have added

30
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:06,000
a couple of products to our product line

31
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:08,239
at kiss

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,239
we now have lighting from science leds

33
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,519
as well as offering beanstalk nutrients

34
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,798
on our website

35
00:01:11,519 --> 00:01:14,478
you know i put a lot of thought and

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,240
consideration into carrying this brand

37
00:01:14,478 --> 00:01:16,719
because it's not an organic nutrient

38
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:18,640
line

39
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:20,239
and while i'm an organic gardener myself

40
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,759
i realize that there are many folks who

41
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:22,879
are not and i want to offer what i

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,439
believe to be one of the most

43
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,959
sustainable chemical options for growers

44
00:01:25,438 --> 00:01:28,478
and we discussed some of those reasons

45
00:01:26,959 --> 00:01:30,078
in this podcast

46
00:01:28,478 --> 00:01:32,478

a fair while now uh but you've been a

62
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,240
popular guest

63
00:02:02,478 --> 00:02:05,438
do you want to fill in listeners on kind

64
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,478
of what you've been up to i think they

65
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:08,079
all kind of know your background a

66
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:11,598
little bit already so

67
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:15,120
what's been going on sure so

68
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:16,079
um the last year i've been working on

69
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,480
getting

70
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,959
a roughly 30 000 square foot canopy

71
00:02:20,479 --> 00:02:24,399
indoor canopy up in pittsburgh

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,920
pennsylvania with a company called my

73
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
tree genetics

74
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:29,280
uh that's been about eighty percent of

75
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:31,439
my focus

76
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,439
as far as uh things on the cultivation

77
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,359
side i've been working

78
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:36,959
uh so that's number one number two is

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,640
i've been working with

80
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,598
a lighting company called science

81
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:44,159
lighting doing some grow trials

82
00:02:41,598 --> 00:02:45,919
with their spectrum controllable lights

83
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,878
and number three i've been

84
00:02:45,919 --> 00:02:50,639
working on getting visibility for

85
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:52,959
beanstalk agriculture

86
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:54,799
which is a controlled release fertilizer

87
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,640
that i was a part of co-developing

88
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
and bringing to market with a few other

89
00:02:56,639 --> 00:03:00,878
great guys

90
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:02,000
so you've been really busy is what i'm

91
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,518
hearing and i want to talk about all

92
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,080
those things

93
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
so um why don't we start off talking a

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,280
little bit about

95
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:11,759
your experience uh with this facility

96
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,759
what's it like setting up a new facility

97
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:15,439
in a you know what it sounds like a

98
00:03:13,759 --> 00:03:16,840
fairly challenging state

99
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:19,039
uh you wanna just touch on that a little

100
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:22,560
bit sure

101
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:28,318
uh so in general

102
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:28,319
startup is uh is really challenging

103
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:31,039
you know because you're built you're

104
00:03:29,598 --> 00:03:32,318
building something right that's kind of

105
00:03:31,039 --> 00:03:33,759
how we're looking at it is you're

106
00:03:32,318 --> 00:03:36,000
building something

107
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:37,598
and you're not operating necessarily so

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,360
you're even when you're starting up

109
00:03:37,598 --> 00:03:42,959
operations you're still

110
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
in in building mode uh dialing things in

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,439
i kind of liken it to like building a

112
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,039
guitar and then

113
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:49,120
once you have the guitar built you put

114
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,079
strings on it and then you have to tune

115
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,360
the strings so

116
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,040
we're in the tuning the strings uh

117
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,400
mode and we did things a little bit

118
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:59,280
differently with this company is we

119
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,519
started out with a smaller canopy

120
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,519
we were required to do that by the state

121
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
that they have some funny rules

122
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
where you have to once you get your

123
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:09,039
occupancy permit

124
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,878
you have to have a harvest within six

125
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,479
months which doesn't factor in all the

126
00:04:10,878 --> 00:04:13,598
things that go into

127
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,840
building things out and getting

128
00:04:13,598 --> 00:04:18,159
everything kind of ready so we staged it

129
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,040
in a few phases so last year right

130
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,040
before

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,439
covet hit we started this phase one

132
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,319
grow which was about a thousand square

133
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:29,120
feet of canopy

134
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:30,399
where we did a bunch of seed hunting

135
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,079
while we were cleaning up all of our

136
00:04:30,399 --> 00:04:32,638
genetics and tissue culture and testing

137
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,000
everything

138
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,319
make sure it didn't have a vibroid or

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,319
bacteria so a lot of preliminary work

140
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:39,839
on the tissue culture plants so we just

141
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:41,680
started with a bunch of seeds from

142
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:43,439
compound in cannerado

143
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
and then hunted those out did a couple

144
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:47,918
of drops and

145
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
trained the core team and your covet hit

146
00:04:47,918 --> 00:04:51,599
and all of that so it just you know

147
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,759
essentially everybody here became

148
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,639
like an extension of my family because

149
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,919
we were

150
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,439
existing and living in a bubble uh

151
00:04:57,918 --> 00:05:01,038
you know which is because i've spent the

152
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,439
majority of the time out here not at

153
00:05:01,038 --> 00:05:04,319
home

154
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:05,120
because travel has been tough and the

155
00:05:04,319 --> 00:05:06,719
last

156
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,000
four to five months you know and this

157
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
all the building and the construction

158
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,319
was happening for the

159
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:14,240
uh first six larger flower rooms and

160
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:15,120
then as of last month we got those

161
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,240
flower rooms

162
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,199
up and going and uh you know it's

163
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,400
challenging

164
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:25,600
enough uh to get everything

165
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:28,638
operational on a timeline

166
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,840
that everybody uh sets up and it's it's

167
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,079
even harder

168
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:33,758
uh when things go wrong and you've got

169
00:05:32,079 --> 00:05:35,038
uh incredibly long lead times now

170
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,919
because some of these parts come from

171
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:37,360
china

172
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,758
some of them are calling coming from all

173
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,680
over and uh we've had

174
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,879
we have to we've had to become very

175
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,038
creative on

176
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:46,319
getting to this point with all the

177
00:05:45,038 --> 00:05:48,639
challenges

178
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:49,439
uh with supply chain with everything

179
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,400
else

180
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,519
so it's been a lot of fluid movement and

181
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:55,918
pivoting

182
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,359
and in hiring so we've we've created

183
00:05:55,918 --> 00:06:00,318
around 40 new jobs

184
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,280
in pittsburgh with this startup and then

185
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,840
going through

186
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:05,279
training and educating a lot of

187
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,359
non-cannabis

188
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:08,799
experienced individuals kind of bringing

189
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,038
them into the fold

190
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,400
and you know it's been great for me

191
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:13,918
because i've been doing this for a

192
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:16,318
little bit

193
00:06:13,918 --> 00:06:18,000
and coming to an area like pittsburgh

194
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:21,039
and working with a great company

195
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,519
that's focused on you know hiring uh

196
00:06:21,038 --> 00:06:25,120
diverse individuals trying to create

197
00:06:23,519 --> 00:06:27,359
like a male female balance

198
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,360
of 50 50 in the garden across the entire

199
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,919
company

200
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,280
you know it's been great to come in to

201
00:06:31,918 --> 00:06:35,439
this

202
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:37,038
this company with that kind of that kind

203
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:39,439
of thought process

204
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:40,959
and you know mission statement to be

205
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,240
inclusive in their hiring

206
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:46,879
and then also be in a

207
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,280
community that cannabis has not been you

208
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:51,199
know it's been tightly regulated and

209
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:52,719
for the last two years it's only been

210
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,520
you know legal medically

211
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,039
but it did not have you know 20 years of

212
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:59,120
medical like california

213
00:06:57,038 --> 00:07:00,800
so for everybody here it's really new

214
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
and really exciting

215
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,120
and it's been you know really refreshing

216
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,759
to

217
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,680
participate in that excitement and and

218
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,680
how exciting is for these people here to

219
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:14,000
be able to work with this plant

220
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
uh that's been probably the most fun

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,560
i've had

222
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,319
uh with the whole process so that's kind

223
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,319
of it

224
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,840
long and short of it i mean it's it's

225
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,919
it's challenging but rewarding is the

226
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:26,719
best way of putting it

227
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:27,839
yeah and i realize you know a project of

228
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,800
this scope

229
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,879
is probably more than we can really dive

230
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,800
into too much on the podcast

231
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:36,478
but are there any highlights or things

232
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,960
that you would you know

233
00:07:36,478 --> 00:07:40,079
looking back like things you wish you'd

234
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:43,279
known at the onset

235
00:07:40,079 --> 00:07:44,560
that uh you know you could maybe pass on

236
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:47,119
in terms of advice or

237
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,079
information you know to a listener

238
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,959
that's more broad possibly

239
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:54,639
yeah absolutely i would say that the

240
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:55,198
number one thing in having a successful

241
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:58,319
startup

242
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,280
is having open communication

243
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,000
uh on all levels of your staff and

244
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,399
management

245
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,360
i would say that anywhere that we've had

246
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:07,038
um

247
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,120
a failure has been because we haven't

248
00:08:07,038 --> 00:08:10,878
been communicating effectively

249
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,199
and creating those paths of

250
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,800
communication

251
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
where it's you know you have a hierarchy

252
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,319
as far as responsibility goes

253
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,479
but we're really trying to create an

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,400
open forum for anybody to kind of

255
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:25,439
communicate when they catch something

256
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:27,038
or something doesn't seem right some of

257
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:28,639
that can become challenging also when

258
00:08:27,038 --> 00:08:31,439
you're working with third parties like

259
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,479
uh contractors or consultants or things

260
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:36,320
like that

261
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,479
where they're not necessarily um as open

262
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,719
internally as you would be in if you're

263
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,200
within the same company to like just

264
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:44,640
communicate when things are coming up um

265
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
but that also highlights like why your

266
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:49,600
core team has to be

267
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:51,439
uh really in in a high level of

268
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,720
communication about every little detail

269
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
and there's ways of doing that without

270
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,399
having to have a thousand meetings

271
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,440
because meetings can take up your entire

272
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,519
day and then

273
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,720
you're just burned out and you can't you

274
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,919
then you have to move into action you're

275
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,040
already kind of

276
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:05,039
you know gone through all the brain

277
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:06,319
damage of like five meetings so we've

278
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:08,240
set up a lot of

279
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,640
uh we've got a handful of social media

280
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,639
apps that we use for our communication

281
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,919
and we have just systems that we set up

282
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,199
for communicating

283
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:17,039
all the little details that are coming

284
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,879
up all little questions

285
00:09:17,039 --> 00:09:20,159
and i'd say that that's that's the

286
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:21,679
biggest challenge is just getting

287
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:24,240
everybody on the same page

288
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:24,879
because you're gonna have you're gonna

289
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,360
have un

290
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,720
unknown challenges that pop up uh

291
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,159
getting things commissioned and the

292
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,639
commissioning process in case you don't

293
00:09:30,159 --> 00:09:32,639
know is

294
00:09:30,639 --> 00:09:34,799
you've got the facility built and then

295
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:36,159
you have to go into turning on all these

296
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:37,759
systems and ensuring that they're

297
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:39,600
meeting your set point

298
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:41,519
and when you're a cult if you're a

299
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,680
cultivator setting up a facility

300
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,759
what you have to provide the engineers

301
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:47,439
is your environmental set points how

302
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:49,360
much water is going in the room

303
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,120
you know all of these things that the

304
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,278
people that are programming

305
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,639
your environmental controls and if you

306
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,439
have a chiller plant something like that

307
00:09:54,639 --> 00:09:57,199
you have to program

308
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,800
in what that how that particular plant

309
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,879
is going to operate based on your

310
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:02,479
desired set points in the room

311
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:03,759
and you have to provide all this

312
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
information then you have to make sure

313
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:06,958
that

314
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,399
it's all working right and you know with

315
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,639
all the challenges you know

316
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,958
sometimes you don't get to have all of

317
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:15,439
that time to do all that testing

318
00:10:12,958 --> 00:10:16,639
and you know certain milestones kind of

319
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,640
overlapping others

320
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,480
so when you're trying to do multiple

321
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:22,799
things at one time

322
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,600
it's you know it's really important that

323
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:25,679
you just over

324
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,040
communicate with everybody and that's

325
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:28,159
been probably the biggest lesson that

326
00:10:27,039 --> 00:10:30,879
i've learned

327
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:31,439
is just to constantly communicate try

328
00:10:30,879 --> 00:10:33,838
not to

329
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,880
micromanage uh you know we've kind of

330
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,600
dissolved

331
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:38,320
the hierarchy approach as far as how

332
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,120
information

333
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,839
gets to the owners of the company and

334
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,278
we've created

335
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,040
you know channels for anybody to bring

336
00:10:43,278 --> 00:10:47,838
things up as needed as we're getting

337
00:10:45,039 --> 00:10:47,838
things started up

338
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:54,559
yeah i mean i think that communications

339
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:56,320
the biggest thing especially challenging

340
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:57,919
too for people who really are growers

341
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,079
and are used to growing around plants

342
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:02,639
you know things that don't talk back

343
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:03,919
pass on emotions and and have like you

344
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:06,958
know life experiences

345
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:08,078
and it can be really hard i know uh for

346
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,838
us

347
00:11:08,078 --> 00:11:11,759
shrinking the business down was actually

348
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
the best thing we ever could have done

349
00:11:11,759 --> 00:11:15,600
uh from a stress perspective from a

350
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:17,439
communication perspective i mean i talk

351
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
to everyone in our company right now

352
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,640
every day

353
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,519
pretty much um you know sometimes it's

354
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:23,600
little but

355
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:25,039
uh you know we only meet once a week and

356
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,440
to me that's

357
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:28,240
enough but i do think i totally agree

358
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,480
with you that

359
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,000
communication is key because if you're

360
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,480
not all on the same page it's

361
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,399
uh it's nearly impossible as the scope

362
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,079
of the project grows to

363
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,919
really be successful or get anything

364
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:42,559
done

365
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:43,439
yeah i agree with that uh part of the

366
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:44,639
you know

367
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
you know what i've been doing in the

368
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:47,919
past is you know consulting or having my

369
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:49,919
own garden

370
00:11:47,919 --> 00:11:51,360
and i have a couple of guys that i work

371
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,679
with but

372
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,360
having to be responsible for the

373
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:58,479
coordination of so many people

374
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,440
so many more people uh you know really

375
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,200
really requires uh having dialogue and

376
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,040
really connecting with everybody and i

377
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,399
look at it as

378
00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:09,039
you know the staff here is watering the

379
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:12,000
garden

380
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:13,120
you know metaphorically and literally

381
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,120
and i'm

382
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,320
i'm here to water their garden and what

383
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,278
i mean by that is i'm here to help

384
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,399
support them

385
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,919
find purpose find their own skill set

386
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:24,958
find their own leadership

387
00:12:21,919 --> 00:12:27,439
so they can um you know

388
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,000
improve their quality of life so it's

389
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,399
it's

390
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,679
it's looking at not to minimize human

391
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,600
beings you know i'm always kind of

392
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:36,159
comparing everything into the garden but

393
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,440
i'm just you know there's a different um

394
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,078
skill set that i'm learning that really

395
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,279
has to do

396
00:12:38,078 --> 00:12:43,120
with um cultivating relationships

397
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,240
cultivating communication and helping

398
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
people that are coming in that are

399
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,759
younger

400
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,759
that want to be in the cannabis space uh

401
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:50,879
that are hungry for that they're excited

402
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:53,838
to be a part of it

403
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:54,399
and really helping support them in their

404
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,000
journey

405
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,759
in this space and doing it in a way

406
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,240
where it it

407
00:12:57,759 --> 00:13:02,399
it's it's an awesome path forward

408
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,919
because i've seen a lot of

409
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,440
a lot of gardens and a lot of growers

410
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:06,479
where people are just burned out and not

411
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,279
happy

412
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:11,200
and i think that you know that's always

413
00:13:09,278 --> 00:13:14,000
going to reflect in the final product

414
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,440
and one of the issues with scale is that

415
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,278
there's a lot of big gardens with a

416
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,040
bunch of unhappy people

417
00:13:17,278 --> 00:13:20,399
and what we're trying to do here is

418
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:23,519
we're trying to

419
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,839
figure out how to scale the garden and

420
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,759
and create wellness with people where

421
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,360
people love coming to work they love

422
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:30,879
they they get to experience the joy of

423
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:34,079
working in the garden

424
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:36,078
um every day you know and and

425
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:37,199
that's that's really what i think we're

426
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:39,120
creating here

427
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,959
and i've had the support of this company

428
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,039
to create something that i've hoped

429
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:45,439
would emerge out of this space whereas

430
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:49,278
it's really been kind of a bumpy

431
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,800
initial road um i think culturally and i

432
00:13:49,278 --> 00:13:52,559
think business wise and i think part of

433
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:54,479
that is because the focus the target has

434
00:13:52,559 --> 00:13:57,119
been off it's been about profit

435
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,839
it hasn't been about uh quality of life

436
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,039
people

437
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:06,079
or quality and i i think that

438
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:08,480
in the long term and probably in

439
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:11,359
the short term having shifting the focus

440
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:13,759
away from just short-term gains and into

441
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,278
creating just an epic place to be and

442
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,078
work and do good things and create

443
00:14:15,278 --> 00:14:18,879
quality products

444
00:14:16,078 --> 00:14:20,239
is going to pay more dividends and then

445
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:22,799
trying to come in

446
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,240
you know inflate your value and run that

447
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:26,479
whole kind of game

448
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,600
um you know with the stock market and

449
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,278
everything else we're kind of starting

450
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,959
to see get exposed now

451
00:14:29,278 --> 00:14:32,320
uh but you know that's been present in

452
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:34,399
the cannabis industry for the like

453
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,839
last eight years where it's just been

454
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,720
pretty awful and

455
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,839
that really will uh that really rolls

456
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,240
downhill

457
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
to the employees and they feel that so

458
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,198
we're trying to you know with my tree

459
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:46,719
we're trying to do something different

460
00:14:45,198 --> 00:14:47,919
i'm learning a lot i've got great

461
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,800
mentors here

462
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:52,879
that are teaching me about how to be a

463
00:14:50,799 --> 00:14:54,799
you know a better people person

464
00:14:52,879 --> 00:14:56,838
and a better leader and you know leading

465
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:59,759
from the heart and leading from

466
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,440
communication so it's cool to see that

467
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:04,480
in an actual company in the cannabis

468
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,480
industry say the very least

469
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:09,039
yeah i know for for us uh

470
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,800
that's been the that's been the biggest

471
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:11,360
challenge slack's been a really cool

472
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:13,838
tool

473
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,800
for us to use in terms of that's what we

474
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,480
use

475
00:15:14,799 --> 00:15:18,399
yeah having these different channels you

476
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
know so like we even have a random

477
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,159
channel where right now we're discussing

478
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:25,519
what's going on with reddit and

479
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:26,000
uh the stock market and you know talking

480
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,240
about things

481
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
along those lines or you know current

482
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
current events i guess

483
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,440
and that's optional not everyone has to

484
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:35,198
participate but it's a way to connect

485
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,880
when we're all so disconnected right now

486
00:15:35,198 --> 00:15:38,719
with covet going on

487
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:40,078
uh and then we have other channels that

488
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,879
are around you know what's going on with

489
00:15:40,078 --> 00:15:43,359
research

490
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:44,799
what's going on around you know sales or

491
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,320
customers so that like if we have a

492
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:48,479
customer issue we can put it up in there

493
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,399
right away and we can all address it now

494
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,399
i realize for a cultivation team that's

495
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,278
a little bit different in terms of what

496
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,480
channels make sense but uh it's been

497
00:15:55,278 --> 00:15:58,078
it's been a great tool for us

498
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
i i don't know what you said you're

499
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:02,000
using slack too it sounds like

500
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,198
yeah yeah because i'm sure people are

501
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,519
gonna be curious so

502
00:16:03,198 --> 00:16:07,039
uh the software or the apps that we

503
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,759
found that work the best

504
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:10,159
is slack for all the communication and

505
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,639
then

506
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:13,838
mondays uh for the scheduling and

507
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,278
project management

508
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,680
and they you can pro you can populate

509
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:20,399
changes in mondays into slack so mondays

510
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:22,799
uh

511
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,120
you know as a module for slack that's

512
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,519
awesome so if i go in and slack is you

513
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,198
know

514
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:29,278
just really intuitive easy to use

515
00:16:27,198 --> 00:16:31,519
project management software

516
00:16:29,278 --> 00:16:33,360
that's like colorful and intuitive it

517
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,799
kind of looks like a kids app but it has

518
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
a lot of functionality

519
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:38,000
and so it's easy for anybody to kind of

520
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,278
jump in and be able to see where

521
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
everything's at there's a bunch of

522
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:43,679
different viewing modes

523
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:46,000
from just a basic project overview to

524
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:48,638
calendars and timeline and gantt charts

525
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,120
all that it's very deep and then when

526
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,519
you

527
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,519
are making adjustments to the schedule

528
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,120
uh you know it lets you you know even if

529
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,159
you're in a task and you get stuck or

530
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,360
it's completed or get

531
00:16:56,159 --> 00:17:03,519
auto populated to the slack channel uh

532
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,759
that correlates to uh that monday's

533
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:08,000
project so i basically set up different

534
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:10,318
project boards for each room

535
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,599
and uh those will auto populate to the

536
00:17:10,318 --> 00:17:13,119
channel that we have on slack that's

537
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,159
dedicated to the room so we

538
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:18,719
we organize it uh we organize our slack

539
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:21,199
and our mondays based off of spaces

540
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,000
and then we have management channels so

541
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,240
anybody that

542
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,880
uh has activities or objectives and

543
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,798
those spaces will have access to them

544
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,080
then we have like a scouting channel and

545
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:32,879
of course we have

546
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:33,839
a meme channel so the staff can meme

547
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,720
each other

548
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:37,519
and i asked the staff to uh you know

549
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,839
right now that

550
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:41,519
say there's one employee that we have

551
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:43,439
that has like topped my memes

552
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:44,720
but we we we have like a friendly meme

553
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,480
challenge where we'll

554
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,400
meme each other and it keeps everything

555
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,079
kind of light-hearted

556
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,519
and we're you know we can't take you

557
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,480
can't take yourself too seriously when

558
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:54,558
you're growing

559
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,000
you know cannabis like the whole part of

560
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,879
this is for us to

561
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,880
enjoy life so we create that place for

562
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:02,480
people will be creative and kind of uh

563
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,120
you know walk the line per se which is

564
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,640
kind of what i i do all the time

565
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:08,319
yeah so this is where you and miami

566
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:11,759
mango are getting all your ammo

567
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:14,558
it's this yeah meme champ right totally

568
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:15,519
the meme channel yeah yeah the only

569
00:18:14,558 --> 00:18:18,079
thing i want to add to this

570
00:18:15,519 --> 00:18:19,038
is uh you know if you are cultivating on

571
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:21,839
it with a team

572
00:18:19,038 --> 00:18:23,038
of growers and you are in a position a

573
00:18:21,839 --> 00:18:24,959
leadership position

574
00:18:23,038 --> 00:18:26,240
um i think the two biggest things i

575
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,400
found that helped me are kind of

576
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,480
really obvious but giving people a sense

577
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
of purpose and a sense of ownership are

578
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
the two things that i found have really

579
00:18:32,558 --> 00:18:36,079
made a difference because as your scope

580
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,120
of company or

581
00:18:36,079 --> 00:18:40,480
or cultivation uh expands you can't

582
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,678
do everything you can't be the one

583
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,919
watering the plants so you have to give

584
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,400
people not only the structure and tools

585
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,400
and the sops to do it well and do it the

586
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,600
way it should be done but also the

587
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,640
ownership

588
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:54,240
and you know the sense of

589
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,520
sense of value in what they're doing to

590
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,400
where they want to speak up and they'll

591
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:58,319
want to do a good job

592
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,320
and and realize that their part in this

593
00:18:58,319 --> 00:19:02,639
company is is really important

594
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:03,519
so i just want to throw that in yeah

595
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,038
yeah i know that

596
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:09,279
i'm i'm 100 with you on it um

597
00:19:07,038 --> 00:19:11,200
and that you know ownership and purpose

598
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:12,798
those two things work hand in hand

599
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,240
and that's gotta that's gotta carry all

600
00:19:12,798 --> 00:19:15,839
the way through and the company has to

601
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
have that commitment to the

602
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:19,759
staff of the employees as well i would

603
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,480
add one thing is i find a lot of

604
00:19:19,759 --> 00:19:22,798
companies

605
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,640
especially in cannabis uh we're always

606
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:26,960
chasing yield numbers

607
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,759
cannabinoid percentages well those are

608
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,840
results

609
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,798
uh and what i've learned is if you chase

610
00:19:29,839 --> 00:19:33,038
results

611
00:19:30,798 --> 00:19:34,240
uh you tend to fail but if you chase

612
00:19:33,038 --> 00:19:37,519
information

613
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,798
results follow so uh if your

614
00:19:37,519 --> 00:19:41,519
communication is

615
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:42,879
is solid you'll be able to have access

616
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:44,558
to all the information

617
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,559
that will end up leading to the results

618
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:47,599
that you desire but if you're constantly

619
00:19:46,558 --> 00:19:49,279
chasing results

620
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:51,359
and not collecting the data and the

621
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:52,000
information that's typically where all

622
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:53,918
the mistakes

623
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,240
occur and where the failures occur as

624
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,240
well

625
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,600
great i think that's a good segue off of

626
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,919
the facility stuff because i wanna i

627
00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:07,038
wanna save some time to talk about

628
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:08,880
uh nutrients specifically

629
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:10,480
what you're doing around with uh

630
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
beanstalk

631
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,599
um talk a little bit about what that is

632
00:20:12,558 --> 00:20:15,678
and i want to talk to you a little bit

633
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:17,439
because you guys are growing using

634
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,120
you know essentially a chemical nutrient

635
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,440
and you and i have had

636
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:23,839
long-winded discussions about the merits

637
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,880
and sustainability of chemicals

638
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:27,519
versus organic production and i talked a

639
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,440
little bit about

640
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,279
actually last podcast that i just put

641
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,880
out

642
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:35,519
today on with carrie dr carrie peters

643
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,320
about

644
00:20:35,519 --> 00:20:38,720
um you know the difference is there too

645
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,000
but

646
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,440
i would love for us to just spend like

647
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
maybe five ten minutes just touching a

648
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,798
little bit on that too

649
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,319
absolutely um and i've met kerry she's

650
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:49,679
awesome i've spoken to her a bunch men

651
00:20:48,319 --> 00:20:52,319
are at a convention

652
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,360
i think peters is a great company uh and

653
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:56,798
i've used their products

654
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:58,319
um a whole lot in the past uh so

655
00:20:56,798 --> 00:21:00,158
just a little of the background on

656
00:20:58,319 --> 00:21:03,599
beanstalk uh

657
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,919
2016 2017 i was

658
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,959
introduced uh to a few individuals that

659
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,400
were trying to get this

660
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,798
product off the ground which is a

661
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,960
controlled release fertilizer

662
00:21:10,798 --> 00:21:14,798
that's a little bit unique in its coding

663
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,360
the same technology

664
00:21:14,798 --> 00:21:18,798
that they developed that this company

665
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,158
behind the scenes these chemists

666
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:22,400
developed for

667
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,559
the nasa space international space

668
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,240
station and the nasa food program

669
00:21:24,558 --> 00:21:28,079
it took them about 10 years to get

670
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,679
approved for nasa by the way so it was a

671
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:32,158
long path

672
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,038
and not anybody can just kind of jump in

673
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
and

674
00:21:33,038 --> 00:21:37,440
the reason why it's unique is it's it's

675
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,519
really geared towards efficiency

676
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,720
and you know not having an excess and

677
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:44,798
waste

678
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,480
so i i thought i would i thought i was

679
00:21:44,798 --> 00:21:47,759
interesting i was interested in the

680
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,880
technology

681
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:51,759
i wasn't really sure uh i wasn't really

682
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,679
confident

683
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:55,279
that it would work for cannabis because

684
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,240
i'm so used to

685
00:21:55,279 --> 00:21:58,960
creating a cocktail of of different

686
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,079
organic

687
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,159
and chemical fertilizers and

688
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:07,038
so i gave it a i gave it a shot i built

689
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:09,360
a small room in my garage

690
00:22:07,038 --> 00:22:10,879
like an eight lighter and then did did a

691
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:13,439
few trials

692
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,159
with different control groups and uh

693
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,519
overall

694
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:19,760
the fertilizer uh beat out everything as

695
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:20,960
far as yields quality and growth rate

696
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:24,158
morphology

697
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:25,519
so i i you know went to the

698
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,880
the people behind the company which

699
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:28,079
ended up becoming beanstalk was called

700
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,280
something else then and said hey i'm

701
00:22:28,079 --> 00:22:30,158
really interested in being a part of

702
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,879
this

703
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,320
uh i think i can help improve where this

704
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,720
fertilizer is at

705
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:38,079
and uh and and bring it and bring it to

706
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,720
the next level and help bring it to the

707
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:41,759
market

708
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:44,558
and essentially the fertilizer is a pril

709
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:45,599
which looks like uh like nerds like the

710
00:22:44,558 --> 00:22:48,000
candy nerds

711
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:50,000
so some people call them space nerds

712
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,640
which i think is a cool name

713
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,319
and that prill is a polyolefin coating

714
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,280
and the minerals are on the inside of

715
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:58,319
that prill

716
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:00,319
and it's a single layer coating whereas

717
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:01,599
other time to release fertilizers which

718
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:02,879
is a little difference between control

719
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:04,798
release and time release

720
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,159
time release can have upwards of 15 to

721
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:09,119
20 layers

722
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,240
of polyurethane polyurethanes half-life

723
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:12,719
is very long

724
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,919
polyolefins is a fraction of that also

725
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,279
there's certain

726
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:19,600
uh fungi and mushrooms that will

727
00:23:17,279 --> 00:23:20,639
degrade if you add that into the compost

728
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:22,558
pile

729
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,320
it'll chew up that polyolefin coating

730
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:27,359
and use it as food

731
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:28,480
with zero uh with zero impact the

732
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:30,719
environment so there's

733
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,599
this process is in place where you can

734
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,798
completely remove

735
00:23:31,599 --> 00:23:37,918
any of that coating you know

736
00:23:34,798 --> 00:23:38,798
after it's been used uh the thought

737
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,559
behind it is

738
00:23:38,798 --> 00:23:42,720
that what we put in the plant is what

739
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:46,000
the plant uses so

740
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,558
uh how it works is when uh moisture or

741
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,640
water

742
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:51,038
hits that membrane that membrane of the

743
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,080
peril the polyolefin coating

744
00:23:51,038 --> 00:23:56,558
through osmosis it will pull out the

745
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:59,599
mineral salts and feed it to the plant

746
00:23:56,558 --> 00:24:02,158
and as time goes by different pores

747
00:23:59,599 --> 00:24:04,000
open up in that coating allowing for

748
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,400
more minerals to come through

749
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,159
at different rates based on how the the

750
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,798
fertilizer

751
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,000
is formulated so it's essentially the

752
00:24:10,798 --> 00:24:14,879
the thought behind it and

753
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,720
also to remediate you know the majority

754
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,799
of your lead jada runoff

755
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,400
so in a small container so containers

756
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:23,599
that are large smaller than

757
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,080
seven gallons i've been able to irrigate

758
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:27,278
with zero runoff and have successful

759
00:24:26,079 --> 00:24:29,439
results if you're

760
00:24:27,278 --> 00:24:32,880
using larger containers you probably

761
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,919
still will need to uh purge the media

762
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,840
once in a while

763
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:38,000
to reset it but it's a little bit better

764
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:40,480
than or a lot better than

765
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,519
you know running a um you know straight

766
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,720
water soluble

767
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:46,639
fertilizer and having to get five to ten

768
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,558
percent runoff every feeding

769
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,640
uh so if you go to areas like central

770
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:52,720
valley and california

771
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,799
you know the the ppm coming out of the

772
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,960
tap there is extremely high and

773
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:58,319
a lot of that has to do with or from the

774
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,558
well water a lot of it has to do with

775
00:24:58,319 --> 00:25:03,839
just so much runoff going into the

776
00:25:00,558 --> 00:25:05,678
uh going into the the water table that's

777
00:25:03,839 --> 00:25:07,678
you know 2 000 parts per million a lot

778
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:10,880
of nitrate a lot of phosphate

779
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:12,400
so the thought is that not everybody's

780
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,679
going to switch over to organic

781
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
organic doesn't work in all

782
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,159
circumstances for instance

783
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:19,678
here in pennsylvania pennsylvania is so

784
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
tightly regulated

785
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:23,679
i've had to cut out all of my organic

786
00:25:21,599 --> 00:25:26,079
inputs for the most part

787
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:26,880
because they don't differentiate between

788
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:29,199
beneficial

789
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,760
and pathogenic bacteria uh there's a

790
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:35,278
very tight aerobic bacteria count

791
00:25:31,759 --> 00:25:37,200
um you know fungi you know

792
00:25:35,278 --> 00:25:38,720
you know mold they call it all bold even

793
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,960
if it's a beneficial

794
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,759
fungi so we're in an extremely tightly

795
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,840
regulated

796
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:45,119
environment and using organics is

797
00:25:43,839 --> 00:25:46,798
extremely risky

798
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:48,479
so you might be in a circumstance

799
00:25:46,798 --> 00:25:50,720
situation where

800
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,720
you have to pass testing and you have to

801
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,759
try and keep it as clean as possible

802
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,319
and that might involve limiting

803
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:59,359
organic inputs or you know really being

804
00:25:58,319 --> 00:26:00,720
careful with them

805
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:03,199
also with some of the issues we're

806
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,319
seeing with kelp and and animal waste

807
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,798
having high levels

808
00:26:04,319 --> 00:26:07,759
of heavy metals and arsenic which i've

809
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:10,000
run into

810
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,798
you know you know the organic inputs

811
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,038
might be

812
00:26:10,798 --> 00:26:14,720
you know might have different levels of

813
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,599
things you don't want in the flowers so

814
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,960
there's

815
00:26:15,599 --> 00:26:20,879
you know i'm looking at it as okay well

816
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,798
most farms i go to are not growing

817
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,320
organically you know that i've consulted

818
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:25,519
or worked with most of them are running

819
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:28,558
some kind of assault

820
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:30,879
how do we make that paradigm more

821
00:26:28,558 --> 00:26:32,399
sustainable how do we reduce that waste

822
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,320
so when this product landed in my lap i

823
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,559
really like that idea but then

824
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:38,158
if it didn't grow good weed then why

825
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:39,519
would i ever use it i mean it got to go

826
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,278
back to the drawing board

827
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:42,639
so in the end you know we've we released

828
00:26:41,278 --> 00:26:43,519
product has been out for about a year

829
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,919
now

830
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,119
um it's a slow start because it's a new

831
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,720
technology and

832
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,719
people sometimes are confused on how

833
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,000
simple it is but you're just mixing this

834
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,919
pro into the soil

835
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,079
essentially feeding water whatever

836
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,960
organic biostimulant you want you can

837
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:58,798
you can

838
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,919
stack certain other things on it as well

839
00:26:58,798 --> 00:27:00,960
it's just basically going to give you

840
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,960
your fundamental

841
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,798
nutrition for the plant and that's

842
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,720
confusing to a lot of people

843
00:27:04,798 --> 00:27:08,879
it was confusing to me when i first was

844
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,400
trialing it out but it really works and

845
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,760
we've had a lot of early adopters with a

846
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,400
lot of success

847
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:16,319
uh you know we would run you know 500

848
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,559
000 square feet of canopy

849
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:20,639
on it with one client and it was

850
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:22,398
extremely successful and they

851
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,399
they've kept using it and most people

852
00:27:22,398 --> 00:27:26,000
that have switched over

853
00:27:24,398 --> 00:27:27,439
and have just been really impressed with

854
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,640
it and then they you can add whatever

855
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,320
you want on top of it

856
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,919
i would stay away from any additional

857
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:33,918
nitrogen because there's

858
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,278
all the nitrogen you need and you

859
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,840
wouldn't want to add any more latent

860
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:38,079
flour

861
00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:40,079
in my opinion uh but overall we're

862
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:42,398
having great results i'm using it here

863
00:27:40,079 --> 00:27:43,199
um we're testing extremely high in the

864
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:44,959
cannabinoids

865
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,960
you know if you look at the mitral

866
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
genetics flower that just drop

867
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,558
or you know between 28 and 32 percent of

868
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,080
the cannabinoids

869
00:27:50,558 --> 00:27:54,879
with three and a half you know anywhere

870
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:58,798
2.8 three and a half percent terpenes

871
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,240
um so great great results there i think

872
00:27:58,798 --> 00:28:01,759
most of that has to do with

873
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:03,038
genetics but if you don't have the

874
00:28:01,759 --> 00:28:03,679
proper nutrition in the proper

875
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:06,079
environment

876
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,519
you might not see that expression so

877
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:10,000
everything is really doing its job it's

878
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:12,240
producing a flower that's desirable

879
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,200
and i'm pretty stoked on the product in

880
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,200
the future of the product

881
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:19,759
yeah i mean to jump in here obviously

882
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,599
i'm the organic guy

883
00:28:19,759 --> 00:28:23,440
i've been organic my whole life i eat

884
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,439
organic food i

885
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,558
you know i've never grown using chemical

886
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:29,919
nutrients

887
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:31,839
um it's not really my world but i i want

888
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,200
to be pragmatic about this and realize

889
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,038
like you said that

890
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,640
you know i don't know what percentage of

891
00:28:35,038 --> 00:28:39,599
growers are using

892
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,360
chemical nutrients i would suspect it's

893
00:28:39,599 --> 00:28:43,119
a higher percentage than those using

894
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:45,599
organic nutrients still

895
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:48,319
though organics has made a huge push i

896
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:50,079
think in the last decade

897
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:51,678
just this is all anecdotal i don't have

898
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:53,199
any numbers here

899
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,200
but that's just sort of what i've seen

900
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,880
on my side of the industry

901
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,679
i'll continue to be that organic

902
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:01,760
advocate but i want to realize that like

903
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,679
people are going to grow using chemicals

904
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:05,440
and if they are going to if this is not

905
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,399
going away how do we

906
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
how are we how can we be more

907
00:29:06,398 --> 00:29:11,038
sustainable about it and i think

908
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,640
you know companies like jax ideas like

909
00:29:11,038 --> 00:29:14,879
beanstalk are

910
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,919
are really great in that aspect um and

911
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,240
i'd like to

912
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,919
further those technologies further that

913
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,519
information so that we're reducing

914
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,759
runoff

915
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:26,000
um you know reducing water usage

916
00:29:23,759 --> 00:29:28,319
potentially like you were saying in that

917
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,679
um and and really simplifying things for

918
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,759
growers so that we can get

919
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
better quality product out there too and

920
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:34,798
frankly i root for the little guys like

921
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:36,398
i don't

922
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,398
i don't want and more general

923
00:29:36,398 --> 00:29:41,839
hydroponics and scots

924
00:29:38,398 --> 00:29:42,558
and and big egg uh taking over industry

925
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,480
so

926
00:29:42,558 --> 00:29:46,158
these small companies or smaller

927
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
companies i guess are really where i

928
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,080
would uh

929
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:51,519
throw my hat in on this so i just want

930
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,720
to throw that out there uh one other

931
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:55,359
thing i want to mention

932
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,798
for people who are not can i can i

933
00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,759
comment on that real quick though before

934
00:29:56,798 --> 00:30:00,798
you shift gears

935
00:29:57,759 --> 00:30:04,079
yeah yeah i would just say that

936
00:30:00,798 --> 00:30:04,480
um i'm i wouldn't say that i'm in either

937
00:30:04,079 --> 00:30:08,158
camp

938
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,919
like uh as far as what i would prefer i

939
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,520
really look at it as what's going to

940
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,120
work the best for that scenario and the

941
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:17,839
best for the goals

942
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:19,918
and i i love organically grown cannabis

943
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:22,639
and i i try and eat as much organically

944
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:25,840
grown produce and food as i can

945
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:28,559
and uh you know there's it just

946
00:30:25,839 --> 00:30:30,480
really what it is is we have these

947
00:30:28,558 --> 00:30:31,839
containers we have to operate and the

948
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,038
containers are like the rules the

949
00:30:31,839 --> 00:30:35,439
regulations

950
00:30:33,038 --> 00:30:36,158
the limitations of the environment and

951
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,960
then also

952
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,760
scale right scale is another container

953
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,278
uh that we

954
00:30:39,759 --> 00:30:42,798
that in general i don't feel like the

955
00:30:41,278 --> 00:30:43,359
cannabis industry is really figured out

956
00:30:42,798 --> 00:30:45,359
yet

957
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:46,798
uh we're getting there but we usually

958
00:30:45,359 --> 00:30:49,038
hit like a point where things

959
00:30:46,798 --> 00:30:50,079
the quality dramatically drops after a

960
00:30:49,038 --> 00:30:52,558
specific

961
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:53,119
amount of square feet of canopy so how

962
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:55,678
to

963
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:57,278
uh how to get to that next level so you

964
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,919
can figure out all those problems part

965
00:30:57,278 --> 00:31:00,720
of that just

966
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,320
involves simplifying everything and i

967
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,720
just find that sometimes

968
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:06,480
i've run into issues where more or

969
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,240
organic inputs have brought in another

970
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,519
layer of complexity

971
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,319
that makes the other uh aspects of

972
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,880
scaling

973
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:16,398
really challenged challenging to manage

974
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,480
but i do know that there

975
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,918
are people working on that right now and

976
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,839
focused on that and they might be in a

977
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,159
market where they have

978
00:31:21,839 --> 00:31:25,278
margins where they can afford to take

979
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,960
that chance

980
00:31:25,278 --> 00:31:28,798
uh just not everybody is in that

981
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:31,360
position and i

982
00:31:28,798 --> 00:31:32,879
love seeing what people are doing uh

983
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:34,719
with organic inputs

984
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,720
and you know frankly some of the best

985
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:38,960
cannabis i've ever smoked has been

986
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,200
you know organically grown and i think a

987
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,200
lot of people agree with that

988
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,759
but yeah i just wanted to say that i'm

989
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,798
for i'm for organic

990
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:51,038
100 but i'm also i'm also for the

991
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,200
transitioning and sustainability

992
00:31:51,038 --> 00:31:54,558
and sometimes that means not necessarily

993
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,240
picking a side

994
00:31:54,558 --> 00:31:58,240
but really looking at like how do we

995
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:01,679
progress further away from things that

996
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,599
are so wasteful

997
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,120
sure and i think that you know the

998
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:07,599
organic industry has its

999
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:08,879
dark side too which um you know we

1000
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:12,158
talked about actually last

1001
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:13,200
last podcast with carrie it's not it's

1002
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:15,519
not perfect either

1003
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,319
you know some of the mind products some

1004
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,319
of the uh

1005
00:32:18,398 --> 00:32:22,479
i i think taking advantage of some of

1006
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:24,080
the um native populations around

1007
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,599
harvesting of some of these things

1008
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:29,119
whether it's it's guanos

1009
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:30,639
or uh coco core things like that are

1010
00:32:29,119 --> 00:32:33,439
really important to consider when we

1011
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,759
look at environmental impact

1012
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,759
and at the end of the day like nitrate

1013
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:38,640
is nitrate and we have to recognize that

1014
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,119
from a plant

1015
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:42,080
um you know a plant physiology

1016
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:45,119
perspective

1017
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:46,240
as an organic grower i i have to realize

1018
00:32:45,119 --> 00:32:47,518
that

1019
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,278
the plant honestly can't tell a

1020
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,200
difference

1021
00:32:49,278 --> 00:32:52,960
on where that's coming from and i think

1022
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,440
that's a hard

1023
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,159
lesson or a hard answer that we don't

1024
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,360
necessarily

1025
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:00,000
want to accept we want to think that

1026
00:32:57,359 --> 00:33:02,558
organics is special and

1027
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,079
where i think organics is special is in

1028
00:33:02,558 --> 00:33:07,440
the sense that

1029
00:33:04,079 --> 00:33:09,199
it's um i i don't think that we

1030
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,440
have completely mastered what

1031
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:14,480
microbiology brings to the table

1032
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
um yes soil brings to the table

1033
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,000
this idea that we can grow a perfect

1034
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,759
plant with a limited number

1035
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,359
number of chemical inputs i i don't

1036
00:33:19,759 --> 00:33:22,798
think we're there and i don't know that

1037
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,599
we ever will be there because it is so

1038
00:33:22,798 --> 00:33:25,759
complex

1039
00:33:23,599 --> 00:33:26,798
so that that's where i think organics

1040
00:33:25,759 --> 00:33:29,119
has a slight

1041
00:33:26,798 --> 00:33:30,319
edge but you're right you are adding

1042
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:31,518
complexity and

1043
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,480
and one of the things we talked about

1044
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,839
with uh with kerry was that um

1045
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:37,919
you know research that's being done

1046
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:39,359
right now is all being done with with

1047
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,000
chemical nutrients

1048
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:43,199
it just because it is easier to control

1049
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,679
for variables it makes

1050
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,880
the scientific methods so much simpler

1051
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,798
and so it's really hard to get good

1052
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,039
organic research and it's hard to get

1053
00:33:48,798 --> 00:33:52,639
replicable organic research because

1054
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:54,240
every soil is going to be a little bit

1055
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,559
different

1056
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,440
so there's there's definite advantages

1057
00:33:56,558 --> 00:33:59,038
to

1058
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,558
you know using mineral salts or

1059
00:33:59,038 --> 00:34:02,158
chemicals and i

1060
00:34:00,558 --> 00:34:04,639
i want to acknowledge that even if

1061
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,960
that's not my path

1062
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:07,919
but if on my path i can help encourage

1063
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,599
people

1064
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,119
to grow more sustainably even if it is

1065
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,159
with chemical nutrients then

1066
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,599
um i'm on board for that

1067
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:18,079
so right on yeah what i was going to get

1068
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,119
at though

1069
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,879
uh was regards to beanstalk uh this

1070
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,639
controlled release fertilizer for people

1071
00:34:22,878 --> 00:34:25,279
who aren't as familiar with it because

1072
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,440
i'm

1073
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,200
wasn't um but as someone who's you know

1074
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,559
owned a nursery we get plants in with

1075
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,799
osmocote in there

1076
00:34:30,559 --> 00:34:34,078
that has these little you know bluish

1077
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,079
green balls

1078
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,760
that slowly you know break down over

1079
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,119
time i realize that what you're saying

1080
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,320
here time release is different than

1081
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:42,079
control release but

1082
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,440
just to give you a visual of sort of the

1083
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,639
concept behind it um

1084
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,960
i thought that might be useful for

1085
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,960
people yeah that's

1086
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,760
yeah that's where the space nerds comes

1087
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,199
from because they they look like little

1088
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,960
little yeah they look like tiny little

1089
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:56,878
balls or a little male form

1090
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,000
i'd say the big the big difference with

1091
00:34:56,878 --> 00:34:59,519
um

1092
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,280
the the big difference which also

1093
00:34:59,519 --> 00:35:02,239
reflects on the price uh between

1094
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,200
osmocote

1095
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:07,039
and beanstalk is the type of coding uh

1096
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:07,919
having a single layer higher quality

1097
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:10,159
coding

1098
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,440
uh with the with the beanstalk that's

1099
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:13,279
the biggest difference so it's the same

1100
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,240
technology that they use

1101
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,119
um you know for nasa and the reason is

1102
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,799
that the poly

1103
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,160
uh polyurethane is in its

1104
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,079
there's a there's other issues with the

1105
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:27,279
polyurethane one of the

1106
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,200
uh temperature affects the release rate

1107
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,519
and what we found is the polyurethane if

1108
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:34,399
you have a soil temperature fluctuation

1109
00:35:31,519 --> 00:35:36,000
the fertility can dump out so the

1110
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,039
polyolefin coating is going to be more

1111
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,199
stable

1112
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:42,639
and it's just overall just a higher

1113
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:46,078
quality product from a chemistry level

1114
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:47,759
without having you know the poly uh

1115
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,720
polyurethane is gonna you know

1116
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,400
essentially break down into

1117
00:35:48,719 --> 00:35:52,879
microplastics which is

1118
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,599
a problem uh because we don't know what

1119
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,559
the impact of microplastics is

1120
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:59,440
uh with with soil biodiversity you know

1121
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,920
they could shape

1122
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,200
the evolutionary path of the microbes

1123
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:05,440
there isn't a

1124
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:06,719
defined way of remediating that so

1125
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,000
that's something that we're seeing

1126
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:10,559
in soil and it's something that we're

1127
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,079
seeing in the ocean

1128
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:13,599
and it's something that i'm exploring

1129
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,240
and and how we can

1130
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,359
ensure that even though we we do have a

1131
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,719
much shorter half-life with the

1132
00:36:17,358 --> 00:36:20,639
polyolefin coating

1133
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:22,399
as a way of remediating and processing

1134
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:25,519
it sooner um

1135
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,160
so it's not hanging out having some kind

1136
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,838
of

1137
00:36:26,159 --> 00:36:30,480
you know negative long-term impact that

1138
00:36:27,838 --> 00:36:30,480
we can't see

1139
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,880
so in theory uh what you're talking

1140
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:38,559
about is having a media that at the end

1141
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,960
of the growth cycle would be essentially

1142
00:36:38,559 --> 00:36:42,480
depleted to the point to where your your

1143
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,119
ec and everything is back at where you

1144
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,800
started

1145
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,559
is sort of the ultimate goal there

1146
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,200
correct and that there's no residual

1147
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:54,400
coding left

1148
00:36:51,199 --> 00:36:55,919
and so if you so if you were to use like

1149
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,200
for instance the osmo code you could

1150
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,119
deplete everything

1151
00:36:57,199 --> 00:37:00,559
but there would still be that residual

1152
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,680
polyurethane

1153
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:05,358
and we don't know the impact of that

1154
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:07,519
right so that's the dangerous like you

1155
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:10,239
part of the issue that we have

1156
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:11,599
with scientific discovery is that we

1157
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:12,959
might come up with something that solves

1158
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,280
a short-term problem

1159
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,720
so it creates a problem 200 years from

1160
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,880
now that we can't see or even

1161
00:37:16,719 --> 00:37:21,118
sooner than that and that's where we

1162
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,160
have had such an ecological impact with

1163
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,440
so many things that we've done with

1164
00:37:22,159 --> 00:37:24,879
technology

1165
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,480
there's always a consequence there's

1166
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,320
always a cost like where there's a

1167
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,119
benefit there's always a consequence or

1168
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,119
a cost

1169
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,480
there's it's never separated there's

1170
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:35,358
always this balance

1171
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,000
and so part of the challenge with new

1172
00:37:35,358 --> 00:37:38,719
with with

1173
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,760
utilizing new sustainable technology is

1174
00:37:38,719 --> 00:37:43,838
finding

1175
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:45,920
systems to continue to create balance so

1176
00:37:43,838 --> 00:37:48,400
you don't have a long-term path

1177
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,838
and we don't i've looked into the data

1178
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,440
i've looked into the research but it's

1179
00:37:49,838 --> 00:37:52,880
really just beginning as far as

1180
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,599
microplastic

1181
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,039
uh content in in the soil so one of the

1182
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,000
things that i look at even with this

1183
00:37:57,039 --> 00:37:59,838
product

1184
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,119
and you know being a part of the company

1185
00:37:59,838 --> 00:38:02,880
be putting this

1186
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:05,280
this product out is really doing a deep

1187
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:07,200
dive on any possible thing that could

1188
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:10,240
have an ecological impact

1189
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:12,879
uh you know that we wouldn't see

1190
00:38:10,239 --> 00:38:13,919
right now right so i've i look into that

1191
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,920
and i look at all the

1192
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,079
the benefits but i'm also looking at the

1193
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:19,838
cost and that led me to

1194
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,079
specific types of fungi that can break

1195
00:38:19,838 --> 00:38:24,159
down polyolefin they've already started

1196
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,720
doing trials on it so there's a way of

1197
00:38:24,159 --> 00:38:28,960
taking all of that spent media right

1198
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,000
and then composting it and inoculating

1199
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,159
it with this fungi

1200
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,119
so it would basically use that polar

1201
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:35,199
also encoding

1202
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,320
as its food source then break that down

1203
00:38:35,199 --> 00:38:39,519
and turn that into

1204
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:42,240
something that would be beneficial

1205
00:38:39,519 --> 00:38:43,920
so you're not recommending or at the

1206
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:46,959
point of reusing the media

1207
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,320
at this stage of the game

1208
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,079
i know i've been we've been using

1209
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:53,359
reusing the media um

1210
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,599
i'm just saying that if you're if

1211
00:38:53,358 --> 00:38:56,960
i've been reaching the media in indoor

1212
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,039
environments or

1213
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:00,880
out primarily outdoor environments like

1214
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:02,239
i try not to reuse media indoors unless

1215
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,000
you heat treat it

1216
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,679
but i would take the media out and we've

1217
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,880
used it for outdoor gardens and had a

1218
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:09,118
lot of success

1219
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,240
would i till it back into the soil

1220
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,760
that's the question

1221
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:14,239
right like i want to have all the

1222
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,200
products we're having be able to be used

1223
00:39:14,239 --> 00:39:18,639
for multi-purposes so whatever the waste

1224
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:20,159
is how do we turn that waste into

1225
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,799
something that

1226
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:24,159
doesn't just necessarily have one home

1227
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,079
after it's been used for

1228
00:39:24,159 --> 00:39:28,078
our purpose but could be used for

1229
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,359
multiple different things

1230
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,200
so part of what we have to create with

1231
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:32,239
sustainability is fluidity and

1232
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,759
flexibility

1233
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,319
with our waste if it's only going to

1234
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,520
create one product or one purpose after

1235
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,800
it's being used you might hit a

1236
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:41,280
bottleneck

1237
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,480
where you meet the demand for that one

1238
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,839
one purpose

1239
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,519
and then it just sits there and it

1240
00:39:43,838 --> 00:39:46,960
becomes waste again so

1241
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:50,480
part of looking at it is like what are

1242
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,159
we we're using pete or coco

1243
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,800
you know is there a way of reusing this

1244
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:56,480
in multiple different applications

1245
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,240
with the lowest environmental impact

1246
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,079
possible and i'm getting pretty granular

1247
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,639
on this but this is how deep i look at

1248
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,839
it

1249
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:05,519
uh part of part of what's happened you

1250
00:40:03,838 --> 00:40:08,078
know and part of that came from

1251
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:08,719
just my my family uh you know family

1252
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,560
background

1253
00:40:08,719 --> 00:40:12,239
where my grandfather was in the

1254
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:14,880
insulation industry

1255
00:40:12,239 --> 00:40:15,838
in the 30s and 40s and 50s and 60s all

1256
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,599
the way through

1257
00:40:15,838 --> 00:40:19,440
and they were using a lot of asbestos at

1258
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,400
the time right and at the time

1259
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,039
asbestos was widely accepted and you

1260
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,039
know then

1261
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:27,279
the 80s hit 70s 80s hit and then they

1262
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:31,400
found out that it was pretty toxic

1263
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:33,599
and uh everybody that was involved in

1264
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,200
manufacturing distributing or selling

1265
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,760
asbestos

1266
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:39,679
was considered liable for what happened

1267
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,720
to the people that got mesothelioma i

1268
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:43,039
believe that's what it's called

1269
00:40:40,719 --> 00:40:44,078
so looking at that i look at my

1270
00:40:43,039 --> 00:40:46,960
grandfather's

1271
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,480
life as like a lesson where he went from

1272
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,440
doing incredibly well in life and

1273
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,760
essentially had to pay out everything he

1274
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,480
had

1275
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,839
made in his life to out to uh you know

1276
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,199
all these lawsuits so

1277
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:59,039
i wouldn't want to ever run into

1278
00:40:57,199 --> 00:41:00,639
anything like that i wouldn't want to

1279
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:02,480
ever be a part of

1280
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:04,318
a product that would have that long term

1281
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,920
impact and i think that

1282
00:41:04,318 --> 00:41:08,880
if if companies in if we start thinking

1283
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,800
about that way

1284
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,880
it's like it's like like being a

1285
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,119
conscious company like thinking about

1286
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,400
all the possible impacts that your

1287
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,160
product can have

1288
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:20,400
and then figure out a plan to remediate

1289
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:22,078
it or don't put it on the market

1290
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,599
if there isn't a way of remediating it

1291
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
and i think that would solve a lot of

1292
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,039
problems overall for everybody

1293
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:29,519
on the planet so just thinking about it

1294
00:41:27,039 --> 00:41:30,960
a little bit differently

1295
00:41:29,519 --> 00:41:32,559
all right so take me through how to use

1296
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,079
it so

1297
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:36,078
uh you know starting at the beginning

1298
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,200
the growth cycle uh you know i've

1299
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,880
watched

1300
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:40,159
i've watched in horticultural

1301
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,440
greenhouses you know when we're doing

1302
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:42,719
like when they're doing like massive

1303
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:45,280
propagation

1304
00:41:42,719 --> 00:41:47,039
uh you know you poke a hole and they

1305
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:48,000
throw like a handful of osmocote down in

1306
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:49,440
that hole and then that

1307
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,679
plant's done and they go on to the next

1308
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,119
plant and it's really really fast but

1309
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:55,358
what are you guys doing with

1310
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,960
with your mix here how do you use the

1311
00:41:55,358 --> 00:41:58,880
fertilizer

1312
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,240
you you could you could use it in the

1313
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,800
same application

1314
00:42:00,239 --> 00:42:04,959
um but as that fertilizer releases it's

1315
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,880
going to be concentrated in one point

1316
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:09,920
so what we recommend is to integrate it

1317
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,119
in to this substrate or medium

1318
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:14,480
i prefer a specific type of peat moss i

1319
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,318
like this peat moss

1320
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,240
formula by a company called pin strip

1321
00:42:16,318 --> 00:42:20,079
doesn't have any perlite in it

1322
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:22,318
it's got a lot of oxygen so i prefer

1323
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:24,160
that but with any like type of

1324
00:42:22,318 --> 00:42:25,679
loose substrate it won't work in rock

1325
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:27,759
walls doesn't work in rockwool but for

1326
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:29,358
any kind of loose substrate

1327
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,800
you can either mix it into the pot or

1328
00:42:29,358 --> 00:42:32,078
you can subdress it so you could

1329
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,079
transplant

1330
00:42:32,079 --> 00:42:35,359
and then you could add the layer of the

1331
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,079
pro the crf

1332
00:42:35,358 --> 00:42:38,880
on top of the level of substrate then

1333
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,200
you have to add an

1334
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:42,800
inch of substrate on top of it so you

1335
00:42:41,199 --> 00:42:44,719
you want it to be

1336
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,560
in contact with media that's been

1337
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:47,358
irrigated or has a moisture content

1338
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:50,480
level

1339
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:52,880
i have top dressing for it works fine

1340
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,119
but it you're going to create a better

1341
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,880
balance

1342
00:42:54,119 --> 00:43:00,640
of ec in the media

1343
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:00,640
if you integrate it in or subdress it

1344
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:04,880
okay so you'll put some in i then take

1345
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:06,559
it

1346
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:08,400
fairly early on are you putting some in

1347
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:09,599
with like a new seedling or do you wait

1348
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,920
a little bit

1349
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,920
um

1350
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:17,599
yeah so so if you're starting from clone

1351
00:43:16,318 --> 00:43:19,358
or seedling

1352
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,640
uh most people are starting with some

1353
00:43:19,358 --> 00:43:22,719
kind of a rooting cube

1354
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,679
or a rock wool it's not going to work

1355
00:43:22,719 --> 00:43:25,919
for that so

1356
00:43:23,679 --> 00:43:28,318
this would be on your you're potting it

1357
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,159
up so if you're taking it to like a

1358
00:43:28,318 --> 00:43:32,480
uh you know quarter gallon or a half

1359
00:43:30,159 --> 00:43:34,799
gallon container you would add the veg

1360
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,920
uh the b basis which is the bed veg

1361
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:38,560
fertilizer

1362
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,838
uh if there's a specific rate per gallon

1363
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:43,759
so for v basis it's 25 grams per gallon

1364
00:43:41,838 --> 00:43:44,960
uh you know for a little starter three

1365
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,800
and a half inch starter pot i usually

1366
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,800
just throw a teaspoon in there

1367
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,079
uh and then when you're bumping it up to

1368
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:53,280
the next phase up

1369
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,760
then you would you know add in

1370
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,119
your complete blend of the fortify the

1371
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,119
absolute flower

1372
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,358
and the k boost and that's going to

1373
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:03,519
finish out the rest of your veg time

1374
00:44:01,358 --> 00:44:05,920
and with enough fertilizer to finish the

1375
00:44:03,519 --> 00:44:08,000
70-day cycle so roughly 90 days so i

1376
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,800
like to do that last stop pod at least

1377
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,920
two weeks before i'm moving into flower

1378
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,920
and then it carries through

1379
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,000
now i did notice you had like a k boost

1380
00:44:16,159 --> 00:44:20,159
or a couple other

1381
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:23,119
things there are those just top dressed

1382
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:25,679
at targeted times

1383
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,519
um you add them all in at the same time

1384
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,118
so they release

1385
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,719
yeah you add everything in at the same

1386
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,160
time uh

1387
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:33,358
that will carry through flour if you're

1388
00:44:32,159 --> 00:44:34,719
just going to be doing nursery

1389
00:44:33,358 --> 00:44:37,199
production you just need

1390
00:44:34,719 --> 00:44:39,039
you know for moms you can use uh the v

1391
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:40,639
basis or the absolute flour

1392
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,480
absolute flour is going to work great

1393
00:44:40,639 --> 00:44:46,480
for vegging it's just the timing

1394
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,719
and the formulas um formulated

1395
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,559
with the k boost with the fortified so

1396
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:54,480
the k boost has

1397
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:57,279
your basically a high level of potassium

1398
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:59,440
with some magnesium in it fortifies

1399
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:02,240
essentially calcium nitrate

1400
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,119
and then the absolute flower is an

1401
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,279
aggregate

1402
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,720
of your macro and micronutrients so you

1403
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,599
add all that in at the same time and

1404
00:45:06,719 --> 00:45:09,199
you're done

1405
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,880
you don't need to add anything else so

1406
00:45:09,199 --> 00:45:13,039
other than that starter pot

1407
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,559
uh you re you know if you're going in if

1408
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,960
you're taking a plant from a starter

1409
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:17,679
plant

1410
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,240
into flour you're just going to amend

1411
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:21,598
that

1412
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:23,598
um that fertilizer into the soil

1413
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,519
and you're good to go and if you're

1414
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:28,240
doing a longer veg time

1415
00:45:25,519 --> 00:45:28,639
uh it depends on how many up pots you

1416
00:45:28,239 --> 00:45:30,879
have

1417
00:45:28,639 --> 00:45:32,559
you know i i don't know if people are

1418
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,519
doing like three or four up pots maybe

1419
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:36,000
they are

1420
00:45:33,519 --> 00:45:36,800
uh but you would just add as the volume

1421
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,639
needed

1422
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,318
and so let's say you have a one gallon

1423
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:43,199
pot you would add

1424
00:45:40,318 --> 00:45:44,559
25 grams of the v basis and let's you

1425
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:47,279
take that one gallon

1426
00:45:44,559 --> 00:45:47,679
into a five gallon well i would only add

1427
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,599
uh

1428
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:51,358
fertilizer for those additional four

1429
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:52,640
gallons not for the total five because

1430
00:45:51,358 --> 00:45:55,598
you've already added

1431
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:57,199
in for that one oh that's really easy

1432
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:59,760
that makes sense

1433
00:45:57,199 --> 00:46:00,399
um yeah so i just want to mention to

1434
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,839
folks too

1435
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,760
uh so this was something that i had to

1436
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:05,199
put a lot of thought into um i'll just

1437
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:08,160
be transparent about it

1438
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:09,358
uh you know knowing you uh knowing the

1439
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:11,920
guys over at beanstalk

1440
00:46:09,358 --> 00:46:13,279
watching your process and formulating

1441
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,280
and improving this product

1442
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,720
thinking about you know being an organic

1443
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:18,880
based company

1444
00:46:16,719 --> 00:46:21,118
um knowing that this is not an organic

1445
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,039
product but yet more sustainable

1446
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:24,640
it is something that we're adding to our

1447
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,920
product line so we will

1448
00:46:24,639 --> 00:46:28,719
be people will be able to order it

1449
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,240
through our website

1450
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,078
but it took a lot of thought on that

1451
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:33,679
because i realized i'm probably gonna

1452
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,760
get some backlash on it knowing that we

1453
00:46:33,679 --> 00:46:37,759
are an organics company and i

1454
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,839
i want to stay an organic based company

1455
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,680
but i do want to promote technologies

1456
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,279
that are more sustainable than what's

1457
00:46:41,679 --> 00:46:46,000
currently available on the market and

1458
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:48,640
that to me was more important than

1459
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,400
being you know this organics versus

1460
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:53,679
chemical nutrients debate

1461
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,519
but it took a lot of thought or you know

1462
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:56,960
it was it was a it was not an easy

1463
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:58,800
decision yeah

1464
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:00,559
so i just want to throw that out there

1465
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
to people to just kind of stave off

1466
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:05,199
some of the comments or uh questions

1467
00:47:03,199 --> 00:47:08,318
that people may have and i'm happy to

1468
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,879
you know elaborate on it but um yeah i

1469
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:11,440
just want to

1470
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,960
i appreciate i yeah i appreciate you for

1471
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:14,639
i mean we've you and i have had some

1472
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:17,358
great conversations

1473
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:18,239
um on you know just about life and

1474
00:47:17,358 --> 00:47:19,920
sustainability

1475
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:21,679
and and this product too and i just

1476
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,440
appreciate you

1477
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,279
doing the due diligence and even

1478
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,880
considering it you know so it's exciting

1479
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,519
to work with you at any level in that

1480
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,200
sense

1481
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:31,119
and i hope you don't get any backlash

1482
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:33,598
and i hope people understand that

1483
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,480
um you know we're all trying to figure

1484
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:37,838
out the best path

1485
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,639
forward and uh you know it's not black

1486
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:40,799
or white

1487
00:47:38,639 --> 00:47:42,318
it's it's somewhere in between on

1488
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,280
getting the whole world in a better

1489
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:44,639
place

1490
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:46,000
yeah and i want to have solutions for

1491
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,960
people in some of those challenging

1492
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,519
environments where

1493
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:52,079
uh like you said i can't um you know

1494
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:54,239
organics isn't always a good fit

1495
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,680
um and some of that is just poor

1496
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:58,558
regulatory practices

1497
00:47:55,679 --> 00:47:59,519
i would i want to blame you know that

1498
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,559
some of the some of these

1499
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:05,519
that's a good place to start they're not

1500
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,960
good um so we could start there but uh

1501
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:08,639
you know knowing that we do have to fit

1502
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:10,559
into this box

1503
00:48:08,639 --> 00:48:12,318
there are there are definite advantages

1504
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:15,760
to running

1505
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:17,119
a facility with less uh you know less

1506
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:21,040
microbial

1507
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:23,358
inputs and uh you know you know a media

1508
00:48:21,039 --> 00:48:25,039
that's a lot that's either sterile or a

1509
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:28,239
lot more controlled

1510
00:48:25,039 --> 00:48:30,000
um i agree yeah

1511
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:32,000
i mean the amount yeah the amount of

1512
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:35,280
challenges just with getting all the

1513
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,838
systems working right and uh you know

1514
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:39,200
teaching all these new people uh how to

1515
00:48:37,838 --> 00:48:41,920
do the fundamentals

1516
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:42,480
and then you factor in that you could

1517
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:46,318
have

1518
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:48,480
a really uh gnarly explosion of

1519
00:48:46,318 --> 00:48:49,679
you know bacteria that you don't want in

1520
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,280
your flower that could happen late

1521
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:52,879
flower i mean it's it's just not

1522
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:54,319
it's not a fun place to be especially

1523
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,079
when you put a bunch of time

1524
00:48:54,318 --> 00:48:57,599
into a crop and it looks great and then

1525
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,519
you fail testing that's like the worst

1526
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,720
feeling ever

1527
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:05,358
yeah so you've speaking of testing um

1528
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:07,358
you've done testing on heavy metals with

1529
00:49:05,358 --> 00:49:10,159
this product

1530
00:49:07,358 --> 00:49:12,400
yep is that something that's publicly

1531
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:14,000
available

1532
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,440
um i don't know if it's on our website

1533
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,079
but i don't have an issue sharing it

1534
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,280
with anybody

1535
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:20,800
so we're all within um the right we're

1536
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,480
in there all in the right limits i know

1537
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,119
there's been people that hit have hit me

1538
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,358
up

1539
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:26,400
about it and i've sent those results

1540
00:49:25,358 --> 00:49:28,880
we've had uh

1541
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,160
testing by batch so we're maintaining

1542
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,760
the quality control

1543
00:49:30,159 --> 00:49:33,598
as it comes from the manufacturing

1544
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,920
partner and uh

1545
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,079
yeah so it's all been acceptable and i

1546
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,318
haven't seen anything bioaccumulate

1547
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:42,240
that cause a failed test and anything

1548
00:49:40,318 --> 00:49:44,480
that i'm doing here which has been

1549
00:49:42,239 --> 00:49:45,838
uh this is the type the tightest

1550
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,920
regulatory

1551
00:49:45,838 --> 00:49:51,039
system i've worked in in pennsylvania

1552
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:53,119
it's pretty it's pretty crazy

1553
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:54,480
yeah you know so on the organic side

1554
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:56,160
when it comes to heavy metals

1555
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:58,000
well first of all in order to register

1556
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,118
as a fertilizer which is something we

1557
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,079
the path we went with

1558
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:03,599
with the soil and our products legally

1559
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:05,200
you're supposed to do that i know not

1560
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,440
all companies have

1561
00:50:05,199 --> 00:50:08,639
there's one selling you know bloom kits

1562
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:11,280
and things like that that are

1563
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:12,799
that haven't registered i hope they do

1564
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,519
but essentially what that does is it

1565
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,599
gives you

1566
00:50:13,519 --> 00:50:17,440
access to you know publicly available

1567
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:19,119
heavy metal levels too like you can go

1568
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,838
on the wsda website and look at my

1569
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,599
company and

1570
00:50:19,838 --> 00:50:23,838
see the heavy metal levels in our

1571
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,119
products that's a requirement so i'm

1572
00:50:23,838 --> 00:50:26,239
sure you know as you you know you're

1573
00:50:25,119 --> 00:50:29,680
registered in these states

1574
00:50:26,239 --> 00:50:31,358
that uh that's publicly available too

1575
00:50:29,679 --> 00:50:33,199
because i know that you guys were

1576
00:50:31,358 --> 00:50:36,558
working on uh

1577
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:37,439
in regards to heavy metals and organics

1578
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:40,559
i know you mentioned

1579
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:41,679
kelp meal um dr kerry peters mentioned

1580
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:43,200
gypsum

1581
00:50:41,679 --> 00:50:44,879
uh you know these are things that you

1582
00:50:43,199 --> 00:50:46,960
have to test uh

1583
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:49,200
soil doctor consulting bryant mason's

1584
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:51,760
been doing some testing on that

1585
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,318
which he shared some of that with me um

1586
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,359
so we're

1587
00:50:52,318 --> 00:50:55,679
this is something we're constantly

1588
00:50:53,358 --> 00:50:56,639
working at but i don't want people to

1589
00:50:55,679 --> 00:50:58,000
freak out and think that

1590
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,679
you know kelp is going to cause their

1591
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:02,318
plant to fail for arsenic it's just

1592
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:03,838
it's about management so not over using

1593
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:04,639
any of these things and just knowing

1594
00:51:03,838 --> 00:51:06,400
what the

1595
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:08,000
heavy metal load is that we're adding

1596
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,480
and also managing our ph in a range

1597
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,000
where those

1598
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,599
things may be less available and then

1599
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,318
running cultivars that are going to be

1600
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,960
uh

1601
00:51:12,318 --> 00:51:16,000
better at at navigating heavy metals

1602
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:18,559
than others you know not

1603
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,599
not as efficient at taking them up so i

1604
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,319
just want to throw that out there

1605
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:23,599
that that last one's so important

1606
00:51:22,318 --> 00:51:25,519
because i have definitely

1607
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:27,280
run into cultivars that do like to

1608
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:27,599
bioaccumulate everything you throw at

1609
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:31,359
them

1610
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,359
so that is an interesting note

1611
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:36,160
yeah i you know people i've seen people

1612
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:37,679
fail for

1613
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:39,679
for some crazy things in their rooms and

1614
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,440
i'm i'm working on putting together

1615
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:42,799
a better guide for that because there's

1616
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,559
just so many variables that can

1617
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,559
contribute from dust

1618
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:50,160
to water to your plumbing to your soil

1619
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:53,119
to your other inputs

1620
00:51:50,159 --> 00:51:54,879
i heard one and this is still

1621
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,519
speculation but i heard one lab

1622
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:00,000
claim that the ph down that this person

1623
00:51:57,519 --> 00:52:01,679
was using was particularly high in

1624
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:03,679
certain heavy metals but i'm waiting for

1625
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:05,519
those lab results um and i wouldn't

1626
00:52:03,679 --> 00:52:06,159
share that anyway because i'm afraid of

1627
00:52:05,519 --> 00:52:08,800
this

1628
00:52:06,159 --> 00:52:10,639
company but uh just the idea i want

1629
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,160
people to be aware that like oh shoot ph

1630
00:52:10,639 --> 00:52:13,598
down i never even thought that might be

1631
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:16,318
something to consider

1632
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:17,599
so in regards to heavy metal because i

1633
00:52:16,318 --> 00:52:19,358
think heavy metals is really the next

1634
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:22,559
hot topic you know we're not

1635
00:52:19,358 --> 00:52:22,960
um we're not testing our vegetables at

1636
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:26,240
this

1637
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:28,159
level which maybe we should be or or not

1638
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:29,598
but um

1639
00:52:28,159 --> 00:52:31,039
we all have to pass if we're if we're

1640
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:32,480
growing in a state that has these

1641
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:34,880
requirements we have to fit into these

1642
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:37,119
requirements so

1643
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,640
you know yeah it doesn't it doesn't it

1644
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,838
doesn't matter

1645
00:52:38,639 --> 00:52:43,920
i mean the impact matters but if the

1646
00:52:41,838 --> 00:52:47,119
state has these regulations

1647
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:48,880
whether they're for good reason uh an

1648
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,480
ignorant reason or there is some

1649
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:52,880
scientific basis

1650
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,079
uh that's just on you know not available

1651
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:56,000
to the rest of us

1652
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:57,359
uh we have to work within these these

1653
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,719
guidelines and it's

1654
00:52:57,358 --> 00:53:02,558
extremely difficult you know it's like

1655
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:04,799
oh man really you can't use

1656
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,839
this product why not you know we we have

1657
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
certain things i mean i don't want to

1658
00:53:05,838 --> 00:53:08,159
get in trouble by

1659
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,160
blasting all out but like there's

1660
00:53:08,159 --> 00:53:12,318
certain things that like we can't use

1661
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:14,078
peroxide for certain things that just

1662
00:53:12,318 --> 00:53:16,000
is it just it's mind-blowing to me like

1663
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,119
it makes zero sense and peroxide's

1664
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,039
fairly safe

1665
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:20,720
just on like cleaning rockwell up or

1666
00:53:19,039 --> 00:53:22,480
anything like that it's

1667
00:53:20,719 --> 00:53:24,000
there's just a lot of restrictions a lot

1668
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,119
of tools that they take out and there's

1669
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,760
no reason for it

1670
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,800
and sometimes if you if you even ask

1671
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,559
them why

1672
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,160
uh they get upset and then just won't

1673
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,680
pick up the phone for you anymore

1674
00:53:32,159 --> 00:53:35,679
you know like because they they just

1675
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:37,919
might not have an answer so

1676
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:38,879
in some of these states we really really

1677
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:41,200
i wish that

1678
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,400
in general i wish that scientists and

1679
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:44,799
people that study

1680
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:47,599
uh things at a granular level i mean i'm

1681
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:49,839
not really a scientist i'm a cultivator

1682
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,800
i just play a scientist on tv or on

1683
00:53:49,838 --> 00:53:52,480
instagram

1684
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:53,680
and i like to hang out with real

1685
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:55,440
scientists and ask them a bunch of

1686
00:53:53,679 --> 00:54:00,078
questions and i feel like

1687
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:03,760
i owe um you know a lot of my success

1688
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:03,760
to a lot of people that

1689
00:54:03,838 --> 00:54:07,279
have a lot more understanding about

1690
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:09,359
granular things than i do

1691
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:11,119
but we really need i'm just if there are

1692
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:11,440
scientists listening to this podcast you

1693
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:14,079
know

1694
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,519
people in special specific fields i know

1695
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:17,119
that most of you

1696
00:54:15,519 --> 00:54:19,358
and speak to you right now i know most

1697
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:22,480
of you um

1698
00:54:19,358 --> 00:54:25,759
don't like to be out in the limelight

1699
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:27,440
and and you know vocalize your thoughts

1700
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:28,160
but right now we have so much crazy

1701
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:30,480
information

1702
00:54:28,159 --> 00:54:32,960
i implore people that are experts in a

1703
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:36,000
field to be courageous right now

1704
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:37,679
and to you know help all of us that are

1705
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:41,119
trying to operate in this world and that

1706
00:54:37,679 --> 00:54:43,039
this is across everything please just

1707
00:54:41,119 --> 00:54:44,798
you know be more vocal we need more

1708
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:48,318
scientists that are more vocal

1709
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:49,759
um you know i think there's a huge void

1710
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:51,519
right now where we could have a lot of

1711
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:53,839
people coming out and talking about

1712
00:54:51,519 --> 00:54:56,318
things and educating

1713
00:54:53,838 --> 00:54:57,440
you know cannabis the cannabis community

1714
00:54:56,318 --> 00:54:59,519
and everyone else

1715
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:02,000
on what the science and the data is

1716
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:02,000
telling you

1717
00:55:02,719 --> 00:55:06,159
yeah i'm working on tracking down a

1718
00:55:04,798 --> 00:55:09,519
really good

1719
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:10,159
chemist who specializes in water and can

1720
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:12,798
really

1721
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:14,239
explain the interactions between

1722
00:55:12,798 --> 00:55:16,798
different types of water

1723
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,159
and how they affect uptake of some of

1724
00:55:16,798 --> 00:55:20,000
these

1725
00:55:18,159 --> 00:55:21,598
specifically heavy metals but nutrients

1726
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,199
in general i might

1727
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:24,640
i might be able to help you with that

1728
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:26,558
all right well let's talk off because

1729
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:28,639
i've got i've got some calls into dram

1730
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:30,400
and uh you know suzanne and some other

1731
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:32,400
people that are working on tracking down

1732
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,480
that like perfect

1733
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:35,838
podcast guest so that's that's in the

1734
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:39,920
works okay cool

1735
00:55:35,838 --> 00:55:41,440
um yeah in terms of science oh go ahead

1736
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,358
i was just going to say that i'll just

1737
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,960
give a little shout out um the water

1738
00:55:43,358 --> 00:55:45,920
treatment company that we used for this

1739
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,440
facility

1740
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,200
uh was called advanced treatment

1741
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:51,200
technologies and

1742
00:55:49,199 --> 00:55:53,199
they've put in a pretty cutting edge

1743
00:55:51,199 --> 00:55:55,358
water purification system

1744
00:55:53,199 --> 00:55:56,798
uh we're able to deliver a high level of

1745
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:58,639
dissolved oxygen to plants

1746
00:55:56,798 --> 00:56:00,318
and then use ozone for all of our

1747
00:55:58,639 --> 00:56:01,199
cleaning protocols and keeping the lines

1748
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,558
clean

1749
00:56:01,199 --> 00:56:06,318
and uh you know that was this was a team

1750
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:07,839
member here that recommended this

1751
00:56:06,318 --> 00:56:10,000
i was coming from the tissue culture

1752
00:56:07,838 --> 00:56:12,558
side and uh

1753
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,679
i have not i've i'm incredibly impressed

1754
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:15,599
with that system

1755
00:56:13,679 --> 00:56:17,440
and with the amount of knowledge that

1756
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:18,318
they brought to the table on this

1757
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,318
project

1758
00:56:18,318 --> 00:56:21,679
and i would i would say you know bark up

1759
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,239
that tree they're doing some interesting

1760
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:24,399
works

1761
00:56:22,239 --> 00:56:25,919
and you know on the on like a scale

1762
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,318
level for agriculture

1763
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:29,599
and on like a laboratory level and

1764
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:31,199
charlie over there advanced treatment

1765
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,079
technologies really came through for us

1766
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:34,399
here

1767
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:35,440
with my tree and what they're doing with

1768
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,358
water

1769
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,039
purification and plants is pretty

1770
00:56:37,358 --> 00:56:39,759
incredible and i'm seeing the results

1771
00:56:39,039 --> 00:56:43,440
now

1772
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:44,559
couldn't be more excited very cool

1773
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,679
yeah i just want to touch on your

1774
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,440
science comments so i i think science

1775
00:56:47,679 --> 00:56:51,039
is a little bit dogmatic you know

1776
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:54,400
there's a lot of people doing

1777
00:56:51,039 --> 00:56:56,558
what they think of as science

1778
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,519
and research and that gets a little

1779
00:56:56,559 --> 00:56:59,200
tricky because

1780
00:56:57,519 --> 00:57:00,719
you know i found people throwing out

1781
00:56:59,199 --> 00:57:01,118
stuff that doesn't fit with sort of

1782
00:57:00,719 --> 00:57:03,118
their

1783
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,200
world view and that's one of the reasons

1784
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:08,000
that i i'm trying to have

1785
00:57:05,199 --> 00:57:08,558
you know people like uh dr peters and

1786
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:11,358
yourself

1787
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,960
on the podcast is to try not to get

1788
00:57:11,358 --> 00:57:15,679
stuck in that

1789
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,480
sort of you know dogmatic view where i

1790
00:57:15,679 --> 00:57:19,519
only look at

1791
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,880
one path to growing this plant because i

1792
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,239
think we can all learn from each other

1793
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,079
and i think we have to do a better job

1794
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:25,679
as cultivators of discerning

1795
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:27,519
and really listening to what people are

1796
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:29,679
saying and running kind of that

1797
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:30,880
[ __ ] meter on it uh yeah you can

1798
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:33,679
have a fancy graph

1799
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,559
you can have you know different counts

1800
00:57:33,679 --> 00:57:38,480
of things but at the end of the day

1801
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,599
you know if the if the overall premise

1802
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,119
doesn't add up or

1803
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,359
if they claim that this is the only way

1804
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,358
to grow a plant then i think we have to

1805
00:57:43,358 --> 00:57:46,960
we have to take a step back and and see

1806
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,318
why some of these things haven't made it

1807
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,119
into horticulture

1808
00:57:48,318 --> 00:57:52,798
um not to say that if it hasn't been

1809
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,119
horticulture it isn't good

1810
00:57:52,798 --> 00:57:57,199
but that is a good test of sort of that

1811
00:57:55,119 --> 00:58:01,838
bs meter in a lot of ways too

1812
00:57:57,199 --> 00:58:05,358
um just uh yeah throw that out there

1813
00:58:01,838 --> 00:58:07,599
yeah yeah and if we're not

1814
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:10,000
following the data we're not following

1815
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:11,519
uh you know scientific method and and

1816
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,679
you know from hypoth you know moving

1817
00:58:11,519 --> 00:58:17,199
from a hypothesis to a theory

1818
00:58:13,679 --> 00:58:18,318
uh for not following uh the system of

1819
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,358
science

1820
00:58:18,318 --> 00:58:22,719
and we're just leaning heavily on

1821
00:58:21,358 --> 00:58:26,078
anecdotal

1822
00:58:22,719 --> 00:58:29,519
and and story right uh that's

1823
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,119
where uh you know that's where

1824
00:58:29,519 --> 00:58:34,639
con man and hucksters thrive and i think

1825
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,119
right now in the world

1826
00:58:34,639 --> 00:58:39,199
we just have a lot of people that are

1827
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:41,680
that can be very charismatic

1828
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:44,159
and uh convince a lot of people that

1829
00:58:41,679 --> 00:58:47,199
things work based off of an idea

1830
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:49,199
uh they might mix in some spirituality

1831
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:50,558
in that which i think is a real abuse of

1832
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:51,919
spirituality i don't think you need to

1833
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:53,440
sell spirituality

1834
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,720
i think that's just like spirituality is

1835
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,039
like a representation of how we're

1836
00:58:54,719 --> 00:58:58,879
connected to everything that's alive

1837
00:58:57,039 --> 00:59:00,719
and uh that at some point science will

1838
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,760
be able to explain that but maybe not

1839
00:59:00,719 --> 00:59:05,919
right now

1840
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:08,400
uh but i it's you know the cannabis

1841
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,920
community is you know ripe for being

1842
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,519
taken advantage of

1843
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:14,000
uh by a lot of people that are coming in

1844
00:59:11,519 --> 00:59:17,039
and selling products that really

1845
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,400
really don't have any evidence uh of

1846
00:59:17,039 --> 00:59:20,079
them being effective

1847
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:21,280
and just because there's a white paper

1848
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:22,640
written about something doesn't mean

1849
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,559
that it's proving

1850
00:59:22,639 --> 00:59:27,118
uh a claim it means that there's an

1851
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:28,960
abstract and there's an exploration

1852
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,200
and that's just the beginning but i see

1853
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,519
like people posting abstracts up

1854
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,199
but not not posting any of the data to

1855
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:37,039
support claims that they make around

1856
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:39,039
specific methods or technologies or

1857
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,599
products and uh yeah

1858
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:42,880
like that's not how you know that's

1859
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:45,519
that's not how you know if something

1860
00:59:42,880 --> 00:59:46,400
works or not so just be really careful

1861
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,838
uh

1862
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,079
and take your time if you're making big

1863
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:51,838
purchases or investing in anything and

1864
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,599
and know that there's there's not data

1865
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:56,719
behind it well you know

1866
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:58,880
who knows really so be wary

1867
00:59:56,719 --> 01:00:00,798
and i i just hope that more people that

1868
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:02,880
study the data

1869
01:00:00,798 --> 01:00:04,159
are a little bit more vocal about it and

1870
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:07,280
can do it in a way

1871
01:00:04,159 --> 01:00:09,199
where they can communicate

1872
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,640
even if people are getting you know

1873
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:12,960
upset or triggered

1874
01:00:10,639 --> 01:00:14,078
for like a better word that this data

1875
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:16,240
might conflict with their world

1876
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,519
view like just we just don't take into

1877
01:00:16,239 --> 01:00:18,639
that personal it's where people are

1878
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,199
right now but it doesn't mean you

1879
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,440
shouldn't

1880
01:00:19,199 --> 01:00:22,480
say something and just understand that

1881
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:23,838
you're working you're going to be

1882
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:24,880
communicating a bunch of people who just

1883
01:00:23,838 --> 01:00:26,719
don't know

1884
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:29,280
or have another narrative in their head

1885
01:00:26,719 --> 01:00:31,759
or another story of how things work

1886
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:34,079
and that's a real challenge but you know

1887
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,760
i love talking to scientists that study

1888
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:37,680
things on a granular level i've learned

1889
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:38,720
so much and that's improved everything

1890
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:42,000
that i do

1891
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:43,679
in this space as a grower

1892
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,318
yeah i feel like we're at a time in

1893
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:49,039
history where there's never been more

1894
01:00:46,318 --> 01:00:50,239
polarization in our society and i feel

1895
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:52,000
like the last thing we need in the

1896
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:52,719
cannabis industry right now is to be

1897
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:55,920
fighting over

1898
01:00:52,719 --> 01:00:58,000
you know dogmatic views at the end of

1899
01:00:55,920 --> 01:01:00,880
the day we're all trying to grow a plant

1900
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:02,480
as to the best of our ability and

1901
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:06,720
sometimes i think we lose sight of that

1902
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:09,199
but in the name of science i agree i

1903
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,558
first off i just a quick plug we do have

1904
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:13,358
some white papers

1905
01:01:10,559 --> 01:01:15,440
on our website feel free to read them

1906
01:01:13,358 --> 01:01:18,000
read the methodology

1907
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:19,838
run your own experiment we're sharing as

1908
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,440
much data as we can

1909
01:01:19,838 --> 01:01:22,880
trying to get stuff published but that's

1910
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:24,480
hard to do

1911
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,720
be partly because we're running things

1912
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,960
in a commercial facility and

1913
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:30,078
a lot of the research uh journals don't

1914
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,679
want that

1915
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:33,200
you know they want stuff done in a

1916
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:35,118
controlled lab which we don't have the

1917
01:01:33,199 --> 01:01:36,719
ability to do so we're doing research at

1918
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,400
you know with legit we're doing

1919
01:01:36,719 --> 01:01:39,759
research with gold leaf gardens here in

1920
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,280
washington state because i have access

1921
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,799
to both those facilities

1922
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:44,640
and that's really good but this brings

1923
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:46,000
me to my next question so i want to do

1924
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:48,960
some research at home

1925
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,679
i'm limited uh here within washington

1926
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:53,119
state

1927
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:55,118
to anywhere from six plants to 15 plants

1928
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,440
i might be able to get up to 30 if i can

1929
01:01:55,119 --> 01:01:59,358
do a cooperative at my location but i'm

1930
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,200
i'm researching the laws because i want

1931
01:01:59,358 --> 01:02:03,038
to be legal within the medical program

1932
01:02:01,199 --> 01:02:06,639
here in washington

1933
01:02:03,039 --> 01:02:08,720
but how do i set up the ultimate

1934
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:10,719
tent grow from a scientific perspective

1935
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:13,439
because i want to test out

1936
01:02:10,719 --> 01:02:15,838
science lights i want to test out you

1937
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,519
know your fertilizer versus our soil mix

1938
01:02:15,838 --> 01:02:20,719
and do a comparison there

1939
01:02:17,519 --> 01:02:21,519
i want to look at how different mbar

1940
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,118
levels

1941
01:02:21,519 --> 01:02:25,440
you know using the blue mats that we

1942
01:02:23,119 --> 01:02:27,680
like with our soils will

1943
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:29,119
create different results so there's all

1944
01:02:27,679 --> 01:02:30,399
these different things i want to test i

1945
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,240
mean the list is

1946
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,559
longer than my lifetime but i want to

1947
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:37,199
start doing this and documenting it

1948
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:38,000
and getting some trends going so i can

1949
01:02:37,199 --> 01:02:40,239
figure out

1950
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:41,039
hey this is this is worthwhile send this

1951
01:02:40,239 --> 01:02:43,038
over to

1952
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:44,720
uh you know gold leaf gardens but

1953
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:46,240
because i can't do that like the some of

1954
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:48,639
the more

1955
01:02:46,239 --> 01:02:50,000
exciting projects i can't really run at

1956
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,960
these facilities because i can't risk

1957
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:53,199
the crop loss

1958
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:54,639
you know they're mixing it up this is a

1959
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:56,639
for-profit business

1960
01:02:54,639 --> 01:02:58,719
i have to be really cognizant of that

1961
01:02:56,639 --> 01:03:02,239
but you know we're formulating new

1962
01:02:58,719 --> 01:03:03,759
soil mixes some new uh growing bloom

1963
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:05,439
formulas things like that

1964
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:07,359
and i'm really excited about that side

1965
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:08,798
of things but i

1966
01:03:07,358 --> 01:03:10,558
i want to i want to be able to do some

1967
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,000
of it in-house myself and i miss growing

1968
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,720
the plant like it's been

1969
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,519
a few years off now uh i've been focused

1970
01:03:14,719 --> 01:03:17,118
on kiss

1971
01:03:15,519 --> 01:03:18,798
i've been wanting to be a you know a

1972
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:19,920
good law-abiding citizen

1973
01:03:18,798 --> 01:03:21,838
as we were going through all these

1974
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,880
different law changes in washington uh

1975
01:03:21,838 --> 01:03:24,239
i've been too busy

1976
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:26,160
but now i feel like i'm at a point where

1977
01:03:24,239 --> 01:03:29,199
i'm ready to start uh growing again

1978
01:03:26,159 --> 01:03:31,038
so yeah

1979
01:03:29,199 --> 01:03:33,038
and i think i saw i think i i think i

1980
01:03:31,039 --> 01:03:35,760
saw your last garden actually

1981
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,119
um if i'm correct i think that was your

1982
01:03:35,760 --> 01:03:38,160
garden because i don't know if you want

1983
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:40,559
me to talk about it

1984
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:42,159
but uh i think you saw some no that was

1985
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:45,039
just some outdoor plants

1986
01:03:42,159 --> 01:03:46,159
uh for my dad to make into a texture

1987
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:49,359
yeah well

1988
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:50,078
yeah some outdoor monsters i remember

1989
01:03:49,358 --> 01:03:52,159
that

1990
01:03:50,079 --> 01:03:53,359
those were purely uh for my dad's

1991
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,639
neuropathy we don't

1992
01:03:53,358 --> 01:03:56,239
you know i don't care if they at the end

1993
01:03:54,639 --> 01:03:58,960
of the cycle they have a little bit of

1994
01:03:56,239 --> 01:04:02,159
pm or something it was it was cool

1995
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:03,599
it was cool uh so that uh if you're

1996
01:04:02,159 --> 01:04:05,519
gonna set up the ultimate tent grow to

1997
01:04:03,599 --> 01:04:07,680
do comparison i guess you have to choose

1998
01:04:05,519 --> 01:04:09,119
you know your sample size of plants um

1999
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,239
if you could get away with the sample

2000
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:11,838
size of six plants

2001
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:14,479
that would probably be great and if

2002
01:04:11,838 --> 01:04:17,519
you're just going to do a side by side

2003
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:19,280
so six plants from the same cultivar uh

2004
01:04:17,519 --> 01:04:20,079
so you'd want that to be consistent i'd

2005
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,960
probably take

2006
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:24,880
two to three times as many clones uh

2007
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,639
that you would use and then select the

2008
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:28,160
ones that are the most homogenous

2009
01:04:26,639 --> 01:04:29,838
so you're getting a good comparison

2010
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,480
meaning they have similar root

2011
01:04:29,838 --> 01:04:34,558
development

2012
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,079
similar health levels going in um

2013
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,599
and then you would randomize them

2014
01:04:36,079 --> 01:04:39,599
technically

2015
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:41,119
and then yes distribute them but my

2016
01:04:39,599 --> 01:04:42,798
thought would be

2017
01:04:41,119 --> 01:04:44,000
so here's what i'm thinking and then

2018
01:04:42,798 --> 01:04:45,838
maybe that would be easier and then you

2019
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,679
can tell me what you think so i want

2020
01:04:45,838 --> 01:04:48,960
i want to make sure that the environment

2021
01:04:47,679 --> 01:04:50,159
is the same so so

2022
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:51,679
essentially we're trying to control yeah

2023
01:04:50,159 --> 01:04:52,078
i was gonna get to that for a variable

2024
01:04:51,679 --> 01:04:53,919
so

2025
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:55,680
my thought was let's just say i can do

2026
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,480
15 plants so if i register with the

2027
01:04:55,679 --> 01:04:58,719
state

2028
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:00,559
medical card i can do 15 plants i would

2029
01:04:58,719 --> 01:05:01,199
get i would get them from a licensed

2030
01:05:00,559 --> 01:05:03,519
facility

2031
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:05,279
i would get them as clones and then i

2032
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,440
was going to run two

2033
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:09,119
at least if i want to trial the soil

2034
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,720
stuff i would run two four by four beds

2035
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:13,760
in a four by eight tent

2036
01:05:10,719 --> 01:05:17,439
and then let's say i wanted to test

2037
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:18,880
lighting i would just run something down

2038
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:22,000
the middle to kind of

2039
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:23,200
limit some of the light overlap in the

2040
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,960
beds

2041
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,399
but i didn't want to have two initially

2042
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,880
i started with like i want two separate

2043
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,160
tents

2044
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:29,519
because i want to make sure everything

2045
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,798
is very controlled in that regard but

2046
01:05:29,519 --> 01:05:32,639
then i started thinking about that and i

2047
01:05:30,798 --> 01:05:35,679
was like there's no way i can keep vpd

2048
01:05:32,639 --> 01:05:36,078
exactly the same environment in in two

2049
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,159
separate

2050
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,200
tents they really need to be in the same

2051
01:05:38,159 --> 01:05:42,399
tent

2052
01:05:39,199 --> 01:05:44,399
um well i wouldn't do i wouldn't do a

2053
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,039
fertilizer trial and a lighting trial at

2054
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:47,440
the same time

2055
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:49,280
no no no totally one thing or another

2056
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:50,880
i've kind of jumped around there i'm

2057
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,480
talking about multiple cycles at this

2058
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,920
point but let's just say

2059
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,000
let's just simplify it so let's say i

2060
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:59,280
wanted to do

2061
01:05:56,000 --> 01:06:02,480
a fertilizer trial so same lights same

2062
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:06,079
cultivar from clone randomized

2063
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:07,599
uh in the same well okay let's see

2064
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,559
let's let's let's make it even more

2065
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,359
specific let's run beanstalk versus

2066
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:15,039
uh you know our biochar soil i would

2067
01:06:13,358 --> 01:06:17,358
have our biochar soil

2068
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:18,559
um well this would get a little trickier

2069
01:06:17,358 --> 01:06:20,000
because i'd want to grow it in a bed

2070
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:20,400
because we've seen better yields with a

2071
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:22,719
bed

2072
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,838
but i guess we could look at this you

2073
01:06:22,719 --> 01:06:25,519
can

2074
01:06:23,838 --> 01:06:27,038
but you could grow beanstalk in the bed

2075
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:28,239
too i wouldn't necessarily need to

2076
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,480
though i could grow it in

2077
01:06:28,239 --> 01:06:32,239
you know a seven gallon pot and say this

2078
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:34,000
is you know the nelson program versus

2079
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:35,279
the dad program i guess

2080
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,960
and we could come you know we could

2081
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:37,599
compare that and talk about the pros and

2082
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,480
cons of

2083
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:40,720
uh you know weight but well why not do

2084
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,159
it

2085
01:06:40,719 --> 01:06:43,759
you could do it in the bed it would be

2086
01:06:42,159 --> 01:06:44,318
interesting to do it because you're

2087
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,559
gonna have

2088
01:06:44,318 --> 01:06:47,358
a different you would have to do your

2089
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,200
bio

2090
01:06:47,358 --> 01:06:50,960
char soil in the same pot so you have to

2091
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:52,480
keep the container consistent so if you

2092
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,079
want to do it in a bed

2093
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:57,119
i would i would recommend doing the

2094
01:06:54,079 --> 01:07:01,680
beanstalk in a 4x4 bed too

2095
01:06:57,119 --> 01:07:04,160
i don't think that's necessarily a

2096
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:05,679
as as a variable that we'd have to

2097
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:06,798
control as much but we could so let's

2098
01:07:05,679 --> 01:07:09,199
say even then we had

2099
01:07:06,798 --> 01:07:10,400
two beds so what am i so assuming the

2100
01:07:09,199 --> 01:07:12,078
light's the same

2101
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:14,480
how am i controlling an environment like

2102
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:16,079
that ideally if i want to keep it within

2103
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:19,199
the tightest conditions would i even try

2104
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:20,480
and run like a small like co2

2105
01:07:19,199 --> 01:07:22,159
sort of thing because because the other

2106
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,159
thing is this garage is insulated but

2107
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:25,679
it's not heated so my outdoor air is

2108
01:07:24,159 --> 01:07:26,078
going to vary like this time of year

2109
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:29,838
it's

2110
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:31,920
probably around 50 degrees yeah um um

2111
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,199
well if you run if you don't run co2 it

2112
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:34,960
doesn't i mean it doesn't

2113
01:07:33,199 --> 01:07:37,118
the co2 factor is just going to give you

2114
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:37,440
a higher yield uh and you'll be able to

2115
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:40,480
run

2116
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:42,960
more light right so uh you'll be able to

2117
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:45,519
probably get above 800 ppfd

2118
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,440
without having you know some big issues

2119
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,719
uh if you were to run the co2

2120
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,400
so but if you're going to keep the

2121
01:07:48,719 --> 01:07:51,759
environment stable you probably you

2122
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:53,599
needed some sort of an environmental

2123
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:55,680
controller and sensor

2124
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:56,798
like a hydrex pro from trollmaster works

2125
01:07:55,679 --> 01:07:59,038
great

2126
01:07:56,798 --> 01:08:00,079
then you need a way of feeding cooler

2127
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:01,760
air in

2128
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,318
and if you kept that tent closed i would

2129
01:08:01,760 --> 01:08:07,280
that would positive pressure the tent

2130
01:08:04,318 --> 01:08:07,920
um with some with like an inline fan and

2131
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,319
some

2132
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:11,599
some carbon filters on the inline fan

2133
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:16,559
and then you could

2134
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:16,559
uh use filters on the airline

2135
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,759
yeah well you know if you're pulling air

2136
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,880
in you want to make sure it's clean

2137
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,079
oh so you're just cleaning there you're

2138
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:24,880
not you're not talking about from an

2139
01:08:22,079 --> 01:08:26,960
odor perspective then

2140
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,400
i mean unless you have to but no i don't

2141
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:31,679
but i've always wanted negative pressure

2142
01:08:28,399 --> 01:08:33,519
because in the past i had to

2143
01:08:31,679 --> 01:08:35,039
okay yeah so for this trial it's better

2144
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,480
if you're running positive pressure and

2145
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:38,158
if it's in a room i mean you wouldn't

2146
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,000
really be able to inject co2

2147
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:42,000
if you're using that fan to control that

2148
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:43,359
air speed unless you're adding co2 to

2149
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:46,000
the room that was

2150
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:47,520
that the tent was existing in basically

2151
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,039
sealed though that was sort of what that

2152
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:51,520
was what i was wondering can you run a

2153
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:53,759
sealed room that small

2154
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:55,600
maybe that's a silly question i don't

2155
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:58,319
know

2156
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:59,440
uh not not really because you've got to

2157
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:02,719
have some kind of

2158
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:05,278
uh you've got to have cool air coming in

2159
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:06,960
right sure so what you but what you

2160
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,799
could do is you condition the room

2161
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:11,600
outside of the tent

2162
01:09:08,798 --> 01:09:12,158
and then you use uh like a voltage

2163
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,838
control

2164
01:09:12,158 --> 01:09:16,158
like a potentiometer to control the

2165
01:09:13,838 --> 01:09:18,880
speed of the fan that's moving the air

2166
01:09:16,158 --> 01:09:21,039
into the tent you don't understand so

2167
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,480
you use that fan the same way that a fan

2168
01:09:21,039 --> 01:09:24,238
from an air handler

2169
01:09:22,479 --> 01:09:26,559
and then you would get your room

2170
01:09:24,238 --> 01:09:28,079
temperature uh that the tent is sitting

2171
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,000
in where you want it

2172
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:32,719
and then you push that air in and then

2173
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,798
you could add co2 into that room

2174
01:09:32,719 --> 01:09:36,319
but uh you know but you have to steal

2175
01:09:34,798 --> 01:09:39,439
that challenge is i i

2176
01:09:36,319 --> 01:09:40,400
can't do that because it's a garage that

2177
01:09:39,439 --> 01:09:41,919
error is just

2178
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,920
then i then i wouldn't then i wouldn't

2179
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:44,319
run co2 so i was wondering like could

2180
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,560
you

2181
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:48,000
run it sealed you know more or less

2182
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:51,600
quote unquote but then just do

2183
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:54,000
controlled air exchanges every so often

2184
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:55,199
to uh to bring your fresh air that was

2185
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:57,279
that was kind of what i was

2186
01:09:55,198 --> 01:09:58,319
i was thinking of and again i've never

2187
01:09:57,279 --> 01:10:00,238
done it on i've

2188
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,359
you know on scale sure on a room but

2189
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:02,799
i've never i didn't know if anyone's

2190
01:10:01,359 --> 01:10:04,238
done an attempt

2191
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:06,719
or if that was you could but then you

2192
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:09,839
had you could but you'd only be getting

2193
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:11,439
uh you'd only that co2 wouldn't hang out

2194
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:14,960
very long because any time

2195
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:16,799
so let's say you have uh you you know

2196
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:18,480
control a brain a little control brain

2197
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:20,159
like hydrox and then

2198
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,678
whenever the temperature gets to a

2199
01:10:20,158 --> 01:10:23,359
certain set point you're gonna kick that

2200
01:10:21,679 --> 01:10:24,640
fan on and it's gonna suck the cold air

2201
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:25,519
from outside of the tent and push it

2202
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,520
through

2203
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:30,080
you could program it to when that fan

2204
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:33,199
turns off that the co2 uh

2205
01:10:30,079 --> 01:10:34,719
then would release into the tent uh

2206
01:10:33,198 --> 01:10:36,319
but any time that fan turns on you're

2207
01:10:34,719 --> 01:10:36,640
just going to be pushing that co2 right

2208
01:10:36,319 --> 01:10:38,399
out

2209
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,000
so you're not going to get you're going

2210
01:10:38,399 --> 01:10:41,359
to get some benefit

2211
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:43,439
but it's not going to be the same thing

2212
01:10:41,359 --> 01:10:45,359
as like a sealed room running it at 1500

2213
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:47,439
parts per million

2214
01:10:45,359 --> 01:10:48,399
yeah i wasn't sure how well that would

2215
01:10:47,439 --> 01:10:49,759
scale down

2216
01:10:48,399 --> 01:10:51,439
to something that size i was just

2217
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:53,679
curious um

2218
01:10:51,439 --> 01:10:54,639
yeah it's i mean i a lot of people have

2219
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,359
played around with that i've played

2220
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:58,320
around with it

2221
01:10:55,359 --> 01:10:59,920
i just intense if i'm doing testing i

2222
01:10:58,319 --> 01:11:02,880
just don't run the co2

2223
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:06,560
and i and i try and stay below 800. i'll

2224
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:09,600
hang out between 600 800 ppfd

2225
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:13,760
okay okay yeah i do have a light meter

2226
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:15,120
um i'm i'm curious to try leds because

2227
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,480
the last time i tried

2228
01:11:15,119 --> 01:11:18,399
every time i tried a tent in the past

2229
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:21,198
i've i've pretty much failed

2230
01:11:18,399 --> 01:11:22,238
um usually because i ran too strong of

2231
01:11:21,198 --> 01:11:24,879
lights

2232
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:26,158
and uh just could not control the heat

2233
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,960
no matter how much

2234
01:11:26,158 --> 01:11:29,920
air flow or um you know even with like

2235
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,920
an eight inch

2236
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,440
air cooled ducting with a massive fan on

2237
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:34,399
there i could not get the heat down low

2238
01:11:33,439 --> 01:11:36,879
enough

2239
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,479
to where um was it with leds or where

2240
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,079
were they no this was a long time ago

2241
01:11:38,479 --> 01:11:43,198
this was back in the day with like

2242
01:11:40,079 --> 01:11:44,559
single-ended hbs and i remember i just i

2243
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,839
roasted some plants they actually

2244
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:47,360
survived better than i thought they

2245
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,000
would have considering the heat pressure

2246
01:11:47,359 --> 01:11:51,679
they were on

2247
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:53,279
but um yeah i uh you know i

2248
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:54,560
way way back when i first started and

2249
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:55,119
people will probably laugh at me for

2250
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,840
this i

2251
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:58,559
i threw a thousand wad in a in a tent

2252
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,760
and

2253
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:04,400
uh ramped it up and

2254
01:12:01,760 --> 01:12:05,440
came back down did you run it did you

2255
01:12:04,399 --> 01:12:07,279
run it 100

2256
01:12:05,439 --> 01:12:08,639
oh yeah yeah i had a lumatec ballast

2257
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:11,359
going i had it all the way up there

2258
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,920
it was cranking thing was so bright oh

2259
01:12:11,359 --> 01:12:13,839
man

2260
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:15,840
and i came back and opened up the tent

2261
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:17,520
and it was like i just stepped into like

2262
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:20,319
tropical paradise

2263
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,320
it was so hot

2264
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,079
but you know that's how you learn my

2265
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,800
mistakes yeah that's

2266
01:12:24,079 --> 01:12:28,158
totally no i've i've made all those

2267
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:31,920
mistakes before

2268
01:12:28,158 --> 01:12:33,359
um 100 so so i went from that to like a

2269
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:36,399
400 watt cmh

2270
01:12:33,359 --> 01:12:37,839
and that worked fine but um yeah

2271
01:12:36,399 --> 01:12:40,000
you know that wasn't it just wasn't

2272
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:41,440
enough ppfd that i felt like i was

2273
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,800
really getting the growth i wanted so i

2274
01:12:41,439 --> 01:12:44,559
usually just ended up

2275
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:46,880
saying screw this taking down the tent

2276
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:49,760
and then just setting up my garage

2277
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:51,119
is really what ends up happening how big

2278
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:53,039
how big was that tent that you had the

2279
01:12:51,119 --> 01:12:55,760
400 watt tmh in

2280
01:12:53,039 --> 01:12:56,479
that was a four by four if i remember

2281
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:58,719
correctly

2282
01:12:56,479 --> 01:13:00,000
yeah so that one was a four by four and

2283
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:01,840
that was okay

2284
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:03,439
but then i just i ended up being like

2285
01:13:01,840 --> 01:13:04,560
screw it i'm just gonna take everything

2286
01:13:03,439 --> 01:13:07,599
out into my garage

2287
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,920
and hook up the thousands and really let

2288
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:10,159
it

2289
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:11,359
let it go to town and and that's what

2290
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:13,198
i've done every single time i've done

2291
01:13:11,359 --> 01:13:14,799
the tent i've taken it down

2292
01:13:13,198 --> 01:13:16,960
halfway through the grow because i just

2293
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:20,000
get fed up with it

2294
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:21,198
so we'll use so so do this ted use like

2295
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:24,479
a 300 watt

2296
01:13:21,198 --> 01:13:26,319
led uh use like the veg light

2297
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:29,839
you know but i don't like fluid has a

2298
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:31,439
vet i want to go with you

2299
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:33,039
yeah but you don't need that much light

2300
01:13:31,439 --> 01:13:35,599
especially if you're not running co2

2301
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:37,039
and you're gonna have like a moderately

2302
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:40,000
controlled environment

2303
01:13:37,039 --> 01:13:42,238
um you if you get that like a 600 watt

2304
01:13:40,000 --> 01:13:43,840
led or 650 watt led

2305
01:13:42,238 --> 01:13:45,359
you're gonna probably end up just

2306
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:46,640
dimming it down

2307
01:13:45,359 --> 01:13:48,880
because it's that it's going to be

2308
01:13:46,640 --> 01:13:49,840
pretty tight to the canopy and i've

2309
01:13:48,880 --> 01:13:52,319
grown

2310
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,079
under the veg lights like from spec

2311
01:13:52,319 --> 01:13:56,000
grade and from fluence

2312
01:13:54,079 --> 01:13:57,279
and i've gotten you know an ounce and a

2313
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,079
half a square foot

2314
01:13:57,279 --> 01:14:01,039
you know without co2 you just don't need

2315
01:14:00,079 --> 01:14:02,960
that much light

2316
01:14:01,039 --> 01:14:04,479
especially if you're just doing a trial

2317
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:06,000
um you don't need that much light for

2318
01:14:04,479 --> 01:14:08,079
something like that

2319
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:09,359
you you do need more light if you're

2320
01:14:08,079 --> 01:14:11,840
trying to like maximize

2321
01:14:09,359 --> 01:14:13,359
every square foot that you have and

2322
01:14:11,840 --> 01:14:16,400
you're trying to optimize everything

2323
01:14:13,359 --> 01:14:16,880
but in a tent for personal use i mean i

2324
01:14:16,399 --> 01:14:19,920
don't know

2325
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:21,440
i mean you could go ham on it but it's

2326
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:23,119
not necessarily needed

2327
01:14:21,439 --> 01:14:25,039
in those kinds of circumstances and if

2328
01:14:23,119 --> 01:14:26,880
anything that extra light without added

2329
01:14:25,039 --> 01:14:29,920
co2 and environmental control

2330
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,760
is just going to cause uptake issues and

2331
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,480
then balances in the media and then give

2332
01:14:31,760 --> 01:14:34,640
you

2333
01:14:32,479 --> 01:14:36,158
uh you know probably not as accurate of

2334
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:39,280
a trial as you desire

2335
01:14:36,158 --> 01:14:40,799
you know yeah i'm curious to to start

2336
01:14:39,279 --> 01:14:43,840
playing around with it

2337
01:14:40,800 --> 01:14:45,600
and you know ultimately this

2338
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:47,119
tent set up would just be for me to get

2339
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:48,960
trending and

2340
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:50,719
and some numbers so that i could then

2341
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,480
take it to a facility and say hey run

2342
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:54,719
this again in your facility

2343
01:14:52,479 --> 01:14:56,718
um on a little bit bigger scale with a

2344
01:14:54,719 --> 01:14:57,600
little bit more controls but

2345
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,079
this is something i've been wanting to

2346
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:02,079
do for a while and you know i think uh

2347
01:15:00,079 --> 01:15:03,519
you know kiss has really been focused i

2348
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:04,800
feel like overly focused on the

2349
01:15:03,520 --> 01:15:06,080
commercial side of things like

2350
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:08,000
commercial growers

2351
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:10,158
and i don't want to discount people that

2352
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:11,600
are growing at home

2353
01:15:10,158 --> 01:15:13,519
you know i think some of the ways that

2354
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,960
we grow have a lot of

2355
01:15:13,520 --> 01:15:17,120
applications for home and i think the

2356
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:18,319
science that we're using in our soils

2357
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:20,158
and things like that can definitely

2358
01:15:18,319 --> 01:15:21,439
apply to someone with six plants as much

2359
01:15:20,158 --> 01:15:24,559
as it could to someone with

2360
01:15:21,439 --> 01:15:27,279
you know 600 or 6000 so and

2361
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:28,480
and if somebody wants organic product um

2362
01:15:27,279 --> 01:15:30,960
they might have to grow it

2363
01:15:28,479 --> 01:15:32,559
at home if their market is so tightly

2364
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:34,560
restricted they can't buy it

2365
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:36,719
you know that's the other option right

2366
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:38,560
so someone's really hellbent on

2367
01:15:36,719 --> 01:15:40,399
on only consuming organic products that

2368
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,199
might have to be you know in their tent

2369
01:15:40,399 --> 01:15:44,399
in their garage or room somewhere yeah

2370
01:15:43,198 --> 01:15:45,839
so i'm sure there's people listening to

2371
01:15:44,399 --> 01:15:47,279
this podcast that are a lot smarter than

2372
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:49,760
me that probably have feedback

2373
01:15:47,279 --> 01:15:50,719
feel free to send it to me um i haven't

2374
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,640
hit the dm

2375
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,480
purchased anything yet for this tent

2376
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,840
grow but i'm i'm getting ready to pull

2377
01:15:54,479 --> 01:15:57,439
the trigger i've already got

2378
01:15:55,840 --> 01:16:00,000
a few lights lined up that i'm going to

2379
01:15:57,439 --> 01:16:01,519
run for one thing that i know i want to

2380
01:16:00,000 --> 01:16:02,399
trial we've already trialled a few of

2381
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:06,159
them at

2382
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:07,679
um at gold goldleaf

2383
01:16:06,158 --> 01:16:09,920
and i've got that data but i haven't

2384
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:11,840
wanted to publish it just yet because

2385
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:14,719
it's such a political market around

2386
01:16:11,840 --> 01:16:17,440
lighting and i don't really want to uh

2387
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:19,119
you know have people run to too many

2388
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:22,479
conclusions based off of

2389
01:16:19,119 --> 01:16:24,960
these trials and and also feel like i'm

2390
01:16:22,479 --> 01:16:26,399
you know bashing one company and

2391
01:16:24,960 --> 01:16:28,560
promoting another so i'm trying to be

2392
01:16:26,399 --> 01:16:30,479
real careful around that i guess

2393
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:31,600
i will say that the led trials that we

2394
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:33,759
ran all

2395
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,120
three led companies crushed the

2396
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:38,320
double-edged hps

2397
01:16:35,119 --> 01:16:39,519
in yield so yes yep that was well i can

2398
01:16:38,319 --> 01:16:42,238
tell you this

2399
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,000
i can tell you this too like 90 of all

2400
01:16:42,238 --> 01:16:46,158
the leds on the market are like coming

2401
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:49,279
out of one factory in shenzhen

2402
01:16:46,158 --> 01:16:51,359
so it's like there's there's not a ton

2403
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:54,319
of differentiating factors

2404
01:16:51,359 --> 01:16:54,639
um there's nothing like the warranty

2405
01:16:54,319 --> 01:16:57,679
yeah

2406
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,960
price the warranty uh and then the

2407
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:00,319
architecture of the light and then

2408
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:02,800
there's a few companies

2409
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:03,519
um that are doing things differently and

2410
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:05,679
doing a lot of

2411
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,520
like well i i like science a lot because

2412
01:17:05,679 --> 01:17:09,119
they they have a manufacturing plant in

2413
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:11,120
texas and they're building these lights

2414
01:17:09,119 --> 01:17:12,559
putting them together in america and i'm

2415
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,439
super stoked on that

2416
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,080
but most of the lights are coming um

2417
01:17:15,439 --> 01:17:18,960
from a few

2418
01:17:16,079 --> 01:17:21,039
factories in china and they just put a

2419
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:24,319
little bit of a spin on the casing

2420
01:17:21,039 --> 01:17:25,840
so it's tough to unless you really

2421
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:26,960
kind of dive in and open up the light

2422
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,199
it's tough to know what's different

2423
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:31,600
about all of them in my opinion

2424
01:17:29,198 --> 01:17:32,479
well i based on your recommendation and

2425
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,760
a few others i

2426
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:36,158
that is one of the lights that i'm

2427
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,480
definitely it's top of the list to trial

2428
01:17:36,158 --> 01:17:39,920
um it is one that uh i was just talking

2429
01:17:38,479 --> 01:17:41,119
with cindy about adding this to our

2430
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:43,199
website today

2431
01:17:41,119 --> 01:17:44,640
to be able to offer its customers so we

2432
01:17:43,198 --> 01:17:45,839
will have that as something if you're

2433
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:47,119
looking to try science like

2434
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:49,600
you can get them through us so we're

2435
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:51,599
going to have that um

2436
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:52,960
and then i you know bios is another one

2437
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,320
that i've worked with for a few years

2438
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,198
and have a good relationship with a good

2439
01:17:54,319 --> 01:17:58,960
company

2440
01:17:55,198 --> 01:18:00,479
um yup i i don't know what's happening

2441
01:17:58,960 --> 01:18:02,079
with my relationship with fluence right

2442
01:18:00,479 --> 01:18:03,359
now but um

2443
01:18:02,079 --> 01:18:05,119
we're not currently offering their

2444
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:07,119
lights at the moment but they're still

2445
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:07,840
around in a a good company too for

2446
01:18:07,119 --> 01:18:09,599
people

2447
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,760
uh and then there's like a whole bunch

2448
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,320
more i i was talking with ben about this

2449
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,760
like

2450
01:18:12,319 --> 01:18:14,960
i would not want to be in the led space

2451
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,920
right now because there's a million

2452
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:18,560
companies

2453
01:18:15,920 --> 01:18:20,000
out there it's oversaturated literally

2454
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,360
just mailed a light to my

2455
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,439
door the other day for no reason so

2456
01:18:23,359 --> 01:18:27,279
like isn't that awesome i'll try it like

2457
01:18:25,439 --> 01:18:29,119
i'm gonna give you a ride

2458
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,559
they were a spin-off yeah of a

2459
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,840
well-known company um

2460
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:33,280
so i don't want to say anything about

2461
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:33,920
them until i've actually tried their

2462
01:18:33,279 --> 01:18:37,119
light but

2463
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:37,679
uh yeah uh there's a lot of great

2464
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:39,039
options

2465
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:40,640
out there now under lighting for full

2466
01:18:39,039 --> 01:18:41,119
spectrum lighting so it's wonderful

2467
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,320
because when

2468
01:18:41,119 --> 01:18:44,079
when we first started there was there

2469
01:18:42,319 --> 01:18:45,759
was nothing like there wasn't anything

2470
01:18:44,079 --> 01:18:47,279
it was blurple lights

2471
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:49,440
and then people were laughing at full

2472
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:51,359
spectrum like it was a waste of money

2473
01:18:49,439 --> 01:18:53,198
and now we've seen that's not the case

2474
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:53,679
and and then there really wasn't a lot

2475
01:18:53,198 --> 01:18:55,519
you know

2476
01:18:53,679 --> 01:18:58,000
initially the only two companies i ever

2477
01:18:55,520 --> 01:19:00,080
heard about were fluent in bios and now

2478
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,520
you know i know that some of the some

2479
01:19:00,079 --> 01:19:05,039
companies have had supply issues but

2480
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,040
there's just so many more options

2481
01:19:05,119 --> 01:19:08,158
really it really is and i would say that

2482
01:19:07,439 --> 01:19:10,319
both

2483
01:19:08,158 --> 01:19:11,279
fluent and bios really kind of paved the

2484
01:19:10,319 --> 01:19:14,079
way

2485
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:14,800
uh for that market and it's crazy how

2486
01:19:14,079 --> 01:19:17,840
quickly it

2487
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:20,800
it exploded um i mean

2488
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:21,520
we like the jungle boys has an led room

2489
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:23,760
now

2490
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,640
and they have their own led light and i

2491
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:27,840
remember

2492
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,239
like six seven years ago uh that they

2493
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:29,840
just

2494
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:32,399
they were never going to switch over to

2495
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:34,960
led and it was like this whole thing and

2496
01:19:32,399 --> 01:19:36,079
you just seen people all over uh

2497
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:39,198
adopting this technology

2498
01:19:36,079 --> 01:19:40,800
and figuring it out and just crushing it

2499
01:19:39,198 --> 01:19:42,319
and just absolutely crushing it and

2500
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:43,840
there's all these new

2501
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:45,119
uh you know there's companies that are

2502
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:47,360
doing all kinds of crazy things with

2503
01:19:45,119 --> 01:19:50,319
leds now so it's cool to see

2504
01:19:47,359 --> 01:19:52,799
and i think all that competition is

2505
01:19:50,319 --> 01:19:54,719
hopefully going to inspire

2506
01:19:52,800 --> 01:19:55,840
uh you know more offerings and more

2507
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:58,880
